 chapter the devil and company renny renwick the engineer and long tom roberts the electrical expert were on hand to meet doc savage when he brought his plane down on the hudson river doc taxied the craft managing it expertly on the windwhipped river surface into the big hangar which was disguised as a warehouse on the river front almost in the shadow of new yorks midtown skyscrapers renny and long tom were a little breathless as they met doc savage its a devil said renny it talks said long tom a little statuette of a satan or a devil not much more than a foot high renny said it is made out of bronze or brass or some similar metal it has a deep voice long tom said but only one man hears it talk one man nobody else his name is joseph sam joseph the man who hears it we mean long tom explained doc savage listened to them patiently patience was one of doc savages accomplishments being one of the things that had been hammered into him as a part of the strange training which he had received in his youth when at diaper age he had been placed in the hands of scientists to be subjected over a course of almost twenty years to an intensive program which was intended to fit him for one specific and rather strange career unlike many persons given an arbitrary training before they were old enough to know what it was all about or speak for themselves he had elected to follow the career for which he had been trained it was an unusual career it consisted literally of making other peoples business his own or at least their troubles for some time now doc savage had been taking it on himself to right wrongs and punish evildoers traveling to the far corners of the earth to do so he had five associates who worked with him renny renwick and long tom roberts were two members of this group of five a devil doc savage said getting it straight and it talks but only one man can hear it thats right long tom said sam joseph there are more details renny said but they wont make it sound less silly long tom declared renny took docs arm come on he said we will take you to talk to montague ogden who is montague ogden he hasnt any connection at all with the devil or so he claims said renny renwick but he is the employer of sam joseph the man who has been hearing the devil speak the impressive ogden building was new just barely prewar and the lobby was all black and gold and apparently designed by an architect who had fallen on his head when small but it was utterly expensive the elevators were gold and black and also utterly expensive and the elevator operators were girls with shapes that also looked expensive i would like to have the money it cost to think about building this place said renny renwick who was an engineer and knew what it had cost i would rather have the elevator operators said monk mayfair monk was a remarkably homely fellow with a remarkable eye for a wellturned ankle the elevator let them out in a corridor which was ankledeep in rich carpet office building halls are ordinarily not even carpeted what kind of a place is this remarked monk wait said renny renwick until you see the master of the establishment they walked into a reception room that might have been lifted from a spectacular motion picture the carpet was even deeper the colors even richer the furniture more extreme the blonde at the desk looked as if she had been manufactured with a magazine cover in mind mr ogden she told them bells in her voice is expecting you then they walked into a log cabin or so it would have seemed had not the big glass windows offered views of some of the financial districts more impressive buildings everything was rustic extremely rustic even to the logs blazing in the fieldstone fireplace and the two large dogs lying on the hearth the dogs lifted their heads and barked i am montague ogden the man behind the desk said he sounded as if he was accustomed to the name meaning something he was smooth that was the first impression you got of him as smooth as a polished rock he was fortyfive or fifty years old wellpreserved and he was dressed in country tweeds and moccasins so that he blended with his logcabin inner office the general effect of montague ogden was a little ridiculous unless of course you were impressed by the obvious evidences of money there were conversational preliminaries introductions mostly then montague ogden got around to making what he evidently intended to be the outstanding statement of the conference i am a very wealthy man he said doc savage with just a trace of the general feeling of distaste that the overly flamboyant office building this office suite and the spectacle effect of the man himself had aroused said at the moment we are more interested in a man named sam joseph who is said to be hearing a small statue of the devil speak aloud to him exactly said montague ogden exactly i understand you can supply details exactlysaid montague ogden i am a very wealthy man and i want nothing spared to straighten out poor sam poor sam is my office manager my trusted employee he is even i may say more than that he is the real working head the manager of my rather wide enterprises i owe sam a great deal sam is paid an excellent salary it is true but his value to me extends far beyond that sam is is he groped for words found them sam is like a part of my own heart he finished doc savage asked quietly what do you mean by straightening out poor sam montague ogden blinked he had blue eyes very paleblue eyes why find out his trouble he said just what has happened doc savage asked patiently ogden spread his hands with the palms up poor sam has this statue of a devil where did he get it i gave it to him montague ogden said i frankly admit that where did you get the statue doc asked from a chinaman ogden explained from an old chinaman named chi sui poor chi sui was a very elderly oriental who for a long time had operated a shop in mott street dealing in knickknacks the trash that tourists buy in chinatown but old chi sui wanted to close up his business and go to china to help chiang against the japanese and he had very little money but he did have this statue which was realistic i bought it from chi sui in spite of the rather hairlifting story he told me about it doc said so the former owner of the devil statue had a story to tell about it yes what was the nature of the story montague ogden blinked smiled sheepishly said a ridiculous story of course one in which i placed no stock not a bit of belief not for a minute suppose you tell it to us anyway doc invited ogden nodded it was a rather simple story it seems that this chinese statue was molded by co suan a friend of the original buddha and that the spirit of buddha captured a portion of the spirit of the king of evil and imprisoned it in this statuette that was to give the little statue life because co suan the sculptor was a great friend of buddha and the allmighty one wished to give his friend fame and fortune deserving of such a kind and goodly fellow therefore buddha imprisoned the spirit of the devil in the statue in order to give the little thing of brass a life and realism which no other sculptor could ever equal that is all of the story yes its ridiculous of course montague ogden smiled at them i want you to understand of course that i do not credit for a minute the belief that the statue is actually talking to poor sam joseph you have not heard the statue speak doc asked no anyone but sam joseph heard it no what else do you know doc savage asked nothing nothing more in that case doc savage said we had better see sam joseph they surrounded sam joseph where he lay on a bed a great chromiumandgreen bed in the penthouse on top of the flamboyant ogden building the decorating theme of the penthouse was chromium and other colors broken up with large and vital flowers of bright coloration the penthouse was not in quite as bad taste as the rest of the building my personal apartment said montague ogden of the penthouse layout i had poor sam brought here sam joseph was obviously not himself he was a man large enough to make quite a hump on the bed under the silken covers he had gray hair a not inconsiderable shock of it and an angelic peaceful completely honestlooking face sam joseph had the kind of a face you would expect a manangel to have it was so entirely benign and innocent good evening gentlemen he said or rather good afternoon it is afternoon isnt it dont you know whether or not it is afternoon doc savage asked sam joseph seemed somewhat confused i guess so he said that is i was watching the snow and the bluebirds singing in the snow it only snows in the afternoon does it not or is it only on wednesday the first of june doc savage asked montague ogden how long has he been talking like that gracious i never heard him speak like that before montague ogden said i really havent his conversation hitherto has been rational oh yes it really has sam joseph said i came out of the hill and it was very dark but there was the fish in the sand with the ice all around it we sat down there the fish and i and we had fine steaks and caviar but the fish wouldnt eat the caviar because he was not a cannibal he told me when the fish said he was not a cannibal he had a very deep voice monk mayfair doc savages assistant looked at doc thoughtfully monk put the end of a forefinger against his own right temple and made a motion as if he was winding up something like the things you pull corks with monk said doc savage studied sam joseph for a while the man was smiling but it was a vacantly empty smile a smile without intelligence or even much feeling behind it doc turned back to montague ogden again the devil statue doc said where is it montague ogden seemed startled oh the devil it is around somewhere i suppose get it but now you can see that poor sam joseph is the devil doc said the devil that talked we want to see it montague ogden now seemed distressed and also his brow wrinkled as if he was trying to think where the statue was and he scratched his head oh how silly of me he said how really silly of course i remember now in my den ill get it i placed the statue in my den and i will get it now he turned away doc said monk go with him me monk was surprised yes you doc said but monk stopped and turned and followed montague ogden monk had remembered that when you argued with doc you usually found yourself exceedingly in the wrong they walked down corridors monk and montague ogden and ogden examined monk out of the corner of his eye as if amazed at monks homeliness and amused by it monks homeliness had amazed and amused many people but he was not ashamed of it there was a pleasantness about his homeliness and a fascination monk would not have to be seen in a very thick fog to be mistaken for something just out of the ape house in the zoo his arms were as long as his legs and he was coated with reddish hair that was close cousin to rusted shingle nails monk was even rather pleased with his clockstopping looks because he had found that they exerted a hypnotic power over girls and the prettier the girl the greater the hypnotic capacity montague ogden opened a door said this is my den mr mayfair the den was inhabited by the stuffed heads of animals at least half a hundred of them which hung on the walls and leered stared snarled or showed gapfanged jaws at anyone in the den there was a man already in the den arent you afraid of staying in here monk asked the man he was a timidlooking young man quite pale and lean and soft the very picture of a timid soul beg pardon the man said he sounded frightened nervous embarrassed this is butch said montague ogden butch eh monk said and tried not to grin at the timid soul montague ogden remarked butch we have come after the devil statue oh butch said he looked scared oh i havent that is well its over there but never mind montague ogden told him well take it with us you can go ahead with your work butch montague ogden picked up the devil statue the statue was about what monk expected to see being not much over a foot high rather fat and made of brass that was tarnished or bronze wearing some sort of ceremonial robe and holding a sword in one hand this devil had a pronounced chinese cast on his evil little face ill carry it monk said but ill carry it monk repeated montague ogden smiled and his very well if you wish was the soul of politeness they left the den and monk was glad to get out of sight of all the leering staring or snarling stuffed animals he wondered how butch managed to stand it in there with all those manhungrylooking trophies and he wondered if that was what was making butch look frightened whos butch monk asked whats he do i mean his work yes butch is my biggame hunting guide and my jujitsu instructor montague ogden explained he also teaches me wrestling and the art of knifethrowing in which i am interested as a hobby monk laughed he thought he was being kidded they went down a hall that was majestic in a futuristic modern fashion with high walls and great pictures in gaunt plain frames and lighting that was so subdued that it was difficult to tell from where it came monk walked along thinking of the timid soul who was named butch and how funny it was that ogden had jokingly said butch was his hunting guide and instructor in the more robust manly arts ordinarily that would not have been funny but after you had seen butch it was quite humorous we can go through this way montague ogden said it is shorter he turned to the left and opened a door and went through it monk was following behind ogden and watching ogdens back when something hit monks head it hit hard whatever it was and there was only a slight sound a slight grinding just before the impact landed it took monk on top of the head slightly to the righthand side so that there was the grisly sensation of the blow sliding down toward the right ear and taking off the whole side of his head as it went in the middle of this awful feeling it got very black and remained that way chapter ii the great mistake monk accomplished the feat of opening his eyes but did it with some difficulty after which he stared at montague ogden monk had the feeling that some time had passed and did not dare move his body for fear his head would fall off it there was a gouging pain in the small of his back soon his ears recovered their ability to hear that nasty picture montague ogden was saying oh that nasty picture i told the interior decorator when he hung it over the door that something like this would happen i told him it would be just my luck to have the picture fall down and brain somebody sometime monk tried out his voice with a groan and found his vocal chords satisfactory im brained all right he said oh gasped ogden hes conscious he has recovered monk felt a hell of a long way from complete recovery and said so what hit me he demanded a picture hanging over the door fell down as you went through explained montague ogden it was one of those freak accidents monk grimaced at ogden its a good thing you were walking ahead of me when it happened monk said or i would have thought you beaned me montague ogden laughed deprecatingly doc savage renny renwick and long tom roberts were standing around monk looking relieved that he had recovered monk wondered if he had recovered or if there was going to be complications the gouging pain in the small of his back was awful he investigated and found it to be the devil statuette i must have fallen on the thing monk complained i wonder how many ribs it broke that the devil statue which speaks doc savage asked thats it monk said montague ogden said uncomfortably of course you gentlemen do not for a minute believe that the statue can speak doc savage made no comment he suggested that renny renwick find the building superintendent and obtain a hacksaw and a cold chisel and hammer in order that they might perform a dissection on the brass devil fifteen minutes later they had the devil lying in half a dozen pieces on a table and there was obviously nothing inside it but brass that is that doc admitted the thing hardly seemed to have a conversational nature of course you knew it hadnt montague ogden said monk mayfair explained to ogden when youve been in the kind of a business were in for a while you get so you dont go around taking things at face value doc savage said we will examine sam joseph now the bronze man spent nearly an hour with sam joseph doing the things a doctor does according to all indications doc said the man has an advanced cerebral fibroma the bronze man then asked monk to telephone the hospital and arrange for reception of the patient doc told montague ogden i am going to call in other brain specialists for consultation do you have any particular doctors you would like to have pass an opinion ogden stared i thought you were supposed to be the worlds leading brain surgeon he said doc passed up the compliment explained in a matter as serious as this we prefer to have a consensus of opinion montague ogden nodded he seemed to be surprised but to consider the matter reasonable now that he thought of it could i bring in dr nedden he asked he is my private surgeon doc savage nodded he had not heard of dr nedden but that did not mean the man could not be good certainly the bronze man said call dr nedden they transferred sam joseph to the hospital a small but wonderfully equipped hospital uptown which specialized in brain cases and which was largely supported by doc savage he did most of his work there doc did not as a matter of fact do a great deal of surgery for surgerys sake his specialty being stubborn and unusual cases upon which he could apply new and experimental technique dr nedden appeared he was a stocky man face reddened by the outdoors sun clothes immaculate who seemed to know what he was doing i have examined the patient previously he explained the unusual cerebropsychosis aroused my interest and i was fairly sure it was cerebral fibroma i made a thorough examination with a cerebroscope and found nothing to support any other diagnosis doc savage called in two more specialists and their diagnosis was the same cerebral fibroma monk asked what the hecks a cerebral fibroma anyway a brain tumor a fibrous type that makes it very difficult to remove doc savage explained why dont doctors use words you can understand monk wanted to know for the same reason that chemists do not use small ones doc told him monk had to grin at that there was nothing more incomprehensible to a layman than a chemical formula even when you simplified it and used the symbols but if you took one of those chemicals and tried to explain what it was by using small words it would run into an afternoons work doc savage found montague ogden your office manager sam joseph has a brain tumor doc told ogden an operation is the only answer he will not die there is no such thing as a minor or a completely safe operation doc told him frankly but he should pull through oh i want him to sam means a lot to me he has always practically run everything for me doc said dr c b sticken would be a good man to do the surgery yes i ogdens eyes flew wide what did you say i recommend c b sticken for the surgery montague ogden looked as if he was going to faint but you must do it he gasped doc savage explained patiently this is not a sufficiently unusual or difficult case to warrant my doing the surgery and furthermore dr sticken is fully qualified montague ogden seemed horrified at the idea i insist on you doing it he cried why i wouldnt think of anyone else ill pay any fee it just happens doc savage said that i do not work for a fee what oh yes i remember you get your funds from some unknown source well then ill donate any sum you name to any organization you wish if you will do the operation that will not be necessary dr sticken is capable ill donate a hundred thousand dollars said montague ogden if you will do this operation doc savage studied the man that is not necessary i mean it a hundred thousand mr savage to any charity or army or navy relief group you care to name the man was so earnest he was pale all right doc savage said finally doc savage did the operation in the special amphitheater pit at the brain clinic it was a cupshaped arena surrounded by the most transparent type of glass beyond the glass were seats for witnessing surgeons the lighting was fluorescent and brilliant as was always the case when doc savage was operating the amphitheater was crowded there were very few students among the witnesses the majority being brain surgeons of established name and reputation some of them men who had hurriedly caught airplanes and flown halfway across the continent in order to watch a master at work doc savage made the scalp incision laid back the scalp then used a special electrical bone knife of his own invention a device which would cut without shock having the property of rendering bone and nerve more insensible to shock in the area near the cutting head the operation progressed with brilliance up to the point where doc reached the spot where the tumor should be there was no tumor the thing was so astounding that doc was stunned he stood there rigid and speechless then after a few moments made the small trilling sound which was his unconscious habit in moments of intense mental stress the trilling was low exotic might have been the product of an eerie wayward breeze in a naked forest it had a ventriloqual quality seeming to come from everywhere rather than any definite spot in the operating room there was certainly no tumor either a fibroma or otherwise there was only one thing doc could say and he said it i have made a mistake he said doc savages mysterious source of fabulous wealth is located in a remote lost valley in central america an enormous golden treasure guarded over by a clan of descendants of ancient maya chapter iii a plan rolling dr nedden the man who had been introduced into the case as montague ogdens private doctor was one of the spectators in the arena above the operating pit he got out of there in a hurry he found a cab across town he ordered and hurry dr nedden leaned back in the cab he seemed to have been holding himself in and now he relaxed as men sometimes do after they have been under terrific strain and try to relax he started going to pieces he trembled and twitched he pounded his knees wildly with his fists hurry you fool he screamed at the driver he got out at an ordinarylooking brick apartment house west of central park and stumbled inside he was so weak he had to hold to the hand rail in the elevator while riding up in the sixteenthfloor hall a man met him the man who met him was the timidlooking soul called butch goodness doctor butch said what is wrong nothings wrong said dr nedden im just having a nervous reaction thats all ill be all right as soon as i can take a sedative butch nodded here he said he handed dr nedden a bundle put these on butch had an identical bundle we can put them on in the inner reception room he added they went to a door a legend on the door in discreet lettering said dr morgan private hospital they tried the door it was locked one of the others in there masking butch said lets try another room there were half a dozen doors in the hall all bearing the same legend they found one which was unlocked and it admitted them to a bare room fitted with two white chairs a white desk a stool behind the desk and a telephone on the desk itself dr nedden and butch unwrapped their bundles which proved to hold ordinary white surgical robes surgical hoods and the gauze antiseptic masks which operatingroom personnel wear when they had donned these their identities were thoroughly concealed dr nedden led the way into another and much larger room after unlocking the hall door of the room where they had dressed there were seven men already seated in the room all were enveloped in the surgical robes and masks dr nedden was still shaking butch had had to tie the strings of neddens robe nedden hurried to a cabinet containing medicines got out a few pills out of a bottle and swallowed them with water the other masked men watched him intently dr nedden faced them gentlemen he said it worked doc savage is trapped dr nedden then sat down and explained i am suffering from nervous shock the strain has been very great on me gentlemen if you will wait a few minutes please they waited patiently judging from the eyes visible above the surgical masks all of them were vastly relieved even elated the sedative took effect on dr nedden his agitation subsided and he arose and drank more water he added a hooker of whiskey he faced the men it was an incredibly difficult and ticklish business he said doc savage is unquestionably the worlds greatest general surgeon and probably the greatest brain surgeon to pull this we had to deceive him at his own business fortunately mental difficulties are the most uncertain to diagnose continued dr nedden by the use of drugs largely types of barbiturates in overdoses i was able to produce fake mental symptoms in sam joseph a number of very cunning devices were resorted to in order to deceive doc savage but i will not take up your time describing them and you would not understand them anyway not being doctors yourselves a man interrupted what about the devilstatue mixup dr nedden shrugged we had a narrow escape there he said a devil statue containing a small loudspeaker and radio had been used to fool sam joseph into thinking the little statue was talking to him through an oversight this statue was still in montague ogdens den when doc savage wished to see it i heard said the other that you had to knock out one of doc savages men that fellow they call monk and swap a harmless statue for the trick one we did that admitted dr nedden we pulled it without a hitch butch said i pulled it i popped him one on the head then ogden made him think a picture had fallen off the wall just as he was going under it and conked him that was a goofy explanation to give him its goofiness made it good butch declared they seemed satisfied one said that fixes everything so we can go ahead with the next step of the plan not everything reminded dr nedden there is still the harrison matter a man growled id call it the duster jones matter butch spoke up smugly that will be taken care of he said the thing to do is let this operation have its repercussions savage may think there is something strange about it its too late now if he does all right but murder isnt something to make mistakes one of the men said chapter iv the indignant man it was a bright crisp morning the sunlight crisp out of an utterly clear sky and the air a thing like wine which you noticed in a way that you do not ordinarily notice air when ham brooks came into doc savages offices in a midtown skyscraper ham looked concerned ham was another doc savage assistant another member of the group of five he was a man of medium height with good shoulders and a thin waist and clothing which had made him notable as one of the countrys bestdressed men he was the law expert of the group doc ham said im worried about something yes you know that operation on sam joseph what about it the news is all over town in the surgical profession that you pulled a bloomer you operated on a man who did not have the slightest trace of what you were operating for doc savage was not worried just gossip within the profession he said maybe it is not very nice of us but it is a very human trait to get a kick out of seeing a big shot make a mistake we all make them it just goes to prove he is human and that we are human to talk about it ham shook his head i know i discounted it at first thinking it was that kind of talk but its more what more there is some ugly talk about malpractice that is ridiculous the definition of malpractice ham said is wrong or injurious treatment at least thats the way the medical dictionaries give it you need not have gone to the bother of looking it up doc told him this is just gossip i have it coming to me because i did make a mistake all right ham said i just wanted to mention it and tell you that legally no one can hang anything on you doc savage smiled that is fine ham but you are making a mountain out of a molehill i hope so ham said but i dont like the way this malpractice talk is going around through the profession it looks as if someone might be spreading it mr montague ogden was more blunt about it he came into doc savages headquarters with his jaw out and his hands made into fists and he was accompanied by two gentlemen who carried brief cases and looked like bulldogs mr savage ogden said i am not at all satisfied with the thing you did to poor sam joseph just what do you mean ogden doc savage asked why did you perform that brain operation on sam joseph for the same reason that you operate for an appendix doc said it seemed to be the thing to do the mans symptoms indicated brain tumor so you said the most outstanding of doc savages features was probably his unusual eyes like pools of flake gold always stirred by tiny winds these took on a rather cold light now you will recall he said that dr nedden and two other brain specialists agreed with me on the diagnosis montague ogden drew himself up they have admitted he snapped that they took your word for it as a matter of truth they were so overawed by yourahreputation that they did not wish to disagree with you doc decided this was rather unprofessional behavior on the part of the three doctors but he made no comment on that saying instead i am sorry it happened he said there is no denying i made a mistake sorry said ogden isnt enough what do you mean i demand snapped ogden that you make a cash settlement of five hundred thousand dollars on sam joseph by way of reimbursing him for the peril to which you subjected his life i also demand that you publish a halfpage advertisement in all new york newspapers admitting that you made an error in diagnosis ham brooks who was present jumped to his feet doc waved ham back he digested montague ogdens demand that is ridiculous of course he said ill show you how ridiculous it is montague ogden bellowed he waved to his two bulldogfaced companions these are my lawyers flack and morrow theyll show you how ridiculous it is this was too much for ham he shot to his feet get out of here ham yelled i know these two shysters flack and morrow theyre crooks of the first water the only thing different about them is that they are big thieves well sue you for slander bellowed a lawyer who ever heard of one lawyer calling another lawyer a crook being slander ham snarled ham habitually carried an innocentlooking black cane and almost everyone in the legal profession knew this was a sword cane the tip of which was coated with a chemical producing quick unconsciousness get out of here ham roared and flourished his cane as he made a rush for ogden and his lawyers ogden and his attorneys took flight as he ran ogden shouted you cant shut us up this way were going to get at the truth about your strange brain operations well unmask your devilish scheme then they ran for their lives from ham got into the elevator and escaped doc ham said something isnt upandup about this the fight on the speakers platform at the big army relief rally at madison square garden got a great deal more publicity it was not much of a fight montague ogden merely popped out of the crowd dashed across the speakers platform in full view of the audience of many thousands and tried to assault doc savage with his fists the police soon hauled ogden away but everyone in the audience heard the words montague ogden shrieked at the bronze man the publicaddress microphones picked them up and made them loud in the great auditorium theres something devilish behind your brain operations ogden screamed what are you doing to those men youre a monster the thing got in the newspapers montague ogden was reputedly one of the rich men of the nation and doc savage had a worldwide name so it could hardly have kept out of the newspapers also doc savage was not a man who sought publicity and items about him were scarce so accordingly their news value was greater doc savage as a matter of fact had antagonized some of the newspapers at various times by refusing to give out information concerning his activities one paper in particular the morning blade a blaring tabloid which featured a stable of columnists who were unreliable sensationalists did not have a great love for doc savage it was the morning blade in which the blacktype editorial said we know all about the laws of libel and slander sometimes we wonder if these laws dont protect people who shouldnt be protected is it libel and slander to ask some questions question one why is this fellow doc savage so secretive about himself that he is known as the man of mystery what has he to hide question two what does doc savage do with the men he seizes the men he says are criminals he alone says they are criminals isnt it the right of our courts to judge those things what happens to these men they disappear their old friends never see them again question three what is this mysterious college which doc savage maintains of which rumors are sometimes heard has it horrors to hide ham brooks came in with this in his hands a scowl on his face and said blast them i think we could stick them for libel and slander on the strength of that doc shall we try it doc savage shook his head but he was thoughtful on the big inlaid table which was one of the principal articles of furniture in the reception room of his eightysixth floor headquarters lay the other metropolitan newspapers all of which contained items about what had happened last night at madison square garden ham doc said quietly it seems i made two mistakes one of them when you operated on sam joseph yes what was the other one when i overlooked your suggestion that something might not be on the upandup about this thing doc said ham grinned we better get to looking into it eh doc nodded we better he said another interested reader of the newspapers that day was butch the timidlooking soul he read them and rubbed his hands together in glee he carried his newspapers and his delight to dr nedden its beginning to roll butch said you think we ought to have another meeting dr nedden was worried he had not been sleeping well and was losing weight he was getting peevish call a meeting he said and sneered are you forgetting it is the man we work for who calls the meetings butch grinned thats right k then i just got too happy over this but its sure rolling now aint h dr nedden looked at the newspapers wet his lips and admitted its rolling all right what are you afraid of doctor you look like a singed cat its trying to perpetrate a thing like this on a man like doc savage muttered dr nedden hell its so big it cant fail savage will start investigating before long itll be built up too much for him to stop it by then and he doesnt know what is behind it hell never guess the thing is so unexpected that it would be the last thing in the world he would look for dr nedden nodded the murder doesnt help my sleep he confessed murder oh that butch laughed didnt you know the harrisons were going to be taken care of tonight more murders butch grinned ever hear of fighting fire with fire doctor where will it be done kansas city butch told him our man is waiting at the airport there now early in his career doc savage recognized the need of some permanently effective but at the same time humane method of treatment for criminals which he captured the numbers of these criminals as time went on would he considerable so out of his skill as a brain surgeon and his understanding of human psychology doc evolved a method of permanently curing criminals of crime he established an institution in a remote section of upstate new york the mountainous area which is surprisingly one of the most deserted sections of the united states here he installed brain specialists which he had trained when he sent a criminal to the college the routine does not vary greatly first the student undergoes a brain operation which doc perfected and which wires out all memory of past the criminal having lost all vicious effects of environment is then training to make a useful and comfortable living at some worthy occupation the results of docs experiment have been remarkable it was his dream and still is to have such a method of criminal treatment widely accepted and practiced for he feels it is one of the few sure cures for habitual criminality however the treatment is far too drastic for public acceptance it is a hundred or two hundred years ahead of its time probably like other things which the bronze man uses regularly chapter v murder and kansas city r j harrison had been christened ranzo john harrison in his cradle and he had come to hate the name ranzo and the nickname randy so thoroughly that he never told anyone his two christened names if he could help it he was now called and had been called for years rotary harrison strangely enough he did not object to rotary he was even proud of it the name came from the socalled rotary method of drilling oil wells as opposed to the cable tool method rotary harrison had been a pioneer in the midcontinent oil fields in the use of rotary drilling rotary harrison was a big man physically a hardhammered giant of a fellow now a little more thin than he had once been but with the hard solid look of a frontiersman in his blue eyes and the same quality in his fists he had made and lost ten or a dozen fortunes and they had been oilmens fortunes anything less than five or ten million dollars is not considered much of a fortune in the oil business the fortunes rotary harrison had made and lost had been big ones he had another big one now and again he was on the verge of losing it he was a spectacular old reprobate his private airplanes for example were always the fastest and most luxurious the one he was flying now was a sample his daughter sister harrison was sitting back in the cabin sis was holding a ocaliber rifle equipped with a telescopic sight sis was on the spectacular side herself being a long blond girl who won tennis cups prizes for riding horses in rodeos and once a complimentary squib from a broadway columnist for knocking a leering stew bum into the middle of next week with a left these were accomplishments enough but she was also with mentality as the saying goes being the possessor of various scholarship keys which were not given for having oil millions as well as two hooks and a play she had written and clippings of many pointed letters she had sent the tulsa world her favorite newspaper concerning what she thought about the oil situation and its probable effect on the national economy assuredly with brains rotary harrison said sis theres a river down there i think its the kaw in that case we may make it sis said maybe so we should hit the kaw close to kansas city sis put down the rifle and picked up a pair of good binoculars she focused these on the sky behind the ship and searched intently for a while she eventually located the winged speck that was the plane following them it was about where it had been during most of the trip we still got our gadfly asked rotary still got it sis agreed yonders kansas city said rotary harrison when we get there well see what luck we have pulling a shenanigan the plane which had followed the harrisons had they believed picked up their trail sometime after they left the municipal airport at tulsa because no plane had followed them off the municipal airport at tulsa they surmised the other ship had been at another airport nearby and had been notified when they left the ground they knew the other plane was following them they had made sure of that by detouring slightly in the direction of oil hill kansas where rotary harrison had once opened a field of gushers that was his third fortune in the making and the plane behind had trailed them on the detour the other ship had always remained some miles back practically out of sight in the distance rotary harrisons face had become rocklike when he knew they were being followed poor old duster jones he said once then rotary had leaned back letting the plane fly herself and had remembered duster jones duster jones had come out of ohio or pennsylvania or some such place forty years ago and he had brought his hard luck with him it had been a kind of inexhaustible hard luck good for all the years of duster jones life fate was particularly cruel because she hit her blows of hard luck with platinum and diamond hammers he made such ungodly rich strikes and he always lost them duster jones had the golden touch of midas but his hands were greased he never quite got hold of the riches but always it was almost duster jones became a legend in the oil fields duster jones liked rotary harrison they were opposites in a way because it seemed that rotary had only to turn a hand to make a fortune while duster could turn handsprings and wind up as poor as a mouse they had been very very close friends for years neither of them ever did a thing ever had hardly a thought that the other did not know about rotary believed he knew why duster jones had been shot between the eyes with acaliber bullet rotary harrison set his plane down at the kansas city airport he taxied back along the edge of the runway toward the office and hangars letting the ship move slowly he watched the other plane the ship that had been following him come out of the southwest he was not surprised when it did not land nor was he puzzled when the craft roared overhead and dropped first one wing then the other in a series of measured maneuvers signal he said they got somebody here at the airport waitin for us he looked back at his daughter then he was oppressed by the feeling of danger around them of poor old duster jones death and of mystery he studied sis face they had been through a lot together through more than most fathers and daughters but he found himself wishing suddenly that sis was somewhere where it was safe scared sis he asked sure she admitted but dont let it bother you rotary grinned nothing is gonna bother us were gonna do the bothering he parked his plane on the line where civilian aircraft were supposed to park he went into the office and filled out the arrival forms and applied for the permission which the army required civilians to obtain before they could fly on to new york want to leave in about half an hour he said see that my plane is refueled half an hour the c a a man said be night before you get into new york you experienced in night flying sure said rotary heres my license with instrument rating rotary and sis got a cab acting as if nothing out of the way was transpiring except that sis carried the rifle which made her a slightly odd spectacle when the cab was crossing the missouri river bridge into kansas city rotary asked got him spotted second cab back of us sis said little man dark hair dark skin blue pinstripe suit thats the one sis agreed all right rotary said pretty soon we surprise him they rolled down off the bridge through the shabby commercial district then started to climb the hill they topped the rise and rolled down grand avenue traffic was thick around them now their cab halted for a red light a big truck on their right pull in ahead of that truck a little rotary ordered their driver obeyed rotary got out the truck screened him from the machine behind go right ahead he told sis the pursuing cab drew alongside the truck passing it rotary harrison jumped out from around the side of the truck he got an arm around the door post of the cab its windows were down drenched the cab door open and was inside rotary showed the occupant of the cab the sixshooter he had inherited from his indianfighting dad dont jump hop skip or reach rotary said just sit he used the kind of a tone he used when he had just lost a string of tools in a sixthousandfoot oil well it was a tone that would curl wire follow that second cab ahead he told the driver the driver looked around he seemed undecided rotary showed him the sixgun and said when i shoot a rabbit with this thing all they generally find is one ear the driver followed orders they turned left and found a street where there was no traffic sis got out of the cab ahead and came back got him eh she examined the man never saw him before the man would have looked suave enough ordinarily perhaps but now he was scared go back to the airport rotary told their driver the cab chauffeur more than anxious to get rid of his passengers and wash his hands of the whole thing lost no time in driving back across the river to the airport rotary told his prisoner you know what happened to duster jones the man said nothing but more fear swam in his eyes he knew what had happened to duster jones all right and apparently that was the big thing now in his mind the same thing will happen to you rotary told him if you make one bleat or one jump they got out at the airport the harrison plane was refueled ready for the air rotary put the captive in the cabin indicating that sis should watch the fellow ill go get my papers for the new york flight rotary explained getting papers every time you turn around in an airplane is a danged nuisance but on account of the war i guess you gotta do it he went away and came back all set he explained he took over the controls started the motor and warmed it checked both magnetos then swung the tail around got out on the runway and fed it the gun when he got the k from the control tower the plane was soon slanting up into the sky rotary harrison turned to their captive i didnt include you in my cargo when i checked out he said you know what that means the man got white thats right rotary told him i cant have you along when we land he turned to his daughter sis plot a course that will take us over one of the great lakes and havent we got a fishing tool back in the cabin that will do as a sinker for this hombres body chapter vi death in the sky they flew north left the missouri river behind climbed until the concrete ribbon of highway was a vague thread below and behind rotary turned the controls over to sis whispering dont get excited but you can act as if you are im fooling about killing this bird i knew you were sis said rotary went back he stood looking at the prisoner who was sprawled in a seat and gripping the seat arms got a name rotary asked smith the man said john smith asked rotary yeah rotary hit him drove two quick blows like lightning the man lifted up in the seat then flopped back he turned slightly blue and his tongue stuck out and he breathed noisily thats for john smithing me said rotary i dont guess theres any need of fooling with you rotary then fell upon the man yanked him into the aisle hit him again that blow produced unconsciousness but it was brief when the man awakened it was in time to find rotary just finishing tying his ankles to his wrists and both of these to an oilwell fishing tool a piece of steel which weighed possibly forty pounds rotary noted the man was awake he made a gesture as if to hit him again then changed his mind what the hell rotary said what yelling you do on the way down wont hurt anything rotary dragged him to the plane door and forced the door open against the propeller wash see were over the missouri river rotary pointed out changed our minds about the great lakes too far away rotary then picked the man up and the fellow struggled horribly but ineffectively heaved him out of the plane door the mans screams were ghastly rotary seemed to encounter an accident the loose end of the rope it was a cowboy lariat with which the man was fled became tangled apparently with one of the seat supports the man was stopped and dangled helplessly just outside the plane door danged rope got caught rotary bellowed he fought as if to free the rope he did not succeed got a knife sis he yelled gotta cut this hombre loose the screaming of the man dangling outside the plane the propeller wash smashing against him with cold horror became articulate words please he screeched dont ill do anything anything rotary sneered at him brother youd just tell me more lies he said sis hand me that knife the man blubbered and screeched that he hoped to die if he was lying he was about as scared as a man could become and remain rational oh all right rotary said with seeming reluctance he yanked the prisoner back inside just one little fib and out you go he warned the man the plot the terrorized captive told rotary harrison was a large thing and it probably extended into foreign countries there were millions of dollars involved and there had been one murder executed and others were planned the killing of old duster jones was that murder asked rotary grimly it was but that one had been done by a man called butch who had been sent out from new york city for the job butch was a fellow who looked as meek as a rabbit a regular milksop man in appearance but a fiend who had the bloodthirsty instincts of a weasel why was duster killed asked rotary fiercely he found out too much the man explained or at least i gathered that was what it was it seems duster was in a honkatonk one night and heard two men talking he bought the men drinks and got them tight he got their tongues loose and went riding with them in the night and at the end of the ride he had learned enough to be dangerous to the plan rotary scowled and demanded why are they trying to knock off me and sis because the man explained they are afraid you know too much what makes them think that your decision to go to new york rotary harrison was astonished he was going to new york as a matter of truth on what he believed in his heart would be a fruitless attempt to raise money he had to have the money because without it the whole structure of his oil enterprises would collapse why am i going to new york do they think he asked the prisoner to see doc savage to tell him what you know rotary hid his amazement so they think that he said he had nearly asked who doc savage was but he caught himself in time and now probing in his mind he decided who doc savage must be he had heard of a rather mysterious man with headquarters in new york by that name for some reason or other rotary recalled many men in the oil fields had heard of savage but he did not know exactly why he did remember that crooks were supposed to be afraid of savage if that meant anything rotary listened to the prisoner talk the man was getting sickly worried as he watched the hard look on rotarys face he was really a small fry the prisoner explained just a hired hand he had been dishonorably discharged from the army for assaulting an officer had served a term in leavenworth and had lately been released from prison he was under bond in a theft case in missouri and had sought to pick himself up a bit of lawyer money by taking on this job a friend another crook had recommended him for the job he had been ordered to seize rotary and sis and hold or kill them whichever was convenient i dont even know who the head guys are he insisted but you know some of the small fry yes that butch and three or four others rotary asked ominously what about doc savage the man knew something about that evidently he and butch or someone else had talked about it they have a big scheme whereby doc savage is going to be made to take the blame for the whole thing the prisoner explained why pick on savage the man said thats the first question that occurred to me too but savage is made for the part he is a mysterious figure then theres all these brain operations he has performed and the men who disappear after he gets his hands on them men who disappear when savage gets hold of them rotary echoed and his surprise got in his voice crooks the thing as a whole did not make much sense to rotary harrison he didnt have the real explanation behind it all he felt he was convinced though that this hireling he had captured did not know the real answer rotary sank in the seat beside sis he told her pretty much as the prisoner had given it what he had learned make sense to you he finished sis was thoughtful looks to me as if our trouble is just part and parcel of a great mess of trouble thats cooking for a lot of folks she decided sis said rotary this makes me look at our own trouble in a new light just how this is our situation six months ago we borrowed a mess of money from a new york outfit owned by a man named montague ogden but ogden himself didnt handle the deal it was handled by sam joseph who was ogdens office manager and seemed to run everything for ogden rotary harrison made a grim jaw for a moment our deal with sam joseph was witnessed by duster jones he continued the deal included an agreement that the loan was to be renewed on our request in six months and it was a written agreement duster jones witnessed it we had a copy and sam joseph had a copy his scowl darkened now sam joseph wires us there was no such agreement he growled our copy of it disappeared stolen probably and poor duster jones the only man who could prove there was an agreement for me is killed that means this sam joseph can demand full payment of the loan in three weeks i havent got the money i have got no more chance than a rabbit of getting it hell foreclose ruin me and grab control of my company as soon as word gets around i cant meet my obligation and hell see that the word gets around the stock of my company will go to hell for cheap sis was also grim she said dad i wonder if they could have killed duster jones because he witnessed that agreement probably rotary agreed what about this doc savage the man theyre trying to hang it all onto sis asked he might want to know whats goin on rotary said so we better hightail it into new york and give him the news rotary went back and tied the prisoner in a somewhat more comfortable position he talked with the man for some time and the fellow poured out all he knew with frightened eagerness but it was nothing more than he had already said ever hear of a man named sam joseph rotary demanded the prisoner had he the big boss rotary asked the other didnt know the killer named butch had just mentioned sam joseph but the prisoner couldnt remember in what connection in order to fly over the missouri river and frighten the prisoner they had flown south from the route laid out for them as a permissible course by the army authorities sis turned the plane north and got on the course again it was the regular airways route kansas city to chicago part of the distance rotary consulted the map heres a place named millard he said theres a civil airways radio station there he got out a notebook and scribbled on it tore out the page on which he had written and folded it around a fivedollar bill then he tied them both around a monkey wrench with a piece of string rotary said k fly low over the radio station make the engine sound as if were in trouble sis followed instructions a man probably an operator came out and stood watching them rotary tossed the paper and the bill tied to the monkey wrench overside the man below began walking toward the falling object what was the idea sis asked just a piece of insurance rotary explained cautious in my old age thats me it could not have been more than three minutes later when a plane came piling out of a cloud a little ahead of them it was fast it bored toward them look sis gasped thats the same plane that followed us from tulsa to kansas city this is the regular route the army assigns to civilian planes rotary said grimly so he just flew up here and waited around for us wheres that rifle he yanked open the cabin windows motor thunder and inrushing wind was a roar careful of the propeller sis warned the plane ahead was coming at them straighton now the pilot must know they couldnt shoot through the propeller and was keeping ahead of it sis said ill do a flat skid to the right be ready she sent the plane into the skid presenting rotary with the other ship as a target but the plane ahead was ready for that it skidded also rotarys rifle banged then there was a terrific racket thudding jars as machinegun bullets stormed into their shipthe metal framing was hit at least a dozen times bullets slashed their fuel tank the tank was located between the cockpit and the engine and suddenly highoctane gas was flooding back into the cockpit and cabin the planes thundered past each other and apart rotary growled must be losin my eye he hadnt as far as he could tell hit anything effectively see if you can keep them back sis said she hauled the hand throttle as far open as it would go rotary nodded he climbed back into the cabin noting that their prisoner was whitefaced but apparently unhurt as yet your pals rotary told him maybe youd been better off if i had tossed you overboard he leaned out of the cabin window from time to time aiming carefully with his rifle and firing he was not a particularly good shot not expert as modern marksmen go although he could hold his own with any man on a quail hunt or shooting jackrabbits from a moving car he emptied the clip he had no idea a plane would be so hard to bring down the other ship gained on them rapidly and flew below and behind so that it was almost impossible for him to hit it or even catch sight of it time seemed to go swiftly but actually only twenty minutes had passed because the mississippi river broad and darkly turgid in the afternoon sun was below them when they caught fire the leaking gas tank did it of course they were tempting providence to try to fly but there had been no place where they could land and still protect themselves after they were down and suddenly sis screamed and the plane was full of bundling flames they were low trying to get the plane behind them out of the blind spot the river was snaking below no more than two hundred feet well have to take to the water sis said she had cut the motor and her voice was astonishingly loud they hit almost at once there was not much of it not much more roughness than a seaplane landing rotary slashed their prisoner loose then he went out through the plane cabin door sis was ahead of him water was pouring in their ship beginning to stand on its nose as it sank rotary and sis swam clear the water was fairly cold fifty yards away low and glistening in the sun was a sandbar it was more than half a mile long looked smooth and was completely bare of vegetation the plane which had brought them down was floating in for a landing on the sandbar everywhere else it seemed to them there was water they got us rotary harrison said chapter vii midwest trail the telegram had just come doc savage gave it a second reading renny doc said renny renwick appeared doc handed him the telegram explaining it just came renny examined the message then turned it thoughtfully in his big hands i telephoned to kirksville missouri from a place called millard missouri where there is an airways radio station he said gravely operator of the airways radio says a plane flew over apparently with engine trouble and dropped a message to be telegraphed to you notice the content of the message doc said you are being framed to take the rap in scheme involving murder and no telling what else coming to give you story and its signed by rotary harrison do you know a rotary harrison the name is not familiar doc admitted get copies of national business directories and whos who and see if we find anything rennys search got results holy cow he said his great rumbling voice fully impressed rotary harrison is an oil man got a financial record like a jackinthebox up and down right now seems to be up but in a shaky way like a man sitting on a stack of packing cases doc savage said check on this plane rotary harrison was flying get monk and ham to help you and long tom keep track of the ship once you find it renny got on a telephone ham brooks came in said doc this thing isnt shaping up so good from a legal angle you mean that montague ogden is still threatening to sue me because of the error in operating on sam joseph hes more than threatening hes filed suit ham spread his hands ogden claims that he has lost the services of sam joseph and is therefore entitled to damages that is a fragile basis for a lawsuit ham shrugged ordinarily yes but the letter of the written law is not always the law that prevails other connected circumstances are usually taken into consideration whether they should be or not you mean ham that the unpleasant publicity we are getting in the newspapers will weight the scales against us that ham said is what i mean i see and furthermore i think somebody is behind that publicity campaign against you our investigation has not turned up a deliberate plot doc reminded theyre too slick too smooth to be caught doc said montague ogden is certainly doing all he can to discredit me but you can say one thing about ogden he stands right out in the open and beats his drum ham admitted he does that grudgingly but the thing is spreading like wildfire i dont see how one man could stir up all that stink renny came in to report on the results of his search for the plane of rotary harrison the ship is down somewhere renny said heres a report from a place called keokak on the mississippi river right at the border of missouri and iowa a plane answering the description of rotary harrisons ship passed over that town closely pursued by another plane about two hours ago that would make it right after the telegram was sent from millard doc savage nodded are you getting one of our planes ready itll be fueled by the time we get there renny said monk and ham are down there now doc savage did not take off for the midwest immediately he got long tom and renny aside you two stay here doc directed and begin a general investigation of the situation just what asked renny would you suggest was a general investigation go to a lot of trouble doc said to find out whether this campaign against us is the work of an organization i see apparently it is the work of montague ogden but you want to know whether there is a gang behind it another thing doc said is an investigation of montague ogden i want the history of the man a complete picture of his life from the beginning up to now montagues life story k i want a complete report on his financial condition the lowdown on montague ogden right i want a full report on dr nedden the lowdown on the ogden private physician he thoroughly agreed with me that a cerebral fibroma was sam josephs trouble doc said so did two other doctors renny reminded i want the lowdown on them too renny nodded all right well do the best we can good we will return as soon as we look into this matter of a man named rotary harrison who has disappeared in the midwest i take it renny said that you know how serious this thing can get i have an inkling im talking about our college renny said doc savages face was suddenly solemn with a trace of strain plainly renny had touched on the worry uppermost in his mind i think you have hit the nail on the head i thought i had renny said if the public gets one single inkling of the kind of an institution we maintain up there there will be a terrific uproar renny nodded well be lucky if they only hang us you understand everything you are to do im to get all the dope possible on montague ogden and his business interests find out if there is an organization behind this newspaper campaign against us and check up on dr nedden and the other doctors who concurred in the diagnosis which said sam joseph had a cerebral fibroma is that all add sam joseph to your list find out all about him sure renny said i can see where long tom and i are going to be as busy as onearmed paperhangers you better hire two or three good detective agencies to help you that wouldnt be a bad idea renny agreed well handle it doc are you leaving for the midwest now right away i hope you find rotary harrison renny said i have a hunch he is the first proof weve had that this thing is a lot bigger than anybody dreamed doc savage took off from the hudson river with monk and ham they used one of docs small planes a craft which could handle five passengers at the very most a ship which was mostly motor it was an experimental army pursuittype job which had been constructed on docs specifications and which had proved too hot to be handled by the average run of pursuit pilots considering how hot the pursuit ships now used by the army were this plane became something of a freak it held a little over four hours gas supply and they had to detour by st louis to find a runway long enough to accommodate them but the trip required very little time monk insisted he hardly had time to spit they were in the air again when ham who was wearing the telephone headset said here is renny in new york on the air voice he wants you doc plugged in his headset picked up the microphone said yes rennys deep voice said another telegram just came in from that place in missouri millard you want it go ahead doc said it says that rotary harrisons plane has landed there and that he and his daughter are waiting to see you if you can fly there to meet them renny explained all right doc said thanks he consulted a chart and the windvelocity information he had gotten from the st louis airport he changed his course alarmed ham brooks consulted the logged data concerning the millard field the runway length theyve got a hardsurfaced runway north and south he said the wind is north and fairly strong we may be able to set this bumblebee down there monk mayfair was less concerned about their landing rotary harrison and daughter eh he remarked i wonder what kind of a daughter ham frowned l thought you were cured cured of what making a yassack out of yourself every time a pretty girl goes past monk grinned the only time i feel like a fool he said is when i let one get past me doc savage said millard field coming up in this thing ham said you no more than put your finger on a place than you are there they made the usual traffic circle of the field came in low over the fence and already stalling the airspeed indicator when they touched said better than a hundred and fifty miles an hour that was plenty hot and as the ship slowed so that the abbreviated control surfaces no longer had much effect it took expert brake controlling to keep them on the runway and out of the fence at the other end when their ground speed was down to twenty miles an hour doc braked the right wheel sent the ship toward the small cottage of an airways radio station with its windmilllike tower for the anemometer and wind sock they were not fifty yards from the cottage when a storm of lead hit their ship all of the bullets and no one but doc noticed this and he certainly did not discuss it then hit back in the cabin section where monk and ham were riding none of them hit near the cockpit where doc was seated in plain view chapter viii man lost it was a machine gun a heavy militarytype gun operating on a tripod it had been set up on the ground and covered with a large canvas and gun and canvas had been behind a car where it had not been noticed or more probably the setting up of it had not been noticed by the operators in the radio station the car drove forward a few yards the canvas was yanked away and the gun began shaking a redlipped snout the effect on docs ship was terrific the machinegun bullets caliber with a hitting energy of around twentynine hundred footpounds seemed about to turn the plane over they raked the ship from stern to propeller and took about a fourth off one propeller blade so that vibration of the unbalanced prop helped shake the ship then everything was silent the motor had stopped finally monk spoke thats a nice missouri reception he said what if this hadnt been an army experimental job with an armored cabin a man appeared in the radio cottage door one of the operators someone shot at him he jumped high and wide and began to run he did not jump back into the cottage which would have seemed natural but took out across the field toward some orange hangars labeled as the property of a flying service on the other side of the field he was a long thin man who ran as probably he had never run before hes a little excited monk said mildly the words were hardly out of monks mouth when a grenade exploded directly under their ship it might have been a homemade bomb of dynamite it lifted the plane monk said forty feet but ten was probably closer and snapped off both wings ripped open the armored cabin compartment and dumped the wreckage over on its side monk always ready with a wisecrack for once was speechless they were dazed their ears had stopped working for the moment doc savage dug into his clothing when he was operating his clothes were invariably a mine of gadgets he came up with a smoke bomb a little egg of a thing which he flipped toward the machine gun the smoke bomb hit the ground ripened made a cloud of smoke so black that it looked solid like a large and spreading mushroom of tar it shut off view of car and machine gun run doc rapped they may use another bomb ham piled out of a rip in the cabin doc followed then monk doc and ham ran heading for the radio shack which had a good concrete foundation that should stop lead monk was bellowing he liked to bellow in a fight and he jumped around half of a mind to rush through the smoke and try his luck on the gun crew behind it then an object came gyrating out of the smoke hit the ground rolled and stopped near monks feet it was another bomb homemade fifteen or so sticks of dynamite and a fizzing smoking fuse monk popped his eyes at it he let out a howl much louder than any previous effort and started running not seeming to touch the ground doc savage scooped up the bomb and threw it back into the smoke on the theory that he could get it away from them faster than they could get away from it monk had often claimed that doc savage had a mind which could stop and reason such things out under such circumstances monk maintained this put doc on a practically abnormal plane the bomb made a noise that a fourth of july never heard and immediately there was some satisfactory howling run doc said they followed monk who already had reached the radio cottage monk went inside through the open door where the operator had been standing when shot at doc and ham followed except that they did not go inside but circled the end of the building and went down behind the foundation keep down doc warned he had seen that the explosion had merely ruffled their enemies there seemed to be at least five of the foe two handling the machine gun the others with rifles the rifles began making me crisp violent reports that gelatined nitrocellulose powders make and the bullets went entirely through the radio cottage in most cases a few were stopped by generators and other solid apparatus inside monk came out through a window landed beside them he had discovered bullets would go through the cottage why dont somebody tell me them things he complained doc savage stepped back a few paces threw another smoke grenade then another and a third he was spacing them carefully they made the noises of firecrackers that had fizzled to monk and ham doc said pay no attention to the yelling i do now in a much louder voice a bellow doc howled monk ham make a break for it run weve got to get away we want to reach the harrisons let these fellows go he waited for that to soak in then he repeated it almost exactly the same words after which he dashed out around the corner of the radio cottage back toward his mangled plane the smoke pall had now spread enough to envelop the entire vicinity he could hear the assailants saying things mostly profanity in the pall doc got into the hulk of his plane largely by the sense of touch and found an equipment case this was intact and he got it open took out two metal flasks he returned with both flasks to monk he gave one to the homely chemist they have a plane doc said it is undoubtedly over by the hangars so get over there and put this stuff in the fuel tank monk knew what was in the flasks he had helped concoct the stuff sure he said doc made his voice loud again and bellowed get away dont take any chances on being shot our job is to get the harrisons then the bronze man ran back into the smoke pall again he went cautiously now he heard a man swearing and made for the fellow found him and struck with a fist simultaneously grabbing the man by the throat to throttle an outcry the fist blow he sent to the stomach it was not very successful for the man was wearing an armored vest one of the platetype commercial armored vests which sell for about seventyfive dollars it stopped most of the effect of docs fist blow the man squirmed fought doc hit him again and the fellow subsided doc took the mans coat and hat strangely the hat was harder to remove than the coat the man had yanked it down over his ears so he wouldnt lose it in the uproar use gas on them doc shouted using his own voice and making it loud he then hauled on the coat which fit him better than expected and yanked the hat over his own ears splitting it at the band in the operation he found the criminals car there was no one behind the wheel he got in started the motor made it moan and race thrusting his head out of the car he yelled imitating one of the voices which he had heard gas gas come on lets get out of here there was no gas of course but the black stuff thrown off by the smoke bombs had an acrid odor that was distinctive enough to give the imagination a good start they thought there was gas they were not prepared with masks evidently and the roaring racing car engine was like a magnet none of them wanted to be left behind they converged on the machine in a wild rush doc added to the confusion it was intensely black there in the smoke pall impossible to see an arm length by honking the car horn steadily and bellowing come on gas gas when he knew they were aboard he meshed gears let out the clutch and gave the machine plenty of gas he drove blindly until he was out of the smoke then he wheeled to the right went over a driveway curbing with a flying bump and out through the airport gate onto a graveled road doc drove fast the men in the car leaned out of windows and fired back into the smoke cloud two were clinging to the outside and one of these tried to fire but almost fell off and lost his rifle so far the hat and coat doc was wearing had fooled them but he did not want to get them too far away from the airport not so far away but that they would try to go back and get their plane he went over a railroad crossing it was rough so rough that only the solid top of the car kept some of them from flying out then there was a sharp turn onto another highway a concrete one and that did not ease the situation doc savage drove two hundred yards more saw a cornfield at the roadside the growing corn was about the right height for his purpose he jammed on the brakes hard gave the wheel just the right treatment and got the car on its side in the ditch in a cloud of dust the door on his side open he got out feet pounding in grass went over a low barbedwire fence into the corn by stooping the corn tassels were well over his head the corn fortunately had not been checkplanted so that its rows ran in only one direction which was parallel to the road they could not look down a corn row and see him that aint bill one of the men bellowed there was some more shooting then but not as bad as it had been back at the radio cottage doc savage kept going and circled widely coming back to the road once there he was very cautious once more but it was not needed the men had deserted their car they had crossed the railroad and were running across the airport toward the hangars on the opposite side they all were there except the one doc had slugged that one had recovered his senses and was sprinting across the field also headed for the hangars ham brooks at the radio shack began shooting ham seemed to have found a doublebarreled shotgun inside the radio cottage he unloaded both barrels with a terrific report he was kicked backward through the radioshack door the running man only ran faster doc went to the railroad tracks there was a culvert close by a small one and he sat down there he waited calmly he was pleased his plan was working as smoothly as if it had been rehearsed they did not always go this well the running men just crossing the airport were staggering with fatigue they did some wild shooting at the hangars the bullets causing a general rush for cover on the part of a number of young men evidently civilian pilot training students the plane setting in front of the hangars was a black cabin job one large motor lowwing one of the expensive ships built for the rich private trade before the war and not taken over by the government because of an overly large number of hours on motor and ship but airworthy and fast a ship large enough to take all the men off the ground they piled into the craft it had an electric starter and this whipped the prop over dust picked up behind the ship and whirled away in clouds the plane tore across the airport ignoring the paved runway quartering into the wind it got its wheels off and immediately the pilot began to slip a little into the wind to keep away from the fence corners a small man a very indignant small man came out of one of the hangars and began to pop away with a revolver at the fleeing plane monk appeared hastily said something to the small man he stopped shooting then he and monk ran into the hangar the plane with the criminals in it got a hundred and fifty feet of altitude banked quickly came back it was obvious they were after ham at the radio shack and maybe the radio shack too if they had more of those dynamite bombs doc savage showed himself he made as much of a spectacle as he could jumping around and waving his arms seizing a short piece of plank and going through the motions of aiming it as if it was a gun the plane wheeled came boring toward him out of the cabin windows came fire and noise doc went into the culvert the machinegun bullets jarred the ground around the mouth of the culvert the plane whooped overhead doc waited soon there was a terrific concussion and sticks dust and leaves flew into the culvert theyd had another dynamite bomb all right doc waited awhile crawled out he looked around for another bomb instantly but located none then he eyed the plane it was heading into the east it had the purposeful aim of a definite place to go doc ran across the field to the hangars monk and the small man latter was swearing really wonderful profanity and not asking questions were wheeling a neatlooking blue biplane out of the big hangar monk said i knew youd want to follow them right away doc doc savage glanced over the ship it was faster than the cabin job which had just left the field ham had appeared at the radio shack again was doing something around the wreckage of their bombripped plane doc made a hand funnel yelled get the scanner ham shouting back faintly said im getting it he disappeared into the plane ruin came out and ran toward them he had a case about the size of a typewriter case and a longer and heavier box of metal doc climbed into the biplane it was an opencockpit job the small man stopped swearing long enough to say thats my c p t advanced trainer you guys bust up that ship and it wont be healthy for you theyre getting hard to get monk said keep your shirt on has anybody some goggles two young men wearing the c p t wing emblems on their blouses had goggles they parted with them for about twice what they were worth cash ham arrived you and monk ride in the back doc said with the gadget ham said itll be a trial riding with that goon he got in the cockpit with the homely monk and the two cases they were very crowded and they were quarreling when doc gave the hand throttle a steady pull and sent the ship across the tarmac doc lifted the ship off and sent it into the east on the trail of the other plane the latter was now out of sight had been out of sight for some minutes the plane being a trainer was equipped with gosports the speakingtubeheadset device used in training student fliers doc indicated monk should put on the headset said get the scanner working monk nodded violently and went to work with the apparatus ham watched puzzled he understood only part of this docs unorthodox conduct of the fight back at the airport had been aimed at scaring the enemy into flight or more specifically into flight to wherever they were holding the harrisons also the fight had been arranged so that monk could introduce something into the gas tank of the plane ahead some chemical ham surmised what kind of mumbojumbo is this ham yelled at monk keep your hair on monk shouted back until i get this thing percolating of the two parts of the apparatus the metal case seemed to contain a large collection of batteries of the b radio type batteries delivering a sizable voltage in addition there were coils and vacuum tubes arranged so that they did not make sense to ham but it was certainly not a radio the second box contained a device into which monk proceeded to thrust his face after plugging it into the other apparatus the thing was about a foot and a half long at the end opposite from monks facewas a large lens and monk stared at the surrounding sky through this north doc monk shouted they swung north right ahead guess they figured they were out of sight of the airport and theyre climbing fast ham bellowed how do you know where that other plane went look monk said he thrust the gadget into hams hands look through it ham stared into the thing at first he saw nothing but a deeppurple darkness and he said so look to the north you overdressed shyster monk ordered ham did so immediately and astonishingly he saw a faintly silvercolored thread of what looked like smoke smoke from a tracer bullet but very vague he told monk what he saw thats it monk said thats the trail of the other plane ham jerked the thing away from his eyes youre crazy youre the crazy one monk roared at him doc and i have worked for months on this thing how does it work simple like all great things monk snapped you introduce a chemical in the gasoline which a plane burns after it burns and passes out of the exhaust stacks it is a vapor that hangs quiescent in the air it will hang there for hours of course it drifts with the wind currents but its there anyway marking a plain trail ham objected but i cant see it with the naked eye thats what makes it good monk assured him you can only see it with this gadget here how does it work that would take two hours to explain plus about four years of chemical education for you so you would know enough to understand the explanation monk assured him but it works with both ultraviolet and infrared wave lengths of light from both ends of the socalled visible spectrum all right all right you dont have to be sarcastic you ape ham said he was satisfied the plane flew north got above an extended bank of clouds then it turned east again and eventually when the cloud bank widened it angled southward compared to the terrific speed of the plane in which they had come out from new york they seemed to be crawling ham had been silent thinking about the gadget they were using he was fascinated he began to see possibilities in the thing say ham yelled the roar of air in the open cockpit made it hard to talk say why wouldnt this be a good gadget for the american army or navy to use on the enemy monk sneered at him what do you think we developed it for has it already been tried europe and asia monk said are full of english and american agents busy introducing quantities of that chemical into the gasoline supplies of the enemy is there any way of them licking it sure they can work out some chemical to nullify the effect of this stuff but that will lake weeks or months and in the meantime their planes can be tracked back to their airdromes by our ships there wont be any such thing as a concealed enemy airdrome ham grinned particularly in crowded europe did bombers operate from secret bases this trailing method would be death on such bases you would follow the trail and if there was wind allow for wind drift on stillair days the stuff should be marvelous as time went on ham was beginning to understand why both the army and navy had refused active service to doc savage and his associates as well the explanation then had been that they could do more good for the war effort by going on as they had been that had seemed a thin argument to doc and the rest of them at the time certainly it was not satisfactory because in the final analysis their main thirst was for excitement and adventure and that even included doc himself the war was a great show probably the greatest show of the century and they hated to miss it or at least fool around in the cheering section only now and then getting a finger into it but the army and navy simply wouldnt have them they had been tossed out on their collective ears not once either just about weekly doc savages researches into light have been extensive his employment of it varied as regular readers of doc savage magazine will surely have noticed in almost every new adventure doc savage manages to introduce one or more surprises in the share of a scientific gadget what readers of a scientific bent will also have noted is that it is the policy of she author of the doc savage material to have doc employ only methods and devices which have been developed or which other scientists have accomplished at least on a laboratory scale since the first doc savage novel appeared in many of the mechanical devices employed by doc savage which seemed completely fantastic at the time have been placed in everyday use these range from simple devices such as a generatoroperated type of flashlight which are now so common they can he bought in toy store for children or in expensive deluxe models for blackout use to the method lately employed of introducing a gas into the fuel tasks of military pursuit planes to make the gasoline vapor nonexplosive when the tanks are hit by the incendiary bullets from enemy guns this however is the first time the device for trailing planes has been employed by doc chapter ix river fight doc savages voice was quiet in the gosport when he said all right there they are the river was a width of gray corduroy below them and in it lay the white scar of a long sandbar at the north end the bar thrust an arm out toward the shore and the water there seemed to be wading depth mostly except for a narrow channel in fact at the far side of the channel very near to the river bank was a paddlewheel steamer which was obviously a derelict a hulk which had been there many years on the sandbar however and in motion was the black plane which they had followed from the millard airport the pilot had seen them was taking off tiny figures were sprinting along the sandbar toward the derelict steamer doc counted them four that meant the pilot was alone in the craft that was leaving the bar that plane and this one were so closely matched in climbing rate and maneuverability that the presence of even one added passenger would be too much of a handicap doc said two of us have to go over there were two chutes in the plane they were regulation parachutes for the c p t students so they would be all right seatpack type ham said ill fly her im the lightest one anyway there was no argument he was right and ham was a good combat pilot doc directed dive her get her about a hundred yards north of the old boat ham nodded to monk doc said hold off cracking your chute until youre almost in the trees youre telling me monk yelled i hope none of those guys are wing shots doc watched the river surface the position of the plane judging the wind velocity which would influence their parachute drift very little but nevertheless somewhat from the condition of the river waves direction of the wind of course was easy to judge from the unruffled surface of the water next to the bank over which the wind was blowing he went over he got a bad start slipping on the cockpit rim and began to turn over and over he stopped that by violent kicking at the right moments the earth came rushing up at him he kept his eyes on it a long fall and a breakout of the chute as low as he intended to crack this one was not something to fool with you fell fifty feet in no time at all fifty feet misjudgment could kill you he was being shot at he could hear the fiddlestringbreak sounds of the bullets passing he did not take his eyes off the ground which was magnifying enormously he hauled on the ripcord he was a little ashamed of what he did then he threw the steel ripcord away in his excitement something parachute jumpers in the army and navy were taught never to do the ripcords cost nearly five dollars apiece the next instant he was jarred solidly then he was in trees the trees were willows and they cushioned his fall tore clothing took off hide planted a few splinters with a flourishing of willows and a painful grunting monk was down a moment later he was not over fifty feet away doc got out of the harness left the chute there and ran to monk monk said these danged willows aint as soft as they look from the air he was not seriously damaged come on doc said they must have the harrisons on that old boat they ran toward the boat the ruin of it projected above the willows higher than would have been possible if the old derelict was resting in the water it must be grounded planted high and dry by some flood years ago perhaps far out of the river channel and now the river had channeled almost to the boat doc saw water through the willows slowed his pace and located the sandbar the four running men were off the big bar were in the deeper channel which separated it from the grounded derelict two of them were wading while the other two were swimming making slightly better time doc drew back made for the boat monk was close behind him monk had picked up a club a small oak fence post a most impressive shillalah an irishmans toothpick monk explained waving the post doc picked up two tomato cans as he ran fishermen must have brought them here to carry worms now they were full of sand and made good missiles feet had trampled the bank near the old boat there was a crude gangplank a tree trunk which had been felled from the bank to the derelict a man was coming down the gangplank walking sidewise using his rifle for a balancing stick he must have seen the two parachutes come down had decided to get ashore and do his fighting bushwhack style doc threw one of the sandfilled tomato cans the man on the log squawked lost his rifle fell down and wrapped his arms around the log he remained there dazed doc pegged a smoke bomb onto the deck of the sidewheeler let it burst then went out on the log he ran lightly hardly seeming to slacken speed while on the log monk followed but paused to give the man clinging to the log a wallop with his club with the result that he nearly fell off the log the clinging man stunned still more lost his grip with his legs but he still hung to the log by his hands monk trampled on his fingers for a while poked with the club the man remained there crying i cant swim in an awful voice youve got a fine chance to learn monk assured him and kicked him loose it was about fifteen feet down to the water and the water was not waistdeep monk ran on entered the smoke from docs grenade which was spreading monk said docs voice in the black pall yeah youve got to be less reckless doc warned you take too many chances k monk agreed and grinned a fight he figured was the place to be reckless the men fording across from the sandbar were shouting excitedly howling warnings about the parachutes to the boat overhead there was tense moaning from the two airplanes doc lifted his voice shouted harrison rotary harrison this is doc savage where are you over the planemotor noise over the yelling of the men coming from the bar and the anxious squalling of the man monk had kicked off the log and who was trying to drown in waistdeep water there was an answer it was a response in a bellowing voice from the boat somewhere deep inside the voice made no words just anger and noise monk said that sounds about like i figured rotary harrison would sound monk come on doc said we have got to find the harrisons and get them out of here safely that is the first job monk thought of the four men in the river and decided to misunderstand docs order now and then monk permitted himself to do something like that usually when to follow instructions meant missing a fight sure ill get em doc monk yelled and made off up the deck there was enough noise what with the planes and the yelling that he figured he could get away with that he wanted a fight the men trying to board the derelict would be just about what he considered suitable odds he made for the bow which was where he surmised the men would try to board the old beat almost at once he fell through to his armpits in a hole in the deck the boards did not seem to be rotten someone had merely removed them he got out of the smoke made better time he reached the rail heard the men splashing alongside he put his head over the rail quickly the men waistdeep in mud and sand were working along the side of the derelict their heads were not more than six feet below wonderful targets for monks long club he decided like playing golf he drew back quickly got a grip on the very end of the club he leaned over the rail two of the men below were ready they had an old piece of rusted wire hawser about a dozen feet long each had an end they came up and over with the hawser swinging it as if it was a skip rope it came down on the back of monks neck they yanked monk did a oneandahalf turn over the rail and lit standing up in the mud beside them it occurred to monk a little too late that they could have seen his shadow when he appeared at the rail the first time they were on him instantly all of them and monk had his fight he knew immediately it was the nastiest fight he had ever had which was saying a great deal two of them had double fistfuls of mud which they at once slapped into his eyes someone hit him with something a little later it felt like a rifle stock when he clutched it helplessly going down he was dazed they got on him with their feet trampled him deep into the mud he never heard one of them say dont do him clear in we can use one of them alive the big boss says doc savage crouched at the edge of a hatch listening the voice that undoubtedly belonged to rotary harrison was howling steadily below it was close overhead the two planes were circling sparring from time to time gun clatter joined the noise of their motors ham seemed to be the better flier at least he was holding his own but the other pilot had an automatic rifle and ham who was used to a ship with an armored cockpit with fuel tanks treated so they would not leak was handicapped like monk he was inclined to be reckless too doc looked down into the hatch the hold planking had long ago been ripped out there were only the naked beams of the old sidewheelers internal frame but there was lurking down there somewhere a guard probably a man with a gun it was tobacco smoke that told the bronze man this not the smoke itself but the pungent odor from the clothes of a man who smoked a pipe a great deal doc picked up a long stick a fragment of fishpole someone had left on deck and sent it away from him like a spear the pole hit skittered down through another hatch made a clatter instantly doc swung down through the hatch where he was crouching he landed on a crosspiece leaped to the right got behind a timber at one time the hold of the derelict had drifted full of mud and sand but of late years the hull at the stern doc was now near the stern had fallen apart and the mud and sand had washed out again when the river was at flood stage so the central section of the derelict was still piled high with a sandbank doc searched carefully located the guard the man was standing behind a timber himself only the muzzle of his gun showing doc worked toward him and managed to get closer and closer the two figures lying bound on the sandbank did not stir and made no sound a man and a girl the girl even turned once quickly as if she heard some small sound in the direction opposite doc which was clever doc got the guard reaching around the beam to take him he tried to make the fellow unconscious silently he did that all right but the mans gun was on cock and it exploded the blast earrending in the confines of the place immediately another guard one stationed farther toward the bow but inside the boat howled an alarmed demand not knowing how many more there were doc shouted run the place is full of cops the cavelike acoustics of the place he hoped would make his voice sound like anybodys voice he dropped the guard ran to the harrisons and freed them slashing with a knife at their ropes run he ordered get ashore they had been tied too long and couldnt run the effort they made was agonizing doc gathered them up one with each arm and carried them the guard toward the bow hadnt been fooled he was coming back and cautiously once he fired at them the bullet scooping rotten wood off a timber carrying the harrisons doc got to a burst hull planking and worked through it they fell out into river mud carrying two people was incredibly difficult in the stuff but he worked toward the bank which was steep and got up onto the sunbaked mud then climbed more rapidly he piled into the willows that furred the top without being shot in the back he dropped the harrisons keep crawling away from here he said the noise of the planes overhead had changed he looked up it was bad news the motor of hams plane had gone dead and he was slanting off to the east for a motoroff landing somewhere he evidently figured he was high enough to reach some of the oatstubble fields that were back half a mile or so from the river the second plane for some reason or other the pilot was not pursuing ham to finish him off was spiraling down toward the sandbar the ship landed on the sandbar there was some shouting when the plane stopped doc moved to a position where he could see the ship three men were hauling a fourth toward the plane the man they hauled was monk monk seemed to be unconscious then three more men appeared wading to the sandbar they were the two guards who had been in the derelict and the man monk had kicked off the log gangplank monk was dumped into the plane the others climbed in the plane went flogging down the long sandbar the sand seemed to be packed as hard as a runway otherwise the ship would never have taken the air with that load but it got off they flew straight up the river slowly gathering altitude the plane was hardly above the level of the riverbank treetops when it was out of sight and out of sound harrison doc called rotary harrison and the girl appeared coated with mud and dust twigs and grass from head to foot they walked stiffly staggering because of stiffened muscles this is my daughter sis rotary harrison said quietly they got away huh doc savage nodded they not only got away he said grimly they escaped with one of my best men doc savage went back aboard the derelict river steamer alone he searched the ruin from stem to rudder post from keel to passenger deck there was nothing to show that the men had used the wreck for anything but a very temporary hideout doc spent some time measuring footprints storing the measurements in his mind using a mentalimpression memory system which he had developed he decided that the river steamer had been wrecked here originally through the misfortune of having its boilers blow up but there was nothing of real value after a while ham brooks came stumbling through the willow thickets a blasted lucky shot brought me down he complained the only bullet that hit the plane i think it shorted out one mag and the other was out of order just one of those freaks doc savage said they got away with monk ham did not say anything but his face was fixed and afterward it lost color he could not have been tortured into admitting it but monk was probably closer to ham than any other person the remarkable memory ability which doc savage possesses is not as his other traits are not particularly freakish really amazing memories as experts on psychology know are usually the result of the use consciously or subconsciously of various system association or otherwise of filing a fact in the brain tissue along with various labels by which it can be found chapter x the demented trail it was not yet daylight the next morning when doc savage walked into his headquarters with rotary harrison and sis renny renwick and long tom roberts were at work surrounded with telephones scratch pads pencils and halfconsumed sandwiches the bigfisted engineer renny said holy cow wheres ham monk was seized by those guys we knew that but where is ham doc explained ham stayed behind to look for monk he got any clues only that the black plane which carried monk away was a type of ship which probably did not have a large fuel capacity and therefore it had to land three or four hundred miles from where they got monk renny nodded long tom and i have been as busy as jumping beans but weve checked up on montague ogden and his company weve looked into that newspaper campaign against you and weve checked up on the doctors who concurred in the diagnosis which led to the operation on sam joseph and we have looked up sam joseph take the last first doc savage suggested and begin with sam joseph rotary harrison and sis crowded close yeah said rotary i think i got me a big personal interest in that hombre this is miss sister harrison and her father mr ranzo john harrison doc savage explained colonel john renwick and major thomas j roberts better known as renny and long tom call me sis sis said smiling and call me rotary rotary harrison rumbled if you want me to be happy renny nodded heres the report on sam joseph the bigfisted engineer rumbled birthplace parents nationality early environment unknown renny stopped speaking looked at them expectantly unknown said doc what do you mean unknown sam joseph said renny is a victim of permanent early amnesia or so he claims he knows nothing about what happened to him before he was about twentyfive years old he claims that he is one of those men who wake up in hospitals not knowing who he is he claims he still does not know what about the rest of his life his business career has been about the usual career of an executive in a business organization he has worked for three different firms a bond house a mailorder concern and the ogden outfit good record you mean he aint a crook rotary demanded disgusted there is no evidence of his being crooked renny said hes just too slick for you then hes got it all covered up if he covered anything up he is slick renny rumbled weve done everything but look at the roots of his teeth no we even did that one of the detectives we hired brought in xray films of sam josephs teeth got them from his dentist rotary harrison smashed a fist into a palm sam joseph is a crook he declared and i think hes a murderer too or at least hired murder done renny was interested what makes you say a thing like that thats a pretty harsh statement six months ago i borrowed a large sum of money from sam joseph and we signed an agreement to renew the loan in six months now i cant pay somebody stole the written agreement to renew and sam joseph say there wasnt any the only witness i had to the agreement was an old friend duster jones he was murdered a man named butch killed him renny jumped butch theres a man working for montague ogden named butch working for sam joseph you mean dont you demanded rotary no for odgen but maybe renny scratched his head doc said the thing to do seems to be to talk to sam joseph renny do you know where we can find him hes back at montague ogdens place as far as we know they rode downtown in a black limousine which was large but subdued discreet ordinary giving no hint that it was actually a rolling fortress of armor plate and special bullet resistant glass and as formidable as a tank long tom had remained behind to continue the investigation to which he and renny had been assigned doc renny said thoughtfully yes you remember that thing which first got me and long tom so excited about this case the talking devil you mean yes what about it it keeps cropping up in my thoughts you suppose it had any peculiar significance doc savage said the thing possibly was not what it seemed rotary harrison demanded whats this stuff about a talking devil renny gave him the story about sam joseph apparently hearing the small devil image speak it was plain from the way renny told the story that he had been giving it a good deal of thought and was still much intrigued by it as well as far from convinced that the speaking satan was a figment of a disordered mind sis harrison also listened to the story and she watched doc savage she seemed to be noting the physical qualities of the bronze man and seemed quite impressed sis said unexpectedly this whole thing hasnt made much sense so far has it if it is just a plot to steal the oil interests which dad and i have built up it seems rather elaborate my guess doc savage told them is that we will find that a great deal more is involved what happened in the midwest shows we are up against a big organization a cultus bunch of hombres rotary put in and they wont stop at nothin a man in a butlers livery tried to prevent them entering the fantastically modernistic ogden penthouse on top of the ogden building rotary harrison lost no time in elbowing the butler out of the way rotary had risen to a rage as he looked at the fabulous richness of the ogden building and had growled probably got the dough for this by robbing other guys like me well ill put a quietus on that he slammed the butler one on the chest and said dont argue with us fancy britches dr nedden met them at the door of the room where sam joseph lay on a bed dr neddens manner was cold as he eyed doc savage his greeting was brusque you are fully aware the patient should not have visitors yet he snapped doc made no comment on that instead he said dr nedden is it true that you have stated that you did not actually diagnose sam josephs trouble as cerebral fibroma dr neddens face tightened i refuse to discuss the case with you but you have so stated to the newspapers have you not when as a matter of truth you told me in plain words that you agreed your diagnosis was cerebral fibroma doc added dr nedden swallowed you cant see the patient he snapped rotary harrison said brother wheres your riot squad you better have one when you tell us what we cant do dr nedden backed away indignantly remember he snapped i havent given my permission this is on your own initiative and against a surgeons advice he wheeled and went away rotary harrison looked after dr nedden and said when i was a kid i used to think i had a strange power where snakes were concerned i thought i could feel when a snake was around me maybe it was imagination then but i feel that way about that guy they went into the room sam joseph smiled at them pleasantly from the bed his color was good although his head was swathed in bandages and he was obviously quite weak his voice when he spoke was low but healthy quiet and quite sanesounding good morning he said i am very sorry to be the cause of all this trouble rotary harrison roared good morning hell listen you ditty blackfaced crook yo hold it hold it doc savage said although doc did not lift his voice harrison went silent sam joseph examined rotary harrison asked who is this man he seems familiar you oughta remember me you snipe said rotary im rotary harrison oh yes yes indeed said sam joseph i do remember you now but you have changed a little you loaned me a hundred and eighty thousand dollars snapped rotary yes i recall on your oil interests and you signed an agreement to renew the loan in six months i am sure you are mistaken sam joseph said i would have remembered that there was no such agreement why yo doc savage got in front of rotary pushed him back you will have to keep that for later doc said this man underwent a major operation three days ago sam joseph smiled said thank you but i am feeling better except at times when i seem to fade off mentally and have rather strange dreams what kind of dreams doc inquired i never seem to be able to recall the details sam joseph said however one strange thing happened i heard that little devil statue speaking again you heard the devil talk again yes i really heard it again sis harrison blurted but i thought the devil was supposed to have been destroy doc interrupting asked where was the devil when it spoke on the table there beside my bed the indicated table was a small modern metal one which bore a rather expensivelooking bedside reading lamp which gave a focused and controlled beam that could be changed from a switch on the end of a cord which an occupant of the bed could use it was the little brass devil statue doc asked yes what did it say doc inquired or did you understand the words the bronze mans voice had not changed had not taken on excitement but there was an intense activity in his flakegold eyes and tension in his jaw muscles i understood the words said sam joseph what were they the devil said hello hello hello we have to see you that thing in missouri turned out better than we expected we have the short ugly one what shall we do with him sam joseph closed his eyes for a moment i am sure that is what the devil said he continued i made a particular point to remember it it was a rather long speech but i kept repeating it to myself i have a good memory really rotary harrison growled if you have such a memory its funny that agreement doc interposed mr joseph had you been asleep just before you heard the devil talk yes one of the sleepspells when you dream well yes but my head was quite clear when i heard the statue talk doc savage nodded what became of the devil after it spoke he asked oh it disappeared i dont know where it went do you have a nurse only dr nedden he has been staying here day and night he seems very disturbed over what happened dr nedden does not leave your side oh i wouldnt say that he goes away frequently but for short times only never for more than five minutes at a time that ended the discussion because long tom roberts burst into the place get out of here doc long tom yelled the police are on their way here to arrest you long tom did not get that excited without reason doc wheeled made for the door the harrisons father and daughter seemed undecided then followed him running they lost no time getting into an elevator and down to the street long tom had a car waiting they piled into that long tom yanked the machine into traffic said you better get down out of sight doc theyll have prowl cars looking for you rotary harrison swore i thought you were a special policeman yourself he said doc made no reply long tom said special commission or not doc you are in plenty of trouble doc said it must have developed suddenly long tom popped a hand down on the steering wheel like that he said like lightning out of a clear sky bang but we should have seen it coming doc said it has been building up all right long tom startled eyed him and demanded you mean to say you have seen it coming doc nodded when did the police appear he asked not very long after you left to come down to examine sam joseph long tom explained the commissioner himself came in with the head of the detective bureau the head of the frauds investigation bureau and some other big shots so i knew it was bad i tried to stall them said i didnt know exactly where you were which was true in a way and then they got a telephone call it was a tipoff about where you were so they lit out and i lit out faster because i beat them down here renny renwick emitted a rumble of anger that dr nedden he tipped them off the sound of a police siren came at them so suddenly that it was surprising the car a white radio prowl whisked past with two grim officers leaning forward on the seat the machine was headed for the ogden building i didnt beat them by much long tom said rotary harrison emitted a growl of disgust do you guys do everything backward what you mean long tom asked whatre they tryin to arrest savage for rotary demanded why you havent said long tom stared at him then at doc savage doc long tom asked do you want to discuss it in front of these people doc savage spoke then in mayan the language of ancient maya was one they had learned in the course of their first really great adventure together although simple it was spoken as far as they knew by no one in the civilized world but themselves has the existence and location of our college actually been disclosed to the police doc asked in mayan apparently not long tom replied also in mayan but they are convinced there is such a place then in our discussions avoid admitting there is such a place doc directed ok long tom said in english he added what do you say we go to my laboratory the police dont know where it is and well be safe there doc nodded doc savage has held through most of his career honorary police commissions usually of high ranking from time to time due to one misunderstanding or another arising out of the bronze mans unusual activities these have been revoked and restored chapter xi the devils work long tom roberts was a man who was noted for two things the first being his ability with electricity for it was conceded that he was one of the great contemporary men of electrical science and secondly he was known for his ability to look as if he was so unhealthy that he was going to collapse with his next step undertakers invariably looked at him with hope monk mayfair claimed long toms complexion was one a mushroom would consider anemic long tom had gotten the complexion by spending some time in his laboratory judging by the looks of the place it was in a basement in a neighborhood which was so tough that the cops walked in pairs in the middle of the street there was no vestige of natural light in the place and apparently no fresh air ever entered either but the array of electrical machinery was impressive actually frightening great grief said rotary harrison in awe long tom brushed pliers wire and gadgets off chairs and seated them doc he said you want to know the whole situation all of it the bronze man said all right long tom told him first ill begin with this stuff against you that appeared in the newspapers im talking about stories like that one which appeared in the morning blade that was a typical example just a lot of innuendo that story in the morning blade was typical although some of the other newspapers were not that blunt long tom picked up a piece of copper wire and began to twist it absentmindedly that newspaper campaign he said was the work of an organization doc asked you are sure of that long tom shoved out his jaw and nodded thats the first real piece of information renny and i dug up it was a campaign all right how was it managed doc inquired in the crudest and most effective way money bribes this thing wasnt hatched in an evening over a glass of beer whoever cooked it up spent plenty of time and has plenty of money to back it and get it going but the money that is spent will probably he only a sneeze in the bucket to the final take doc said you were explaining how this newspaper campaign against me was put in operation by bribing one or two guys on each paper long tom said they just bought off a reporter here and there not on every paper mind just where they could find a soft man we got this information from reporters they had planned to bribe and couldnt did one man do the bribing one man thats right who doc asked was he butch long tom said the fellow they call butch rotary harrison frowning heavily said i dont see how newspaper stories could start the police looking for you or is there something behind the stories yes what is the rest of it doc asked we long tom said have investigated the montague ogden business enterprises and found the whole institution about to collapse accountants havent finished going over the books yet there hasnt been time but it seems that montague ogden who thought he was a rich man is without a cent or maybe even in debt suspicions are that the firm has been looted it has had the money sucked out of it like a weasel sucks the blood out of a chicken the weasel bellowed rotary was sam joseph i bet right said long tom sam joseph a man who and mark this because it is the important part a man who does not have any memory of his early life a man who cannot recall where he spent his youth or anything about his early environment or existence doc savage was suddenly showing the most intense interest go on he said sam joseph is no long tom said yes there are at least ten others long tom looked at doc gravely and every one of them is a man who does not remember what happened during the early part of his life rotary harrison frowned this is a crazy thing first a brass devil that talks then men who have lost their memories not lost their memories long tom corrected men who have simply had all memory of their early lives erased from their brains there was now the strangest expression on doc savages metallic features name some of those men he directed long tom said charles moore t b moresco dan taylor reynold rice doyle that is enough doc savage said the bronze man almost never showed emotion but now there was stark amazement on his face shock and stunned amazement whats the matter with you rotary asked doc was silent he could not very well answer the men long tom had named were men who had once been criminals men whom doc savage had captured in the course of his strange career of righting wrongs and punishing evildoers name the rest of them doc said suddenly long tom named them doc nodded grimly they were successful graduates of his college all of them what have they done doc asked every one of those men long tom said pointedly has become a crook robbed his concern of enormous sums of money doc savage stood erect slowly and walked into another room he sank in a chair and sat there long tom roberts glanced at the harrisons and indicated they should remain where they were then long tom followed doc he closed the door behind him and stood studying the big bronze man he had never seen doc look as deeply affected its an awful thing to happen doc long tom said finally very bad doc agreed i dont understand it at all none of the graduates from our college have ever turned back to crooked ways before how come a whole bunch of them do it now all at once dirty work doc said long tom rubbed his jaw thoughtfully it must be you figure it is all tied in with the talking devil and sam joseph apparently sam joseph was never in the college no but all the others were doc savage came up out of the chair he seemed to have reached some kind of a conclusion a decision he said the particularly terrible aspect of this thing is that the whereabouts of our college and proof that it actually exists may get into the hands of the police and the public when they are unfriendly we have always known that our method of treating criminals is too drastic for the public to accept and probably will be too drastic for another fifty or a hundred years he paused and shook his head grimly i had hoped doc continued to keep the college in operation and perhaps in the future evolve some way of quietly bringing the method of treating criminals to the attention of the public present it in a favorable light so that it would be seen as the only sure cure for criminal minds then with that accomplished if we could present a sound groundwork of many cases of criminals cured and made into upright citizens by our treatment we could get our method accepted it would mean the elimination of the most troublesome type of criminal of all the confirmed criminal but doc concluded if our plans are wrecked now it can well take another century or more for such a thing to be developed and accepted by the public that is the really grim thing about this you and i believe in this thing and we know how it works and what a benefit it will be to mankind we know how tragic losing it would be doc there is one thing the police havent been tipped they havent been told where our college is located we have got to stop this thing before they are informed if we knew where to start long tom complained renny renwick brought doc savage the newspaper it was a copy of the morning blade the paper which had attacked doc savage with the greatest violence this just went on sale on the streets renny said take a look at it red ink for headlines went out of fashion years ago even for the blade but this one was in red ink doc savage aid confesses the following is a true signed statement made to representatives of the blade this morning by lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett monk mayfair for a long tune aid and close confident of the notorious and monstrous doc savage editor the blade and whom it may concern this is to inform you that i have just discovered the real nature of the incredible thing which doc savage has been doing to the brains of men accordingly i have not only severed all relations with doc savage but i shall do what i can to right this horrendous wrong i shall have in the hands of the morning blade and all other newspapers and press associations in time for publication tomorrow morning a full and true signed statement concerning doc savages socalled college and the hideous brain operations conducted there my statement will include the location of the college in order that the poor wretches still there may be rescued it will also include a full list of past graduates of the place as nearly as my memory can supply the names of these poor victims monk mayfair renny rumbled holy cow thats monks signature too and the document isnt a fake that was also docs opinion the letter from monk or the statement whichever it would he called was not printed but was a reproduction of a photograph of the letter itself it was a good cut quite large full of detail and there was no doubt that monk had signed it furthermore monks fingerprints were affixed renny waved the paper angrily howd this happen he bellowed its incredible what the blazes has gotten into monk theyve bought him off said rotary harrison renny looked as if he was going to slam harrison with one of his big fists dont be a fool renny growled they couldnt torture a thing like that out of monk howd they get it then renny stared at doc savage and his jaw fell for the bronze mans manner had changed doc looked alert even relieved the bronze man was on his feet doc indicated the newspaper they stubbed their toes he said they went just one jump too far and gave it all away now we can go into action action renny said is what we can use some of get ham brooks doc savage said get him here at once chapter xii mantheft ham brooks did not arrive at long tom roberts experimental laboratory which was serving as docs headquarters until early that night he came in looking haggard pouches under his eyes lips cracked from wind i got your message to come he told doc but i had a heck of a time dodging police did you know theres a police alarm all over the united states for you doc admitted he knew that because he had been listening to shortwave radio police broadcasts he led ham into a room where they could be alone and closed the door that thing monk had in the newspapers that incredible thing ham exclaimed howd they make monk sign a thing like that he must have been horribly tortured doc said quietly do not worry about monk he probably is still alive and they probably have not tortured him but doc indicated a chair sit down he said i have a job for you it may be dangerous but it is important it requires a man of your build a man who can act that is why i called you in ill do it ham said calling me in was all right too i hadnt found a single trace of poor monk lean back in this chair doc said twenty minutes later the bronze man opened the door and called in rotary and sis harrison and long tom they came to the door and gasped in astonishment sam joseph exclaimed sis whered you get him how does he look like sam joseph to you doc asked why of course he does sis said and rotary nodded agreement long tom roberts however grinned and said so thats why you wanted ham he does look a lot like sam joseph at that the resemblance which ham now bore to sam joseph the victim of the wrongly diagnosed brain operation was in fact startling there had been a physical resemblance to begin with and the disguise work doc had done had enhanced the likeness doc said all right i just wanted to see how effective the disguise was will you leave us alone now whats going on rotary blurted sis took his arm said come on dad it looks to me like were going to get some action they went out leaving doc and ham alone doc said ham his voice will be the tricky part we are going to work on that now it may take several hours i will talk to you using the nearest thing to sam josephs voice and tone i can manage and you will repeat the words after me the truck was large painted a silver gray and had a body like a metal box it was labeled deparment of sanitation and it had the usual mechanism at the rear into which the contents of an ash can could be dumped and loaded automatically into the dust and odorproof body there was nothing about it to indicate it was not a city sanitationdepartment truck of the type which called at downtown office buildings each morning before dawn for ashes and waste it did arrive a little early it stopped at the service entrance of the towering modern ogden building near the stack of ash cans which the janitors had already placed on the sidewalk as was customary two men came out of the ogden building they wore janitors coveralls marked ogden bldg but they did not look like janitors and the bulges in their pockets near which they kept their hands were obviously guns they stood and watched a pair of sinister figures very alert in the rather thick gloom two men piled out of the truck and began loading ashes they worked methodically as if they had done that work for years only twice did they seem to have a little trouble grunting and banging large ash cans against the rear of the truck before they lowered them to the walk replaced the lids and took the cans back to stand them along the wall just inside the service entrance of the building they got in the truck drove to the next building and collected more ashes one of the two men wearing janitor coveralls laughed some guys make it the hard way dont they wed look more like janitors said his companion if we got busy and rolled these empty ash cans back into the boiler room you gone crazy the other demanded hell with it they closed the service door locked it and walked away discussing a bottle and a card game they had been forced to desert it was quiet in the passageway for two or three minutes after they had gone then lids came off two of the ash cans doc got out of one ham brooks wearing his sam joseph disguise with coveralls and a cellophanelike hood to protect his clothing and the bandages from ash dust appeared from the other can lucky we used a system to get in here ham said theyve got the place under guard all right doc said look for the stairway the only other guard they encountered was outside the door of montague ogdens penthouse he was equipped with brush and pail and apparently it was his job to look innocent by scrubbing at the parquet floor when the occasion required doc used an anesthetic bomb on him the bomb was about the size of a bantam egg consisted of a thin glasslike plastic shell containing liquid the shell burst when the bomb hit near the man making hardly any noise and the liquid splattered evaporated the guard seemed to go to sleep actually that was about what it amounted to the anesthetic gas one of the most efficient gadgets ever developed by doc savage took effect without causing sensation and the man would awaken as one awakens from sleep after half an hour or so doc and ham avoided effects of the gas by holding their breath after about a minute the stuff lost its effectiveness mingling with the air doc carefully gathered up the glasslike plastic fragments and pocketed them so no trace would remain there were no servants in the elaborate penthouse layout which ham considered a little strange and i wonder where montague ogden himself is he added whispering in the bedroom where sam joseph lay dr nedden was sitting nedden occupied a deep chair and he was reading he had the lights on very bright as if to keep himself awake doc savage tossed another of the anesthetic grenades into the room after easing the door open a fraction of an inch at a time he and ham held their breath until dr neddens head sagged forward and the book slipped out of his hands to the floor doc savage picked up the book dr nedden had been reading it was a technical tome one on medinals the monosodium salts of diethylbarbituric acid the book title meant nothing to ham but he noted that doc savage seemed to think it significant for the bronze man made for a brief moment a tiny trilling sound a note that was almost inaudible and yet it sounded satisfied ham saw also that doc picked up a small bottle on a table at dr neddens elbow evidently the man had been using the contents himself something to keep him awake ham remarked sam joseph was asleep they awakened him he knew them and smiled we are going to take you out of here for a while doc savage told him and leave ham brooks in your place i do not see any sense in that sam joseph said there will be sense to it we hope doc said the man seemed agreeable ham took sam josephs place in the bed be very careful doc warned him ham nodded how long will i have to do this do you suppose let us hope no longer than a few hours doc told him we will put the genuine patient back as soon as possible ham said o k im game there are some weapons you can use concealed in your head bandage doc said if it comes to that the bronze man got sam joseph out of the building without difficulty without being discovered he carried the patient to a car which renny renwick had waiting around the corner feel all right doc inquired oh yes excellent sam joseph said you know it is strange i feel very well at times and then at other times i go off into those strange unconscious spells doc savage made no comment but renny glanced at the patient asked heard that devil do any more talking no sam joseph replied i guess you gentlemen think i am crazy dont you seen anything more of the devil no you do think im crazy dont you doc savage said quietly you are as sane as any of the rest of us and you can rest assured of that the bandages kept much expression from showing on sam josephs face but into his voice came almost pitiful relief when he spoke i am so glad to hear you say that he said eagerly so much has happened to make me doubt my well rationality for example well those periods of coma of unconsciousness when my senses leave me yet it is not sleep sam joseph opened and closed his hands slowly painfully that has been happening for many weeks and always there has been growing a kind of premonition of something terribly wrong doc put a comforting hand on his arm you have a very strong subconscious mr joseph you mean something is wrong very long tom roberts helped them carry sam joseph into the electrical research laboratory in the dank basement when they arrived long tom was somewhat sullen and scowled frequently at rotary harrison something wrong doc asked i dont see why the hell i cant get out and walk around the town rotary snapped its not me the police are looking for long tom said i told him your orders were for everybody to stay out of sight doc i practically had to hit him over the head with a chair to keep him here rotary growled you try kissing me with a chair and itll be the last guy you try it on now dad sis said hes right the police probably know we are with mr savage we cannot do anyone any good in jail long tom renny sis and rotary watched with interest but with no immediate understanding as doc savage went to work on sam joseph it first appeared that the bronze man was going to do nothing but give sam joseph another physical examination including various blood tests then it was clear that the examination was of specialized nature doc analyzed blood samples tissue saliva it seemed to the others that he was making every possible analysis he spent some four hours at it then he asked sam joseph questions these periods of coma or unconsciousness to which you refer doc said did they come on regularly no not at all sam joseph assured him there was an irregular interval of time between each one i want you to think carefully doc said and tell me whether some of them came on after meals yes yes after i had taken a cocktail sometimes i thought it was the cocktails causing it and i even stopped drinking who was with you when you had the cocktails why why dr nedden now that i think of it doc savage was pleased have you ever heard of the monosodium salts of diethylbarbituric acid the bronze man asked sam joseph frowned no except that i believe i have seen dr nedden reading a scientific text concerning something like that doc nodded your spells of coma he said have been brought on by medinals and other drugs my analysis is not complete but there is unmistakable evidence of the presence of medinals and their continued administration what is a medinal a hypnotic doc explained renny gave a violent jump holy cow hypnotics you mean theres a drug that hypnotizes a perso no no doc corrected him the medical application of the term hypnotic simply means an agent producing sleep but in the present case other drugs have been added to the barbituric group to produce physically a state of coma with apparently only the loss of the facility of memory and initiative sam joseph apparently understood it better than any of them they drugged me he ejaculated and then they made me do whatever they wanted me to do and i didnt remember rotary harrison seemed astounded thats why you dont remember the agreement you signed to renew my loan that must be it doc savage confronted renny renwick and long tom roberts he said there is one thing more we should do to make sure about this thing that is to get hold of at least one of the graduates of our college who according to the police have turned crooked right now renny asked right now doc said renny and long tom left on the job doc savage went back to work testing and analyzing blood specimens from sam joseph it was a job not made any easier by the fact that long toms electrical laboratory was not equipped with medical type slides for the microscopes nor proper chemicals there was however a wonderful atomic microscope which made up for much that was lacking sis harrison waited patiently employing her time in administering little comforts to sam joseph sis it was evident was admiring doc savage more and more what will happen to mr ham brooks if they find he is not sam joseph she asked doc said we had better cross our fingers and hope on that an hour later renny and long tom came back they had a man named charles moore once a patient in the college we got him long tom explained dryly by highjacking him away from two police detectives who were taking him to talk to the district attorney charles moore was a smooth brown capable man a little taller than the average in good physical shape clean living had made his face pleasant and there remained very little of the thin hardness that had once been there when he was a notorious criminal he had once as a matter of fact very nearly succeeded in murdering doc savage but that was before he had been captured subjected to a brain operation that wiped out all knowledge of past and trained as an accountant he had been a successful honest man in the field of accountancy having risen to be vice president of his firm they had arrested me charles moore said i do not understand it at all they say i have robbed my company of large sums of money that is ridiculous he looked extremely worried doc savage asked how do they claim the robberies were executed as vice president of my concern which deals in heavy industrial and oilfield machinery i handled a lot of executive matters charles moore explained there are many occasions where i could sign the wrong kind of a bill of sale or lease or other document and steal a large sum in the company files they claim they have found a lot of such papers one example is a bunch of receipts for money paid out and no merchandise was received the money went into my pocket they claim it does look logical but im no crook i hate crooks doc savages voice was quiet intended to restore the mans confidence in himself how about those spells of coma somewhat like sleep from which you have suffered doc asked charles moore stared at him in astonishment how did you know about those you have had them oh yes do you know a man named dr nedden why yes i do and do you have a drink with dr nedden now and then yes renny renwick leaped up and slammed a fist into a palm bellowing this tears it this tears it right up the middle i see the guts of the thing now sit down or theyll hear you in china long tom snapped we all see it now renny subsided charles moore didnt know that he had once been a criminal none of the graduates knew that about themselves charles moore did not even know the purpose of the strange institution in upstate new york where he had received his training nor did he know its exact location charles moore must not renny knew be told of his past or the unorthodox method that had been used to change him from a criminal to an honest man it would do charles moore no good and it might saddle his mind with a worry that would hamper him through the rest of his life doc savage told charles moore the thing for you to do is go back and give yourself up to the police we are going to do our best to straighten out this mess shall i tell them about this meeting with you doc nodded it will do no harm yes tell them but do not tell them where the interview took place charles moore departed not a little relieved a devilish scheme renny said when they were alone that fiend dr nedden somehow learned the identity of a group of the men we have made honest by brain operations he worked on those men with drugs got them to perpetrate crimes which they did not know they were doing and now he is saddling the whole thing on us long tom looked at doc asked doc do you suppose nedden is the brains behind it the bronze man did not seem to hear the question which was a rather aggravating eccentricity of his when he did not wish to answer an inquiry renny and long tom had seen him do it many times before they did not put the question again knowing it would get no response long tom said finally we know how that letter from monk came to happen anyway they drugged him he signed it when he was drugged renny nodded agreed that is why they kept him alive what about ham when do we put sam joseph back in his place doc savage looked as if he was worried about ham chapter xiii kill order ham brooks was a little worried about himself he had played the part of sam joseph recuperating operation victim with complete success for some hours now the success was so complete that it was contributing to hams worry nothing had happened so that he could prove to himself that he could get away with it he did not like the looks of the medicine dr nedden was mixing either medicine was something ham didnt want dr nedden approached heres your little tonic for the day he said i dont feel as if i need anything ham said hurriedly oh but you must build up your strength this will just make you rest comfortably and sleep a little ham felt more kindly toward the stuff sleep eh well if he was asleep it would be that much easier to get away with this thing he drank the stuff it tasted as if they had drowned a cat in it about a month ago and forgot to remove the remains he was a little astonished at the speed with which he became sleepy it was sure potent stuff not unpleasant though he remembered thinking that and then he was able to think of no more dr nedden bent over ham and said sam sam can you hear me there was no response from the figure on the bed dr nedden rolled back hams eyelids and examined the reaction of the eyes to the beam of a small flashlight which he splashed into them he seemed satisfied fully under he remarked dr nedden then went into the kitchen of the elaborate penthouse layout and from there into an excellent and bizarre considering that it was on top of a skyscraper imitation of a french wine cellar this was well stocked with imported wines and champagnes selecting a wickercovered jug labeled as a wine dr nedden separated this the gut had been cut in the middle the two halves fitting together inside the wicker covering he took a brass devil image out of this having carried the thing back to the room where ham lay dr nedden placed the image on the table and turned on a thermal switch by holding a lighted match against the devils left ear the switch evidently operated as a thermostat functions there was a click and a radio apparatus began humming as it warmed up inside the thing dr nedden took hold of the thing pressed on a spot where there was a concealed button said all right you can come up now and bring the papers be right up the devil said but with the voice of butch the meeklooking man butch came in looking very subdued and sheeplike in blue suit black shoes and a stiff collar he had a brief case under an arm and wore a pair of rimless spectacles he was altogether benign good afternoon he said gently you need new batteries in that devil doctor your signal comes in very weak you may want to contact someone at the other end of the city sometime and they will not be able to hear you thanks said dr nedden shortly furthermore i would suggest you dispose of the devil added butch the thing nearly got us into trouble once when you insisted on having it talk to poor sam joseph to further convince him he was mentally unbalanced and needed a brain operation suppose doc savage had gotten the real statue containing the transceiver that day instead of the fake one which he did finally get savages suspicions would have been aroused oh stop harping on it dr nedden snapped savage didnt get the real one and he operated on sam joseph and all those witnessing doctors saw that he had made a mistake and that gave us the foothold we needed to start accusing him butch shrugged and placed his brief case on the table he removed several documents together with a fountain pen here they are he said that the last of them dr nedden demanded sure this finishes up cleaning out montague ogden these papers prove that sam joseph bought or rather pretended to buy a large quantity of stock which he proceeded to carry on the books of the concern the stock being actually nonexistent will prove sam joseph shystered his boss out of a fortune the checks of course have already been signed by sam joseph two weeks ago when he was under the effects of the drug and cashed the boss has the money all we need now is these few papers to help clinch the blame on sam dr nedden grinned waved an arm there he is go to it butch seated himself beside the bed it was obvious that he had gone through the routine many times before because he leaned forward took hams hand and said sam sam hear me sam do as you are told here is a fountain pen take it and hold it take the pen sam hams hand then moved vaguely finally grasped the pen in writing position butch said write write sam sign your name sign it sam joseph sam joseph ham wrote the signature butch repeated this painstakingly with the other documents got all of them signed fine he said now you wont need to dope him up any more were all shaped up dr nedden looked much relieved you think everything is fine then butch nodded sure all hunky savage hasnt made any progress whatever we just hit him with everything and hit him so fast that he hasnt been able to get his head above water he was tricked into that operation that stunned him we had him framed before he knew it dr nedden said that operation on sam joseph here was risky i still dont think it was worth the risk you dont why dammit that was the crowning touch that was what will convict doc savage thats what theyll electrocute him for i dont understand butch whipped out a paper which bore typed lines look here is what the morning newspapers will carry the typing said why did savage operate on sam joseph sam joseph is a man who was formerly an amnesia victim he is a man who has no idea who he was in his youth all the embezzlers in this case are the same none of them remember back past a certain day did doc savage operate on the brains of all these men did he make them crooks did he take their loot from them did they work for him did savage operate on sam joseph in an attempt to hide the crime he had committed in operating on the mans brain dr nedden laughed and said i see it now the operation is the one thing that implicates doc savage directly in the affair sure butch very satisfied with himself and the world started to fold the documents which ham had just signed and place them with other papers in the brief case he froze he eyed the papers his eyes came out of their sockets a little look he croaked the signature aint his what this signature aint sam josephs signature butch yelled dr nedden leaped to the bed and rubbed hams face vigorously dislodging some of the wax makeup which doc had applied as disguise its not sam he gasped its ham brooks butch said dr nedden nearly went to pieces then he wrung his hands seemed wildly baffled then suddenly snatched up his hat and headed for the door in frenzied flight butch said none of that and produced a gun dr nedden came back butch ordered help me take this guy along but what dont ask baboon questions butch snarled grab him weve got to get out of here with him we may need a hostage somebody we can knock off if they dont stay off our trail they got out of the building a great deal faster than it seemed possible they could have managed it butch warned the rest of the gang the minor members who served as guards around the place all of them piled into cars from a nearby parking lot they went to the ordinarylooking brick apartment house west of central park butch ordered all of the men to wait outside preferably in nearby bars and to respond to a signal comprised of two short one long and two short blasts of an automobile horn butch and dr nedden carried ham who was still unconscious into the elevator at the sixteenth floor they got out and packed ham through one of the numerous doors marked dr morgan private hospital two men only were there and they were minor members of the gang wearing white malenurse suits and at the moment in a fright and carrying towels wrapped around pistols call a meeting butch snarled at them get everybody here this seemed to be the general headquarters of the gang the spot where conferences were held and in ordering the summoning of everybody butch apparently meant only those who held positions of responsibility in the organization men who considered it important that the other members did not become too familiar with their faces they began arriving they entered the outer reception rooms and changed to the surgical robes and masks which were their conference disguises butch was impatient with this mumbojumbo rome is burning he snarled and you guys fiddle with your faces the group was eventually gathered butch counted seven of them and the boss makes eight butch said but the boss wont be here butch produced the little statue of a devil a devil with chinese characteristics and placed it on a white operating table he switched the thing on let the tubes warm said into the microphone boss come in this is important he got no answer thats what i was afraid of he said and that doesnt make it look any better butch apparently held no more position of authority than any of the others because a man growled where do you get off calling a meeting and giving orders oh shut up butch said something has gone wrong he told them about the finding of ham brooks in place of sam joseph and pointed out hams unconscious body as proof of the story he informed them he did not know just what the unexpected discovery might mean but it was sure to be nothing healthy for them it meant at the least that doc savage was a lot closer to arriving at the truth than any of them expected the boss he reminded them had made a provision for a case like this if anything serious went wrong he told them we were to make a break for the boss southwestern ranch and stay there until the hounds quit howling until things blew over butch tried to get an answer out of the radio transceiver concealed in the devil statue and failed get going he directed you he told dr nedden will light out first with ham brooks here were taking him along as a hostage if we need him also when he comes out from under the effect of that hypnotic were damned sure going to find out how much doc savage knows dr nedden nodded he and another man got a stretcher on which they placed ham they carried him to the elevator and rode down they were alone the other men being busy getting rid of their masks and surgical robes at the lobby floor they bent to pick up the stretcher oh gasped dr nedden his eyes got wide montague ogden was standing there ogdens feet were well apart and his eyes narrow he wore a topcoat and from the way his hands rested in the pockets it was obvious they held guns oh repeated dr nedden uh hello boss montague ogden said so you know who you take orders from i yes yes of course dr nedden was uncomfortable after all it isnt much of a secret and your ranch of course we all know about that know we are to go there and keep out of sight if the breaks get too tough i see montague ogden said he did not seem angry and where are you going now to the ranch who gave those orders butch said nedden maliciously butch gave them hes becoming very officious i see officious eh montague ogden looked fierce well well see about that is everyone going to the ranch yes everyone monk mayfair is already being held there of course and were taking this other fellow ham brooks as a hostage if we need one then what then if we dont need monk or ham they can be killed montague ogden seemed to give the situation thought you two will go with me and bring ham he said we will take my private plane you can fly can you not dr nedden yes i can fly and you know where the ranch is yes yes of course then get going montague ogden snapped we will go together you two ham brooks and myself they got going for a man who was in command of a situation montague ogden seemed very strained and he took only one or the other of his hands from his pockets at a time never removing both hands chapter xiv king and joker doc savage drove his ambulance with care and concentration on the seat beside him sis harrison sat and watched with admiration you mean to tell me she said that you built a radio set small enough to enclose in the bandages on hams head from the back of the ambulance long tom said drive north awhile doc and better put on more speed the signal isnt too good doc said not a radio set just a transmitter a little oscillator powered with concentrated flashlight batteries which puts out a simple wave that can be traced with a direction finder its marvelous sis exclaimed the ambulance was one belonging to the hospital which doc savage controlled the one which he had employed in performing the unfortunate brain operation on sam joseph sam joseph was now back in that hospital to recuperate under an assumed name we have used the device before doc said there is nothing stupendous about it it will only work for a few hours not over a day it is only good for horizon distance because the wave length is so short it has several drawbacks i think its marvelous sis said long tom said go east again doc were getting a little closer to it rotary harrison bellowed i hope we catch up with him soon im getting tired of this chasing around i want to get my hands on somebody i want my hands on a throat quit bawling like a bull long tom said you are worse than monk doc asked long tom are you still in contact with renny yes i can hear his carrier wave tell him to keep somewhere above us but plenty high high enough that hell not be noticed k renny is bothered he says what if the civil air patrol or an army plane orders him down that is a chance we have to take doc said a plane is the only way of following if they take ham away in a plane sis saw that the bronze man was under an intense strain she understood his feelings it was at his suggestion that ham brooks had undertaken the job of pretending to be sam joseph now ham was in trouble or everything pointed to it as soon as ham had been moved as indicated by the shift of the little radio transmitter they had hurried to follow they had gotten uptown a little too late to intercept ham at the time he was stationary somewhere near central park and now they were trying to catch him feeling a change of subject would do doc good sis said you have five assistants have you not there are only four monk ham renny and long tom working with you this time but dont you have five yes five doc savage said the other is johnny william harper littlejohn the archaeologist and geologist he is in alaska where he is preparing some specimens long tom yelled in the back doc i think theyve got ham in a plane i think theyre just taking the air the plane was a bright cabin job they saw it flash overhead climbing steeply and caught a faint trace of its strong motor roar doc savage rapped long tom call renny down with our plane quick ive already called him down long tom said doc savage tramped on the brake wheeled the car to the right up a steep rutted road into a field the field was large and flat a meadow nearby was a hangar and a car parked in front of it an elderly man in coveralls stood in front of the hangar rolling a cigarette doc braked the car to a halt before the man demanded who owns the field reckon its me the man said easily he looked honest whose plane just took off private ship belongs to montague ogden the financier keeps it here had three friends with him one of them so sick he was on a stretcher head all bandaged know any of the friends one feller named dr nedden family physician of ogdens i think renny was down on the field now he was flying a fast cabin plane that was far from being the freak of speed in which they had made their earlier flight into the midwest this ship could hold its own with ogdens plane however renny taxied up in the ship they loaded in renny fed the cylinders gas and they took off long tom had brought his direction finder and he was feverishly setting it up this was the critical period and his manner showed it the little transmitter concealed on ham was weak and if it got out of range now they were lost when he picked up the signal his yell of delight startled everyone got it he bellowed head more south renny and fifteen minutes later renny was saying i can see the ship now what do we do overtake them keep back far enough not to be seen doc savage said we might as well find out where they are going rotary harrison looked disgusted at that always followin he snapped about time we was gettin our hands on some necks aint it doc made no comment long tom remarked there is an old chinese proverb that says snake is small because he suck egg fox is big because he wait and catch grown bird what kind of an answer is that rotary snarled it got dark and they followed the other plane several hours by radio alone after which the other ship landed they saw its landing lights streak out beams and these picked up a smooth field and came to a stop on it over georgia somewhere long tom said near the coast doc savage watched the plane lights below for a moment parachutes he said one man with me either one of you renny said match you to long tom and then lost they went over the side together and cracked open their chutes at once it was very dark clouds above and small chance of their being seen and probably their plane motor had not been heard because they could see that the engine of the ship below was still idling over and that would drown any sound from above doc called softly get out of the harness sure long tom said they squirmed and strained and unfastened the parachute harness snaps these were chutes from docs plane so they were equipped with a gadget which renny renwick had worked out for use by american parachute troopers a gadget for releasing themselves quickly from the encumbrance of a parachute harness so when they hit the ground they were instantly free and running they separated luck was with them the engine of ogdens plane was still turning and its coughing had covered the noise of their hitting the earth ogden and two men were standing in the glare of the plane landing light ogden had a gun in each hand the two men one of them dr nedden slowly put up their hands doc savage did not carry a gun never carried one if he could avoid it believing to carry one made you rely too much on a firearm and be lost without it he waited long tom had a gun a small machine pistol with a tremendous rate of fire long tom walked into the glare of landing lights presented the muzzle of his machine pistol said this little gun puts out a million bullets a minute montague ogden turned slowly he looked at long tom he inspected doc savage ive been a hell of a fool ogden said he tossed his guns on the ground and im a very puzzled man he added doc said puzzled ogden nodded for some reason or other these three men seem to think i am their leader i am nothing of the sort it puzzles me no one said anything finally ogden added i tricked them into bringing me down here from new york thinking they would lead me to their headquarters he stared at them i became scared he finished i am very glad you came along while renny landed the plane containing rotary and sis harrison doc savage tied dr nedden and the other man then doc examined ham and found him unharmed but very groggy able to mutter only that they had given him some kind of a damned shot of something he sounded weakly indignant they listened to ogdens story it was the story of a man who had been duped a man who had inherited his wealth and had always had other men manage it for him a man who knew little or nothing about business but who liked to put on a big show liked to impress people with his wealth the flamboyant ogden building was an example a man of close loyalties of intense friendships a man who would sacrifice for his friends and liked to fight for them i was intensely worried about sam josephs mental troubles said montague ogden it was dr nedden i realize now who convinced me you would be the man to operate and then you did operate and there was no brain tumor how did that happen anywaydoc savage was uncomfortable in the darkness i was outsmarted doc confessed at my own game they had imitated the symptoms of cerebral fibroma so skillfully that i was completely taken in that must have taken a clever doctor ogden said it did nedden is clever i think we will find he has other clever doctors working with him montague ogden sighed explosively they are all clever he said so much smarter than i am but i became suspicious finally who wouldnt after i found that sam joseph apparently had been looting my company i knew sam would not do a thing like that my true friends do not doublecross me that is one wonderful fact i have learned about human nature i became suspicious too late my indignation and it was righteous indignation i assure you even if egged on by dr nedden about the operation mistake had already touched off the newspaper publicity i made a terrible fool of myself there but you must understand i did that because i thought sam joseph my closest friend had been wronged doc savage said you made that clear enough and it was understandable under the circumstances montague ogden sounded grateful i have been shadowing them he explained following them around and that was how i happened to track them to an apartment house near central park i was waiting downstairs not knowing what to do when dr nedden and this man came out with the stretcher and what i thought was poor sam joseph on the stretcher i confronted them imagine my astonishment when i found they thought i was their leader he sounded bewildered they said they were going to my ranch he said i havent got a ranch i own lots of things but no place like that but they landed here and i didnt know what to do and then you landed and im glad he groaned i imagine you thought i was the leader too he concluded you must have thought i was the king and now you find im only a silly gullible pawn the joker you are probably disgusted doc savage asked the ranch is near here yes i dont know exactly where though is this the ranch flying field no montague ogden said but there is one i made dr nedden land on this meadow telling him i did not want the others to know we were here i told him i wanted to sneak up on butch who has been becoming too officious nedden knows where the flying field and the ranch is yes without exchanging a word renny and long tom fell on dr nedden clubbed him to the ground and announced they were going to dispose of him then and there if he did not tell them where the ranch was located there was nothing ridiculous about their performance although they admitted later it should have been they sounded so utterly convincing they sold a bill of goods please nedden gasped ill tell you the ranch was about two miles and a half distant along a country road which bordered one edge of this meadow far enough that they didnt hear us land probably sis harrison said with relief rotary harrison growled lets get going i want my hands on somebodys neck and quick just a moment doc savage said the bronze man went to their plane his own ship the one which renny had just landed in the cabin there were equipment cases in special racks and he selected one of these he carried the case to the others he exhibited the contents a new type of grenade he explained a new gas one against which no mask is effective extremely potent acting almost instantaneously renny looked at the grenades and seemed startled holy cow doc but we are each going to take some doc explained interrupting quickly here we will divide them how dyou work the gadgets rotary asked pull this key out twist the key doc savage corrected you will find that it seems to wind like an alarm clock twist it up tight then get rid of it throw it as you would an ordinary grenade whats the idea of the winding the peculiar internal construction which was necessary oh rotary said i see another one of your gadgets chapter xv satans ranch they left dr nedden montague ogden and the other crook behind doc savage used a hypodermic needle on them and they were almost immediately asleep they would remain that way for some time until noon the following day at the least renny dragged them off in the tall weeds where they would not be likely to be found before then montague ogden did not object to being drugged and left behind i expect you to suspect me he said i see how you could not conceive of a man being as big a fool as ive been walking away long tom remarked you know i halfway think hes innocent oh hell snorted rotary harrison next thing youll be thinking toads have wings ham brooks went with them he was rapidly regaining his equilibrium he stripped off his bandages which contained the little radiowave transmitter and had salvaged the gadget when sis insisted she would like to have it as a souvenir of an incredibly fantastic adventure ham gave it to her which somewhat irritated long tom it was long toms device having covered about a mile they heard a series of three planes approach from the north and land in the night far ahead of them they saw by looking up the faint glow of landing lights reflected against the very low clouds the gang arriving renny rumbled the way i understand it the whole kit and kaboodle will be there what a chance to make a roundup they pushed forward more rapidly dust was thick on the country road a soft pad for their footfalls light appeared ahead electric glow around low buildings the structures seemed to be made of logs and slabs in keeping with the piny woods around them and there was the excited barking of dogs which seemed to be confined to a fenced enclosure doc savage said we had better close in immediately while the dogs are still barking otherwise the animals might give an alarm good idea rotary agreed whats the plan of campaign we will get a little closer doc said and look over the place rotary stopped sis he said you go back but dad sis objected i may be able to help youre a girl an but im not scared at least im not going to go to piece rotary was suddenly harsh you go back he said im not going to have a daughter of mine mixed up in the kind of a thing this is going to be i better go back sis doc said someone should be free and clear to go for help if we fail sis finally consented all right if you insist she agreed they left her in the darkness and went on moving with increasing care sis had been so disappointed at being left behind that they were silent they were quite close to the ranch buildings when long tom spoke in a whisper sis sure hated to miss out on this he said doc said it was necessary rotary harrison was suddenly confronting them you bet it was necessary he snarled he had a gun and a flashlight he menaced them with the gun wouldnt do for her to know what a hell cat her old man is rotary said he splashed glare from the flashlight on them men came running from the ranch get butch rotary snarled at the man i dont want no more mistakes about whos boss of this thing they took doc savage renny and long tom and ham into a long low room with beamed ceilings and native fieldstone fireplaces at each end a room where saddles and bridles hung ropes and spurs steer horns and buffalo horns all the stuff that goes into a phony ranch setup get back get back rotary harrison kept snarling at his men dont get close to these hombres no tellin what theyll pull he pushed back his men bodily and they made a large circle around the prisoners careful they got more tricks than a centipede has legs he warned he bellowed out a laugh i oughta know i been their shadow for two days doc savage said you went to a lot of trouble rotary rotary harrison laughed hell yes and why not he asked ive spent the best months of my life to say nothing of what money i had left in the world working this out it was complete he waved an arm added it was complete even to this little hideout here which i bought and recorded in montague ogdens name doc said and while you were committing the robberies you included yourself what could have been finer who would suspect a robbed man particularly doc savage said one who came to me for help thats the idea and one who has an innocent daughter doc suggested that hit rotary harrison where it hurt the smirk slid off his face the lips off his teeth she dont know about it he said thats why i didnt want her to come along it was still in the room light in the place came from electric bulbs in oxyoke and oldfashioned lantern devices and from a few false candles the men stood tense none of them looked at ease running his gaze over them doc savage picked out two men who were doctors he knew they were doctors without recalling their names but hed seen their faces before they were cerebrologists or specialists on the human brain they were not prominent men yet skilled enough to help in perpetrating the gigantic hoax that had been pulled they were crooks certainly doc looked at their leader rotary harrison said you could have saved a lot of your elaborate scheming rotary stared huh it was needless smoke screen doc said what the hell do you mean mean you were wise to me doc said you made a few mistakes first when you were captured on the mississippi river you were not killed you were kept alive there was no reason whatever for you being kept alive particularly when you insisted your friend duster jones had been killed because he knew too much you had yourself seized to arouse my interest and it did arouse my interest particularly in the phony aspect of it again your business of a loan renewal agreement with sam joseph was a false note sam joseph recognized you but he did not make any loanrenewal agreement with you in talking to you which you said he did and also doc continued you were in a position to know about all the companies and concerns which were robbed in the course of this thing all of them were companies with which you would be familiar charles moores oilfield machinery concern for example you are an oilman you would naturally know more about how to rob an oilfield machinery concern and the same thing applied to the rest of your victims there was too much coincidence rotary grinned so there was too much coincidence so what so we were able to beat you at your own game game deceit doc savage said what kind of nutty talk is that you doc savage jumped then he moved with abrupt violence taking the two men holding him completely by surprise he was not able to seize a weapon but he was able to get free to leap and reach a stairway that seemed to go down into a cellar a window was near but he ignored that hit on his stomach slid to the stairs went down them renny long tom and ham began struggling violently but with no effect rotary harrison bellowed hes in the cellar theres no way out give me one of those grenades he meant the trick grenades which doc savage had so carefully distributed with explanations about their deadly gas contents before the raid on the ranch rotary grabbed up one of the grenades he ran to the cellar opening get ready to slam the door shut after i throw this egg down there he snarled ready one of his men said seizing the door for the benefit of doc savage down below rotary bellowed you said wind the key like an alarm clock didnt you he wound the key instantly there were explosions all over the room all through the ranchhouse wherever the trick grenades happened to be all coming together they were not loud reports but there was a guttural violence about the way they let go and the gas they spewed was sickening paralyzing blinding if you inhaled it doc savage came up out of the cellar lets finish this job he said what rotary and none of his men knew and what none of them ever did find out was that by winding the key on the grenades you wound a powerful little generator the size of a watch and the current from this through vacuum tubes not as large as a peanut was amplified and put out in an impulse that would effect tiny receivers and these would explode the grenades each grenade contained receiver and transmitter but they were not complicated because they employed the same circuit wind the key in one grenade and they would all explode as soon as rotary harrison had wound the key renny and long tom and ham knowing all the grenades would let go now began to fight the gas was not effective unless breathed so they held their breathing back renny and long tom did it very successfully but ham almost immediately got hit in the stomach the blow to hams middle was terrific and it opened up his mouth and he had gascharged air into his lungs before he could help himself he began to yell in pain with the other men and fell to the floor there was nothing deadly about the gas but it was very painful and brought quick unconsciousness not that it did the recipient any benefit doc heard monk monks bellowing even when he was gagged was distinctive doc located the sound headed for it through a door across a room through another door there was a small tight shed stacked high with litter old camp stools and tent poles mostly and monk floundering around in the middle of it monk was doing his bellowing entirely through his nose which was remarkable he was making about the same amount of noise as a good trumpet although it was hardly musical doc stopped slashed his bindings monk bolted to his feet evidently he had been kicking around enough that his muscles were not stiff because he was up and out of the door in a streak still making nasal noise of remarkable quantity doc went back into the connecting room found a window he remembered to yell anaesthetic gas at monk by way of warning then doc smashed open the window thrust out his head and got fresh air into his lungs then he turned and met rotary harrison in some fashion astonishment must have stopped the mans breathing until he realized what had happened rotary had escaped the gas his face was purple bloated from holding his breath doc tried to belt the wind out of harrison so he would have to breathe it was not a success rotary piled out into the night doc followed caught him they went to the ground rotary was strong and desperate he was not a young man but the iron of his muscle was astonishing monk mayfair entering the big room saw no one in motion only men motionless on the floor he knew there was gas he could feel the slight sting of the stuff against his eyes he saw ham and he was horrified until he discovered ham merely seemed to be gassed monk went on he could hear fighting a few shots well in the rear of the house he headed for the spot hey somebody said rotary it was dark in the hall monk stopped he recognized the voice butch yeah monk said this way we can get to a plane sure monk said he moved rapidly and pushed along behind the other man until they came to a lighted room it was butch all right butch slim and pale and delicatelooking the meekly helplesslooking person monk took butch by the neck its a shame to waste time on a spindlin little guy like you monk said you oughta ow ow monks greatest pride was what he could do in a handtohand fight he liked to brawl knockdowndragout anything goes biteanear gougeaneye he had never confessed to anyone but he took regular lessons in rough and tumble in jujitsu and had even hired an osteopath doctor to teach him how to twist bones so as to hurt the most he thought he was very good he began to get an education he was hit twice he didnt know exactly where but the agony was awful stars exploded pain made his toes feel as if they were falling off he managed and he thought he was lucky to do that to fall on butch they went over and over bones cracked muscles popped joints cracked ow monk bawled owwww he felt sure he was rapidly being separated from arms legs ears hair nose somewhere in the back of the house renny renwick yelled a gang of them are killing monk come on but when renny appeared in the door he stopped he began to grin uncontrollably then to knot up with laughter long tom joined him he too thought it was funny get ham brooks renny gurgled pour water on ham or something to wake him up ham cant miss this ham would give years off his life to see this monk and his tiny opponent went through a convulsion monk emitted fresh bellows of pain he was suddenly not enjoying the fight he had often in the past tackled a dozen men who were fighting men and howled in glee through the whole fray now he was suddenly out of glee oh oh oh monk squalled we better stop it renny said before he eats monk alive he went over and tapped butch on the head with a revolver barrel butch collapsed monk rolled feebly crawling away from the senseless butch as if the latter was a tarantula monk tried to get to his feet failed collapsed sat there foolishly monk stared at the feeblelooking butch my my monk said and to think theres only one of him chapter xvi truth and varnish the head of the new york state police and the district attorney from new york city who had been assigned to the case arrived a few hours after daylight explanations and arguments pro and con and the taking of statements occupied about three hours the d a made the speech of summary officially he said there has been no proof presented that mr savage maintains any kind of an institution where criminal brains are operated upon whatever our personal opinions may be they probably will remain officially inactive because of lack of such proof personally the idea of treating criminals in that way seems a good idea to me ham brooks asked what about all this stink in the newspapers doc explained when it is proven that the whole thing was simply a cleverly thoughtout and executed scheme to pick a bunch of men who had been ah amnesia victims in the past and drug them and force them to commit crimes while drugged then lay it all on to me when that is all proven the newspapers will drop their campaign and apologize no doubt ham said they better apologize or therell be the fattest goblin of a lawsuit after each one of them the new york district attorney checked over a list of prisoners we have checked and rechecked the list of prisoners he said and from the statements of the other prisoners we seem to be one short the man who was the ringleader a man by the name of rotary harrison doc savage spoke quietly rotary harrison the bronze man said was badly injured he was sent to a private hospital can you turn him over to us when he is fit doc nodded yes he said but rotary harrison will not be proven the criminal leader i am afraid what do you mean it will probably develop doc savage said quietly that rotary harrison was just another one of the list of victims who like myself were framed to be the goats but all the stolen money and property is in his name the d a pointed out doc shook his head rotary harrison is turning all the property back to the rightful owners the d a watched the bronze man for a while then he grinned well that fellow butch will make a good master mind he said well hang it onto him he got his papers together and went outside to watch the prisoners being loaded into cars the moment doc was alone with monk and the others the bronze man said monk get to our plane get your portable chemical lab whats the idea rotary harrison doc explained is going to our upstate place for an operation that will wipe out all his memory of the past i want you to mix an anaesthetic that will keep him unconscious during the trip yes i know that monk said but what was the idea of telling the d a that rotary was just another victim of the plot when you know perfectly well he was the brains behind the whole thing thats right doc said and thats principally the reason i want to send him to the college you see rotary planned this master crime himself and he hired all the others he was not only plotting to steal several million dollars but he was going to discredit us and our life work with the public the first thing he did was to get hold of dr nedden and that young fellow butch the two of them traced down some of our graduates drugged them stole all the money from the firms they worked for and when the big blowup came they were going to say that we were responsible for the crimes because we had performed brain operations on them the big scheme behind rotarys mind was that he would have us trapped and then he could force us to pay blackmail or see the work of our college destroyed monk grunted blackmail eh i guess he was figuring to cut himself a big slice of our central american gold supply doc nodded yes that was his plan he was so clever about it that only one man in the organization knew who their leader really was that man was butch he was the one who hired all the others including dr nedden and they all got their instructions through that little devil statue which in reality was only a tiny transmitting and receiving set where is rotary now renny asked out in the bush where i hid him doc explained monk looked puzzled i still dont understand why youre covering rotary up from the police i think renny gave monk a kick and said come on you dope monk followed renny outside whats got into doc he said rotary was the leader and possibly renny suggested dryly doc is suffering from a slight attack of your chronic trouble huh sis harrison renny said in other words she doesnt know her dad was the kingfish in this affair oh oh monk grinned now ive run across something i can understand the end
