there had been no mail for me in the three weeks id been renting that tiny secondfloor suite of offices near oxford street i closed the door of the outer eight by ten office skirted the table and chair that might one day house a receptionist if the time ever came that cavell investigations could run to such glamorous extras and pushed open the door marked private behind that door lay the office of the head of cavell investigations pierre cavell me and not only the head but the entire staff it was a bigger room than the reception office i knew that because id measured it but only a trained surveyor could have told it with the naked eye im no sybarite but i had to admit that it was a pretty bleak sort of place the distempered walls were of that delicate tint of offgrey pastel shading from offwhite at floor level to offblack just below the ceiling that only london fog and the neglect of years can achieve in one wall overlooking a narrow grimy courtyard was a tall narrow window washed on the inside with a monthly calendar close by on the linoleumcovered floor a square desk not new a swivel chair for me a padded leather armchair for the client a strip of threadbare carpet to keep the clients feet from getting cold a hat rack and a couple of green metal filing cabinets both empty nothing more there was no room for anything more i was just lowering myself into the swivel chair when i heard the deep double chime of the bell in the receptionroom and the sound of hinges creaking ring and enter the legend on the corridor door read and someone was doing just that ringing and entering i opened the top lefthand drawer of my desk pulled out some papers and envelopes scattered them before me pulled a switch by my knee and had just risen to my feet when the knock came at my inner door the man who entered was tall thin and a close student of the tailor and cutter a narrowlapelled coat hung over an immaculately cut charcoal suit in the latest italian line and in his suedegloved left hand he carried his other glove black bowler briefcase and a few inches up his wrist a tightlyrolled hornhandled black umbrella he had a long pale narrow face thin black hair parted in the middle and brushed almost straight back rimless glasses an aquiline nose and on the upper lip a thin black line that on closer inspection still looked like a thin black line miniaturisation of the moustache brought to an almost impossible state of perfection he must have carried a micrometer about with him he looked for all the world like a topflight city accountant i couldnt see him as anything else excuse my walking straight in like this he smiled briefly three gold caps in the upper teeth and halfglanced over his shoulder but it seems your secretary thats all right please come in he even talked like an accountant controlled positive slightly overprecise in the articulation he offered me his hand and the handshake too was in character quick neat giving nothing away martin he introduced himself henry martin mr pierre cavell yes wont you sit down mr martin thank you he sat down gingerly very straight feet together briefcase balanced with scrupulous care across his touching knees and looked around him slowly missing nothing a faint smile not showing his teeth business not ah so very brisk these days mr cavell maybe he wasnt an accountant after all accountants as a rule are polite wellmannered and slow to give unnecessary offence but then maybe he wasnt feeling quite himself people who came to see private detectives were seldom hi a normal frame of mind i keep it this way to fool the inspector of taxes i explained how can i help you mr martin by giving me some information about yourself he was no longer smiling and his eyes were no longer wandering about myself my voice was sharp not razoredged just the voice of a man who hasnt had a client in all the three weeks hes been in business please come to the point mr martin i have things to do so i had lighting my pipe reading the morning paper things like that im sorry but about yourself i have you in mind for a very delicate and difficult mission i must be sure you are the man i want that is reasonable i think mission i looked speculatively at henry martin and thought i could get to disliking him without too much trouble dont carry out missions mr martin i carry out investigations of course when there are investigations to carry out the tone was too neutral to take specific offence perhaps i should supply the information please bear with my unusual method of approach for a few minutes mr cavell i think i can promise that you will not be sorry he opened his briefcase brought out a buff folder abstracted a stiff sheet of paper and began to read paraphrasing as he went along pierre cavell born lisieux calvados of anglofrench parents father civil engineer john cavell of kingsclere hampshire mother annemarie lechamps of lisieux mother of francobelgian descent one sister liselle both parents and sister killed in air attack on rouen escaped fishingboat deauvillenewhaven while still in late teens parachuted six times into northern france each time brought back information of great value parachuted into normandy dday minus two at end war recommended for no fewer than six decorations three british two french and one belgian henry martin looked up and smiled thinly the first discordant note decorations refused some quotation to the effect that the war had aged you fast and that you were too old to play with toys joined regular british army rose to major in intelligence corps understood to have cooperated closely with mi counterespionage i believe then joined police why did you leave the army mr cavell id throw him out later right now i was too intrigued how much more did he know and how i said poor prospects you were cashiered again the brief smile when a junior officer elects to strike a senior officer policy dictates that he should choose a man below field rank you had the poor judgement to select a majorgeneral he glanced at the paper again joined metropolitan police rapid rise through the ranks one must admit that you do appear to be rather gifted in your own line to position of inspector in last two years seconded for special duties nature unspecified but we can guess and then you resigned correct correct on a record card resigned looks much better man dismissed which is what you would have been had you remained another twentyfour hours you do appear to have what amounts to a genius for insubordination something to do with an assistant commissioner i understand but you still had friends quite powerful friends within a week of your resignation you had been appointed as head of security in mordon i stopped what i was doing which was squaring off the papers on my desk and said quietly details of my record are readily available if you know where to look but you have no right to possess that last item of information the morden microbiological research establishment in wiltshire had a security rating that would have made access to the kremlin seem simple i am perfectly aware of that mr cavell i possess a great number of items of information that i shouldnt like the additional item that i know that in keeping with your record you were also dismissed from this post like yet another item the real reason why i am here today i know why you were dismissed the accuracy of my first deduction in the detecting business that my client was an accountant spoke ill for my prospects henry martin wouldnt have recognised a balance sheet if it had been handed to him on a silver salver i wondered what his line of business might really be but i couldnt even begin to guess you were dismissed from mordon martin went on precisely primarily because you couldnt keep a still tongue in your head oh nothing to do with security we know that he removed his rimless glasses and polished them thoughtfully after fifteen years in your line you probably dont even tell yourself half of what you know but you talked to top scientists directors in mordon and you made no secret of your opinion of the nature of the work in which they were engaged you are not the first person to comment bitterly on the fact that this establishment referred to in parliamentary estimates as the mordon health centre is controlled exclusively by the war office you knew of course that mordon is concerned mainly with the invention and production of microbiological organisms for use in war but you are one of the few who know just how ghastly and terrifying are the weapons that have been perfected there that armed with those weapons a few planes could utterly destroy all life in any country in the space of a few hours you had very strong opinions about the indiscriminate use of such a weapon against an unsuspecting and innocent civilian population and you made your opinion known in many places and to many people inside mordon too many places too many people so today you are a private detective lifes unjust i agreed i rose to my feet crossed to the door turned the key in the lock and pocketed it you must realise mr martin that you have already said too much the sources of your information about my activities at mordon youre not leaving here till you tell me martin sighed and replaced his spectacles melodramatic understanding but totally unnecessary do you take me for a fool cavell do i look a fool what i told you i had to tell you to gain your cooperation i will put my cards on the table quite literally he drew out a wallet found a rectangle of ivory cardboard and placed it on the table mean anything to you it meant a great deal across the middle of the card ran the legend council for world peace at the bottom righthand corner henry martin london secretary martin pulled his chair close and leaned forward his forearms on my desk his face was intent serious of course you know about it mr cavell i dont think i exaggerate when i say that it is by far the greatest force for good in the world today our council cuts across race religion and politics you will have heard that our prime minister and most members of the cabinet belong i do not wish to comment on that but i can state that most of the church dignitaries in britain whether protestant catholic or jewish are members our list of titled members reads like debretts of other distinguished members like whos who the foreign office who really know whats going on and are more afraid than any are solidly on our side we have the support of all the best the wisest the most farseeing men in the country today i have very powerful men behind me mr cavell he smiled faintly we even have influential members in mordon all he said i knew to be true except that bit about mordon and maybe that had to be true to account for his knowledge i wasnt a member of the council myself not being the right type for inclusion either in debretts or whos who but i knew that the council for world peace a society semisecret in its nature inasmuch as it recognised that diplomatic negotiations were best not conducted through newspaper headlines was of only the most recent origin but already regarded through the western world as the last best hope for mankind martin took the card from me and slipped it back in his wallet ah i am trying to say is that i am a respectable man working for a preeminently respectable body i believe that i said thank you he dipped into his briefcase again and brought out a steel container about the size and shape of a hipflask there is mr cavell a militarist clique in this country of whom we are frankly terrified who promise to wreck all our dreams and hopes madmen who are talking every day more loudly of waging a preventive war against the soviet union germ warfare it is highly unlikely that they will win their way but it is against the most unlikely contingencies that we have to be most warily on our guard he spoke like a man who had rehearsed his speech a hundred times against this bacteriological assault there could and would be no defence a vaccine against this virus has been developed after two years of the most intensive research but the only supplies in the world are in mordon he paused hesitated then pushed the flask across the table to me a statement that is no longer quite accurate this flask was removed from mordon three days ago the contents can be cultured to produce sufficient vaccine to immunise any nation on earth we are our brothers keepers mr cavell i stared at him i said nothing please take this at once to this address in warsaw he pushed a slip of paper across the table you will be paid a hundred pounds now all expenses and a hundred pounds on your return a delicate mission i realise perhaps even a dangerous one although in your case i should not think so we have investigated you very carefully mr cavell you are reputed to know the byways of europe as a taxidriver knows the streets of london i do not foresee that frontiers will present you with much difficulty and my antiwar sympathies i murmured of course of course the first trace of impatience we had to check most carefully you realise that you had the best allover qualifications you were the only choice well now i murmured this is flattering and interesting i dont know what you mean he said brusquely will you do it mr cavell no no his face became very still you say no this then is the extent of your precious concern about your fellowmen all this talk in mordon you said yourself that my business wasnt very brisk i interrupted i havent had a client for three weeks for all indications to the contrary i wont have one for three months and i added you said yourself i was the only choice the thin mouth twisted in a sneer you dont positively refuse to go then i dont positively refuse how much two hundred and fifty pounds each way your last word thats it mind if i say something cavell the man was losing his manners yes i mind keep your speeches and moralities for your council this is a business deal he stared at me for a long moment eyes hostile behind thick glasses then reached again into his briefcase and brought out five flat packets of treasury notes laid them neatly on the table before him and glanced up at me two hundred and fifty pounds exactly maybe the london branch of the council should get itself a new secretary i suggested was it myself or the council that was to be defrauded of the extra ј neither the tone came with the eyes glacial both of them he didnt like me we offered a fair price but in a matter of such importance were prepared to meet extortion take your money after youve taken off the rubber bands stacked the notes together and counted them out fifty fivers in front of my eyes my god the cool meticulous speech had gone and something almost savage came to take its place no wonder you were kicked out of so many jobs he ripped off the bands stacked the notes and counted them off separately there you are fifty satisfied satisfied i opened my righthand drawer picked up the notes address and flask dropped them into the drawer and closed it just as martin was finishing the securing of the straps on his briefcase something in the atmosphere maybe an extra stillness from my side of the table caused him to look up sharply and then he became as immobile as myself except for his eyes which continued to widen until they seemed to take up all space behind the rimless glasses its a gun all right i assured him a japanese hanyatti nineshot automatic safetycatch off and indicator i observe registering full dont worry about the scotch tape over tire mouth of the barrel thats only to protect a highly delicate mechanism the bullet behind will go through it itll go through you and if you had a twin brother sitting behind you it would go through him also your forearms on the table he put his forearms on the table he kept pretty still which is the way people usually do when theyre peering down into the barrel from a distance of three feet but his eyes had gone back to normal quickly and he didnt seem all that worried that i could notice this troubled me for if any man had the right to be worried it was henry martin maybe this made henry martin a very dangerous man you have an unusual way of conducting business cavell no shake in the voice just a dry contempt what is this a holdup dont be silly and dont you wish it were i already have your money you asked me earlier if i took you for a fool the time and circumstances didnt seem right for an immediate answer but i can give it to you now you are a fool youre a fool because you forgot that i worked in mordon i was security chief there and the first job of any security chief is to know what goes on in his own bailiwick im afraid i dont understand you will this vaccine here its designed to give immunity against which particular virus im only an agent for the council for world peace it doesnt matter what matters is that all the vaccines up till now have been made and stored exclusively in horder hall essex the point is that if that flask came from mordon it contains no vaccine it probably contains one or other of the viruses secondly i know that it is normally impossible for any man council for world peace sympathiser or not to take top secret viruses out of mordon no matter how clever or surreptitious he is when the last man has left the laboratories fourteen hour time clocks come into operation and the opening combination overriding those is known to only two men if anything has been taken it has been taken by force and violence that demands an immediate investigation thirdly you said the foreign office was solidly on your side if thats the case why all this cloakanddagger approach to me to smuggle vaccine through the diplomatic bag to warsaw is the obvious answer finally and your biggest blunder my friend you forgot the fact that i have been engaged in one form or other of counterespionage for quite some time every new body or organisation thats set up in britain automatically comes under the microscope as did the council for world peace when it set up its headquarters here i know one of the members an elderly stout bald and shortsighted character who is the complete antithesis to you in every way his name is henry martin and hes the secretary of the london branch of the council the real one he looked at me steadily for a few moments not scared his forearms still resting on the table then said quietly there doesnt seem to be much more left to say does there not much what are you going to do turn you over to the special branch with you goes a tape of our conversation just as a routine precaution i switched on a recorder before you came into this room not evidence i know but the address flask and your thumbprint on fifty fivers will be all the evidence they require it does look as if i made a mistake about you he admitted we can do a deal i cant be bought not at least for fifty miserable fivers a pause then softly five hundred no a thousand a thousand pounds cavell inside the hour keep quiet i reached over the phone laid the receiver on the table and began to dial with my left forefinger id reached the third number when a sharp knock came to my office door i let the receiver lie and got to my feet making no noise the corridor door had been shut when martin had come into my room no one could open that corridor door without the bell chiming id heard no chime there had been no chime but somebody was in the outer office now just outside my door martin was smiling it wasnt much of a smile but it was there i didnt like it i moved my gun and said softly face into that corner martin hands clasped behind your neck i dont think thats necessary he said calmly that man outside the door is a mutual friend do it now i said he did i crossed to the door standing well to one side and called out whos there police cavell open up please police the word carried familiar overtones but then there were a great number of people around who were able to imitate a great number of voices i glanced at martin but he hadnt moved i called out your credentials under the door with them there was a movement on the other side of the door then an oblong cardboard slid into view on the floor no badge no credentials nothing like that just a calling card bearing the words d r hardanger and a whitehall telephone number the number of people who knew that this was the only form of identification that superintendent hardanger used would be very few and the card matched the voice i unlocked and opened the door superintendent hardanger it was big burly redfaced with the jowls of a bulldog dressed in the same faded grey raglan and black bowler that hed worn in all the years id worked with him i caught a glimpse of a smaller man behind him a khakiclad arm and leg no more id no time to see more for hardanger had moved his sixteen stone of solid authority four feet into my office forcing me to take a couple of backward steps all right cavell a flicker of a smile touched the abnormally light blue eyes you can put that gun away youre quite safe now the police are here i shook my head sorry hardanger but im no longer working for you i have a licence for this gun and youre in my office without permission i nodded towards the comer search this character and then put my gun away not till then henry martin hands still behind his neck turned slowly round he grinned at hardanger who smiled back and said shall i search you john rather not sir martin said briskly you know how ticklish i am i stared at them from hardanger to martin then back again i lowered my gun and said wearily all right what gives im genuinely sorry about this cavell hardanger said in his rough gravelly voice but necessary how necessary explain this mans name really is martin john martin of the special branchinspector recently returned from toronto want to see his credentials or will my word do i crossed to my desk put the gun away and brought out the flask money and slip of paper with the warsaw address i could feel the tightness in my face but i kept my voice quiet take your damned props martin and get out you too hardanger i dont know what this stupid charade this farrago of rubbish was for and ill be damned if you can make me care out i dont like smart alecs making a fool of me and i wont play mouse to any mans cat not even the special branchs easy up now cavell hardanger protested i told you it was necessary and let me talk to him the man in khaki interrupted he came round hardanger and i could see him clearly for the first time army officer and no subaltern either slight spare authoritative the type im allergic to my name is cliveden cavell majorgeneral cliveden i must i was cashiered from the army for taking a swing at a majorgeneral i interrupted think id hesitate to do it again now im a civilian you too out now i told you what he was like hardanger muttered to no one in particular he shrugged his shoulders heavily thrust his hand into the pocket of his raglan coat and brought out a wristwatch well go but first i thought you might like to have this a keepsake he had it in london for repair and it was delivered to the generals office yesterday what are you talking about i said harshly im talking about neil clandon your successor as security chief in mordon i believe he was one of your best friends i made no move to take the watch from the outstretched hand was you said clandon clandon dead murdered if you like when someone broke into the central laboratories in mordon late last nightearly this morning i looked at the three of them and then turned away to stare out through the grimy window at the grey fog swirling along gloucester place after a time i said youd better come in neil clandon had been found by a patrolling security guard shortly after two oclock that morning in the corridor beside the heavy steel door leading to number one lab in e block that he was dead was beyond dispute what he had died of was not yet known for in an establishment staffed almost entirely by doctors no one had been allowed to approach the dead man the strictness of the rule was absolute when the alarm bells rang it was a job for the special branch and the special branch alone the senior guard had been summoned and had approached within six feet of the body he had reported that clandon had been violently ill before dying and that he had obviously died in convulsions and great agony the symptoms had all the hallmarks of prussic acid poisoning had the guard been able to get the typical bitter almond smell this of course would have put the tentative diagnosis beyond reasonable doubt but that of course had been impossible all guards on internal patrol had to make their rounds in gastight suits with a closed circuit breathing apparatus the senior guard had noticed something else the time clock setting on the steel door had been altered normally it was set to run from pm till am now it was set to run from midnight which meant that access to number one lab would be impossible before pm except to those who knew the combination that overrode the time lock it was the soldier not hardanger who supplied this information i listened to him and said why you whats your interest in all this majorgeneral cliveden is the secondincommand of the royal army medical corps hardanger explained which automatically makes him the director of the mordon microbiological research establishment he wasnt when i was there my predecessor has retired cliveden said curtly but the underlying worry was clear to see ill health first reports naturally came to me i was in london i notified the superintendent immediately and on my own initiative i ordered an oxyacetylene team from aldershot to rush there they will open the door under special branch supervision an oxyacetylene team i stared at him are you quite mad i dont understand cancel it man cancel it at once what in gods name made you do that dont you know anything about that door apart from the fact that no acetylene equipment in existence could get through that special steel of that door inside hours dont you know that the door itself is lethal that its filled with a nearlethal gas that theres a central insulator mounted plate inside the door that damn well is lethal charged with two thousand volts i didnt know that cavell his voice was low ive only just taken over and even if they did get inside have you thought of what would happen then youre scared arent you majorgeneral clivedon youre terrified at the thought that someone has already been inside maybe that someone was careless maybe that someone was very careless maybe he knocked over a container or cracked a sealed culture tank a tank or container for instance with botulinus toxin which is one of the viruses both made and stored in number one lab it takes a minimum of twelve hours exposure to air to oxidise the toxin and render it harmless if anyone comes into contact with it before oxidisation theyre dead men before midday that is and clandon had you thought of him how do you know the botulinus didnt get him the symptoms are exactly the same as those of prussic acid poisoning how do you know the two guards werent affected the senior guard who spoke to you if he had been affected the botulinus would have got him as soon as hed taken off his mask to speak to you hed have died in agonies a minute later have you checked that hes still alive cliveden reached for the phone his hand was shaking while he was dialling i said to hardanger right superintendent the explanation martin here i nodded two good reasons the first was that you are number one suspect say that again youd been sacked he said bluntly left under a cloud your opinion of mordons place in the scheme of things was well known you have a reputation for taking the law into your own hands he smiled without humour ive had plenty of experience of that from you youre loony would i murder my best friend i said savagely you were the only outsider who knew the whole security setup in mordon the only one cavell if anyone could get into and out of that place it was you he paused for a significant moment and you are now the only man alive who knows the combinations for the various laboratory doors the combinations as you know can only be altered in the factory where the doors are made after your departure the precaution of changing was not thought necessary dr baxter the civilian director knows the combinations dr baxter is missing we cant trace him anywhere we had to find out fast how the land lay this was the best way the only way immediately after you left home this morning we checked with your wife she said youve been round at my house i stared at him bothering mary questioning her i rather think dont trouble hardanger said dryly youd get no satisfaction from breaking in false teeth i wasnt there sent a junior officer silly of me i admit asking a bride of two months to turn in her husband of course she said you hadnt left the house all night i looked at him without speaking his eyes were exactly on a level with mine he said are you wondering whether to haul off at me for even suggesting that mary may be a liar or why she didnt phone to tip you off both shes no liar you forget how well i know her and she didnt tip you off because we disconnected your phone both home and here we also bugged this phone before you arrived this morning i heard every word you said to martin on the phone in your outer office he smiled you had me worried for a few minutes there how did you get in i didnt hear you the bell didnt go off the fuse box is in the outer corridor all very illegal im afraid i nodded ill have to change that so youre in the clear cavell an oscar for inspector martin i should say twelve minutes flat to find out what we wanted to know but we had to know why why that way a few hours legwork by your men checking taxis restaurants theatres and youd have known i couldnt possibly have been in mordon last night i couldnt wait he cleared his throat with unnecessary force which brings me to my second reason if youre not the killer then youre the man i want to find the killer now that clandon is dead you are the only man who knows the entire security setup at mordon no one else does damned awkward but there it is if anyone can find anything you can not to mention the fact that im the only man who can open that door now that clandon is dead and baxter missing theres that too he admitted theres that too i mimicked thats all you really want and when the door is open i caa run along and be a good boy not unless you want to you mean that first derry now clandon id like to do something i know ill give you a free hand the general wont like it no one ever called hardangers ultimate superior by his name very few even knew it ive already fixed it with the general youre right he doesnt like it i suspect he doesnt like you hardanger grinned sourly often the way with relatives you did that in advance well thanks for the compliment you were the number one suspect but i never suspected you all the same i had to be sure so many of our best men have gone over the wall in the past few years when do we leave i said now cliveden had just replaced the receiver on its rest his hand still wasnt very steady if youre ready i will be in a moment hardanger was a past master at keeping his expressions buttoned up but there was a speculative curiosity in those eyes that he couldnt hide the sort of look hed give a man whod just put a foot wrong i said to cliveden the guards at the plant any word theyre all right so it cant have been botulinus that got clandon the central laboratories are completely sealed up and dr baxter still no signs of him he still no signs that makes two of them now coincidence general if thats the word i want i dont know what youre talking about he said irritably easton deny my predecessor in mordon he vanished a couple of months ago just six days after he was the best man at my wedding and he still hasnt turned up surely you knew how the hell should i a very testy little man indeed i was glad he wasnt a civilian doctor and myself one of his patients ive only been able to get down there twice since my appointment anyway baxter he left the laboratories all right checking out slightly later than usual he didnt return he lives with a widowed sister in a bungalow near alfringham five miles away he didnt come home at all last night she says he turned to hardanger we must get down there immediately superintendent right away sir cavell is going to come with us glad to hear it cliveden said he didnt look it and i couldnt blame him you dont make majorgeneral without developing an army mind in the process and the army mind sees the world as a neat orderly and regimented place with no place at all in it for private detectives but he was trying to be courteous and making the best of a bad job for he went on well need all the assistance we can get shall we go just as soon as ive phoned my wife to let her know whats happening if her phones been reconnected hardanger nodded i reached for the receiver but clivedens hand was on it first pressing it firmly down on its cradle no phoning cavell sorry must have absolute security on this its imperative that no one no one knows that anything has happened at mordon i lifted his wrist the phone came up in his hand and i took it from him i said tell him superintendent hardanger looked uncomfortable as i dialled he said apologetically im afraid cavell is no longer in the army sir not under the jurisdiction of the special branch he is um allergic to authority under the official secrets act we could demand sorry sir hardanger shook his head heavily classified information voluntarily disclosed to a civilian outwith a government department is no longer an official secret no one made us tell cavell anything and he never asked us to hes under no obligation and we want his cooperation i made my call told mary that no i wasnt under arrest that i was going down to mordon and would call her later in the day after i hung up i took off my jacket strapped on a felt shoulder holster and stuck the hanyatti into it it was a big gun but it was a big jacket with plenty of room in it unlike inspector martin i didnt go in much for the italian line hardanger watched me expressionlessly cliveden disapprovingly twice he made to say something twice he thought better of it it was all very irregular indeed but so was murder chapter two the army had a helicopter waiting for us but the fog was too heavy instead we went down to wiltshire in a big jaguar saloon driven by a plainclothes policeman who took far too much satisfaction in leaning with all his weight on both accelerator and siren button but the fog lifted as we cleared middlesex the roads were fairly clear and we made it intact to mordon by just after midday mordon is an architectural monstrosity a guaranteed blot on any landscape had the designer if it had a designer based it on an early nineteenthcentury prison which it exactly resembles he couldnt have achieved an uglier or more repulsive structure but mordon is only ten years old grim grey and gaunt under the darkly lowering october skies of that day mordon consisted of four parallel rows of squat flattopped concrete buildings three stories high each row in its repellent forbidding life lessness for all the world like condemned and abandoned victorian tenements in the worst slums of a great city but a fitting enough facade for the work that went on behind the walls each row of buildings was about a quarter of a mile in length with about two hundred yards separating the rows the space between buildings and boundary fence five hundred yards at the nearest approach was completely open completely clear no trees no bushes no shrubs not even a clump of flowers a man can hide behind a bush he might even be able to hide behind a clump of flowers but he cant hide behind a blade of grass two inches high and nothing higher grew in the bleak desolation of the grounds of mordon the term boundary fence not a wall people can hide behind walls was a misnomer any world war concentration camp commandant would have sold his soul for mordon with fences like those a man could sleep soundly at nights the outer barbedwire fence was fifteen feet high and sloped outwards at so sharp an angle that the top was four feet out of line with the foot a similar fence only sloping the other way paralleled the outer for its entire perimeter at a distance of about twenty feet the space between those fences was patrolled at night by alsatians and dobermannpinschers trained manhunters and if need be mankillers answerable only to their own army handlers three feet inside the second fence and actually below its overhang was a twostrand tripwire fence of so fine a metal as to be normally almost invisible and certainly would be invisible to anyone climbing down at nighttime from the top of that second fence and then another ten feet away was the last fence each of its five strands running through insulators mounted on concrete posts the electric current passing through those wires was supposed to be less than lethal if that is you were in good health to make sure that everyone got the general idea the army had put up noticeboards at tenyard intervals round the entire perimeter of the outer fence there were five different types of notices four of them black on white read danger keep out by order warning guard dogs in use prohibited place and electrified fences the fifth a violent red on yellow said simply w d property trespassers will be shot only a madman or complete illiterate would have attempted to break his way into mordon we came on the public ring road that completely surrounded the camp bore right by the gorsecovered fields and after a quarter of a mile turned into the main entrance the police driver stopped just short of the lowered boom and wound down his window as a sergeant approached the sergeant had a machinepistol slung over his shoulder and it wasnt pointing at the ground either then he caught sight of cliveden lowered his gun gave a signal to a man we couldnt see the boom rose the car moved on halted before heavy steel crashgates we left the car passed through a steel side door and made our way into a onestorey block marked reception three men waited for us there two i knew colonel weybridge deputy commandant of mordon and dr oregon dr baxters chief assistant in e block weybridge though technically under clivedens command was the real boss of mordon a tall freshfaced man with black hair and an incongruously irongrey moustache he was reputed to be an outstanding doctor mordon was his life he was one of the few with his own living accommodation on the premises and it was said that he never passed outside the gates twice a year gregori was a tall heavy swarthy darkeyed man an italian and exprofessor of medicine from turin and a brilliant microbiologist greatly respected by his fellow scientists the third man was a bulky shapeless character in a bulky shapeless tweed suit who looked so much like a farmer that he had to be what he turned out to be a policeman in plain clothes inspector wylie of the wiltshire constabulary cliveden and weybridge made the introductions then hardanger took over generals and colonels or not army establishment or not there was no question from the word go as to who was in complete charge hardanger made it clear from the start he said bluntly inspector wylie you shouldnt be here no member of any county constabulary has any right to be inside those gates but i doubt if you knew that and im sure youre not responsible for your presence here who is i am colonel weybridges voice was steady but he was on the defensive the circumstances are unusual to say the least let me tell it inspector wylie put in our headquarters got a call late last night about eleventhirty from the guardhouse here saying that one of your car crews i understand jeeps patrol the ring road all night had given chase to some unidentified man who seemed to have been molesting or attacking a girl just outside your grounds a civilian matter outwith army jurisdiction so they called us the duty sergeant and constable were here by shortly after midnight but found nothing and no one i came along this morning and when i saw the fences had been cut well i assumed there was some connection between the two things the fences cut i interrupted the boundary fences its not possible im afraid it is cavell weybridge said gravely the patrol cars i protested the dogs the trip wires the electric fences how about them youll see yourself the fences are cut and thats all thats to it weybridge wasnt as calm as he seemed on the surface not by a long way i would have taken long odds that he and gregori were badly frightened men anyway inspector wylie went on calmly i made inquiries at the gate i met colonel weybridge there and he asked me to make inquiries discreet inquiries to try to trace dr baxter you did that hardanger asked weybridge the voice was speculative the tone neutral dont you know your own standing orders that all inquiries are to be handled by your own security chief or my office in london clandon was dead and oh god hardangers voice was a lash so now inspector wylie knows that clandon is dead or did you known before inspector no sir but you do now how many other people have you told colonel weybridge no one else his voice was stiff his face pale thank heaven for that dont think im carrying security to ridiculous lengths colonel for it doesnt matter what you think or what i think all that matters is what one or two people in whitehall think they give the orders we carry them out the instructions for an emergency such as this are quite clear we take over completely you wash your hands of it completely i want your cooperation of course but it must be cooperation on my terms what the superintendent means cliveden said testily is that amateur detecting is not discouraged its forbidden i suppose that includes me too hardanger dont make my job more difficult than it is already sir i wont but as commandant i must ask for the right to be kept informed of all progress and the right to be present when number one lab in e block is opened up thats fair hardanger agreed when cliveden asked the lab i mean hardanger looked at me well the twelve hours you spoke of are up im not sure i looked at dr gregori has the ventilation system been started up in number one no of course not nobodys been near the place we left everything strictly alone if anything had been say knocked over i went on carefully would oxidisation be complete i doubt it airs too static i turned to hardanger all those labs are specially ventilated by filtered air later cleaned in a closed circuit special compartment i would like this switched on then maybe in an hour hardanger nodded gregori dark eyes worried behind his thick lenses phoned instructions then left with cliveden and weybridge hardanger turned to inspector wylie well inspector it seems youre in possession of information you shouldnt have no need to issue the usual dreadful warnings to you i suppose i like my job wylie smiled dont be too hard on old weybridge sir those medical men just arent security minded he meant well the paths of the just thats me are made thorny and difficult by those who mean well hardanger said heavily whats this about baxter seems he left here about pm last night sir but later than usual i gather so he missed the special bus to alfringham he checked out of course i asked every scientist leaving mordon had to sign the out register and hand in his security tag no doubt about that he had to wait for the ordinary service bus that passed the road end at conductor and two passengers confirm that someone answering to our description no names of course got on at the road end but the conductor is quite positive that no one of that description got off at alfringham farm where dr baxter lives he must have gone all the way to alfringham or hardcaster the terminus he just vanished hardanger nodded he looked consideringly at the burly quieteyed man like to work with us on this wylie it would make a change from checking up on the old footandmouth wylie admitted but our super and the chief constable might have something to say about that they could be persuaded i think your office is at alfringham isnt it ill call you there wylie left as he passed through the doorway we caught sight of an army lieutenant hand raised to knock on the door hardanger cocked an eye and said come in morning sir morning mr cavell the sandyhaired young lieutenant looked tired but his voice was brisk and alert in spite of that wilkinson sir officer in charge of the guard patrols last night colonel said you might want to see me considerate of the colonel i do hardanger superintendent hardanger glad to meet you wilkinson you the man who found clandon last night perkins a corporal of the guard found him he called me and i had a look at him just a look then i sealed e block called the colonel and he confirmed good man hardanger approved but well come to that later you were notified of the wirecutting of course naturally sir with with mr clandon gone i was in charge we couldnt find him not anywhere he must have been dead even then quite you investigated the wirecutting of course no sir no why not your job surely no sir its a job for an expert a halfsmile touched the pale tired face we carry automatic machineguns superintendent not microscopes it was pitch black besides by the time a few pairs of regulation army boots had churned the place up there wouldnt have been much left to investigate i set a four man guard sir each man ten yards from the break two inside and two out with orders that no one should be allowed to approach never looked to find such intelligence in the army hardanger said warmly that was first class young man a faint touch of colour touched wilkinsons pale face as he tried hard not to show his pleasure anything else you did nothing that would help you sir i sent another jeep theres normally three on patrol at a time round the entire perimeter of the fence to make a spotlight search for another break but this was the only one then i questioned the crew of the jeep whod made this wildgoose chase after the man who was supposed to have attacked the girl and warned them that the next time their ah chivalrous instincts got the better of them they would be sent back to their regiments theyre not supposed to leave their jeeps no matter what the provocation you think this episode of the distressed young lady was just a blind to let someone nip in smartly and unobserved with a pair of wirecutters what else sir what else indeed hardanger sighed how many men usually employed in e block lieutenant fiftyfive sixty sir doctors a mixed bunch doctors microbiologists chemists technicians army and civilian i dont know too much about them sir were not encouraged to ask questions where are they now i mean e block is sealed off in the refectory lounge some of them wanted to go home when they found e block shut up but the colonel colonel weybridge wouldnt let them thats convenient lieutenant id be grateful if youd lay on two orderlies or messengers or whatever one for me one for inspector martin here inspector martin would like to talk to those e block men individually please make arrangements if there are any difficulties you are free to say that you have the full authority of general cliveden behind you but first id like you to come along with us and identify us to your guards at this gap in the fence then tell all the guards the men who man the jeeps and the doghandlers to be at the reception office in twenty minutes the ones who were on duty before midnight i mean five minutes later hardanger and i were alone at the break in the fences the guards had withdrawn out of earshot and wilkinson had left us the barbed wire on the outer fence was strung between curving reinforced concrete posts like junior editions of modern city lighting standards there were about thirty strands on the fence with roughly six inches between each pair the fourth and fifth strands from the bottom had been cut then rejoined with heavy grey twine tied round the barbs nearest the cuts it had taken a pretty sharp pair of eyes to discover the break there had been no rain for three days and there was no trace of footmarks the ground was damp but that was still from the heavy dew of the previous night whoever had cut those wires had left long before the dew had begun to settle your eyes are younger than mine hardanger said sawn or cut snipped cutters or pliers and have a look at the angle of the cut slight but its there hardanger took one end of the wire in his hand and peered at it from left at the front to right at the back he murmured the way a lefthanded man would naturally hold cutters or pliers to obtain maximum leverage a lefthanded man i agreed or a right handed man who wanted to confuse us so a man whos either lefthanded or clever or both hardanger looked at me in disgust and made his way slowly to the inner fence no footprints no marks between the fences the inner fence had been cut in three places whoever had wielded those cutters would have felt more secure from observation from the ring road the point we had yet to establish was why he had felt so secure from the attention of the police dogs patrolling the area between the two fences the tripwires under the overhang of the second fence were intact whoever had cut that fence had been lucky indeed if not stumbling over them or hed known their exact location our friend with the pliers didnt strike me as a man who would depend very much on luck and the method hed adopted to get through the electric fence proved it unlike most such fences where only the top wire carried the current all the way the others being made live by a vertical joining wire cable at each set of insulators this fence was live in every wire throughout the alarm bell would be rung by the shorting of any of those wires to earth as when someone touched them or by the cutting of any of the wires this hadnt fazed our friend with the pliers insulated pliers quite obviously the two strands of trs cable lying on the ground between two posts showed this clearly enough hed bent one end of one strand on to the lowest insulator of one post trailed it across the ground and done the same with the lowest insulator on the next post so providing an alternate pathway for the current hed done the same with the pair of insulators above these then simply cut away both lowermost wires and crawled through under the third wire an ingenious beggar hardanger commented almost argues inside information doesnt it or somebody just outside the outer fence with a powerful telescope or binoculars the ring road is open to public traffic remember wouldnt be hard to sit in a car and see what type of electric fence it was and i dare say if the conditions were right he could have seen the tripwires on the inner fence glistening in the sun i dare say hardanger said heavily well its no damn good us staying here and staring at this fence lets get back and start asking questions all the men hardanger had asked to see were assembled in the reception hall they were sitting on benches around the hall fidgeting and restless some of them looked sleepy all of them looked scared i knew it would take hardanger about half of one second to sum up their mental condition and act accordingly he did he took his seat behind a table and looked up under his shaggy brows the pale blue eyes cold and penetrating and hostile as an actor he wasnt all that far behind inspector martin all right he said brusquely the jeep crew the ones who made the wildgoose chase last night lets have you three men a corporal and two privates rose slowly to their feet hardanger gave his attention to the corporal your name please muirfield sir you in charge of the crew last night yes sir tell me what happened yes sir wed completed a circuit of the ring road stopped to report everything ok at the main gate and then left again it would be about elevenfifteen sir give or take a minute or two about two hundred and fifty yards past the gates we saw this girl running into the headlights she looked wild disheveled like her hair all over the place she was halfscreaming halfcrying a funny noise i was driving i stopped the jeep jumped out and the others came after me i should have told them to stay where they never mind about what you should have done the story man well we came up to her sir shed mud on her face and her coat was torn i said ever seen her before no sir would you recognise her again he hesitated i doubt it sir her face was in a fair old mess she spoke to you yes sir she said recognise her voice any of you recognise her voice can you be quite sure of that three solemn shakes of their heads they hadnt recognised her voice all right hardanger said wearily she pitched me tale of the damsel in distress at the psychological moment someone conveniently betrayed his presence and started running you all took off after him catch a glimpse of him a glimpse only sir just a blur in the darkness could have been anyone he took off in a car i understand just another blur i take it yes sir not a car sir a closed van type sir a bedford i see hardanger stopped and stared at him a bedford how the devil do you know it was dark you said it was a bedford muirfleld insisted id know the engine anywhere and im a garage mechanic in civvy street hes right superintendent i put in a bedford does have a very distinctive engine note ill be back hardanger was on his feet and it didnt need any clairvoyance to see him heading for the nearest telephone he glanced at me nodded at the seated soldiers and left i said pleasantly enough who was the doghandler in number one last night the circuit between the two barbedwire fences were divided into four sections by wooden hurdles number one was the section in which the breakin occurred you ferguson a dark stocky private in his middle twenties had risen to his feet ferguson was regular army a born soldier tough aggressive and not very bright me he said there was truculence in his voice not very much but more waiting there if i wanted it where were you at eleven fifteen last night in number one with rollo thats my alsatian you saw the incident that corporal muirfield here has described course i saw it lie number one ferguson lie number two and youll be returned to your regiment before the day is out im not lying his face was suddenly ugly and you cant talk to me like that mister cavell you cant threaten me any more dont think we dont all know you were sacked from here i turned to the orderly ask colonel weybridge to come here at once please the orderly turned to go but a big sergeant rose to his feet and stopped him its not necessary sir fergusons a fool its bound to come out he was at the switchboard having a smoke and a cup of cocoa with the gatehouse communications number i was in charge never saw him there but i knew about it and didnt worry about it ferguson always left rollo in number one and that dogs a killer sir it was safe enough it wasnt but thanks youve been in the habit of doing this for some time havent you ferguson i havent he was scowling sullen last night was the first if there was a rank lower than private i interrupted wearily youd stay in it till the end of your days use what little sense you have do you think whoever arranged this decoy move and was standing by with his pliers ready to break in did it unless he knew for certain you wouldnt be on patrol at mat particular time probably after mr clandon finished his pm rounds visit to the main gate every night you went straight into the gatehouse for your smoke and cocoa isnt that it he stood staring down at the floor in stubborn silence until the sergeant said sharply for gods sake fergie use your loaf everybody else here can see it so can you again silence but this time a sullen nod of defeat were getting someplace when you came here you left your dog rollo behind yes sir fergusons days of truculent defiance were over whats he like hed tear the throat out of any man alive from the general downwards ferguson said with satisfaction except me of course he didnt tear out any throats last night i pointed out i wonder why he must have been got at ferguson said defensively what do you mean got at did you have a look at him before you turned him into his compound last night look at him course not why should i when we saw the cut outer fence we thought whoever done it must have caught sight of rollo and run for his life thats what i would have bloody well done if fetch the dog here i said but for gods sake muzzle him first he left and while he was away hardanger returned i told him what id learned and that id sent for the dog hardanger asked what do you expect to find nothing i think a chloroform pad or something like that would leave no mark same if some sort of dart or sharply tipped weapon with one of those funny poisons had been chucked at him just a pinprick thats all there would be from what i hear of our canine pal i said i wouldnt try to hold a chloroform pad against his head if you gave me the crown jewels as for those funny poisons as you call them i dont suppose one person in a hundred thousand could lay hands on one of them or know how to use them even if they did besides throwing or firing any sharptipped weapon against a fastmoving thickcoated target in the dark would be a very dicey proposition indeed our friend of last night doesnt go in for dicey propositions only for certainties ferguson was back in ten minutes fighting to restrain a wolflike animal that lunged out madly at anyone who came near him rollo had a muzzle on but even that didnt make me feel too confident i didnt need any persuasion to accept the sergeants word that the dog was a killer does that hound always act like this i demanded not usually ferguson was puzzled in fact never usually perfectly behaved until i let him off the leash then hell go for the nearest person no matter who he is but he even had a go at me this afternoon halfhearted like but nasty it didnt take long to discover the source of rollos irritation rollo was suffering from what must have been a very severe headache indeed the skin on the forehead just above eyelevel had a swollen pulpy feeling to it and it took four men all their time to hold the dog down when i touched this area with the tips of my forefingers we turned him over and i parted the thick fur on the throat till i found what i was looking for two triangular jagged tears deep and very unpleasant looking about three inches apart youd better give your pal here a couple of days off said to ferguson and some disinfectant for those gashes on his neck i wish you luck when youre putting it on you can take him away no chloroform no fancy poisons hardanger admitted when we were alone those gashes barbed wire hey what else just the right distance apart somebody pads his forearm sticks it between a couple of strands of barbed wire and rollo grabs it he wouldnt bark those dogs are trained never to bark as soon as he grabs hes pulled through and down onto the barbed wire and cant pull himself free unless he tears his throat out and then someone clouts him at his leisure with something heavy and hard simple oldfashioned direct and very very effective whoever the character were after hes no fool hes smarter than rollo anyway hardanger conceded heavily chapter three when we went up to e block accompanied by two of hardangers assistants newly arrived from london we found cliveden weybridge gregori and wilkinson waiting for us wilkinson produced the key to the heavy wooden door no one been inside since you locked the place after seeing clandon hardanger asked i can guarantee that sir guards posted all the time but cavell here asked for the ventilation system to be switched on how could that be done without someone going inside duplicate switches on the roof sir all fuseboxes junctions and electrical terminals are also housed on the roof means that the repair and maintenance electricians dont even have to enter the main building you people dont miss much hardanger admitted open up please the door swung back we all filed through and turned down the long corridor to our left number one lab was right at the far end of the corridor as least two hundred yards away but that was the way we had to go there was only the one entrance to the entire block security was all on the way we had to pass through half a dozen doors some opened by photoelectric cells others by handles fifteen inches long elbow handles considering the nature of the burdens that some of the mordon scientists carried from time to time it was advisable to have both hands free all the time we came to number one lab and clandon clandon was lying just outside the massive steel door of the laboratory but he wasnt any more the neil clandon i used to know the big tough kindly humorous irishman whod been my friend over too many years he looked curiously small now small and huddled and defenceless another man altogether not neil clandon any more even his face was the face of another man eyes abnormally wide and starting as one who had passed far beyond the realms of sanity into a total and terrorinduced madness the lips strained cruelly back over clenched teeth in the appalling rictus of his dying agony and no man who looked at that face at the convulsively contorted limbs could doubt that neil clandon had died as terribly as man ever could they were all watching me that i was vaguely aware of but i was pretty good at telling my face what to do i went forward and stooped low over him sniffing and found myself apologising to the dead man for the involuntary wrinkling distaste of nose and mouth no fault of neils i glanced at colonel weybridge and he came forward and bent beside me for a moment before straightening he looked at wilkinson and said you were right my boy cyanide i pulled a pair of cotton gloves from my pocket one of hardangers assistants lifted his flash camera but i pushed his arm down and said no pictures neil clandons not going into anyones morgue gallery too late for pictures anyway if you feel all that like work why dont you start on that steel door there fingerprints itll be loaded with them and not one of them will do you the slightest damn bit of good the two men glanced at hardanger he hesitated shrugged nodded i went though neil clandons pockets there wasnt much that could be of any use to me wallet cigarette case a couple of books of matches and in the left hand jacket pocket a handful of transparent papers that had been wrapped round butterscotch sweets i said this is how he died the very latest in confectionery cyanide butterscotch you can see the sweet he was eating on the floor there beside his head have you such a thing as an analytical chemist on the premises colonel of course hell find that sweet and possibly one of those butterscotch papers covered with cyanide i hope your chemist isnt the type who licks his fingers after touching sticky stuff whoever doctored this sweet knew of clandons weakness for butterscotch he also knew clandon put it another way clandon knew him he knew him well he knew him so well and was so little surprised to find him here that he didnt hesitate to accept a butterscotch from him whoever killed clandon is not only employed in mordon hes employed in this particular section of e block if he werent clandon would have been too damn busy suspecting him of everything under the sun even to consider accepting anything from him narrows the field of inquiry pretty drastically the killers first mistake and a big one maybe hardanger rumbled and maybe youre oversimplifying and taking too much for granted assumptions how do you know clandon was killed here youve said yourself were up against a clever man a man who would be more likely than not to obscure things to cause confusion to cast suspicions in the wrong place by killing clandon elsewhere and then dragging him here and its asking too much to believe that he just happened to have a cyanide sweet in his pocket that he just happened to hand to clandon when clandon just happened to find him doing what he was doing about the second part i dont know i said i should have thought myself that clandon would have been highly suspicious of anyone he found here late at night no matter who he was but clandon died right here thats for sure i looked at cliveden and weybridge how long for cyanide poisoning to take effect practically instantaneous cliveden said and he was violently ill here i said so he died here and look at those two faint scratches on the plaster of the wall a lab check on his fingernails is almost superfluous thats where he clawed for support as he fell to the floor some friend gave clandon that sweet and thats why id like the wallet cigarette case and books of matches printed theres just a chance in a thousand that the friend may have been offered a cigarette or a match or that he went through clandons wallet after he was dead but i dont think theres even that chance in a thousand but i think the prints on that door should be interesting and informative ill take a hundred to one in anything you like that the prints on that door will be exclusively of those entitled to pass through that door what i really want to find out is whether theres been any signs of deliberately smearing as with a handkerchief or gloves in the vicinity of the combination timelock or circular handle there will be hardanger nodded your assumption that this is strictly an inside job is correct there will be to bring in the possibility of outsiders theres still clandon i said hardanger nodded again turned away to watch his two men working on the door just then a soldier came up with a large fibre case and a small covered cage placed it on the floor saluted nobody in particular and left i caught the inquiring lift of clivedens eyebrow when i go into the lab i said i go in alone in that case is a gastight suit and closed circuit breathing apparatus ill be wearing that i lock the steel door behind me open the inner door and take the hamster in this cage in with me if hes still alive after a few minutes well its clear inside a hamster hardanger turned his attention from the door moved across to the cage and lifted the cover poor little beggar where did you acquire a hamster so conveniently mordon is the easiest place in britain to acquire a hamster conveniently there must be a couple of hundred of them within a stones throw from here not to mention a few thousand guineapigs rabbits monkeys parrots mice and fowls theyre bred and reared on alfringham farm where dr baxter has his cottage poor little beggar as you say theyve a pretty short life and far from sweet one the rspca and the national antivivisection society would sell their souls to get in here the official secrets act sees to it that they dont mordon is their waking nightmare and i dont blame them do you know that over a hundred thousand animals died inside these walls last year many of them in agony theyre a sweet bunch in mordon everyone is entitled to his opinions general cliveden said coldly i dont say i entirely disagree with you he smiled without humour the right place for airing such sentiments cavell but the wrong time i nodded acknowledgement or apology he could take it how he liked and opened the fibre case i straightened gassuit in hand and felt my arm gripped dr oregon the dark eyes were intense behind the thick glasses the swarthy face tight with worry dont go in there mr cavell his voice was low urgent almost desperate i beg of you dont go in there i said nothing just looked at him i liked gregori as did all his colleagues without exception but gregori wasnt in mordon because he was a likeable man he was there because he was reputed to be one of the most brilliant microbiologists in europe an italian professor of medicine hed been in mordon just over eight months the biggest catch mordon had ever made and it had been touch and go at that it had taken cabinet conferences at the highest levels before the italian government agreed to release him for an unspecified period and if a man like dr gregori was worried maybe it was time that i was getting worried too why shouldnt he go in there hardanger demanded i take it you must have very powerful reasons dr gregori he has indeed cliveden said his face was as grave as his voice no man knows more about number one lab than dr gregori we were speaking of this a short time ago dr gregori admits candidly that hes terrified and id be lying if i didnt say that hes got me pretty badly frightened too if dr gregori had his way hed cut through the block on either side of number one lab built a five foot thick concrete wall and roof round it and seal it off for ever thats how frightened dr gregori is at the very least he wants this lab kept closed for a month hardanger gave cliveden his usual deadpan took transferred it to gregori then turned to his two assistants down the corridor till youre out of earshot please for your own sakes the less you know of this the better you too lieutenant sorry he waited until wilkinson and the two men had gone looked quizzically at gregori and said so you dont want number one lab opened dr gregori makes you number one on our suspect list you know please i do not feel like smiling and i do not feel like talking here he glanced quickly at clandon looked as quickly away im not a policeman or a soldier if you would of course hardanger pointed to a door a few yards down the passage whats in there just a storeroom i am so sorry to be so squeamish come on hardanger led the way and we went inside oblivious of the no smoking signs gregori had lit a cigarette and was smoking it in rapid nervous puffs i must not waste your time he said i will be as brief as i can but i must convince you he paused then went on slowly this is the nuclear age this is the age when tens of millions go about their homes and their work in daily fear and dread of the thermonuclear holocaust which they are all sure may come any day and must come soon millions cannot sleep at night for they dream too much of our green and lovely world and their children lying dead in it he drew deeply on his cigarette stubbed it out at once lit another he said through the drifting smoke i have no such fears of a nuclear armageddon and i sleep well at nights such war will never come i listen to the russians rattling their rockets and i smile i listen to the americans rattling theirs and i smile again for i know that all the time the two giant powers are shaking their sabres in the scabbards while theyre threatening each other with so many hundreds of megatoncarrying missiles they are not really thinking of their missiles at all they are thinking gentlemen of mordon for we the british i should say have made it our business to ensure that the great nations understand exactly what is going on behind the fences of mordon he tapped the brickwork beside him behind this very wall here the ultimate weapon the worlds one certain guarantee of peace the term ultimate weapon has been used too freely has come almost to lose its meaning but the term in this case is precise and exact if by ultimate one means total annihilation he smiled a little selfconsciously im being melodramatic a little perhaps my latin blood shall we say but listen carefully gentlemen and try to understand the full significance of what im going to say not the general and colonel of course they already know but you superintendent and you mr cavell we have developed in mordon here over forty different types of plague germs i will confine myself to two one of them is a derivative of the botulinus toxin which we had developed in world war ii as a point of interest a quarter of a million troops in england were inoculated against this toxin just before dday and i doubt whether any of them know to this day what they were inoculated against we have refined this toxin into a fantastic and shocking weapon compared to which even the mightiest hydrogen bomb is a childs toy six ounces of this toxin gentlemen distributed fairly evenly throughout the world would destroy every man woman and child alive on this planet today no flight of fancy his voice was weighted with heavy emphasis his face still and somber this is simple fact give me an airplane and let me fly over london on a windless summer afternoon with no more than a gramme of botulinus toxin to scatter and by evening seven million londoners would be dead a thimbleful in its water reservoirs and london would become one vast channel house if god does not strike me down for using the term ideal in this connection then this is the ideal form of germ warfare the botulinus toxin oxidises after twelve hours exposure to the atmosphere and becomes harmless twelve hours after country a releases a few grammes of botulinus over country b it can send its soldiers in without any fear of attack by either the toxin or the defending soldiers for the defending soldiers would be dead and the civilians the men the women the children they would ail be dead all dead gregori fumbled in his pocket for another cigarette his hands were shaking and he made no attempt to conceal the fact he was probably unaware of it i said but you used the term ultimate weapon as if we alone possessed it surely the russians and americans they have it too we know where russias laboratories in the urals are we know where the canadians manufacture it the canadians were leaders in the field until recently and its no secret that there are four thousand scientists working on a crash programme in fort detrick in america to produce even more deadlier poisons so hurried a crash programme that we know that scientists have died and eight hundred of them fallen ill over the past few years they have all failed to produce this deadlier poison britain has succeeded which is why the eyes of the world are on mordon is it possible hardangers tone was dry but his face was set a deadlier poison than this damn botulinus seems kind of superfluous to me botulinus has its drawback gregori said quietly from a military viewpoint that is botulinus you must breathe or swallow to become infected it is not contagious also we suspect that a few countries may have produced a form of vaccine against even the refined type of drug we have developed here but there is no vaccine on earth to counteract the newest virus we have produced and its as contagious as a bushfire this other virus is a derivative of the polio virus infantile paralysis if you will but a virus the potency of which has been increased a million times by well the methods dont matter and you wouldnt understand what does matter is this unlike botulinus this new polio virus is indestructible extremes of heat and cold oxidisation and poison have no effect upon it and its life span appears to be indefinite although we believe it impossible we hope it impossible that any virus could live for more than a month in an environment completely hostile to growth and development unlike botulinus it is highly contagious as well as being fatal if swallowed or breathed and most terrible of all we have been unable to discover a vaccine for it i myself am convinced that we can never discover a vaccine against it he smiled without humour to this virus we have given a highly unscientific name but one that describes it perfectly the satan bug it is the most terrible and terrifying weapon mankind has ever known or ever will know no vaccine hardanger said his tone wasnt dry this time but his lips were no vaccine at all we have given up hope only a few days ago as you will recall colonel weybridge dr baxter thought he had found it but we were completely wrong there is no hope none in the world now all our efforts are concentrated on evolving an attenuated strain with a limited lifespan in its present form we obviously cannot use it but when we do get a form with a limited lifespan and its death must be caused by oxidisation then we have the ultimate weapon when that day comes all the nations of the world may as well destroy their nuclear weapons from a nuclear attack no matter how intense there will always be survivors the americans have calculated that even a fullscale soviet nuclear attack on their country with all the resources at russias disposal would cause no more than seventy million deaths no more i say with possibly several million others as a result of radiation but half the nation would survive and in a generation or two that nation would rise again but a nation attacked by the satan bug would never rise again for there would be no survivors i hadnt been wrong about hardangers lips being dry he was licking them to make speaking easier someone should see this i thought hardanger scared hardanger truly and genuinely frightened the penitentiaries of britain were full of people who would never have believed it and until then hardanger said quietly until you have evolved this limited lifestrain until then gregori stared down at the concrete floor until then let me put it this way in its final form the satan bug is an extremely refined powder i take a saltspoon of this powder go outside in the grounds of mordon and turn the saltspoon upside down what happens every person in mordon would be dead within an hour the whole of wiltshire would be an open tomb by dawn in a week ten days all life would have ceased to exist in britain i mean all life the plague the black death was nothing compared with this long before the last man died in agony ships or planes or birds or just the waters of the north sea would have carried the satan bug to europe we can conceive of no obstacle that can stop its eventual worldwide spread two months i would say two months at the very most think of it superintendent think of it if you can that is for it is something really beyond our conception beyond human imagination the lapp trapping in the far north of sweden the chinese peasant tilling his ricefields in the yangtse valley the cattle rancher on his station in the australian outback the shopper in fifth avenue the primitive in tierra del fuego dead all dead because i turned a saltspoon upside down nothing nothing nothing can stop the satan bug eventually all forms of life will perish who what will be the last to go i cannot say perhaps the great albatross for ever winging its way round the bottom of the world perhaps a handful of eskimos deep in the arctic basin but the seas travel the world over and so also do the winds one day one day soon they too would die by this time i felt like lighting a cigarette myself and i did if any enterprising company had got around to running a passenger rocket service to the moon by the time the satan bug got loose they wouldnt have to spend all that much on advertising what im afraid of you see gregori went on quietly is what we may find behind that door i have not the mind of a detective but i can see things when they lie plainly before me whoever broke his way into mordon was a desperate man playing for desperate stakes the end justified by any means and the only ends to justify such terrible means would be some of the stocks in the virus cupboard cupboard hardanger drew down his bushy brows dont you lock those damn germs away somewhere safe they are safe i said the lab walls are of reinforced concrete and paneled with heavygauge mild steel no windows of course this door is the only way in why shouldnt it be safe in a cupboard i didnt know hardanger turned back to oregon please go on thats all gregori shrugged a desperate man a man in a great hurry the key to the locker just wood and glass i have in my hands here see he would have to break in in his haste and with the use of force who knows what damage he may not have done what virus containers he might not have knocked over or broken if one of those had been a satan bug container and there are but three in existence maybe its only a very remote chance but i say to you in all sincerity and earnestness if there was only one chance in a hundred million of a satan bug container having been broken there is still more than ample justification for never opening that door again for if one is broken and one cubic centimetre of tainted air escapes he broke off and lifted his hands helplessly have we the right to take upon ourselves the responsibility of being the executioners of mankind general cliveden hardanger said im afraid i agree seal it up colonel weybridge i dont know i dont know weybridge took off his cap ran his hand through the short dark hair yes i do now seal the damn place up well youre the three men who should really know what they are talking about hardanger pursed his lips for a moment then glanced at me in the face of expert unanimity it should be interesting to hear what cavell thinks cavell thinks theyre a pack of old women i said i think your minds are so gummed up with the idea of the satan bug on the loose that youre incapable of thinking at all far less thinking straight lets look at the central fact central supposition rather dr gregori bases all his fears on the assumption that someone has broken in and stolen the viruses he thinks theres one chance in a thousand that one of the containers may have been broken so if that door is opened theres one chance in a thousand of menace to mankind but if he has actually stolen the satan bug then the menace to mankind becomes not one in a thousand but a thousand to one for heavens sake take the blinkers off for a moment and try to see that a man on the loose with the viruses presents an infinitely greater danger than the remote chance of his having broken one inside those doors simple logic says that we must guard against the greater danger so we must get inside the room how else can we begin to get any trace of the thief and killer to try to guard against the infinitely greater danger we must i say or i must im dressing up and taking that hamster in there if the hamster survives good and well if he doesnt i dont come out fair enough of all the damned arrogance cliveden said coldly for a private detective cavell you have an awful lot of gall you might bear in mind that im the commandant in mordon and i take all the decisions you did general but not any more the special branch has taken over completely you know that hardanger ignored us both grasping at straws he said to gregori you mentioned that a special air filtration unit was working inside there wont that have cleared the air with any other virus yes not with the satan bug its virtually indestructible i tell you and its a closed circuit nitration unit the same air washed and cleaned is fed back in again but you cant wash away the satan bug there was a long pause then i said to gregori if the satan bug or botulinus is loose in this lab how long would it take to affect the hamster fifteen seconds he said precisely in thirty seconds it will be in convulsions in a minute dead there will be reflex muscle twitchings but it will be dead thats for the satan bug for botulinus only slightly longer dont stop me from going in i said to cliveden ill see what happens to the hamster if hes ok then ill wait another ten minutes then ill come out if you come out he was weakening cliveden was nobodys fool he was too clever not to have gone over what i had said and at least some of it must have made sense to him if anything any virus has been stolen i said then whoever stole it is a madman the kennet a tributary of the thames passes by only a few miles from here how do you know that madman isnt bent over the kennet this instant pouring those damned bugs into the water how do i know you wont come out if that hamster does die cliveden said desperately good god cavell youre only human if that hamster does die do you expect me to believe that youre going to remain in there till you die of starvation asphyxiation rather when the oxygen gives out of course youre going to come out all right general suppose i come out would i still be wearing the gassuit and breathing apparatus obviously his voice was curt if you werent and that room was contaminated well you couldnt come out youd be dead all right again this way i led the way out to the corridor indicated the last corridordoor wed passed through that door is gastight i know that so are those outside double windows you stand at that corridor door have it open a crack the door of number one lab opens on it youll see me as soon as i begin to come out agreed what are you talking about this i reached inside my jacket pulled out the hanyatti automatic knocked the safety catch off you have this in your hand if when the lab door opens im still wearing the suit and breathing apparatus you can shoot me down at fifteen feet and with nine shots you can hardly fail to then you shut the corridor door then the virus is still sealed inside e block he took the gun from me slowly reluctantly uncertainly but there was nothing uncertain about eyes and voice when finally he spoke you know i shall use this if i have to of course i know it i smiled but i didnt feel much like it from what ive heard id rather die from a bullet than the satan bug im sorry i blew my top a minute ago he said quietly youre a brave man cavell dont fail to mention the fact in my obituary in the times how about asking your men to finish off printing and photographing that door superintendent twenty minutes later the men were finished and i was all ready to go the others looked at me with that peculiar hesitancy and indecision of people who think they should be making farewell speeches but find the appropriate words too hard to come by a couple of nods a half wave of a hand and theyd left me they all passed down the corridor and through the next door except general cliveden who remained in the open doorway from some obscure feeling of decency he held my hanyatti behind his body where i couldnt see it the gassuit was tight and constricting the closed circuit breathing apparatus cut into the back of my neck and the high concentration of oxygen made my mouth dry or maybe my mouth was dry anyway three cigarettes in the past twenty minutes a normal days quota for me i preferred to take my slow poisoning in the form of a pipe wouldnt have helped any either i tried to think of one compelling reason why i shouldnt go through that door but that didnt help either there were so many compelling reasons that i couldnt pick and choose between them so i didnt even bother trying i made a last careful check of suit mask and oxygen cylinders but i was only kidding myself this was about my fifth last careful check besides they were all watching me i had my pride i started spelling out the combination on the heavy steel door a fairly complicated and delicate operation at any time the operation of opening that door was made doubly difficult by reinforcedrubber covered fingers and poor vision afforded by slanted goggles but exactly a minute after id begun i heard the heavy thud as the last spin of the dial energised the powerful electromagnets that withdrew the heavy central bolt three complete turns of the big circular handle and the halfton door eased slowly open under the full weight of my shoulder i picked up the hamsters cage eased in quickly through the opening door checked its swing and closed it as swiftly as possible three turns of the inner circular handle and the vault door was locked again the chances were that in so doing i had wiped off a fair number of prints but i wouldnt have wiped off any prints that mattered the rubbersealed frostedglass door leading into the laboratory proper was at the other end of the tiny vestibule further delay would achieve nothing nothing apart from prolonging my life that was i leaned on the fifteeninch elbow handle pressed open the door passed inside and closed the door behind me no need to switch on any lights the laboratory was already brilliantly illuminated by shadow less neon lighting whoever had broken into that lab had either figured that the government was a big enough firm to stand the waste of electricity or hed left in such a tearing hurry that hed had no time to think of lights id no time to think of lights either nor had i the inclination my sole and overriding concern was with the immediate welfare of the tiny hamster inside the cage i was carrying i placed the cage on the nearest bench whipped off the cover and stared at the little animal no bound man seated on a powder keg ever watched the last few minutes of sputtering fuse with half the mesmerised fascination the totallyexclusive concentration with which i stared at that hamster the starving cat with upraised paw by the mousehole the mongoose waiting for the kingcobra to strike the ruined gambler watching the last roll of the dice compared to me they were asleep on the job if ever the human eye had the power of transfixion that hamster should have been skewered alive fifteen seconds gregori had said fifteen seconds only and if the deadly satan bug virus was present in the atmosphere of that lab the hamster would react i counted off the seconds each second a bell tolling towards eternity and at exactly fifteen seconds the hamster twitched violently violently but nothing compared to the way my heart behaved a double somersault that seemed to take up all the space inside the chest wall before settling down to an abnormally slow heavy thudding that seemed to shake my body with its every beat inside the rubber gloves the palms of my hands turned wet icecold my mouth was dry as last years ashes thirty seconds passed by this time if the virus was loose the hamster should have been in convulsions but he wasnt not unless convulsions in a hamster took the form of sitting up on its hind legs and rubbing its nose vigorously with a couple of tiny irritated paws fortyfive seconds a minute maybe dr gregori had overestimated the virulence of the virus maybe this was a hamster with an abnormally tough and resistant physique but gregori didnt strike me as the sort of scientist who would make any mistakes and this looked like a pretty puny hamster to me for the first time since entering the room i started to use the breathing apparatus i swung the top of the cage back on its hinges and started to lift out the hamster he was still in pretty good shape as far as i could tell for he wriggled from my hand jumped down on to the rubbertiled floor and scurried away up a long passage between a table and a wallbench stopping at the far end to get on with scratching his nose again i came to the conclusion that if a hamster could take it i could too after all i outweighed him by about five hundred to one i unbuckled the straps behind my neck and pulled off the closed circuit breathing apparatus i took a long deep lungful of air that was a mistake i admit you can hardly heave a vast sigh of relief at the prospect of keeping on living yet awhile just by sniffing cautiously at the atmosphere but that is what i ought to have done i could understand now why the hamster had spent his time in rubbing his nose with such disgusted intensity i felt my nostrils try to wrinkle shut in nauseated repugnance as the vile smell hit them sulphuretted hydrogen had nothing on it holding my nose i started moving around the benches and tables within thirty seconds in a passage at the top of the laboratory i found what i was looking for and what i didnt want to find the midnight visitor hadnt forgotten to switch out the lights hed just left in such a tearing hurry that the thought of light switches would never even have crossed his mind his one ambition in life would have been to get out of that room and close both doors tightly behind him just as quickly as was humanly possible hardanger could call off his search for dr baxter dr baxter was here still clad in his white kneelength overall lying on the rubber floor like clandon hed obviously died in contorted agony unlike clandon whatever had killed him hadnt been cyanide i knew of no type of death associated with this strange blueness of the face with the outpouring of so much fluid from eyes ears and nose above all with so dreadful a smell even to look was revolting enough the idea of making a closer approach was more repugnant still but i forced myself to do it anyway i didnt touch him i didnt know the cause of death but i had a pretty fair idea so i didnt touch him instead stooped low over the dead man and examined him as carefully as was possible in the circumstances there was a small contused area behind the right ear with a little blood where the skin had been broken but no noticeable swelling death bad supervened before a true bruise had had time to form a few feet behind him lying on the floor at the base of the wall farthest from the door were fragments of a dark blue curved glass and a red plastic top the shattered remnants obviously of some container or other there were no signs at all of what the container had once held a few feet away in this wall was an inset rubbersealed glass door behind this i knew lay what the scientists and technicians called the menagerie one of four in mordon i pushed open the door and went inside it was a huge windowless room as large almost as the laboratory itself all the wall spaces and three roomlength benches were taken up by literally hundreds of cages of all types some of a sealedglass construction with their own private airconditioning and filtration units but most of the standard open mesh type hundreds of pairs of eyes mostly small red and beady turned to stare at me as i entered there must have been between fifteen hundred and two thousand animals in that room altogether mostly mice ninety per cent of them mice i should have guessed but also about a hundred rabbits and the same of guinea pigs from what i could see they all seemed in fair enough health anyway all of them had clearly been affected in no way at all by what had happened next door i made my way back to the lab closing the communicating door behind me almost ten minutes id been inside now and nothing had happened to me yet and the chances were remote that anything would happen now i cornered the hamster returned him to his cage and left the lab to open the heavy steel outer door just in time i remembered that general cliveden would be waiting not far from the door ready to fill me full of holes if i emerged still wearing the gassuit cliveden would be understandably triggerhappy and could easily miss the fact that id removed the breathing apparatus i climbed out of the gassuit and opened the door general cliveden had the automatic at eye level at the full stretch of his arm pointing towards the widening crack of the doorway and myself i dont say he was happy at the prospect of shooting me but he was ready enough for it all the same and it was a bit late now to tell him that the hanyatti had a hairtrigger i said quickly its all right the air is clear inside he lowered his arm and smiled in relief not a very happy smile but still a smile maybe the thought had come to him too late in the day that he himself should have volunteered to go inside instead of me are you perfectly sure cavell he asked im alive arent i i said irritably youd better come inside i went back into the lab and waited for them hardanger was first through the door his nose wrinkled in involuntary disgust and he said what in hells name is causing that vile smell botulinus it was colonel weybridge who supplied the answer and in the shadow less neon lighting his face seemed suddenly grey he whispered again botulinus how do you know i demanded how do i he stared down at the floor and looked up to meet my eyes we had an accident a fortnight ago a technician an accident i repeated then nodded you would know the smell but what the devil hardanger began a dead man i explained killed by botulinus at the top of the room its dr baxter no one spoke they looked at me then at each other then followed me silently up the lab to where baxter lay hardanger stared down at the dead man so this is baxter his voice held no expression at all you are quite sure remember he checked out of here about halfpast six last night maybe dr baxter owned a pair of wirecutters i suggested its baxter all right someone coshed him and stood at the lab door and flung a botulinus container against this wall closing the lab door behind him immediately afterwards the fiend cliveden said hoarsely the unspeakable fiend or fiends i agreed i moved across to dr gregori who had sat down on a high stool he had his elbows on a bench his face was sunk in his hands the straining finger tips made pale splotches against the swarthy cheeks and his hands were shaking i touched him on the shoulder and said im sorry dr oregon as you said i know youre neither soldier nor policeman you shouldnt have to meet with those things but you must help us yes of course he said dully he looked up at me and the dark eyes were smudged and with tears in them he was he was more than just a colleague how can i help mr cavell the virus cupboard check it please of course of course the virus cupboard what on earth could i have been thinking of he stared down at baxter in fascinated horror and it was quite obvious what he was thinking of at once at once he crossed to a wooden cupboard with a glazed front and tried to open it a couple of determined tugs and then he shook his head its locked the doors locked well i was impatient you have the key havent you the only key nobody could have got in without this key not without force it it hasnt been touched dont be so damned silly what do you think baxter died of influenza open that cupboard he turned the key with unsteady fingers no one was looking at baxter now wed eyes only for dr oregon he opened both doors reached up and brought down a small rectangular box he opened the lid and stared inside after a moment his shoulders sagged and he seemed different altogether curiously deflated head bowed very low theyre gone he whispered all of them all nine of them have been taken six of them were botulinus he must have used one on baxter and the others i said harshly to the bowed back the other three the satan bug he said fearfully the satan bug its gone chapter four the management refectory canteen at mordon had something of a reputation among the more gourmetminded of the staff and the chef that had prepared our lunch was right on form maybe the presence at our table of dr macdonald a colleague of oregons in number one lab and president of the mess had something to do with it however it was it seemed that i was the only person with an appetite at all that day hardanger only picked at his food and neither cliveden nor weybridge made hardly any better a showing gregori ate nothing at all just sat staring at his plate he excused himself abruptly in the middle of the meal and when he came back in five minutes he looked white and shaken probably i thought hed been sick violent death wouldnt be much in the line of a professor specialising in the cloistered work of chemical research the two fingerprint experts werent there they were still hungry aided by three other detectives recruited locally through inspector wylie theyd spent over an hour and a half fingerprinting the entire inside of the laboratory and were now collating and tabulating their results the handle of the heavy steel door and the areas adjoining the combination lock had been heavily smeared with a cotton or linen material probably a handkerchief so the possibility of an outsider having been at work couldnt be entirely excluded inspector martin came in towards the end of the meal hed spent all his time until then taking statements from the temporarily jobless scientists and technicians barred from e block and he wasnt finished yet by a long way every statement made by those interviewed about their activities the previous evening would have to be rigorously checked he didnt say how he was getting on and hardanger predictably didnt ask him after lunch i accompanied hardanger to the main gate from the sergeant on duty there we learnt who had been in charge of the checkingout clock the previous evening after a few minutes a tall blond freshfaced corporal appeared and saluted crisply corporal norris sir you sent for me yes hardanger said take a seat please ive sent for you norris to ask you some questions about the murder of dr harold baxter the shock tactics worked better than any amount of carefully delicate probing could have done norris already in the purpose of lowering himself gingerly into his chair sat down heavily as if suddenly grateful to take the weight off his feet and stared at hardanger the eyes widening in a gaze of shocked incredulity the opened mouth would have been within the compass of any moderately competent actor but the perceptible draining of colour from the cheeks was something else again the murder of dr baxter he repeated stupidly dr baxter hes dead murdered hardanger said harshly he was murdered in his laboratory last night we know for a fact never mind how that dr baxter never left mordon last night but you checked him out you say you checked him out but you didnt you couldnt have done who gave you his security tag and told you to forge his signature or maybe that someone did it himself how much did they pay you norris the corporal had been staring at hardanger in numbed bewilderment then the numbness passed and his native yorkshire toughness reasserted itself he rose slowly to his feet his face darkening look sir he said softly i dont know who you are someone pretty important i suppose a police inspector or one of those mi chaps but i can tell you this say that to me just once again and knock your bloody head clean off i relieve you would too hardanger was suddenly smiling he turned to me not guilty eh he could hardly be that good i agreed i hardly think so forgive me norris i had to find out something and i had to find out fast im investigating a murder murder isnt a nice business and sometimes ive got to use tactics that arent very nice either understand yes sir norris said uncertainly he was slightly mollified but only slightly dr baxter how i mean who m never mind that just now hardanger said briskly you checked him out in this book here eighteen thirtytwo hours it says that right if the book says so sir that time stamps automatic you took his security tag from him this one he held it up yes sir didnt happen to speak to him did you as a matter of fact sir yes about what just the weather and the like sir he was always very friendly to us chaps and his cold about his cold hed a pretty bad one coughing and blowing his nose all the time you saw him clearly course i did ive been guard here for eighteen months and i know dr baxter as well as my own mother dressed in his usual checked ulster trilby and those heavy horn glasses of his youd swear to it in court that it was dr baxter i mean he hesitated then said id swear to it and both my mates on duty saw him also you cancheck with them we checked then left to return to the administrative block i said did you really think baxter stayed behind last night no hardanger admitted he left all right and came back with his pliers either alone or with someone else which on the face of it would appear to make baxter a bad un but it seems that an even badder un disposed of him when thieves fall out perhaps you thought the signature genuine as genuine as any signature can ever be no one ever signs his signature the same way twice i think ill get onto the general in london straight away an allout check on baxter might turn up something very interesting especially past contacts youll be wasting your time from the point of view of security baxter was sitting in the hottest seat in europe boss of number one lab in mordon every step hes taken from the day he learnt to walk every word hes said since every person hes met they would have checked and rechecked a hundred times baxters clean hes just too big a fish to get through the security mesh so were a number of other characters who are now either in jail or moscow hardanger said grimly im phoning london now then checking with wvlie to see if theyve turned up anything on that bedford that was used as a getaway car then im going to see how martin and the fingerprint boys are getting on coming no id like to check with the internal guards who were on duty last night and mooch around on my own a little he shrugged ive no jurisdiction over you cavell but if anything turns up youll let me know he added suspiciously think im crazy with a guy walking around with the satan bug in his vest pocket do you think im going to start a oneman war he nodded still a little suspiciously and left me i spent the next hour checking with the six internal guards who had been on duty before midnight the previous night and learnt what i had expected to learn nothing all of them were wellknown to me which was probably the real reason why hardanger had wanted me down in mordon and all of them had been on duty in mordon for at least three years all of their stories tallied and none of it helped at all with two guards i made a minute check of all windows and the entire roof area of e block and i was just wasting my time no one had seen clandon from the time he left lieutenant wilkinson at the gatehouse just after pm till his body had been found normally no one would have expected to see him for after making his rounds clandon retired for the night to the little concrete cottage he had to himself less than a hundred yards from e block this cottage faced on the long glass corridor of the block where as a security precaution the lights burned night and day it was no great trick to guess that clandon had seen something suspicious in e block and gone to investigate no other reason could have accounted for his presence outside number one laboratory i made my way to the gatehouse and asked for the register book showing the names and nature of business of all those who had checked in and out of mordon the previous day there were several hundred of those altogether but all but a very few of them were staff regularly employed there groups of special visitors to mordon were not infrequent visiting scientists from the commonwealth and nato countries or an occasional small group of mps who were given to asking awkward questions in the commons and were brought down to mordon to see for themselves the sterling work being carried out there oil the health front against anthrax polio asian flu and other diseases such groups were shown exactly what the mordon authorities wanted them to be shown and usually came away no wiser than they had arrived but on that previous day there had been no such groups of visitors there had been fourteen callers altogether all of them concerned with the delivery of various supplies i copied down their names and the reasons for their visits and left i phoned the local carhire firm asked for the indefinite hire of one of their cars and that it should be brought and left at the gates of mordon another call to alfringham this time to the waggoners rest and i was lucky enough to get a room the last call was to london to mary i told her to pack a suitcase for me and one for herself and bring them both down to the waggoners rest there was a train from paddington that would get her down by halfpast six i left the gatehouse and went for a walk through the grounds the air was cold and a chill october wind blowing but i didnt walk briskly i paced slowly up and down beside the inner fence head bowed gazing down at my feet most of the time cavell lost in thought or so i hoped any onlooker would think i spent the better part of an hour there paralleling the same quarter mile of fence all the time and at last i found what i was looking for or so i thought next circuit round i stopped to tic my shoelace and then there was no more doubt in my mind hardanger was still in the administrative block when i found him he and inspector martin were poring over freshly developed batches of photographic prints hardanger looked up and grunted hows it going its not any progress with you no prints on clandons wallet cigarette case or books of matches except his own of course nothing of any interest on the doors weve found the bedford van rather inspector wylies men have found a bedford van reported missing this afternoon by a chap called hendry an alfringham carrier with three of those vans found less than an hour ago by a motorcycle cop in the hailem woods sent my men across there to try it for prints its as good a way of wasting time as any maybe do you know the hailem woods i nodded halfway between here and alfringham theres a b road forks off to the north about a mile and a half along that road there may have been woods there once but theyve gone now you wouldnt find a couple of dozen trees in the entire area now outside gardens that is residential whats called a good neighbourhood this fellow hendry a check been made yes nothing there one of those solid citizens not only the backbone of england but a personal friend of inspector wylies they play darts for the same pub team that hardanger said heavily puts him beyond the range of all suspicion youre getting bitter i nodded at the prints from number one lab i take it a firstclass job i wonder which of the prints belongs to the man who stays nearest to the spot where the bedford was found he gave me an upfromunder glance as obvious as that is it isnt it it would seem to leave him pretty well out dumping the evidence on your own doorstep is as good a way as any of putting the noose round your own neck unless thats the way were intended to think fellow called chessingham know him research chemist i know him would you vouch for him in this business i wouldnt vouch for st peter but id wager a months pay hes clear i wouldnt were checking his story and well see well see how many of the prints have you identified fifteen sets altogether as far as we can make out but weve been able to trace only thirteen i thought for a minute then nodded that would be about right dr baxter dr gregori dr macdonald dr hartnell chessingham then the four technicians in that lab verity heath robinson and marsh nine clandon one of the night guards and of course cliveden and weybridge running a check on them what do you think hardanger said testily including cliveden and weybridge cliveden and weybridge hardanger stared at me and martin backed him up with another stare are you serious cavell with someone running around with the satan bug in his pants pockets i dont think its the time for being facetious hardanger nobody nobody is in the clear he gave me a long hard look but i ignored it and went on about those two sets of unidentified prints well print every man in mordon till we get them hardanger said grimly you dont have to almost certainly they belong to a couple of men called bryson and chipperfield i know them both explain yourself theyre the two men hi charge of running alfringhain farm the place that supplies all the animals for the experiments carried out here theyre usually up here with a fresh supply of animals every week or so the turnover in livestock is pretty heavy they were here yesterday i checked on the register book making a delivery to the animal room in number one laboratory you say you know them what are they like young steady hardworking very reliable live in adjacent cottages on the farm married to a couple of very nice girls they have a kid apiece a boy and a girl about six years old not the type any of them to get mixed up in anything wrong you guarantee them you heard what i said about st peter i guarantee nothing and nobody theyll have to be checked ill go if you like after all i have the advantage of knowing them you will hardanger let me have his close look again like to take inspector martin with you all one to me i assured him it wasnt but id manners then in that case its not necessary hardanger said there were times i thought when hardanger could be downright unpleasant report back anything you find ill lay on a car for you i already have one carhire firm he frowned that was unnecessary plenty of police and army cars available you know that im a private citizen now i prefer private transport i found the car at the gate like so many rental machines it was a great deal older than its actual age but at least it rolled and took the weight off my feet i was glad to take the weight off my feet my left leg hurt quite badly as it always did when i had to walk around for any length of time two eminent london surgeons had more than once pointed out to me the advantage of having my left foot removed and sworn that they could replace it with an artificial one not only indistinguishable from the genuine article but guaranteed painfree they had been quite enthusiastic about it but it wasnt their foot and i preferred to hang on to it as long as possible i drove to alfringham spent five minutes mere talking to the manager of the local dancehall and reached alfringham farm just as dusk was falling i turned in through the gates stopped the car outside the first of the two cottages got out and rang the bell after the third attempt i gave it up and drove to the second cottage id get an answer there lights were burning behind the windows i leaned on the bell and after some seconds the door opened i blinked in the sudden wash of light then recognised the man before me bryson i said how are you sorry to burst in like this but im afraid ive a very good reason mr cavell unmistakable surprise in his voice all the more pronounced in the sudden conversational hush from the room behind him didnt expect to see you again so soon thought youd left these parts i did how are you sir id like a few words with you and with chipperfield but hes not at home hes here with his missus turn about in each others house for our saturday night get together he hesitated exactly as i would have done if id settled down with some friends for a quiet drink and a stranger broke in delighted to have you join us sir ill keep you only a few minutes i followed bryson into the brightly lit livingroom beyond a log fire burnt cheerfully in the fireplace and around it were a couple of small settees and a high chair or two in the centre was a low table with some bottles and glasses a comfortable homely scene a man and two women rose as bryson closed the door behind me i knew all three chipperfield a tall blond man the outward antithesis in every way of the short stocky bryson and the two mens wives blonde and dark to match their husbands but otherwise was a strong similarity small neat and pretty with identical hazel eyes the similarity was hardly surprising mrs bryson and mrs chipperfield were sisters after a couple of minutes during which civilities had been exchanged and id been offered a drink and accepted for my sore legs sake bryson said how can we help you mr cavell were trying to clear up a mystery about dr baxter i said quietly you might be able to help i dont know dr baxter in number one lab bryson glanced at his brotherinlaw ted and me we saw him only yesterday quite a chat with him we had nothing wrong with him sir i hope he was murdered last night i said mrs bryson clapped her hands to her mourn and choked off a scream her sister made some sort of unidentifiable noise and said no oh no but i wasnt watching them i was watching bryson and chipperfield and i didnt have to be a detective to see that the news came as a complete shock and surprise to both of them i went on he was killed last night before midnight in his lab someone threw a deadly virus poison over him and he must have died in minutes and in great agony then that someone found mr clandon waiting outside the lab and disposed of him also by cyanide poisoning mrs bryson rose to her feet her face paperwhite her sisters arms around her blindly threw her cigarette into the fireplace and left the room i could hear the sound of someone being sick in the bathroom dr baxter and mr clandon dead murdered brysons face was almost as pale as his wifes had been i dont believe it i looked at his face again he believed it all right he listened to the sounds coming from the bathroom and then said with as much angry reproach as his shaken state would allow you might have told us private like mr cavell without the girls being here i mean im sorry i tried to look sorry im not myself dandon was my best friend you did it on purpose chipperfield said tightly he was normally a likeable and affable young man but there was nothing affable about him right then he said shrewdly you wanted to see how we all took it you wanted to know if we had anything to do with it isnt that it mr cavell between eleven oclock and midnight last night i said precisely you and your brotherinlaw here were up for exactly five dances at the friday night hop in alfringham youve been going there practically every friday night for years i could even tell you the names of the dances but i wont bother the point is that neither of you nor your wives left the hall for an instant during that hour afterwards you went straight into your landrover and arrived back here shortly after twelvetwenty we have established beyond all doubt that both murders took place between and pm so lets have no more of your silly accusations chipperfield there can be no shadow of suspicion about you two if there was youd be in a police cell not seeing me here drinking your whisky speaking of whisky sorry mr cavell damned silly of me saying what i did i mean chipperfields relief showed in his face as he rose to his feet and poured more whisky into my glass some of it spilled on to the carpet but he didnt seem to notice but if you know weve nothing to do with it what can we do to help you can tell me everything that happened when you were in e block yesterday i said everything what you did what you saw what dr baxter said to you and you to him dont miss out a thing the tiniest detail so they told me taking it in turns and i sat there looking at them with unwavering attention and not bothering to listen to a word they said as they talked the two women came in mrs bryson giving me a pale shamefaced halfsmile but i didnt notice it i was too busy doing my close listening act as soon as the first decent opportunity came i finished my whisky rose and made to leave mrs bryson said something apologetic about her silliness i said something suitably apologetic in return and bryson said sorry we havent been able to be of any real help mr cavell you have helped i said police work is largely confined to the confirming and eliminating of possibilities youve eliminated more than you would think im sorry i caused such an upset i realise this must be quite a shock to both your families being so closely associated with mordon speaking of families where are the kids tonight not here thank goodness mr chipperfield said with their grandmother in kent the october holidays you know and they always go there then best place for them right now i agreed i made my apologies again cut the leavetaking short and left it was quite dark outside now i made my way back down to the hired car climbed in drove out through the farm gates and turned left for the town of alfringham four hundred yards beyond the gates i pulled into a convenient layby switched off engine and lights my leg was aching badly now and it took me almost fifteen minutes to get back to brysons cottage the livingroom curtains were drawn but carelessly i could see all i wanted to without trouble mrs bryson was sitting on a settee sobbing bitterly with her husbands free arm round her the other held a tumbler of whisky and the tumbler was more than half full chipperfield a similar glass in his band was staring into the fire his face dark and sombre mrs chipperfield on the settee was facing me i couldnt see her face only the fair hair shining in the lamplight as she bent over something held in her hand i couldnt see what it was but i didnt have to i could guess with the certainty of complete knowledge i walked quietly away and took my time in making my way back to the car i still had twentyfive minutes before the london train was due in alfringham the train and mary mary cavell was all my life two months only id been married to her but i knew it would be that way till the end of my days all my life an easy thing for any man to say easy and trite and meaningless and perhaps a little cheap until you saw her that was then you would believe anything she was small and blonde and beautiful with amazing green eyes but it wasnt that that made her special you could reach out your arms in the streets of london in the evening rush hour and pick up half a dozen girls without really trying all of them small and blonde and beautiful nor was it just the infectious happiness that left no one untouched her irrepressible gaiety her obvious delight in a life that she lived with the intensity of a tropical hummingbird there was something else there was a shining quality about her in her face in her eyes in her voice in everything she said and did that made her the only person id ever known whod never had an enemy male or female there is only one word to describe this quality the oldfashioned and much maligned term goodness she hated dogooders those she called the goodygoodies but her own goodness surrounded her like a tangible and visible magnetic field a magnetic field that automatically drew to her more waifs and strays more people broken in mind and body than a normal person would encounter in a dozen lifetimes an old man dozing away his last days in the thin autumn sunshine on a park bench a bird with a broken wing they all came alike to mary broken wings were her speciality and i was only now beginning to realise that for every wing we saw her mend there was another the world knew nothing about and to make her perfect she had the one drawback which kept her from being inhumanly perfect she had an explosive temper that could erupt in a most spectacular fashion and to the accompaniment of the most shockingly appropriate language but only when she saw the bird with the broken wing or the person responsible for breaking it she was my wife and i still wondered why she married me she could have chosen almost any man shed ever known but shed chosen me i think it was because i had a broken wing the german tanktrack that had crushed my leg in the mud at caen the gasshell that had scarred one whole side of my face adonis would never have claimed it for his own anyway beyond hope of plastic surgery and left me with a left eye that could just barely tell the difference between night and day that made me a bird with a broken wing the train came in and i saw her jumping down lightly from a compartment about twenty yards away followed by a burly middleaged character with a bowler hat and umbrella carrying her suitcase the dead image of the big city tycoon who spends his business hours grinding in the faces of the poor and evicting widows and orphans id never seen him before and i was certain neither had mary she just had the effect on people the most unlikely citizens fought each other for the privilege of helping her and the tycoon looked quite a fighter she came running down the platform to meet me and i braced myself for the shock of impact there was nothing inhibited about marys greetings and although i still wasnt reconciled to the raised eyebrows of astonished fellowtravellers i was getting accustomed to them id last seen her only this morning but i might have been a long lost loved one coming home for the first time after a generation in the australian outback i was setting her down on terra firma as the tycoon came up dumped the cases beamed at mary tipped his bowler turned away still beaming at her and tripped over a railway barrow when hed got up and dusted himself he was still beaming he tipped his bowler again and disappeared you want to be careful how you smile at your boyfriends i said severely want me to spend the rest of my life working to pay off claims for damages against you that oppressor of the working class that just passed by hed have me wearing the same suit for the rest of my life he was a very nice man indeed she looked up at me suddenly not smiling pierre cavell youre tired worried stiff and your leg is hurting cavells face is a mask i said impossible to tell his feelings and thoughts inscrutable they call it ask anyone and youve been drinking whisky it was the long separation that drove me to it i led the way to the car were staying at the waggoners rest it sounds wonderful thatched roofs oak beams the inglenooks by the blazing fire she shivered it is cold cant get there fast enough we got there in three minutes i parted the car outside a modernistic confection in gleaming glass and chrome mary looked at it then at me and said this is the waggoners rest you can see what the neon sign says outdoor sanitation and bollweevils in the bedposts have gone out of fashion and theyll have central heating the manager at the moment doubling as receptionist would have felt more at home in an eighteenthcentury waggoners rest redfaced shirtsleeved and smelling powerfully of the breweries he scowled at me smiled at mary and summoned a tenyearold boy presumably his son who showed us to our room it was clean enough and spacious enough and overlooked a back courtyard decked out in a poor imitation of a continental beer garden more important one of the windows overlooked the porchway leading into the court the door closed behind the boy and mary came up to me how is that stupid leg of yours pierre honestly its not so good id given up trying to tell lies about myself to mary as far as i was concerned she was a human liedetector itll ease up it always does that armchair she ordered and the stool so youre not using that leg again tonight im afraid ill have to quite a bit damn nuisance but it cant be helped it can be helped she insisted you dont have to do everything yourself there are plenty of men not this time im afraid i have to go out twice i want you to come with me the first tune thats why i wanted you here she didnt ask any questions she picked up the phone ordered whisky for me sherry for herself old shirtsleeves brought it up huffing a bit after climbing the stairs mary smiled at him and said could we have dinner in our room please dinner shirtsleeves stiffened in outrage his face going an impossible shade redder in your room dinner thats a good un where do you think youve landed claridges he brought his gaze down from the ceiling where hed been imploring heaven and looked at mary again he opened his mouth to speak closed it kept looking at her and i knew he was a lost man claridges he repeated mechanically i well ill see what can be done against the house rules mind you but itll be a pleasure maam he left i said there should be a law against you pour me some whisky and pass that phone i made three calls the first was to london the second to inspector wylie and the third to hardanger he was still at mordon he sounded tired and irritated and i didnt wonder hed had a long and probably frustrating day cavell his voice was almost a bark how did you get on with those two men you saw at the farm i mean bryson and chipperfield nothing there there are two hundred witnesses who will swear that neither of them were within five miles of mordon between eleven and midnight last night what are you talking about two hundred they were at a dance anything turned up in the statements made by our other suspects in number one lab did you expect anything to turn up he said sourly do you think the killer would have been so dumb as to leave himself without an alibi theyve all got alibis and damn good ones im still not convinced there wasnt an outsider at work chessingham and dr hartnell how strong are their stories why those two his voice was a suspicious crackle im interested in them im going to see them tonight and i wondered what their stories were youre not going to see anyone without my sayso cavell his voice was pretty close to a shout i dont want people blundering in i wont blunder im going hardanger the general said i was to have a free hand didnt he blocking my way which you can do is not my idea of giving a free hand the general wouldnt like it hardanger a silence hardanger was bringing himself under control at last he said in a quieter tone you gave me to believe that you didnt suspect chessingham i want to see him hes not only acute and observant hes more than usually friendly with dr hartnell its hartnell im really interested in hes an outstanding research man young and financially irresponsible he thinks because hes clever with bugs he can be the same on the stock market three months ago hartnell put all his cash into a flybynight company whod splurged their adverts in all the national dailies he lost the lot then he mortgaged his house a few weeks before i left mordon i believe he lost most of that too trying to recoup why the hell didnt you tell me before hardanger demanded it just suddenly came to me this evening it just suddenly came hardangers voice cut off as if he had been strangled then he said thoughtfully isnt that too easy jumping on hartnell because hes heading for the bankruptcy court i dont know as i say hes not clever at everything ive got to find out both have alibis of course both were at home their families vouch for them i want to see you later hed given up ill be at the county in alfringham im at the waggoners rest a couple of minutes away could you come round to see us about ten us mary came down this afternoon mary there was surprise in his voice suspicion that he didnt get round to elaborating but above all pleasure one good reason hardanger had for not liking me too much was that id made off with the best secretary hed ever had shed been with him three years and if any person could ever be said to be the apple of an eye like a basilisk it was mary he said he would be around at ten chapter five i drove out to hailem woods with mary sitting strangely silent by my side over dinner id told her the whole story the whole story id never seen her scared before but she was that now badly two frightened people in a car we reached chessinghams house about a quarter to eight it was an oldfashioned flatroofed stonebuilt affair with long narrow windows and a flight of stone steps leading up to the front door over a moatlike trench that ran right round the house and gave light to the basement high trees sighing in the cold night wind surrounded the house on four sides and it was beginning to rain heavily it was a place and a night in keeping with our mood chessingham had heard the car and met us at the top of the steps he looked pale and strained but there was nothing in that everyone who was in anyway connected with e block had every reason for looking pale and strained that day cavell he said he didnt offer his hand but opened the door wide and stood sideways to let us in i heard you were in mordon must say i didnt expect you out here though i thought they asked me enough questions today as it was this is a pretty unofficial visit i assured him my wife chessingham when i bring along my wife i leave the handcuffs at home it wasnt funny he shook hands reluctantly with mary and led us into an oldfashioned sittingroom with heavy edwardian furniture velvet drapes from ceiling to floor and a fire burning in a huge open fireplace there were two people sitting in highbacked armchairs by the fire one was a goodlooking young girl of nineteen or twenty slender brownhaired and browneyed like chessingham himself his sister the other obviously was his mother but much older than i had expected his mother to be a closer inspection showed that she wasnt really so old she just looked old her hair was white her eyes had that curious glaze you sometimes see on old people who are coming to the end of their road and the hands resting on her lap were thin and wrinkled and crisscrossed with blue veins not an old woman a sick woman a very sick woman prematurely aged but she sat very erect and there was a welcoming smile on her thin rather aristocratic features mr and mrs cavell chessingham said youve heard me speak of mr cavell my mother my sister stella how do you do both of you mrs chessingham had that assured direct nononsense voice that would have gone well with a victorian drawingroom and a houseful of servants she peered at mary my eyes arent what they used to be im afraid but my goodness you are a beautiful girl come and sit beside me how on earth did you manage it mr cavell i think she must have mistaken me for someone else i said these things happen mrs chessingham said precisely for all their age her eyes could still twinkle she went on that was a dreadful thing that happened out at mordon today mr cavell dreadful i have been hearing all about it a pause again the halfsmile i hope you havent come to take eric to jail already mr cavell he hasnt even had dinner yet all this excitement you know your sons only connection with this affair mrs chessingham is that he is unfortunate enough to work in number one laboratory our only interest in him is his complete and final elimination as a suspect every narrowing of the field is an advancement of a kind he doesnt have to be eliminated mrs chessingham said with some asperity eric has nothing to do with it the idea is ridiculous of course you know that i know that but superintendent hardanger who is in charge of investigations doesnt know that all statements must be checked no matter how unnecessary the checking i had a great deal of difficulty in persuading the superintendent that i should come instead of one of his own officers i saw marys eyes widen but she recovered herself quickly and why did you do that mr cavell i was beginning to feel sorry for young chessingham he must have felt foolish and ineffectual with his mother taking command in this fashion because i know your son the police dont saves seventyfive per cent of the questioning straight away and special branch detectives can ask a great number of brutal and unnecessary questions in a case like this i dont doubt it nor do i doubt that you could be as ruthless as any man ive ever known if the occasion arose but i know you wont on this occasion she sighed and shifted her hands to the arms of her chair i hope you will excuse me i am an old woman and not very well and so i have some privileges dinner in bed is one she turned and smiled at mary id like to talk to you my child i have so few callers i make the most of them would you like to help me negotiate those dreadful stairs while stella sees to the dinner when we were alone chessingham said sorry about mother she does tend i think shes a wonderful woman no need to apologise his face lightened a little at that about your statement you said you were at home all night mother and sister will of course vouch for that of course he smiled theyd vouch for it whether i was at home or not id be surprised if they wouldnt after seeing them i nodded your mother could say anything and she would be believed not your sister shes young and inexperienced and any competent policeman could break her down inside five minutes if you were in any way involved youre too smart not to see that so your story has to be true can they vouch for the entire night up to elevenfifteen say no he frowned stella went to bed about tenthirty after that i spent a couple of hours on the roof chessinghams observatory ive heard of it no one can prove you were up there no he frowned again thinking does it matter i havent even a bicycle and theres no public transport at that time of night if i was here after tenthirty i couldnt have made it to mordon by elevenfifteen anyway four and a half miles you know do you know how the crime was carried out i asked i mean have you heard by someone making a diversion to allow someone else to cut through the fences the red herring got away in a bedford van stolen from alfringham id heard something like that the police werent very communicative but rumours get around did you know that the van was found abandoned only one hundred and fifty yards from your house a hundred and fifty yards he seemed genuinely startled then stared moodily into the fire thats bad isnt it is it he thought briefly then grinned im not as smart as you think its not bad its good if i were driving that van id have had to go to alfringham first for it after leaving here at tenthirty also if i were the driver then i obviously couldnt have gone to mordon id have been making my supposed getaway thirdly i wouldnt have been so damned stupid as to park it at my front door fourthly i cant drive thats pretty conclusive i admitted i can make it even more conclusive he said excitedly lord im not thinking at all tonight come up to the observatory we went up the stairs we passed a door on the first floor and i could hear the subdued murmur of voices mrs chessingham and mary talking a slingsby ladder led us up into a square hut affair built in the centre of the flat roof one end of the hut was blanked off with plywood an entrance covered by a hanging curtain at the other end was a surprisingly large reflector telescope set in a perspex cupola my only hobby chessingham said the strain had left his face to be replaced by the eager excitement of the enthusiast im a member of the british astronomical association jupiter section and a regular correspondent for a couple of astronomical journals some of them depend almost exclusively on the work of amateurs like myself and i can tell you that theres nothing less amateurish than an amateur astronomer whos been well and truly bitten by the bug i wasnt in bed till almost two oclock this morning i was making a series of photographs for the astronomical monthly of the red spot in jupiter and the satellite lo occulting its own shadow he was smiling broadly in his relief now heres the letter commissioning me to do them theyve been pleased with some other stuff ive sent in i glanced at the letter it had to be genuine of course got a set of six photographs beauties too although i say it myself here ill let you see them he disappeared behind the curtain which i took to be the entrance of his darkroom and reappeared with a batch of obviously very new photographs i took them they looked terrible to me just a bunch of greyish dots and streaks against a fuzzily dark background not bad eh not bad i paused and said suddenly could anyone tell from those pictures when they were taken thats why i brought you up here take those to the greenwich observatory have them work out the precise latitude and longitude of this house and they could tell you within thirty seconds when each of these photographs were taken go on take them with you no thanks i handed back the photographs and smiled at him i know when ive already wasted enough tone and ive wasted far too much send them to the astronomical monthly with my best wishes we found mary and stella talking by the fireside a few civilities a polite refusal of a drink and we were on our way once in the car i turned the heater switch up as far as it would go but it didnt seem to make any difference the switch probably wasnt attached to any heater it was bitterly cold and raining heavily i hoped the rain would ease i said to mary what did you find out i hate this business she said intensely i hate it this sneaking underhand approach to people the lies the lies to a lovely old person like mrs chessingham and to that nice girl to think i worked all those years for the superintendent and never thought i know i said but you have to fight fire with fire think of this double murderer think of this man with the satan bug in his pocket think of im sorry i really am sorry its just that im afraid i was never cut out to be well never mind i didnt find out much they have a maid thats why dinner was ready shortly after stella rose stella lives at home her brother insists on it insists she spends all her time looking after her mother her mother is really pretty ill i gathered from stella may go at any time though shes been told by her doctor that a transfer to a warm climate like greece or spain might add ten years to her life some dangerous combination of asthma and a heart condition but her mother doesnt want to go says shed rather die in wiltshire than vegetate in alicante something like that that was all im afraid it was enough it was more than enough i sat without speaking thinking maybe the surgeons who wanted to give me a new foot had the right of it when mary said abruptly and you learn anything i told her what had happened at the end she said i heard you telling the superintendent that you really wanted to see chessingham to find out what you could from him about dr hartnell what did you find out nothing never asked him you never why on earth not i told her why not dr hartnell and his wife they had no children were at home both of them knew mary wed met socially once during the brief time mary had been staying with me when i lived in mordon but they clearly didnt regard our visit as a social call everyone i was meeting was nervous very much on the defensive i didnt blame them id have been nervous too if i thought someone was trying to hang a couple of murders round my neck i went through the spiel about how my visit was only a formality and the unpleasant experience i was sparing them by coming myself instead of letting one of hardangers men do the questioning their activities in the earlier part of the evening were of no interest to me i asked them about the later part and they told me at ninethirty they said they had sat down to watch television specifically the golden cavaliers a tv version of a successful stage play that had just finished a long run in london did you see that mary broke in so did i pierre was out late last night with a business friend and i turned it on i thought it was wonderful for some minutes they discussed the play i knew mary had seen it and i knew she was finding out whether they also had really seen it and there was no question but that they had after some time i said when did it finish about eleven and then a quick bite of supper and bed hartnell said by say eleventhirty by that at the latest well thats perfectly satisfactory i heard mary clear her throat and looked across casually her steepled fingers were resting lightly in her lap i knew what that meant hartnell was lying this i couldnt understand but id infinite faith in her judgement i glanced at the clock id asked for a call at eightthirty and now it was exactly that inspector wylie was on time the bell rang hartnell spoke into the phone then handed it to me for you cavell the police i think i spoke holding the earpiece fractionally away from my head wylie had a naturally carrying voice and id asked him to be good and loud he was he said cavell ah you told me you were going to be there so i took a chance this is urgent nasty spot of bother at hailem junction close tieup with mordon if im not mistaken very unpleasant indeed can you get down there immediately as soon as i can wheres hailem junction not half a mile from where you are the bottom of the lane turn right and pass the green man just there i hung up rose and hesitated that was inspector wylie some trouble at hailem junction i wonder if i could leave mary here for a few minutes the inspector said it was something unpleasant of course with his alibi accepted dr hartnell was almost jovial well look after her old man i parked the car a couple of hundred yards down the lane took my torch from the glove box and turned back towards hartnells house a quick look through the lit window and i knew i had nothing to fear from that quarter hartnell was pouring drinks and all three seemed to be talking animatedly the way people do when the strain is off i knew i could rely on mary keeping them talking there indefinitely mrs hartnell i noticed was still sitting in the chair shed been occupying on our arrival she hadnt even risen to greet us maybe her legs were troubling her elastic stockings arent as undetectable as some manufacturers would like to think the garage was locked by a heavy padlock but the master locksmith who had been responsible for a tiny part of the training of myself and a score of others in the now distant past would have laughed at it i didnt laugh at it i was no master locksmith but even so i had it open in less than two minutes i hardly cut myself at all somewhere along the line hartnells illadvised plunge into the stock market had compelled him to sell his car and now his sole means of transport was a vespa scooter although i knew he used a bus to and from mordon the scooter was in good condition and looked as if it had been cleaned recently but i wasnt interested in the clean parts only the dirty ones i examined the machine closely and finally scraped off some of the dried mud under the front mudguard and put it in a polythene bag which i sealed i spent another two minutes looking around the garage left and locked it another quick check on the livingroom showed the three of them sitting round the fire drinking and talking i made my way to the toolshed behind the garage another padlock from where i was i was now completely hidden from the house so i took the chance of having a good long look at the padlock then i picked it and went inside the shed was no bigger than seven by five and it took me no longer than ten seconds to find what i was after there had been no attempt to conceal anything i used another couple of polythene bags closed and locked the door behind me and made my way back to the car soon afterwards i parked the car in hartnells driveway hartnell answered the doorbell that didnt take you long cavell he said cheerfully as he led me into the lounge what was his smile died away as he saw my face was there is there something wrong im afraid there is i said coldly something very far wrong youre in trouble dr hartnell im afraid it looks to me like pretty bad trouble would you care to tell me about it trouble his face tightened but there was the shadow of fear in his eyes what the devil are you talking about cavell come off it i said i put some value on my time if you dont on yours and its because i refuse to waste my time that im not going to hunt around for any fancy gentlemanly words to express myself to be brief and blunt hartnell youre a fluent liar youve gone too far damn you cavell his face was pale his fists were clenched and you could see that he was actively considering having a go at me which as a medical man forty pounds lighter than i was he should have recognised as an unpromising course of action i wont take that line of talk from any man youll have to take it from the prosecuting counsel in the old bailey so you might as well have some practice in getting used to it if you saw the golden cavaliers last night as you claimed you must have had the tv set balanced on the handlebars of your scooter the police constable who saw you passing through hailem late last night made no mention of a tv set i assure you cavell i havent the faintest idea you make me ill i said disgustedly lies i can forgive but stupidity in a man of your calibre no i looked at mary about this play the golden cavaliers she lifted her shoulders in discomfort and distress all tv broadcasts in southern england were badly affected by electrical disturbances last night there were three breakdowns in the play and it didnt finish until twenty minutes to twelve you must have a very special tv set indeed i said to hartnell i crossed to a magazine stand and picked up a copy of the radio times but before i could open it hartnells wife spoke a tremor in her voice you neednt bother mr cavell last nights play was a repeat of sunday afternoons we saw the play on sunday she turned to her husband come on tom youll only make it worse for yourself hartnell stared miserably at her turned away slumped down in a chair and drained his glass in a couple of gulps he didnt offer me any but i didnt add lack of hospitality to his list of faults maybe the time wasnt right he said i was out last night i left here just after tenthirty i had a phone call from a man asking me to meet him in alfringham who was the man it doesnt matter i didnt see him he wasnt there when i arrived it wouldnt have been our old pal tenpercent tuffnell of tuffnell and hanbury consultantsatlaw he stared at me tuffnell do you know tuffnell the ancient legal firm of tuffnell and hanbury is known to the police of a dozen counties they style themselves consultantsatlaw anybody can call themselves consultantsatlaw theres no such thing so the bonafide legal eagles cant take any action against them tuffnells only knowledge of law comes from the fairly frequent occasions on which he had been hauled before the assize judges usually on charges of bribery and corruption theyre one of the biggest moneylending firms in the country and by all odds the most ruthless but how how did you guess no guess that it was tuffnell a certainty only a man with a powerful hold over you could have got you out at that time of night and tuffnell has that hold he not only holds the mortgage on your house but also your note of hand for another ј who told you that hartnell whispered no one i found out for myself you dont think youre employed in the laboratory with the highest security rating in britain without our knowing everything about you we know more about your own past than you know yourself thats the literal truth tuffnell it was en hartnell nodded he told me he wanted to see me at eleven sharp i protested naturally but he said that unless i did what i was told hed not only foreclose on the mortgage but hed have me in the bankruptcy court for that five hundred pounds i shook my head you scientists are all the same outside the four walls of your lab you ought to be locked up a man who lends you money does so at his own risk and has no legal recourse so he wasnt there no i waited a quarter of an hour then went to his house a whacking great mansion with tennis courts swimming pool and what have you hartnell said bitterly i thought he might have made a mistake about the meeting place he wasnt there there was nobody there i went back to the alfringham office and waited a little longer then came home about midnight it was anybody see you you see anybody anybody who can vouch for your story nobody nobody at all it was late at night and the roads were deserted it was bitterly cold he paused then brightened that policeman he saw me his voice seemed to falter on the last words if he saw you in hailem you could equally well have turned off for mordon after leaving it i sighed besides there was no policeman youre not the only one who tells lies so you see the spot youre in hartnell a phone call for which we have only your word no trace of the man alleged to have made it sixteen miles on your scooter including a wait in a normally busy little town and not a living soul saw you finally youre deeply and desperately in debt so desperate that you would be willing to do anything even break into mordon if the financial inducements were high enough he was silent for a moment then pushed himself wearily to his feet im completely innocent cavell but i see how it is and im not all that a fool so im going to be what do you call it detained in custody i said what do you think mrs hartnell she gave me a troubled halfsmile and said hesitantly i dont think so i well i dont know how a police officer talks to a man hes about to arrest for murder but you dont talk the way i should imagine they do i said dryly maybe you should be working in number one lab instead of your husband as an alibi hartnell your story is too ridiculously feeble for words nobody in their right minds would believe it for an instant which means maybe that im not in my right mind i believe it hartnell exhaled a long sigh of relief but his wife said with a strange mixture of hesitancy and shrewdness it could be a trap you could think tom guilty and be lulling him into mrs hartnell i said with respects you are abysmally ignorant of the facts of life as they appertain to the wilds of wiltshire your husband may think no one saw him but i can assure you that the way between here and alfringham is alive with people between and pm courting couples gentlemen between pubs and homes upending their last bottles to prepare themselves for wifely wrath old ladies and some not so old peering between notquiteclosed curtains with a squad of detectives i could turn up a score of people by noon tomorrow ill wager a dozen alfringham citizens saw dr hartnell waiting outside tuffnells office last night im not even going to bother finding out mrs hartnell said softly he means it tom i mean it somebody is trying to divert suspicion to you hartnell i want you to remain at home for the next two days ill fix it at mordon youre to talk to no one no one during that time take to your bed if you have to but talk to no one your absence from work your indisposition will be thought peculiar in the circumstances and will make somebody think our suspicions are directed towards you you understand completely im sorry i was such a fool cavell but i wasnt very nice myself good night in my car mary said wonderingly what on earth is happening to the legendary cavell toughness i dont know tell me you didnt have to tell him that he wasnt under suspicion after hed told his story you could just have said nothing and let him carry on to his work as usual a man like that would be incapable of hiding the fact that he was worried to death and that would have suited your purpose of making the real murderer think were on to hartnell just as well but you couldnt do it could you i wasnt like this before i got married im a ruined man besides if hartnell really knew the evidence against him hed go off his rocker she was silent for some time she was sitting on my left hand side and i cant see people who are sitting to my left but i knew she was staring at me finally she said i dont understand i have three polythene bags in the rear seat in one of them is a sample of dried red mud hartnell invariably takes the bus to work but i found that mud a peculiar reddish loam under the front mudguard of his scooter and theonly place for miles around with that type of soil is a couple of fields near the main gates of mordon in the second bag is a hammer i found in his toolshed it looks clean but im betting that a couple of grey hairs sticking to the haft came from our canine pal rollo who was so grievously clouted last night the third bag contains a pair of heavy insulated pliers theyve been perfectly cleaned but a comparison by electronic microscope of some scratches on it and the broken ends of the barbed wire in mordon should give some very interesting results you found all that she whispered i found all that neargenius i would say youre worried to death arent you mary asked i made no reply and she went on even with all that you still dont think hes guilty i mean that anyone should go to such lengths hartnells innocent of the killing anyway someone picked the lock of his toolshed last night unmistakable scratches if you know what to look for then why did you remove two reasons because there are some policemen in this island who have been so rigidly indoctrinated with the belief that two and two must inevitably make four that they wouldnt think twice of bypassing the old bailey and dragging hartnell to the nearest old oak tree the red mud hammer and pliers together with paul reveres moonlight ride its pretty damning but but you said yourself that if he had been out last night there would have been witnesses eyewash i called dr hartnell a fluent liar but he isnt in my class at night all cats are grey during the dark any motorcyclist with heavy coat crash helmet and goggles looks pretty much like any other motorcyclist with heavy coat crash helmet and goggles but i didnt see that there was anything to be gained by worrying hartnell and his wife to death if there was i wouldnt have hesitated not with this madman running around with the satan bug besides i want hartnell not to be worried what on earth do you mean i dont rightly know i confessed hartnell wouldnt kill a fly but hartnell is mixed up in something very fishy indeed what makes you say that you said hes clear why i told you i dont know i said irritably call it a hunch call it something the subconscious mind cottoned on to and hasnt yet got around to transferring to some place where recognise it anyway my second reason for filching exhibits a b and c is that whoever planted the goods on hartnell and started him on his wildgoose chase is going to be more than a little worried himself now if the police either cleared hartnell or clapped him in the hoosegow our friend would know where he stood but with hartnell mysteriously and suspiciously remaining at home and the police at the same time making no mention of having found exhibits a b and c the killers going to be kept wondering just what the cops are up to indecision indecision hampers action and hampering action buys time we need all the tone we can get you have a low and devious mind pierre cavell mary said at length but i think that if i were innocent of a crime and the evidence proved beyond any doubt that i was guilty id rather have you investigating my case than anyone alive by the same token if i were guilty of a crime and there was no possibility of any evidence pointing to me id rather have anyone else in the world except you investigating it or so my father says and he should know i know youll find this man pierre i wished i could even begin to share her conviction but i couldnt even begin i was sure of nothing nothing at all except that hartnell wasnt the blueeyed innocent he appeared nor his good wife and that my leg was aching pretty fiercely i wasnt looking forward very much to the remainder of that night we were back in the waggoners rest just before ten oclock hardanger was waiting for us in a deserted corner of the lounge along with a darksuited unknown man who turned out to be a police stenographer the superintendent was studying some papers and scowling away into the middle distance from time to time but the craggy face broke into a beam of pleasure when he looked up and saw us mary rather he was genuinely fond of her and found it difficult to understand why she had thrown herself away on me i let them talk for a minute or two looking at marys face and listening to her voice and wishing vaguely for the hundredth time that i had tape and film to record the soft lilting cadences of the voice and the fascinating shift and play of expression in case the day should ever come when that would be all i would have left of her then i cleared my throat to remind them that i was still here hardanger looked at me touched an internal switch and the smile vanished turn up anything startling he asked in a way the hammer that laid out the alsatian guard dog the pliers that cut the wire and apparent proof that dr hartnells moped was in the vicinity of mordon last night he didnt bat an eyelid he said lets go up to your room we went and once there hardanger said to a man accompanying him johnson your notebook and to me from the beginning cavell i told him everything that had happened that night exactly as it had been omitting only what mary had learned from chessinghams mother and sister at the end hardanger said you are convinced that its a frameup on hartnell looks like it doesnt it hadnt it occurred to you that there might be a double twist to this that hartnell planted it on himself yes but its hardly possible i know hartnell outside his work hes blundering nervous unstable and an ass hardly the basic material for the ruthless calculating criminal and hed hardly go the length of picking his own padlock anyway it doesnt matter ive told him to stay at home meantime whoever stole the botulinus and the satan bug did so for a purpose inspector wylies pretty keen to get into the act let him have his men keep a roundtheclock watch on the house to see that hartnell stays put hartnell even if guilty wouldnt be so mad as to keep the viruses in the house if theyre elsewhere and he cant get at them thats one worry less i also want a check made on his supposed moped trip of last night therell be a watch kept and check made hardanger promised chessingham tip you off in any way about hartnell nothing useful just my own hunch hartnell was the only person i knew of in number one lab in a position to be blackmailed or coerced the point is that someone else knows it too he also knew that tuffnell was from home that other man is the man we want how did he find out how did you find out hardanger demanded tuffnell himself told me i was here for a fortnight some months ago helping derry check on a bunch of newly arrived scientists i asked him to give me the names of all mordon employees who were coming to him for financial assistance hartnell is only one of a dozen did you ask or demand demanded you know thats illegal hardanger said heavily on what grounds on the grounds that if he didnt id enough information to put him behind bars for years to come had you that information no but a shady character like tuffnell has always a great deal to hide he cooperated tuffnell may have talked about hartnell or his partner hanbury how about other members of his staff there are none not even a typist in a business like that you cant trust your own mother apart from them cliveden weybridge possibly clandon and myself knew and easton deny of course no one else had access to the security files in mordon derry and clandon are gone how about cliveden thats ridiculous he was at a war office meeting till after midnight last night in london whats ridiculous about cliveden having this information and passing it on to someone else hardanger was silent and i went on and weybridge what was he doing at zero hour last night asleep who told you himself hardanger nodded and i went on corroboration hardanger looked uncomfortable he lives alone in the officers block hes a widower with an orderly to look after aim that helps how about the other check seven others hardanger said one as you said it would be was a night guard been there only two days and his transfer was a complete surprise to him sent from his regiment to take the place of a sick guard dr gregori was at home all last night he lives in a kind of highclass boardinghouse outside alfringham and half a dozen people will swear he was there until at least midnight that lets him out dr macdonald was at home with friends very respectable friends playing cards two of the technicians verity and heath were at the dance in alfringham last night they seem in the clear the other two robinson and marsh were out on a double date with their girl friends cinema cafe then back to their homes so youve turned up nothing at all not a damn thing but how about the two technicians and their girl friends mary asked robinson and marsh they provide each others alibis and there was a girl used as a decoy nothing there i said whoever is responsible for this lot is far too smart to fall into the elementary error of selfsupporting alibis if either of the two girls was a stranger to those parts there might just be possibly something in it but if robinson and marsh havent changed their girl friends since the last time we checked on them then theyre just a couple of harmless local girls the superintendent here would have had the truth out of them in five minutes flat probably two two it was hardanger agreed nothing there weve sent all their footwear to the lab for a check that fine red loam soil gets into the tiniest cracks and would be a dead giveaway but its purely routine nothing will come of it you want a copy of all those statements and witnesses reports please whats your next move what would yours be hartnell countered id have tuffnell hanbury cliveden and weybridge questioned to see if theyve ever spoken to anyone about hartnells financial difficulties then id have gregori macdonald hartnell chessingham cliveden weybridge and the four technicians questioned separately of course about the extent of their social life with the others whether they had ever been in each others homes is a question that might be tossed in casually and id have fingerprint squads move into all their houses at the same time to print as much of every house as possible youd have no trouble getting warrants for that little lot if x maintains hes never been in ys home and you find prints proving him a liar well someone is going to have some interesting explaining to do including general clivedens and colonel weybridges homes hardanger asked grimly i dont care whose feelings are wounded this is no time to consider anyones hurt pride its a long long shot hardanger said criminals with something to hide particularly the connection between them would never meet in each others homes anyway can you afford to ignore even such a long shot probably not hardanger said probably not twenty minutes after their departure with the polythene bags i climbed out of the window clambered to the ground via the porch picked up my car where id left it parked in a side street and set off for london chapter six it was exactly half past two in the morning when i was shown into the library of the generals west end flat the general welcomed me in a red quilted dressinggown and waved me to a seat he hadnt been to bed i could see that the dressinggown meant nothing he invariably wore it inside the house six foot three and built to match the general would never see seventy again but his back was as straight his complexion as fresh and his eyes as clear as a man thirty years his junior he had thick irongrey hair irongrey trimmed moustache grey eyes and the cleverest brain of any man id ever met i could see he had been doing some thinking with this brain and wasnt any too pleased with the conclusions hed arrived at well cavell his voice was clipped incisive vaguely military youve made a pretty mess of things yes sir he was the only man in the world who rated a sir from me one of my best operatives neil clandon is dead another as good easton deny is probably also dead though only listed missing dr baxter a great scientist and a great patriot and how badly we need both is dead whose fault cavell mine i looked at a convenient decanter i could do with a drink sir there rarely has been a time when you couldnt he said acidly and then just one degree less acidic leg acting up a little sorry about this hour of night sir it was essential how do you want it the story straight quick and from the beginning hardanger turned up at am sent in an inspector martin heavily disguised as god knows what to test my loyalty first i suppose you thought that one up too you might have warned me i tried to he said impatiently i was too late the news of clandons death reached general cliveden and hardanger before it did me i rang you up but your home and office phones were out of order hardanger did that i nodded anyway i passed the test hardanger was satisfied and asked me to come to mordon said hed suggested it to you and youd been reluctant it must have taken quite a bit of doing to suggest something to hardanger and leave him with the impression that hed thought it up himself it was never underestimate hardanger an outstanding policeman he has no suspicions youre sure that this was a putup job that it was you who engineered me out of the special branch and into mordon and then out of mordon again he has no suspicions i guarantee right the story i didnt waste words that was one of the very first things an agent learnt about the general never to waste words with him in ten minutes hed all the relevant facts and hed never forget one of them almost word for word with hardangers reports that have already been filed with me through official channels he commented almost i said good policemen concentrate only on relevancies your conclusions cavell what about the investigation i asked to be made down in kent sir negative i swallowed some more whisky i needed it hardanger suspects dr baxter to be a case of the biter bit i said you know that already he phoned asking for a security check on baxter he suspects dr baxter probably accompanied by another man broke into mordon and that thieves fell out as a result of which dr baxter met his death at the hands of his fellow breaker and enterer an action that may have been either spurofthemoment or premeditated what hardanger doesnt know is that it was dr baxter who first reported to easton derry directly and privately that minute amounts of rare and valuable viruses were disappearing from mordon and asked for an investigation or that it was baxter who as a result of our requests had me removed from mordon so that i could carry on investigations in london under cover of a private detectives business hardanger is wrong on both counts dr baxter didnt break into mordon that night for the sufficient reason that he hadnt left it earlier that evening the man behind this killing man working with a considerable organisation i should say has kidnapped the children of bryson and chipperfield the farm managers the fact that the kids are not where their parents say they are with their grandmother in kent is all the proof i want bryson and chipperfield were given their choice cooperation or dead children they cooperated they carried crates of animals into number one lab on the afternoon of the killings they were old regulars the guards would never have thought of inspecting the crates inside two of these crates were two men fairly skilfully made up to resemble dr baxter and someone we can call x eight crates were carried in that afternoon and bryson and chipperfield followed their usual practice of not disturbing the lab work too much by bringing in all the crates first and leaving them in the corridor just outside the lab before carrying them all in this of course is conclusive proof of highlydetailed inside information while the crates were there one of the men inside the one disguised as x nipped smartly out into the adjoining cloakroom used by the scientists and technicians in number one he probably hid in a locker the other man the one disguised as baxter was carried into the animal room a dozen places where a man could hide there our enquiries show that the scientists and technicians drifted off singly that evening they usually did one of them x takes his chance of going into a momentarily empty cloakroom and changes over places with the impostor to whom he hands his security tag the fake x now leaves by the main gate handing in his tag and forging the name it was a pitch dark night and hed only be one of hundreds crowding out he was pretty safe x goes back into the lab when the coast is clear and sticks a gun into baxter more likely this has already been done by the man dressed to impersonate baxter anyway it doesnt matter baxter was always the last to leave he was responsible for setting the combination and so they nailed him by and by the imposter b takes off and hands in baxters card at the gate x of course cant just pocket the viruses knock off baxter and remove himself as far as the gate guard is concerned x has already checked out he cant check out a second time he knows it wont be safe to move until the last of the security rounds have been finished at pm he waits till then takes the viruses belts baxter over the head with his gunbutt and leaves throwing a virus toxin at the unconscious man he has to kill baxter because baxter knew who he was he didnt know as we did that clandon was keeping a binocular watch every night on the corridor in e block but its highly likely that he suspected he might hes not the man who would leave anything to chance he must have known that this was the one possibility that might upset his plans hence the cyanide sweet when clandon came up after x had shut the door x must have spun some yarn and got clandon to accept the sweet he obviously knew clandon well and clandon knew him the general rubbed his moustache thoughtfully ingenious if nothing else basically you must be right but theres something wrong about that cyanide business far wrong clandon was looking for a man that had been stealing virus supplies and he must have suspected that x was the man i just dont see clandon accepting this butterscotch besides x was carrying a gun probably silenced why not that why the cyanide i dont know sir i felt like adding that i hadnt been there how did you get on to this in the first place the dog sir it had a couple of barbed wire tears in its throat it seemed likely that there might be blood on the wire itself there was it took me an hour to find it on the inner wire no one broke into mordon that night someone broke out why didnt hardanger discover this hed no reason to suspect what i did i knew that baxter hadnt broken in and a check with the gate guard showed that baxter had his face covered with a handkerchief and talked thickly through a cold when he left that was enough besides hardangers men did get around to examining the wires they concentrated on the outside one for an hour or so and then moved to the inner fence and found nothing there was nothing to find id removed the blood youre an unethical devil cavell yes sir that was good coming from him then a visit to bryson and chipperfield a couple of steady reliable characters drinking like fish at fivethirty in the afternoon and spilling it when they poured mrs bryson smoking like a factory chimney shes never smoked in her life general air of quiet desperation well concealed but all very obvious suspects theres general cliveden and colonel weybridge cliveden was in london at the time of the killing but although hes only been in mordon two or three times since taking over he has two things against him he has access to the security files and may have known of hartnells financial troubles and it was strange that such a gallant soldier didnt volunteer to go into the lab instead of me it was his place not mine he bosses mordon the two words gallant and soldier are not necessarily synonymous the general said dryly remember hes a doctor not a fighting man thats so i also remember that two of the handful of double vcs ever won were won by doctors it doesnt matter same two arguments apply to weybridge with the additional two factors that he lives on the premises and has no alibi gregori because he was too insistent for what i regarded as insufficient reason to have the placed sealed off for keeps but the fact of the insistence itself being so obvious may remove suspicion as does the fact that the virus locker door was opened by a key and gregori had what was thought to be the only key what do we really know about gregori sir the lot every step hes taken from the cradle the fact that hes not a british national made his screening twice as intensive as normal thats from our side before he came here he was doing highly secret work in turin for the italian government and you can imagine the thorough going over gregori got from them hes absolutely in the clear which should make me pretty reluctant to waste time on him only trouble is judging from past records everyone else seems in the clear also anyway these are the first three suspects and i think hardanger is beginning to have ideas about one or more of these three the ideas he got from you eh i dont like it sir i dont like it because hardaager is as straight as they come and it goes against the grain to operate behind his back i dont like saying or doing things which amount to deliberately misleading and deceiving him and i dont like it because hardanger is very smart indeed and to keep him from tumbling to me ive got to devote almost as much time to keeping hardanger reasonably satisfied as to investigating the case itself dont think i like it either the general said heavily but it has to be were up against clever and determined men whose main weapons are secrecy cunning and and violence all right then secrecy cunning and violence we must meet and destroy them on their chosen ground i must employ the best weapon that comes to my hand i know of no man who could or would presume to instruct you in any of those three secrecy cunning violence i havent been very cunning so far you havent the general admitted on the other hand when i said to you that youd made a mess of things i was being less than fair the initiative invariably rests with the criminal anyway what matters is that you are essentially a loner a one man band while hardanger is just as essentially an organisation man with an organisation comes delegation of authority dispersal of concentration blunting of initiative and lowered secrecy and any and all of those mitigate against the chances of final success nevertheless the organisation is indispensable to you it carries out all the groundwork and routine investigation that you couldnt possibly do yourself and diverts attention and suspicion from yourself as long as hardanger unwittingly or no misleads the killer or killers as to the direction the inquiry is taking well thats all i want out of him hes not going to like it when he finds out sir if he finds out cavell and thats for me to worry about other suspects the four technicians barely possible all of them were seen moving around during the evening at one time or another and on the assumption that the killer was holed up in the lab between six and eleven oclock that lets them out as far as the murders were concerned hardanger is carrying out a minute by minute check of their late evening movements one of them might have been a decoy so might a thousand others the decoy doesnt necessarily have anything to do with number one lab hartnell would appear to be in the clear his alibi is so hopeless that it would seem to have to be genuine but for all that i have a feeling that theres something queer going on there and be calling on him again then theres chessingham a very big question mark as an assistant research chemist his salary is no shakes but it seems he can afford to run a big house have a maid and keep his sister at home to look after his mother the maids been there only two months his mother incidentally is in a very bad way from a health viewpoint her doctor says that a shift to a wanner climate might add years to her life she herself maintains that she doesnt want this shift but thats probably only because she doesnt want to embarrass her son who she knows cant afford it maybe chessingham would like the money to send her abroad im sure in fact theyre a pretty close family i dont want hardanger on this can you arrange to have chessinghams bank account checked a monitoring watch kept on all incoming and outgoing mail a check made with local authorities to see whether a driving licence has ever been issued in his name a check made with the army unit in which he did his national service to see if he ever drove a vehicle and finally a check on all the local moneylenders to see if chessinghams on their books hes certainly not with tuffnell and hanbury the biggest sharks in the area but there are a dozen others within twenty miles and chessingham never strays far from home he may be borrowing money by mail from some london firm is that all you want the general was heavily ironic i think it essential sir is it how about this excellent alibi he provided the pictures of the transit of jupiter or whatever it was that could prove his presence at home down to a second more or less dont you believe it i believe those pictures would show exactly when they were taken i dont necessarily believe that chessingham was there when they were taken hes not only a fine scientist but an uncommonly clever lad with his hands he built his own camera radio and tv set he built his own reflector telescope even handgrinding the lenses it would be no great trick for chessingham to rig up a mechanism to take pictures automatically at preselected intervals or someone could have done it for him while he was elsewhere or the photographs themselves could have been taken elsewhere with a corresponding time allowance made for longitude differences so as to give the same effect and chessinghams far too intelligent a bird not to have spotted right away that those photographs would have provided an alibi yet he pretended that it only occurred to him while i was talking to him hed have thought it would have been too obvious and suspicious if it had all been cut and dried in advance you wouldnt trust st peter himself would you cavell i might if there were sufficient independent witnesses to testify to any alibi he might have that is giving anyone even the faintest shadow of the benefit of the doubt is the one luxury i cant afford you know that sir and chessingham isnt getting that shadow nor is hartnell hmm he peered at me under the tufted grey of his eyebrows and said inconsequentially easton derry vanished because he played it too close to the cuff i wonder how much you are holding back from me cavell what makes you say that sir god knows im a fool to ask you as if youd tell me anyway he poured a whisky for himself but placed it on the mantelshelf without tasting it whats behind all this my boy blackmail of one kind or another our friend with the satan bug and botulinus virus in his pants pocket has the finest blackmail weapon in history hes probably after money very large sums of money if the government want back the bugs itll cost them a fortune additional blackmail is that if the government dont come across hell sell the bugs to a foreign power at least thats what i hope what im afraid of is that were dealing with not a criminal but a crackpot mind dont tell me that a crackpot couldnt have organised all this some crackpots are brilliant if it is a crackpot itll be one of the mankind must abolish war or war will abolish mankind brigade in this case the threat would be on a smaller scale you know britain must abolish mordon or ill abolish britain that sort of thing probably a letter in the post right now to one of the big national dailies telling them he has the viruses and what he intends doing with them the general picked up his whisky glass and stared down into it with all the rapt attention of a soothsayer looking for an answer in his crystal ball what makes you think that about the letter i mean hed have to sir pressure is the essence of blackmail our friend with the viruses must have the publicity a terrified population and how right they would be to be terrified would bring such terrific pressure to bear that the government would have to accede to any demands made upon them or go out of office at once where were you between five minutes to ten and ten oclock tonight he asked abruptly where was i i looked at him long hard stare for long hard stare then went on slowly in the waggoners rest in alfringham speaking to mary hardanger and a plainclothes constable by the name of johnson im getting old or senile or both the general shook his head irritably then lifted a sheet of paper from the mantelshelf and handed it to me youd better read this pierre the pierre made it very bad indeed and it was very very bad indeed it couldnt have been worse a reuters dispatch sheet the message in typed capitals mankind must abolish war or war will abolish mankind the typescript began it is now in my power to abolish the most dreadful form of war this world has ever known or ever will know bacteriological warfare i have in my possession eight ampoules of botulinus toxin which i took from the mordon research establishment near alfringham wiltshire twentyfour hours ago i regret that two men were killed last night but have no deep sorrow what are two lives when the lives of mankind are at stake the contents of any of those ampoules suitably dispersed could destroy all life in britain shall fight fire with fire and destroy evil by forces of evil mordon must cease to exist that stronghold of the antichrist must be utterly razed so that no stone be left standing i order that all experiments in mordon cease forthwith and that the buildings in which this evil work is carried out be dynamited and bulldozed to rubble you will broadcast acknowledgement and compliance on the bbc news at am tomorrow morning if i am disregarded i shall be compelled to take steps the effects of which i dare not contemplate but those steps i shall take it is the wish of one who is greater than all that war upon earth shall cease for ever and i am his chosen instrument mankind must be saved from mankind i read through it again and laid the sheet down this was the real mccoy no one outside mordon knew that eight ampoules had been stolen the general said well well a nut i said completely off his trolley mind you he has a rather nifty line of prose good god cavell the generals face was set in hard lines cold grey eyes angry a communication like that and all you can do is is to make feeble what do you want me to do sir get out the sackcloth and ashes sure its terrible but we were expecting it or something like it if ever there was a time to use our heads and not our hearts well this is the time youre right the voice was a sigh of course youre right and damnably accurate in your forecast this came by phone call from alfringham between five to ten and ten oclock tonight sorry about that too im even ready to suspect myself the message came to reuters in london dictated at slow speed reuters thought it a hoax but telephoned alfringham just in case the news of the theft and murders hasnt been officially released yet typicalarmy stupidity for half of wiltshire knew about the murders hours ago and so does fleet street all reuters got was a denial but the reaction to their questions convinced them that they were on to something very hot indeed for two hours believe it or not they argued back and forth as to whether or not this item should be released to the press the decision not to communicate came from the very top they notified scotland yard who notified me by that time it was well after midnight this is the original copy a crackpot you think a screw or two loose but all the rest of his mental machinery is working just fine he knows he has to have publicity to generate sufficient terror to bring pressure to bear and to generate even more terror he gives the impression that he doesnt know three of the eight ampoules in his possession contain the satan bug if the public really thought he had the satan bug and might use it in mistake theyd scream for him to be given anything on earth just so long as he returned it he may not know it is the satan bug id never seen the general like this before hesitant and uncertain under the grimly worried mask we cant assume he does i can he knows whoever it is he knows youre going to keep this out of the papers itll buy us time he must have publicity as you say how about the actual crime itself the breakin the murders itll be in every paper in the country tomorrow its already on the streets local wiltshire correspondents got the tipoff early this evening after that there was nothing we could do about it the reaction of the populace should be interesting i finished my whisky and rose ill be getting back sir what are you going to do ill tell you sir i should start on bryson and chipperfield but id be wasting my time they wont speak theyll be too terrified for their kids lives and besides im convinced they wouldnt have seen either the man who gave the orders or the men they carried inside im going to start over again with the number one lab people a couple of phone calls to cliveden and weybridge hinting darkly trying to provoke a reaction then a visit to chessingham hartnell macdonald gregori and the technicians nothing smart or sophisticated or clever put the wind up suggesting i know more than i do all i want is a basis for one tiny suspicion of any of them and ill take him into a deserted cellar and take him apart till i have all the truth what if youre wrong about him the general seemed to be staring fixedly at a point just over my shoulder ill put him together again if i can i added indifferently we have never operated it that way cavell weve never had a lunatic with the power to wipe us all out either thats so thats so he shook his head whos going to be the first object of your attentions dr macdonald macdonald why macdonald doesnt it strike you as curious sir that of all the major dramatis persona the only one without shadow of suspicion against him is dr macdonald i find that very interesting maybe he forgot to frame himself when he was so busy framing everybody else planting suspicion away from himself this is an uncommonly dirty world and i automatically suspect those as pure as the driven snow the general gazed at me in a long silence then glanced at his watch you might just manage a couple of hours sleep when you get back ill get all the sleep i want when i get the satan bug back a man can go only so long without sleep cavell the tone was very dry it wont take me long sir my promise ill have the satan bug back in mordon in thirtysix hours thirtysix hours a long considering pause with any other man id laugh in his face ive learnt not to laugh in yours but thirtysix hours he shook his head the general had been brought up in the old school and he was too polite to tell me that i was a fool or a braggart or a liar or all three the satan bug you say how about how about the murderer recovering the viruses is all that matters whether the killer is himself killed or handed over to the cops doesnt seem that important let him look out for himself im more worried about you looking out for yourself be very careful cavell a hard thought for you to take but he may be a cleverer and more dangerous man than yourself he reached out and touched me gently below the left shoulder i suppose you wear that hanyatti in bed at night you know you have no authority from me to use it i point it at people just to frighten them sir giving people heart attacks doesnt come underthe heading of frightening them i wont detain you boy hows mary well sir she sent her love from alfringham of course he forgot for the moment that i was about his only subordinate who didnt curl up under his level stare and let me have it with both barrels im not sure i like my daughter my only child being mixed up with something like this i needed i still need someone i can trust thats mary you know your own daughter as well as i do she hates the business were in but the more she hates it the more impossible it is to keep her out of it she thinks i shouldnt be allowed out alone shed have been down in alfringham within twentyfour hours anyway the general looked at me for a moment then nodded heavily and showed me to the door chapter seven dr macdonald was a big heavilybuilt man in his late forties with that wellleathered and spuriously tough look you quite often find among a certain section of the unemployed landed gentry who spend a great deal of time in the open air much of it mounted on large horses in pursuit of small foxes he had sandy hair sandy eyebrows sandy moustache and the smooth full tight reddishtanned face indicative of a devotion to the table a wellstocked cellar a fresh gillette every morning and an incipient heart condition in his own rather arrogant and fleshy way macdonald was a pretty goodlooking and impressive character but at the moment he wasnt looking his best not that anyone would be when rubbing sleep from gummed eyelids and welcoming the unexpected caller at am on a pitch dark raining and bitterly cold october predawn welcoming perhaps was not the right word what the bloody hell do you mean by coming hammering on my door in the middle of the bloody night macdonald demanded he clutched a dressinggown more tightly about his shivering bulk and managed to prop an eye wide enough open to identify me in the faint wash of light coming from the porchway behind him cavell what the devils the meaning of this im sorry macdonald civility turning the other cheek terrible hour i know but i must talk to you its most urgent nothing so damn urgent that you have to come hauling a man out of his bed at this time of night he said furiously ive already told the police all i know anything else you can see me about in mordon sorry cavell good night or good morning he took a long step back and swung the door hi my face id no more cheeks to turn the sole of my right foot caught the door before it engaged on the latch and i kicked it open violently the sudden transfer of weight to my bad leg didnt do my left foot any good at all but it was nothing compared to what it did to macdonalds right elbow which was where the flying door must have caught him for when i passed inside he was clutching his elbow with his left hand and doing a dervish dance with language suitably geared to the occasion hed packed in the plummy debrett accent in favour of broad scots for what he had to say it was much more impressive it was ten seconds before he was properly aware that i was standing there get out the voice was halfsnarl halfshout the face twisted hi malevolence out of my house at once you he got started on my forebears but i cut him short two men are dead macdonald theres a madman on the loose with the power to turn that two into two million your convenience doesnt enter into it i want answers to questions i want them now you want them and who are you to want anything the heavy lips were curled into an expression that was halfsneer halfgrimace of pain and the oxfordsandhurst drawl was working again i know all about you cavell kicked out of mordon because you couldnt keep your big mouth shut youre only a socalled private detective but i suppose you thought there might be better pickings going here than in the dirty little divorce cases you people specialise in god knows how you managed to push your way into this but as far as i am concerned you can push straight out again you have no authority to ask me anything youre not the police where are your credentials show me to say that he was making no attempt to mask the sneer on his face the contempt in his voice would have been understating the case i hadnt any credentials to show him so i showed him the hanyatti instead it might be enough bluster is usually a facade that conceals nothing but it wasnt enough maybe there was more to dr macdonald than i had thought my god he laughed not one of those laughs with a silvery tinkle of bells an unpleasant laugh guns at six in the morning whatever next cheap melodramatic rubbish ive got your number now cavell by god i have a little ring to superintendent hardanger will soon fix you mister cheap little private detective outside the demands of his job he was obviously no stickler for accuracy cheap i may have been but i was a good couple of inches taller than he was and at least as heavy the phone was on the table beside me he took two steps towards it and i took one towards him the muzzle of the hanyatti caught him just under the breastbone and i stood aside as he jackknifed and fell to the floor it was brutal highhanded completely unjustifiable on the face of it and i didnt like it one little bit but i liked even less the idea of a madman with the satan bug in his possession i had to use every second i had by and by when it was all over id apologise to macdonald but not now he rolled around for a bit clutching his midriff with both hands and whooping in pain as he tried to drag air into his lungs after a minute or so he quietened down and struggled to his feet still clutching his stomach breathing very quickly very shallowly like someone who cant get enough oxygen quickly enough his face was grey and puffy and the bloodshot eyes held an expression that was pretty close to hatred i didnt blame him any this is the end of the road for you cavell his voice came in hoarse gasps punctuated by halfsobbing inhalations youve gone too far this time unprovoked assault he broke off flinching as he saw the barrel of the hanyatti arching towards his face both hands were flung up in instinctive selfdefence and he grunted in agony as my free hand caught him in the midriff again he stayed down longer this time and when he finally dragged himself trembling to his feet he was in pretty bad shape his eyes were still burning mad but there was something else in them now as well fear i took two quick steps towards him lifting the hanyatti high macdonald took two corresponding steps back then collapsed heavily on a settee as it caught him behind the knees his face held rage and bewilderment and fear lest i hit him again it also held hatred for both of us for me because i was doing what i was doing for himself because he knew he was going to do what i said macdonald wasnt ready to talk but he was going to all the same and both of us knew it where were you on the night baxter and clandon were killed i asked i remained on my feet the hanyatti ready hardanger has my statement he said sullenly at home id had three friends in for bridge until almost midnight friends a retired scientific colleague the local doctor and vicar good enough for you cavell maybe he was getting some of his courage back nobody more skilled at murders than doctors and priests have been unfrocked before i looked down at my feet at the smooth grey sweep of a walltowall carpeting if a man dropped his diamond tiepin in that nap hed have to call in a tracker dog i said with no particular inflection fancy line in floorcoverings you have here doctor five hundred quid wouldnt have bought this little lot being clever or just insolent cavell he was getting his courage back i hoped he wasnt going to be so foolish as to get too much of it back heavy silk drapes i went on period furniture genuine crystal chandelier a pretty big house and id wager the whole house is furnished on the same scale the same expensive scale where does the money come from doctor you do the pools or just a bingo expert for a moment he looked as if he were about to tell me to mind my own damn business so i halflifted the hanyatti again not much just enough to make him change his mind he said stiffly im a bachelor with no dependants i can afford to indulge my tastes lucky you where were you last night between nine and eleven pm he frowned and said at home are you sure of course im sure apparently hed decided that stiff indignation was his safest line witnesses i was alone all night all night my housekeeper arrives at eight each morning that may be very unfortunate for you no witnesses for last night i mean what the devil are you trying to tell me he seemed genuinely puzzled youll know soon enough you dont run a car do you doctor as it happens i do but you come to mordon on an army bus i prefer it that way its no concern of yours true what kind of car a sports car what kind of sports car a bentley continental a continental a sports car i gave him a long look but it was wasted he was staring down at the carpet maybe he had lost a diamond tiepin there your taste in cars is like your taste in rugs its an old car secondhand when did you buy it he looked up abruptly what does it matter what are you trying to get at cavell when did you buy it ten weeks ago he was giving the carpet the onceover again maybe three months ago an old car you say how old four years four years they dont give away four year old continentals for boxtops they give them away for about ј where did you get ј from three months ago i didnt i paid ј down the rest over three years its the way most people buy their cars you know an extended credit scheme aimed at capital conservation thats for people like you for people like me they call it hirepurchase lets see your hirepurchase agreement he brought it a quick glance showed that he had been speaking the truth i said whats your salary dr macdonald just over ј the government is not generous he wasnt blustering or indignant any more i wondered why so that after taxation and living expenses you couldnt possibly have as much as a thousand left at the end of the year in three years ј yet according to this agreement youre going to pay off close to ј balance plus interest in three years how do you propose to accomplish this mathematical impossibility i have two insurance policies maturing inside the next year ill get them for you dont bother tell me doctor why are you so worried so nervous im not worried dont lie all right so im lying i am worried i am nervous the questions you are asking would make anyone nervous maybe he was right at that i said why should feat make you worried doctor why he asks me why he glared up at me then went back to looking for his diamond pin because i dont like the trend of your questioning i dont like what youre trying to prove no man would what am i trying to prove i dont know he shook his head not looking up youre trying to establish that i live beyond my means i dont i dont know what youre trying to prove i said youve got the old tartan eyes this morning doctor and if you dont mind me saying so you stink of stale whisky you have all the signs of a man who had a heavy session with the bottle last night and is paying the price now not i suppose that a couple of belts on the solar plexus improved matters funny thing is youre listed on our books as a moderate social drinker youre no alcoholic but you were alone last night and social drinkers dont drink alone thats why theyre social but you were drinking alone last night drinking heavily doctor i wonder why worried perhaps worried even before cavell and his worrisome questions ever came along i usually have a nightcap before retiring he said defensively he was still staring at the carpet but his interest lay not in any tiepin but in not letting me see his expressions on his face that doesnt make me an alcoholic whats a nightcap or two i agreed but when a nightcap turns out to be the better part of a bottle of whisky it ceases to be a nightcap i glanced round the room then said wheres your kitchen what do you damn it dont waste my time through there i left the room and found myself in one of those gleaming stainless steel monstrosities that started out to be an operating theatre and changed its mind at the last moment more evidence of money and on the gleaming sink more evidence that dr macdonald really had had an extended nightcap a bottle of whisky threefifths empty with the torn lead seal still lying beside it a dirty ashtray full of mashedup cigarettes i turned as i heard a sound behind me macdonald was standing in the doorway all right he said wearily so i was drinking i was at it for two or three hours im not used to those things cavell im not a policeman or a soldier two horrible ghastly murders he halfshuddered if it was acting it was brilliant acting baxter had been one of my best friends for years and why was he killed how do i know the killer hasnt another victim lined up and i know what this satan bug can do good god man id reason to be worried worried stiff so you had i agreed so you still have even although i am getting pretty close to him the killer i mean and maybe he is after you next its a thought to bear in mind you coldhearted callous devil he ground out in gods name get out and leave me alone im just going keep your doors locked doctor youre going to hear more of this cavell now that id announced my intention of leaving and had stuck the hanyatti out of sight he was recovering courage well see if youre so damned tough when youre up in court on an assault charge dont talk rubbish i said shortly i never laid a finger on you theres no mark on you its only your word against mine me id take mine first any time i left the house i saw the dark bulk of the garage where the bentley was presumably housed but i didnt give it a second glance or thought when people want a nice inconspicuous unobstructive car for a stealthy and unobstructive mission they dont go around borrowing bentley continentals i stopped at a phone box and on the pretext of wanting oregons address made two unnecessary calls to weybridge first who couldnt as i knew he couldnt help me and to cliveden who could and did they were both pretty shirty about being disturbed at the crack of dawn but they quietened down when i told them that id had to have the information immediately because my investigations had now reached such a critical stage that i might have the case tied up before the day was out both of them tried to question me on the progress i was making but i gave nothing away that didnt take much finesse for id nothing to give away in any event at am i was leaning on the doorbell of dr oregons house more precisely the house in which he lived a good class boarding house run by a widow and her two daughters parked outside the front was a navy blue fiat oregons car it was still pitch dark still cold and wet i felt very tired and my leg ached badly so that i had difficulty in concentrating on what had to be done the door opened and a plump woman greyhaired and fiftyish peered out into the darkness this would be the landlady herself mrs whithorn reputedly a cheerful and happygolucky soul of devastating untidiness and unpunctuality whose boardinghouse was the most soughtafter in the area her reputation as a cook was enviable who on earth is it at this time of morning her voice held a goodnatured exasperation not the police again i hope im afraid so mrs whithorn cavell is my name id like to see dr gregori please poor dr gregori hes already put up with enough from you people but i suppose youd better come in id go and see if hes up yet just tell me where his room is and ill find out for myself if you please mrs whithorn she demurred a bit then reluctantly told me where to find him five yards along the big hall down a side passage and i was outside his door his name was on it i knocked and waited i didnt have to wait long gregori must have been up but only just he wore a faded russet dressinggown over his pyjamas and his swarthy face was swarthier than ever he evidently hadnt yet got round to shaving cavell he said there was no particular warmth of welcome in his voice people greeting the law at dawn are seldom in the most amiable frame of mind but at least unlike macdonald he was civil youd better come in and have a seat you look worn out i felt worn out i eased myself into the offered chair and looked around gregori didnt do himself as well as macdonald in the way of furniture but then it probably wasnt his furniture in the first place the room i was in was furnished as a small study his bedroom would be through the communication door in the far wall a worn but still serviceable carpet a couple of armchairs in the same category one wall completely lined with bookcases a heavy oak table with swivel chair typewriter and piledup papers and that was about it in the stone hearth was the remains of last nights fire smooth white ash such as you get from burning beech the room though cold was rather stuffy gregori had obviously not as yet succumbed to the english madness of flinging open windows under any and all conditions and i seemed to smell some peculiar odour in the air so faint as to be unidentifiable if i can be of any help to you mr cavell gregori prompted just routine inquiries dr gregori i said easily most uncivilised hour i know but we feel that time is not on our side you have not been to bed he said shrewdly not yet ive been busy visiting im afraid my choice of visiting hours doesnt make me very popular ive just come from dr macdonald and im afraid he wasnt at all pleased to be dragged out of his bed no dr macdonald gregori said delicately is a somewhat impatient man you get on well with him on friendly terms a colleague shall we say i respect his work why mr cavell incurable nosiness tell me doctor have you any alibi for last night of course he looked puzzled i told it to mr hardanger in person from eight until almost midnight i was at the birthday party for mrs whithorns daughter sorry i interrupted last night not the night before aha he looked at me anxiously there have been there have been no more killings no more i reassured him well doctor last night he halfsmiled and shrugged an alibi had i known that an alibi would have been required of me i would not have failed to provide one at what time exactly mr cavell let us say between and pm alas no no alibi i fear i was in my room here working all night on my book work therapy you might call it mr cavell after the dreadful experience of yesterday he paused then went on apologetically well not all night from after dinner about eight till eleven it was a good night for me in the circumstances three whole pages he smiled again differently for the type of book im writing mr cavell a page an hour represents excellent progress and what type of book is that on inorganic chemistry he shook his head and added wistfully it is unlikely that the citizens will be besieging the bookshops in order to buy it the reading public for my speciality is limited indeed that the book i nodded at the pile of papers on the desk it is one i began in turin more years ago than i care to remember examine it if you wish mr cavell not i fear that it would convey much to you apart from the rather abstruse nature of the subjectmatter it is in italian the language i prefer for writing i didnt tell him that i could read italian almost as well as he spoke english instead i said you type directly on to paper but of course my handwriting is that of the true scientist almost completely indecipherable but a moment he rubbed a thoughtful palm across a blue and bristly chin the typewriter it may have been heard thats why i asked you think it likely i dont know my rooms were specially chosen because of my typing must not disturb the other guests you understand there are no bedrooms either above or on either side of me wait now yes yes im almost certain i heard a television programme next door at least more doubtfully i think i did next door is what mrs whithorn rather grandly calls her television lounge but it is very poorly patronised i fear chiefly by mrs whithom herself and her daughters and that not frequently but im sure i heard something well almost sure shall we ask we asked we went along to the kitchen where mrs whithorn and one of her daughters were preparing breakfast the aroma of sizzling bacon made my leg feel weaker than ever one minute was enough an hourlong vintage film had been shown on television the previous evening and mrs whithorn and two of her three daughters had watched the entire performance the film had started precisely at ten and as they passed dr oregons door into the lounge and after that had sat down they could hear him typing on his machine not loud not loud enough to be annoying but perfectly distinct mrs whithorn had commented at the time that it was a shame dr gregori should have so little time for leisure and relaxation but she knew he would be eager to make up for the time lost at her daughters party his first night off for weeks dr gregori made no attempt to bide his satisfaction im very much indebted to this elderly film shown last night and to you mrs whithorn he smiled at me your suspicious at rest mr cavell i never had any doctor but thats how policemen must work by the elimination of even the most remote possibilities dr gregori saw me to the front door it was still dark still cold still very wet indeed the rain was bouncing high off the tarmac road i was considering how best to introduce my now standard spiel about the remarkable progress i was making when gregori himself said suddenly i am not asking you to betray any professional confidences mr cavell but well do you think there is a chance that youll get this fiend are you making any progress at all more than i would have thought possible twelve hours ago investigations have led me pretty far in what i believe to be the right direction very far i might say if it werent for the fact that im up against a brick wall walls can be climbed mr cavell so they can and this one will be i paused i dont know whether i should have said what i did but i know you will keep it strictly to yourself he gave me his earnest reassurances on that point and we parted half a mile away i stopped at the first callbox and got through to london been to bed yet cavell the general greeted me no sir dont feel to badly about it neither have i ive been very busy indeed making myself unpopular dragging people out of their beds in the middle of the night no more unpopular than ive made myself sir i dare say with any results nothing special yourself sir chessingham no record of a civilian driving licence having been issued to him at any time this may not be definite it may have been issued to him in some place other than his own country although this would be unusual as for his army record it turns out strangely enough that he was in the rasc the rasc then the chances are that he did have a licence did you find out sir the only fact that i have been able to establish about chessinghams army career the general said dryly is that he actually was in the army the wheels of the war office grind uncommonly slow at any time but in the middle of the night they grind to a dead halt we may have something by midday what we do have now are some rather interesting figures supplied us less than half an hour ago by chessinghams bank manager he gave me the figures and hung up i climbed wearily into the car once more and headed for chessinghams house fifteen minutes drive and i was there in the bleak halflight of dawn the squarebuilt house with its sunken basement looked more dreary and forbidding than ever the way i was feeling didnt help matters any i squelched my way up the flight of worn steps over the moat and pressed the bell stella chessingham appeared she was neatly and attractively dressed in a flowered housecoat and her hair was smoothly brushed but her face was pale and the brown eyes were tired she didnt look very happy when i told her i wanted to see her brother i suppose youd better come in she said reluctantly mothers still in bed erics at breakfast he was bacon and egg again my leg felt weaker than ever chessingham rose to his feet and said nervously good morning mr cavell i didnt wish him good morning back i gave him my cold impersonal stare the kind only policemen and head waiters are allowed to use and said i have to ask some more questions chessingham ive been up all night and im in no mood for evasions straight answers to straight questions our investigations during the night have opened up some very interesting lines of inquiry and the main line leads straight here i looked at his sister miss chessingham i have no wish to distress you unnecessarily it might be better if i interviewed your brother alone v she looked at me with wideopen eyes licked her lips nervously nodded and turned to go chessingham said stay here stella i have nothing to hide from anybody my sister knows everything about me mr cavell i wouldnt be so sure about that the voice to match the stare if you wish to stay miss chessingham you may please remember afterwards that i asked you to go both were pale now and very apprehensive indeed on the basis of my ability to terrify people i could have had a job with a central european secret police at any time i said what were you doing last night chessingham round about ten oclock shall we say last night he blinked why do i have to account for my movements for last night the questions come from me please give an answer i well i was at home with stella and mother all night of course theres no of course no visitors no outsiders to testify to your presence here just stella and mother just miss chessingham at ten oclock your mother would be in bed yes in bed id forgotten im not surprised forgetting is your strong line you forgot to tell me last night that you had been in the rasc the rasc he sat down at the table again not to eat and from the slight movements of his arms i could tell that one hand was gripping the other pretty strongly yes thats right how did you know that a little bird told me the same bird told me that he had seen you driving an army vehicle i was sticking my neck out but id no option time was not on our side you said you couldnt drive i cant his eyes flickered to his sister and then back to me theres a mistake someone is making a mistake thats you chessingham if you keep denying it what if i can produce four independent witnesses by nightfall who will swear to it that they have seen you driving i may have tried once or twice im im not sure i havent a driving licence you make me sick i said in disgust youre speaking and behaving like a moron youre no moron chessingham stop beating about the bush and making a fool of yourself you can drive admit it miss chessingham your brother can drive cant he leave stella alone chessinghams voice was high his face pale youre right damn you i can drive after a fashion i suppose you thought it very clever to abandon that bedford van outside your house two nights ago on the assumption that the police would never believe anyone capable of doing anything so obvious i was never near that van his voice was almost a shout i swear it i swear i was never near that van i got frightened when you came round last night and i said anything i could to to strengthen my innocence innocence i laughed my nasty policemans laugh the photographs of jupiter that you said you took how did you take them or did someone else take them or did you rig up an apparatus to take the pictures automatically while you were away at mordon what in the name of god are you talking about he was getting frantic apparatus what damned apparatus search the house from top to bottom and see if you can find dont be so naive i interrupted probably buried deep in the woods anywhere within fifty square miles of here mr cavell stella chessingham stood in front of me her hands so tight that they were shaking her face mad youre making a terrible mistake eric has nothing to do with with whatever it is this murder nothing i tell you i i know were you with him after half past ten the night before last in his observatory if you werent young lady you dont know i know eric i know hes completely incapable of character testimonials are no good to me i said brusquely and if you know so much perhaps you can explain to me how ј comes to have been deposited in your brothers bank account in the past four months five hundred pounds on july rd the same on october rd can you explain they looked at each other sick fear in their eyes and making no attempt to conceal it when chessingham managed to speak on his second or third attempt his voice was hoarse and shaking its a frameup someone is trying to frame me shut up and talk sense i said wearily where did the money come from chessingham he paused for a moment before replying then said miserably from uncle george his voice had dropped almost to a whisper and he was glancing apprehensively ceilingwards decent of uncle george i said heavily whos he mothers brother his tone was still low the black sheep of the family or so it seems he said he was completely innocent of the crimes with which he had been charged but that the evidence against him had been so overwhelming that hed fled the country i glared at him doubletalk at am after a sleepless night wasnt much in my line what are you talking about what crimes i dont know chessingham sounded desperate weve never seen him hes phoned me twice at mordon mother has never mentioned him we didnt even know he existed until recently you knew about this too i asked stella of course i did your mother of course not chessingham said i told you she never even mentioned his existence whatever he was accused of it must have been something pretty bad he said that if mother knew where the money came from shed call it tainted and refuse it we stella and i want to send her abroad for her health and that money is going to help its going to help you up the steps of the old bailey i said roughly where was your mother born alfringham it was stella who answered chessingham didnt seem capable of it maiden name jane barclay wheres your phone id like to use it she told me and i went out to the hall and put a call through to the general almost fifteen minutes elapsed before i returned to the breakfastroom neither of the two appeared to have moved from the positions in which i left them my god youre a bright pair i said wonderingly it would never have occurred to you of course to pay a visit to somerset house what would be the point you knew you would be wasting your time uncle george never existed your mother never had a brother not that that will be news to you come on now chessingham youve had time to think up a better explanation than that one you couldnt possibly think up a worse one to account for the ј he couldnt think one up at all he stared at me his face grimly hopeless then at his sister then at the ground i said encouragingly well theres no rush about it youll have a few weeks to think up a better story meantime i want to see your mother leave my mother out of this damn you chessingham had risen to his feet with such violence that his chair had gone over backwards my mothers a sick woman and an old one leave her alone you hear cavell i said to stella please go and tell your mother im coming up in a minute chessingham started towards me but his sister got in the way dont eric please she gave me a look that should have pinned me to the wall and said bitterly dont you see that mr cavell is a man who always gets his own way i got my own way the interview with mrs chessingham took no more than ten minutes it wasnt just the most pleasant ten minutes of my life when i came downstairs both chessingham and his sister were waiting in the hall stella came up to me big brown eyes swimming in a pale and frightened face and said desperately youre making a fearful mistake mr cavell a terrible mistake eric is my brother i know him i know him i swear to you that he is completely innocent in everything hell have his chance to prove it there were times when i didnt find any great difficulty in hating myself and this was one of those times chessingham you would be wise to pack a case enough stuff to last you for a few days at least youre taking me with you he looked resigned hopeless ive neither the warrant or the authority for that somebody will come never fear dont be silly as to try to run a mouse couldnt get through the cordon round this house a a cordon he stared you mean there are policemen round think we want you to take the first plane out of the country i asked like dear old uncle george it was a good enough exit line and i left it at that the hartnells were to be my next and last call before breakfast that morning halfway there i pulled up at an aa box on a deserted wooded stretch of road unlocked the booth and put a call through to the waggoners rest by and by mary came on the phone and after shed asked me how i felt and id said fine and shed more or less called me a liar i told her i would be back in the hotel shortly after nine oclock to have breakfast ready for me and to ask hardanger to come round if he could i left the phone booth and although my car was only a few yards away i didnt dawdle any in reaching it the cold grey rain was still sheeting down for all my haste though i suddenly stopped with the door halfopen and stared through the rain at a character coming down the road towards me from a distance of less than a hundred yards he appeared to be a middleaged welldressed citizen wearing a raincoat and trilby but there all resemblance to a normal human being ended he was making his way down the rainfilled gutter by hopping around on his right foot arms outstretched to balance himself kicking a rusty tin can ahead of him with every combined hop and kick a gout of water went spraying up in the air i watched this performance for some time until i became conscious of the rain drumming heavily on my back and soaking through to my shoulders besides even if he had escaped over a high wall it was still rude to stare maybe if i were buried long enough in the wilds of wiltshire i too would take to playing hopscotch in the rain still with my eye on this apparition i eased quickly into the driving seat pulling the door to behind me and it was not until then that i discovered that the purpose of the hopscotch merchant was not to demonstrate the standard of loopiness in rural wiltshire but to distract my attention from the back of my car where someone had been biding crouched down on the floor i heard a slight noise behind me and started to twist but i was far too late the blackjack must have been chopping down even as i heard the sound my left foot was still on the wrong side of the steering column and anyway he was on my left or blind side the blackjack made contact just below and behind my left ear with what must have been considerable force or accuracy or both for the agony and the oblivion were separated by only a hairsbreadth in time chapter eight it wouldnt be accurate to say that i woke up the term waking up implies a fairly rapid and oneway transition from a state of unconsciousness to that of consciousness and there was nothing either rapid or oneway about my progress through the twilight zone that separates those one moment i was greyly aware that i was lying on something hard and wet the next the awareness was gone how long a time elapsed between the intervals of greyness id no means of knowing and even if i had my mind would have been too fuzzy to appreciate it gradually the spells of awareness became longer and longer until eventually there was no more darkness but i wasnt all that sure that this was in any way an improvement or a desirable state of affairs for with returning comprehension came an all but paralysing pain that seemed to hold my head neck and right hand side of my chest in an immense vice a vice with some burly character inexorably tightening the handle i felt the way a grain of wheat must feel after it had passed through a combine harvester painfully i opened my good eye and swivelled it around until i located the source of the dim light a grilled window high up on one wall just below the roof i was in a cellar of some kind of the semisunk basement type featured in chessinghams house id made no mistake about the hardness of the floor or the wetness rough unfinished concrete with shallow pools of water on it and whoever had left me there had thoughtfully dumped me right in the centre of the largest puddle i was lying stretched out on the floor partly on my back partly on my right hand side with my arms behind my back in a ridiculously strained and uncomfortable position i wondered vaguely why i chose to lie in this awkward position and found out when i tried to change it somebody had made a very efficient job of tying my hands behind my back and from the numbness in my forearms it was a fair guess that hed used considerable weight in the tying of the knots i made to gather my legs under me to jerk myself up to a sitting position and discovered that they wouldnt gather i just couldnt move them i used their immobility to lever myself upwards to a sitting position waited until the coruscating lights dancing before my eyes faded and vanished then peered forward and down my legs were not only tied at the ankles they were secured to a metal upright of a winebin which took up practically the entire length of the wall beneath the window and not only was i tied but i was tied with pvc plastic flex if id needed any confirmation that a professional had been at work i didnt any more even a gorilla couldnt snap pvc and nothing less than a pair of hefty pliers could possibly undo the knots fingers were quite useless for the job slowly carefully any rash movement and my head would have fallen off i looked around the cellar it was as featureless and just about as empty as any cellar could ever be the window the closed door the winebin and me it could have been worse no one pouring in water to drown me no one flooding the confined space with a lethal gas no snakes no black widow spiders just the cellar and me but bad enough i hitched myself forwards towards the winebin and tried to snap the wire securing me to it by jerking my legs back as violently as i could but all i did was to add another pain to the overfull quota i had already i struggled to free my hands knowing before i began that i was only wasting my time and gave up almost as soon as i had started i wondered how long it would be before i died of starvation or thirst take it easy i said to myself think your way out of this cavell so i thought as best i could without my head hurting the way it did but it didnt seem to do much good all i could think of was how sore and uncomfortable i was it was then that i saw the hanyatti i blinked shook my head and cautiously looked again no doubt about it the hanyatti the top of the butt just visible three or four inches below and to the side of the lefthand lapel of my coat i stared at it and it still didnt go away i wondered dimly how the man men certainly who had dragged me there had missed it and it slowly came to me that they hadnt missed it because they hadnt looked for it in the first place policemen in britain dont carry guns i was more or less a policeman hence i didnt carry a gun i hunched up my left shoulder and reached my head as far down and to the left as possible at the same time pushing the lapel away with the side of my face on the third try i got my teeth to the butt but they just slipped off the rounded surface when i tried to get a purchase and lift the gun from its holster four times i repeated this manoeuvre and after the fourth attempt i gave up contorting my neck into that strained and unnatural position would have been uncomfortable enough in any event added to the effects of the blackjack the only result this contortion was having was to make the cellar swim dizzily around me at the same time the manoeuvre brought a sharply piercing pain to my right chest and i wondered drearily whether any of my ribs had been broken and were sticking into a lung the way i felt i was prepared to believe anything a brief rest then i had twisted up until i was in a kneeling position i bent sharply from the waist my head coming close to the concrete floor to give gravity an assist in freeing the hanyatti from the holster nothing happened i tried again overdid the violence of the forward jerk and fell flat on my face when my head finally cleared i repeated the process and this time the gun finally slid from the holster and clattered to the floor in the poor halflight of the cellar i knelt and peered anxiously at the gun a character with a sadistic enough turn of mind might have considered it highly amusing to empty the gun and replace it in the holster but id been spared the humorist the loading indicator registered nine the magazine was full i squirmed round on the floor picked up the hanyatti with my bound hands slipped the safety catch and dragged the gun around to my right side as far as the unnaturally twisted position of my left shoulder would allow the folds of my jacket kept getting in the way of the automatic but i strained and pushed until i could see about three inches of the barrel protruding beyond my side i bent my knees and hitched myself forward until my feet were within fifteen inches of the muzzle for a brief moment i considered trying to shoot through the pvc that bound my ankles but only for a brief moment buffalo bill might have done it but then buffalo bill had had binocular vision and i felt pretty certain hed never performed any of his sharpshooting feats in dim halflight with numbed hands bound behind his back the chances were a thousand to one that the net result achieved would be the anticipation of those two london surgeons who wanted to remove my left foot i decided to concentrate instead on the eighteen inch length of four twisted strands of pvc that attached my legs to the wine bin i sighted as best i could and squeezed the trigger three things happened instantaneously and simultaneously the recoil from the gun together with the unnatural position in which i was holding it made me feel as if my right thumb had broken the reverberation of the sound in that confined space had the same effect on my eardrums and i felt a wind ruffle my hair as the ricocheting bullet soundless in flight in that echoing intensity of sound came within half an inch of ending my problems for good and all and a fourth thing happened i missed two seconds later i fired again no hesitation if there was a watchdog upstairs taking his ease hed be charging down the cellar steps in a matter of moments to find out who was breaking up his happy home not only that but i knew if i stopped to consider the chances of the ricochet being that half inch lower this tune i never would get around to pulling that trigger again the close thunder of the explosion and this time i was sure my right thumb had gone but i hardly cared the wire binding me to the winebin was neatly severed in half buffalo bill couldnt have done it any better i twisted grabbed one of the winebin supports with my all but useless hands hoisted myself shakily to my feet rested my left elbow on a convenient shelf and stood there waiting staring at the door anyone coming to investigate would have to pass through that door and as a target a man at six feet was going to be a much simpler proposition altogether than a wire at eighteen inches for a whole minute i stood there motionless apart from the trembling of my legs straining to the utmost what little the gunshots had left me of my hearing nothing i risked a couple of quick hops out to the centre of the cellar and peered up through the high window in case my gaoler was playing it careful and smart again nothing another couple of hops and i was by the door testing the handle with my elbow locked i turned my back on the door scrabbled around with the muzzle of the hanyatti until id found the lock and pulled the trigger with the second shot the door gave abruptly beneath my weight it says much for the state of mind that id never even checked the position of the hinges to see whether the door opened inwards or outwards and fell heavily through the doorway on to the concrete passageway outside if there was anyone waiting out there with the hopeful intention of clobbering me hed never have a better chance no one clobbered me because there was no one waiting there to clobber me dazed and sick i pushed myself wearily to my feet located a light switch and clicked it with my shoulder the naked bulb hanging at the end of a short flex above my head remained dead it could be a dud lamp it could be a blown fuse but my guess was that it meant no power at all the air in that cellar had the musty lifelessncss that bespoke long abandonment by whoever had once owned the house a flight of worn stone steps stretched up into the gloom i hopped up the first two steps teetered on the point of imbalance like a spinning top coming to rest but managed to twist round quickly and sit down before i toppled once down it seemed the safe and prudent thing to do to keep my centre of gravity as low as possible by staying there and i made it to the top of the stairs by jackknifing upwards on the seat of my pants and the soles of my shoes the door at the head of the cellar stairs was also locked but it wasnt my door and i still had five shots left in the hanyatti the lock gave at the first shot and i stumbled out into the hallway beyond the hallway high wide and narrow featured what estate agents euphemistically call a wealth of exposed timbering black ugly adzecut oaken beams everywhere two doors on either side both closed a glass door at the far end another beside me leading presumably to the rear of the house a staircase above my head and an uneven parquet floor thickly covered with a dust streaked by the confused tracks of footprints leading from the glass door to the spot where i was standing the finest feature of the hall was the fact that it was completely deserted i knew now i was alone but for how long i didnt know it seemed a poor idea to waste even a second i didnt want to smear the tracks in the hall so i turned to the door beside me for a change it was unlocked i passed into another passage that gave on the domestic quarters larder pantry kitchen scullery an oldfashioned house and a big one i went through those apartments opening cupboards and pulling drawers out on to the floor but i was wasting my time no signs here of hasty abandonment like the keepers skipping out from the flannan isle lighthouse the exowners had cleaned out the lot when they lit out they hadnt left as much as a safety pin not that a safety pin would have been found of much value in cutting the pvc that bound hands and ankles the outside kitchen door was unlocked i opened it and hopped out into the still heavily falling rain i looked around me but i could have been anywhere an acre of overgrown garden completely run to seed ten foot high hedges that hadnt felt a clipper in years and dripping pines and cypresses soughing under a dark and weeping sky wuthering heights had nothing on it there were two wooden buildings not far away one big enough to be a garage the other less than half the size i hopped my way towards the latter for the sound reason that it was the nearer of the two the door hung crazily on twisted hinges and creaked dismally as i put my shoulder to the splintered wood it was a shed that had been obviously used as a workshop to one side below the filthy window stood a massive workbench with a rusty vice still bolted in position if it wasnt too rusted to turn and if i could find some cutting tool to jam into it that vice would be useful indeed only as far as i could see there were no cutting tools of any description no tools of any kind as in the house so here the departing owners had been nothing if not thorough when it had come to the removal of their goods and chattels the walls were completely bare they had left only one thing and that because it was quite useless a square plywood box half full of rubbish and woodshaving with the aid of a piece of wood i managed to tilt the box and spill its contents on the floor with the stick i stirred the jumble of odds and ends pieces of wood rusty screws bent pieces of metal twisted nails and at last a very old and rusty hacksaw blade it took me ten minutes to jam the blade into the vice my hands were numbed to the point of almost paralytic uselessness and another ten minutes to saw my way through the pvc binding my wrists i could have done it in far less time but as with my hands behind my back i couldnt see what i was doing i had to go easy i could have sawn through an artery or a tendon just as easily as through a wire and i wouldnt have been able to tell the difference my hands were as lifeless as that they looked pretty lifeless too when id severed the last pvc strand and brought them round to the front for examination swollen to a size half as much again as normal with smooth bluishpurple distended skin and the blood swelling slowly from torn skin on the inside of both wrists and most of my fingers i hoped that the dark flaking rust on the blade of the hacksaw that had caused those cuts wasnt going to give me bloodpoisoning i sat on the side of the box for five minutes cursing savagely as the mottled purple of my hands slowly began to vanish and the circulation to come pounding back with the almost intolerably exquisite agony of a thousand barbed needles tearing at the flesh when i could at last hold the hacksaw blade in my hands i cut the pvc on my ankles and cursed some more just as colourfully as before till the blood supply in my feet came back to something like normal i pulled up my shirt to have a look at the righthand side of my chest and just as quickly and roughly stuffed the shirt back under the waistband of my trousers a prolonged inspection would only have made me feel twice as ill as i was already in the few clear patches in the thick crust of blood that covered almost all of the side of my body the grotesquely swelling bruises were already turning all the kaleidoscopic colours of the rainbow i thought sourly that if the man who had used me for football practice had chosen the left instead of the right side of my chest hed have broken all his toes on the hanyatti it was as well that he hadnt i had the hanyatti in my hand as i left the toolshed but i didnt really expect to have to use it i didnt go near the house i knew id find nothing there except the footprints and that was a matter for hardangers experts from the front of the house a driveway curved away between dripping pines and i limped off down the weed grown gravel it would have to lead to a road of sorts a few paces then i stopped and tried to think as best i could with my thinking equipment in the poor shape it was whoever had clobbered and tied me up might want it to be known that i had been temporarily removed from the scene it was just as possible for all i knew to the contrary that he didnt if he didnt the i he couldnt have been able to afford to leave my car where it had been and would have removed it where what simpler and more logical than to hide cavells car where he had hidden cavell i headed back to the garage the car was there i got in slumped wearily back on the cushions sat there for a few minutes then climbed as wearily out again if someone thought it would be to his advantage not to have people know i was out of commission then it might equally well be to my advantage not to have that someone know that i was back in commission again how this would be to my advantage i couldnt even begin to guess at the moment my mind was so gummed up by weakness and exhaustion and the beating i had taken that coherent thought was beyond me all i knew was that i was dimly aware that it might be to my advantage and with the shape i was in and considering the lack of progress i was making i needed every advantage i could get the car would be a dead giveaway i started walking the driveway led to a road that was no more than a rutted track deep in water and viscous mud i turned right for the good enough reason that there was a long steep hill to the left and after perhaps twenty minutes i came to a secondary road with a signpost reading netley common miles netley common i knew was on the main londonalfringham road about ten miles from alfringham which meant id been taken at least six miles from the aa box where i had been laid out i wondered why maybe that had been the only deserted house with a cellar within six miles it took me over an hour to cover the two miles to netley partly because of the shape i was in anyway partly because i kept hopping into bushes and behind the cover of trees whenever a car or a cyclist came along netley common itself i bypassed by taking to the fields empty of all signs of life on that teeming and bitter october morning and finally reached the main road where i sank down halfkneeling halflying in a ditch behind the screen of some bushes i felt like a waterlogged doll coming apart at the seams i was so exhausted that even my chest didnt seem to be hurting any more i was bonechilled as a mortuary slab and shaking like a marionette in the hands of a frenzied puppeteer i was growing old twenty minutes later i had grown a great deal older traffic in rural wiltshire is never up to piccadilly standards at the best of times but even so it was having an offday in that time only three cars and a bus had passed me and as they were all full or nearly so none of them was any use to me what i wanted was a truck with only one man in it or failing that a car with just the driver although how any man alone in a car would react when he saw the wild dishevelled figure of a lifer on the lam or a refugee from a canvas jacket was anybodys guess the next car that came along had two men in it but i didnt hesitate i recognised the slowmoving big black wolseley for what it was long before i could see the uniforms of the men inside the car braked smoothly to a stop and a big burly sergeant relief and concern in his face was out and helping me to my feet as i stumbled up the bank he had the arm and the build to carry weight and i let him take most of mine mr cavell he peered closely into my face it is mr cavell i felt id changed a lot in the past few hours but not all that much so i admitted i was thank god for that theres been half a dozen police cars and heaven only knows how many of the military out looking for you for the past two hours he helped me solicitously into the back seat now you just take it easy sir ill do just that i eased my squelching sodden mudstained figure into a corner im afraid this seat will never be the same again sergeant dont you worry about that sir plenty more cars where this one came from he said cheerfully he climbed in beside the constable at the wheel and picked up the microphone as the car moved off your wife is waiting at the police station with inspector wylie wait a minute i said quickly no hullaballoo about cavell returning from the dead sergeant keep it quiet i dont want to be taken anywhere i can be recognised know of any quiet spot where i could be put up and stay without being seen he twisted and stared at me he said slowly i dont understand i made to say that it didnt matter a damn whether he understood or not but it wouldnt have been fair instead i said it is important sergeant at least i think so any hideaway you know of well he hesitated its difficult mr cavell theres my cottage sergeant the driver volunteered you know jeans away with her mother mr cavell could have that is it quiet has it a phone and is it near alfringham i asked all three of them sir fine many thanks sergeant please speak to your inspector privately ask him to come to this cottage as soon as possible with my wife with superintendent hardanger if hes available and have you the alfringham police i mean a doctor they can rely on who doesnt talk out of turn i mean we do that he peered at me a doctor i nodded and pulled back my jacket the rain of that morning had soaked me to the skin and the blood seeping through from the bruises much diluted had covered most of the shirtfront in a particularly unpleasant shade of brownishred the sergeant took a quick look turned and said softly to the driver come on rollie boy youve always wanted to make like moss and nows your chance but keep your finger off that damned siren then he reached for the microphone and started talking in a low urgent voice im not going into any damned hospital and thats final i said irritably with a couple of ham sandwiches and half a tumbler of whisky inside me i was feeling much more my old nasty self again sorry doc but there it is im sorry too the doctor bending over me in the bed in that police bungalow was a neat methodical and precise man with a neat methodical and precise voice i cant make you go mores the pity i would if i could for youre a pretty sick man in urgent need of radiological examination and hospital care two of your ribs seem cracked and a third is definitely fractured how badly and how dangerously i cant say i dont have xray eyes not to worry i said reassuringly with the way youve strapped me up i cant see any broken ribs sticking into a lung or out through my skin for that matter of it unless you yield to an irresistible compulsion to indulge in violent gymnastics the doctor said dryly we need not concern ourselves with the possibility of you stabbing yourself to death what does concern me is the likelihood of pneumonia broken bones plus the exhausting unpleasant and very wet time youve been through provide an ideal breeding ground pneumonia together with broken ribs make for a very nasty condition cemeteries are full of people who could once have testified to that fact make me laugh some more i said sourly mrs cavell he ignored me and looked at mary sitting still and pale on the other side of the bed check respiration pulse temperature every hour any upward change in those or difficulty in respiration and please contact me at once you have my number finally i must warn you and those gentlemen here he nodded to hardanger and wylie that if mr cavell stirs from his bed inside the next seventytwo hours i refuse to regard myself as in any way medically responsible for his wellbeing he picked up his toolbag and took off as the door closed behind him i swung my legs off the bed and started to pull on a clean shirt it hurt but not as much as i expected it would neither mary nor hardanger said anything and wylie seeing that they had no intention of speaking said you want to kill yourself cavell you heard what dr whitelaw said why dont you stop him superintendent hes off his rocker hardanger explained youll observe inspector that not even his wife tries to stop him some things in this life are a complete and utter waste of time and making cavell see sense is one of them he glared at me so youve been coming all over clever and lonewolfish again havent you and you see what happens look at the bloody mess youre in now literally look at it and nothing to show when in gods name are you going to realise that our only hope lies in working together the hell with your dartagnan methods cavell system method routine cooperation thats the only way you ever get anywhere against big crime and damn well you know it i know it i agreed patient skilled men working hard under patient skilled supervision sure im with you but not here no room for patience now patient men take time and we have no time youve made arrangements for an armed watch to be kept on this house i was in and to have your sleuths examine the footprints he nodded your story lets waste no more time youll have it just as soon as you tell me why you havent bawled me out for wasting valuable police time in searching for me and why you havent tried to use your authority to make me stay in bed are we worried superintendent the newspapers have the story he said flatly about the breakin the murders the theft of the satan bug we didnt expect that last thing theyre hysterical already screaming banner headlines in every national daily he pointed to a pile of newspapers on the floor beside him want to see them and waste more time i can guess thats not all thats worrying you it isnt the general was on the phone he was looking for you half an hour ago six gestetner duplicated letters delivered by special messengers this morning to the biggest concerns in fleet street character saying that his previous warning had been ignored no acknowledgement of it on the am bbc news the walls of mordon still stood some rubbish like that said that within the next few hours he would give a demonstration proving he had those viruses and he was willing to use them will the papers print it theyll print it first of all they the editors got together and contacted the special branch at scotland yard the assistant commissioner got in touch with the home secretary and i gather there was some kind of emergency meeting anyway a cabinet order not to print fleet street i gather told the government to take a running jump to itself and told the government that it is the servant of the people and not vice versa and that if the nation stood in deadly peril and that on the face of it they certainly seemed to the people had the right to know they also reminded the government that if they put one little foot wrong in this matter they would be out on their ears overnight the london evening papers will be on the streets about now ill bet the headlines are the biggest since ve day the balls up on the slates i nodded i watched mary her face expressionless and carefully not looking at me button my shirtcuffs with both wrists bandaged and my fingers heavily scratched it was a bit much for me and went on well itll certainly provide the british public with a conversational change from the football pools what soandso said on tv last night and the latest rock and roll sensation i went on to tell him of what happened during the night omitting my trip to london to see the general at the end hardanger said heavily very very interesting are you trying to tell me that you woke up in the middle of the night and without telling mary started chasing and phoning around wiltshire im telling you the old secret police technique and you cant beat it get them at their sleepiest and most apprehensive and youre already halfway there and i didnt go to sleep in the first place i went without telling because i knew damned well it would go so much against all your training and instincts that you wouldnt hesitate to use force to stop me if i had he said coldly you might have a full set of ribs right now if you had we wouldnt have narrowed this list so much five of them i let drop to all of them that we were getting pretty close to an answer and one of them was scared enough to panic and try to stop me you assume its a damned good assumption got a better for a starter i suggest we haul in chessingham straight away theres plenty on him and i forgot hardanger interrupted you phoned the general last night yes i didnt even bother to look shamefaced wanted authority to hash about in my own way knew you wouldnt grant it clever devil arent you if he guessed i was lying there were no signs of it in his face you asked him to check on this fellow chessingham his service career seems he was a driver in the rasc thats it then going to pull him in yes his sister she wouldnt be guilty of anything other than covering up for her own flesh and blood and the mother is in the clear thats for sure so that leaves the four others you contacted this morning youd put them all in the clear i would not take colonel weybridge the only certain facts we know about him are these he has access to the security files and so would be in a position to blackmail dr hartnell into cooperating you mentioned last night you thought hartnell was in the clear i said id reservations about him secondly why didnt our gallant colonel like his gallant commanding officer volunteer to go into the lab instead of me was it because he knew the botulinus virus was loose in there thirdly he is the only one without an alibi for the time of the murder good lord cavell youre not suggesting we pull in colonel weybridge i can tell you we had a pretty nasty time from both cliveden and weybridge when we insisted on fingerprinting their quarters this morning cliveden actually phoned the assistant commissioner and got his head in his hands in a gentlemanly sort of way he hates our guts now that helps this fingerprinting of the suspects houses anything turned up yet give them a chance hardanger protested its not one oclock yet be a couple of hours before they finish tabulating their results and i cant pull in weybridge the war office would have my scalp in twentyfour hours if this lad with the satan bug starts chucking it around i said there wont be any war office in twentyfour hours peoples feelings have ceased to be of any concern besides you dont have to throw him in the cooler confine him to his quarters open arrest house arrest whatever you call it anything turned up in the past few hours a thousand stones and nothing under any of them hardanger said grimly the hammer and pliers were definitely the ones used in the breakin but wed been sure of that anyway not a single useful print in the bedford decoy van the same for the telephone box which was used to make the call to reuters last night weve put your moneylending friend tuffnell and his partner through the mill and had the fraud squad examine their books until we know as much about their business as they do themselves we could have them both behind bars in a week but i just cant be bothered anyway dr hartnell is definitely their only customer from number one lab the london police are trying to trace the man who sent the letters to fleet street if were wasting our time down here they might as well waste their time up there inspector martin has spent the entire morning questioning everyone in number one lab about their social relations with each other and the only thing he has turned up so far is that dr hartnell and chessingham were on visiting terms we already knew that were having a check made on every known movement of every suspect in the past year and we have teams of men checking with the occupants of every house within three miles of mordon to see if they noticed anything strange or out of the way on the night of the murders something is bound to turn up sometime if you spread the net wide enough and the meshes are small enough it always does sure in a couple of weeks or a couple of months our friend with the satan bug has promised to do his stuff in a few hours damn it superintendent we cant just wait for something to turn up organisation no matter on how massive a scale wont do it method number two lighting a meerschaum and making like sherlock isnt going to get us far either we have to provoke a reaction you already provoked a reaction hardanger said sourly see where it got you you want more reactions how as a starter investigate every financial transaction and every bank book entry of everyone working in number one every entry in the past year and dont forget weybridge and cliveden let the suspects know then squads of policemen to every house search each house from top to bottom and have the searchers list every tiniest thing they find this will not only worry the man were after it might actually turn up something if were going to go that far inspector wylie put in we might as well throw the lot of them in the cooler its one sure way of taking our man out of circulation hopeless inspector we may be dealing with a maniac but hes a brilliant maniac hed have thought of that possibility months ago hes got an organisation nobody in mordon could possibly have delivered those letters in london this morning and you can bet your pension that the first thing hed have done after getting the viruses would be to get rid of them well try stirring things up hardanger said reluctantly though where im going to find all the men to pull them off the housetohouse questioning its a waste of time he nodded again reluctantly and spoke at length on the phone while i finished dressing when he put the phone down he said to me im not going to waste my breath arguing go ahead and kill yourself but you might think of mary im thinking of her all right im thinking that if our unknown friend gets careless with the satan bug therell soon be no mary therell be nothing this seemed to be a pretty effective conversation stopper but after some time wylie said thoughtfully if this unknown friend does give a demonstration i wonder if the government really would close down mordon close it our pal wants it flattened to the ground its impossible to guess what they will do things are only at the badlyscaring stage so far no ones out and out terrified speak for yourself hardanger said sourly and just what are you thinking of doing now cavell if youll be kind enough to tell me he added with heavy irony ill tell you dont laugh but im going to disguise myself i fingered the scars on my left cheek a little assistance from mary and her warpaint and these will be gone hornrim spectacles a pencil moustache grey suit credentials identifying me as inspector gibson of the metropolitan police and im a changed man whos going to supply the credentials hardanger asked suspiciously me not necessary i always carry them around with me anyway just in case i ignored his stare and went on and then ill call again on our friend dr macdonald in his absence if you understand the good doctor on a modest salary manages to live like a minor eastern potentate everything except the harem and maybe he discreetly keeps that somewhere else also drinking heavily because hes worried stiff about the satan bug and his own personal safety i dont believe him so im calling on him youre wasting your time hardanger said heavily macdonald is above suspicion long distinguished and spotless record spent twenty minutes this morning going over it ive read it i said some of the star turns in the old bailey over the past few years have had immaculate records until the law caught up with them hes a highly respected character locally wylie put in bit of a snob associates only with the very best people but everyone speaks very well of him and theres more to his record than youve read cavell hardanger went on in the report theres only a brief mention of his wartime service in the army but it so happens im a personal friend of the colonel who commanded macdonalds regiment in the last two years of the war i rang him up dr macdonald it seems has been strangely reticent about himself did you know that as a second lieutenant in belgium in he won the dso and the bar that he finished up as a lieut colonel in a tank regiment with a string of medals as long as your arm i didnt and i dont get it i admitted he struck me as a phoneytough type who if ever hed done any valorous deeds wouldnt have been backward about admitting them he wanted me to think he was afraid he didnt want me to think he was brave why because he knew he had to justify his heavy drinking so he put it down to personal fear but in view of his record it almost certainly wasnt that queer item number one queer item number two why wasnt all this listed in his security report easton derry compiled most of those dossiers and derry would be unlikely to overlook so large a gap in a mans history i dont know about that hardanger admitted but this much is certain if the report i had on macdonald is correct then on the face of it it seems highly unlikely that a man so brave selfless and patriotic could possibly be mixed up in anything like that this colonel of macdonalds regiment who told you about him could you get him down here immediately hardanger let me have his cool speculative look thinking hes a phoney in every sense that this mans been substituted for the real macdonald i dont know what to think we must have another squint at his record card and check that derry really did compile it we can soon fix that hardanger nodded this time he was on the phone for almost ten minutes and when hed finished with that so had mary with my face and i was all ready to go hardanger said you look bloody awful but i wouldnt recognise you if i saw you in the street the files in the safe in my hotel shall we go there i turned to leave the room hardanger took a look at the palms and fingers of my hands still slowly welling blood from the hacksaw scratches he said irritably why didnt you have the doctor bandage your fingers as well want to get blood poisoning have you ever tried to use a gun with your fingers bandaged together i asked sourly well man a pair of gloves then thats ridiculous just as bad couldnt get a finger through the trigger guard rubber gloves he said impatiently plastic its a point i agreed certainly it would hide those damn scratches i stared at him without seeing him then sat down heavily on the bed hells bells i said softly i sat very still for a few seconds nobody spoke i went on speaking more to myself than anyone else rubber gloves to cover the scratches then why not elastic stockings why not i looked up vaguely and saw hardanger glancing at wylie maybe thinking that they had let the doctor go too soon but mary came to my rescue she touched my arm and i turned to look at her her face was set and the big green eyes wide with apprehension and the birth of an unpleasant certainty mordon she whispered the fields round it gorse theyre covered with gorse and she was wearing elastic stockings pierre what in heavens name hardanger began harshly inspector wylie i interrupted how long would it take you to get an arrest warrant murder accessory no time at all he said grimly he patted his breast pocket i have three of them here already signed like you said yourself there are times when we cant wait for the law we fill em in murder eh accessory and the name hardanger demanded he still wasnt sure that he shouldnt be calling the doctor dr roger hartnell i said chapter nine what in the name of god are you talking about dr roger hartnell a young man with a face suddenly old and tired and strained stared at us then at his wife who was standing rigidly beside them then back at us again accessory after murder what are you talking about man its our belief that you know well enough what we are talking about wylie said calmly it was the inspectors bailiwick and it was he who had just read out the charge and was making the formal arrest he went on i have to warn you that what you say now may be used against you at your trial it would help us if you made a full confession now i admit but arrested men have their rights you may wish to take legal advice before you speak like hell he was going to take legal advice he was going to talk before he left that house and hardanger wylie and i all knew it will someone please explain what this this nonsense is about mrs hartnell said coldly the slightly supercilious incomprehension the wellbred distaste were done to a turn but the hostile rigidity of the figure overdone the gripping hands so tightly clasped that the tremor showed and she was still wearing the elastic stockings gladly wylie said yesterday dr hartnell you made a statement to mr cavell here to cavell hartnell did some more staring thats not cavell i didnt like my old face i said do you blame me inspector wylie is talking hartnell to the effect wylie went on that you made a late trip night before last to see mr tuffnell intensive investigation has turned up several people who were in a position to have seen you had you travelled in the direction you said you did at the time you said you did not one of those people saw you thats point number one and quite a good point it was too even if the purest fiction the check had been made all right but not a single witness found to confirm or deny hartnells story which had been just as expected point number two wylie went on mud was found last night under the front mudguard of your motorscooter a mud which seems to be identical with the red loam found locally only outside mordon we suspect you went there early in the evening to reconnoitre your machine is at present being moved to police laboratories for tests point number my scooter hartnell looked as if a bridge had fallen on him mordon i swear to number three later that night you took your scooter and wife to a spot near chessinghams house you almost gave yourself away to mr cavell you said that the policeman alleged to have seen you on your scooter could back up your story about the trip to alfringham and then you remembered almost too late that if he had seen you he would also have seen your wife on the pillion seat we found the imprint of your scooters wheels among bushes not twenty yards from where the bedford had been abandoned careless doctor very careless i note youre not protesting that one he couldnt wed found the imprints less than twenty minutes previously points four and five hammer used to stun the guard dog pliers used to cut the mordon fence both found last night in your toolshed again by mr cavell why you filthy sneaking thieving his face twisted the hairtrigger control suddenly snapped and he flung himself at me clawed hands outstretched he didnt get three feet hardanger and wylie just moved in massively from either side and pinned him helplessly between their bulks hartnell struggled madly uselessly his insane fury increasing i took you in here you you swine i entertained your wife i did his voice weakened and faded and when it came again it was another man talking the hammer used to stun the dog the pliers here in my house they were found here how could they have been found here he couldnt have been more bewildered if hed heard the late senator mccarthy declaring himself to be a lifelong communist they couldnt have been found here what are they talking about jane hed turned to his wife and his face was desperate were talking of murder wylie said flatly i didnt expect your cooperation hartnell please come along both of you theres some terrible mistake i i dont understand a terrible mistake hartnell stared as us his face hunted i can clear it up im sure i can clear it up if you have to take anyone with you take me but dont drag my wife along please why not i said you didnt hesitate to drag her along a couple of nights ago i dont know what youre talking about he said wearily would you say the same thing mrs hartnell i asked in view of the statement made by your doctor who saw you less than three weeks ago that you are in perfect health what do you mean she demanded she was under better control than her husband what are you getting at the fact that you went to a chemists in alfringham yesterday and bought a pair of elastic stockings the gorse outside mordon is pretty vicious stuff mrs hartnell and it was very dark when you ran off after decoying the soldiers from their truck you were pretty badly scratched werent you and you had to cover those scratches didnt you policemen are just naturally suspicious especially in a murder case this is entirely ridiculous her voice was flat mechanical how dare you insinuate you are wasting our time madam hardanger spoke for the first time his voice sharp and authoritative we have a policewoman outside must i bring her in silence very well then i suggest we leave for the police station could i have a few words with dr hartnell first i asked alone that is hardanger and wylie exchanged glances id already had their permission but i had to have it again to make things right for them if the need arose at the trial why hardanger demanded dr hartnell and i used to know each other fairly well i said we were on fairly friendly terms time is desperately short he might be willing to talk to me talk to you its no easy feat to sneer and shout at the same moment but hartnell achieved it by god never tune is indeed short hardanger agreed sombrely ten minutes cavell he nodded to mrs hartnell she hesitated looked at her husband then walked out followed by hardanger and wylie hartnell made to follow but i swung across and blocked his way let me past his voice was low and ugly ive nothing to say to people like you he gave a short description of what he thought people like me were like and when i showed no signs of stepping aside he swung back his right fist for a clumsy roundhouse swing that a blind octogenarian could have parried or avoided i showed him my gun and he changed his mind have you a cellar in your house i asked a cellar yes we he broke off and his face was ugly again if you think youre going to take me i swung my left fist in imitation of his own cumbersome effort and when he lifted his right arm in defence i tapped him with the barrel of the hanyatti just enough to take the fight out of him caught his left arm up behind his left shoulder and marched him down towards the rear of the house where a flight of steps led down to a cellar i closed the door behind us and shoved him roughly on to a rough wooden bench he sat there for some seconds rubbing his head then looked up at me this is a putup job he said hoarsely hardanger and wylie they knew you were going to do hardanger and wylie are hampered i said coldly theyre hampered by regulations concerning interrogation of suspects theyre hampered by the thoughts of careers and pensions i have no such thoughts im a private individual and you think youll get away with this he said incredulously do you seriously think i wont talk about it by the time i have finished i said impersonally i doubt whether you will be able to talk ill have the truth in fifteen minutes and i wont leave a mark im an expert on torture hartnell a group of belgian quislings gave me a course of instruction over a period of three weeks i was the subject try hard to believe i dont care much if you are badly hurt he looked at me he was trying hard not to believe me but he wasnt sure there was nothing tough about hartnell lets try it the easy way first though i said lets try it by reminding you that theres a madman on the loose with the satan bug threatening to wipe out god knows how much of england if his conditions arent met and his first demonstration is due any hour what are you talking about he demanded hoarsely i told him what hardanger had told me and then went on if this madman wipes out any part of the country the nation will demand revenge theyll demand a scapegoat and public pressure will be so terrific that theyll get their scapegoat surely youre not so stupid as not to see that surely youre not so stupid that you cant visualise your wife jane with the hangmans knot under her chin as the executioner opens the trapdoor the fall the jolt the snapping of the vertebrae the momentary reflex kicking of the feet can you see your wife hartnell can you see what you are going to do to her she is young to die and death by hanging is a terrible death and its still the prescribed penalty for a guilty accessory to murder for gain he looked up at me dull hate and misery in the sick eyes in the halflight of the cellar his face was grey and there was the sheen of sweat on his forehead i went on you realise that you can retract any statement you make to me here without witnesses a statement is valueless i paused and dropped my voice youre deep in this arent you he nodded he was staring at the floor whos the killer whos behind all this i dont know as god is my judge i dont know a man rang me up and offered me money if id cause this diversion jane and myself i thought he was crazy and if he wasnt something stank about it i refused next morning ј arrived by post with a note to say there would be ј more if i did what i was told a a fortnight went by and then he came on the phone again his voice did you recognise his voice it was deep and muffled ive no idea who it was i think he was talking with something over the mouthpiece what did he say the same as his note there would be this other ј if i did as he asked and i said i would he was still looking downwards i i had already spent part of the money received the extra ј not yet how much have you spent of the ј you received about forty show me the rest of it its not here not in the house i went out last night after you had been here and buried the remainder in the woods what was the money in denominations i mean fivers bank of england fivers i see all very interesting doctor i crossed to the bench where he was sitting screwed my hand into his hair jerked his head savagely upwards jammed the barrel of the hanyatti into his solar plexus and as he gasped in pain brought up the barrel and thrust it between his teeth for ten seconds i stood like that motionless while he stared up at me with eyes crazy with fear i felt slightly sick one chance is all you get from me hartnell i said in a low voice youve had that chance now the treatment you rotten contemptible liar expect me to believe a crazy story like that do you think the brilliant mind behind this would have phoned asking you to make a diversion knowing very well that the chances were high that you would at once go to the police put them and the army at mordon on their guard and so ruin all his plans do you think this man in an area where automatic exchanges are not yet installed would have spoken to you when any operator with time on her hands could have listened in to every word he said are you so naive as to imagine that i would be so naive as to believe that do you believe this man with a genius for organisation would leave everything the success of all his plans dependent on the lastminute factor of the strength of your greed do you believe he would pay in fivers which can as often as not be traced and which could also have if not his prints then those of the cashier issuing them do you expect me to believe that he would offer ј for the job when he could get a couple of experts from london to do it for a tenth of that and finally do you think id believe your yarn about burying the money in the woods at night so that come the dawn if you were told to dig them up by the police you would be unable to find them again i stood back taking the gun from his face or shall we go and look for that money now oh god its useless he was completely crushed his voice a moan im finished cavell im finished ive been borrowing all over the place and now im over two thousand in debt cut the sobstory i said harshly it doesnt interest me tuffnell the moneylender was pressing me hard he went on dully he wasnt looking anywhere near me im mess secretary at mordon ive embezzled over six hundred pounds someone god knows who or how found out and sent me a note saying that if i didnt cooperate hed lay the facts before the police i cooperated i put the gun away the ring of truth is far from having the belllike clarity some innocents would believe but i knew hartnell was too beaten to prevaricate further i said you have no clue at all as to the identity of the man sending the note no and i swear i dont know anything about the hammer or the pliers or the red mud on the scooter my leg was now hurting so badly that theyd given me a police car and police driver but even so i didnt enjoy the trip across to dr macdonalds house time was running out and all i could see was a brick wall that evening there would appear in all the evening papers a carefully worded account of how two mordon scientists had been arrested and charged with murder and that the final solution of the theft of the satan bug was only hours away and while it might we hoped lull the suspicions of the real killers it wasnt advancing our cause very much blind men in a fog at midnight and no leads just no leads at all hardanger was going to open an intensive investigation in mordon to find out who might have had access to the mess accounts probably i thought bitterly only a couple of hundred people or so i was met at the door of dr macdonalds house by his housekeeper she was in her middle thirties more than passably goodlooking and gave her name as mrs turpin her face was like thunder the face of the faithful retainer powerless to defend her masters property against ravage and assault when i showed my false credentials and asked to be allowed in she said bitterly that another prying nosyparker more or less couldnt do any harm now the house appeared to be alive with plainclothes policemen i identified myself to the man in charge a detectivesergeant by the name of carlisle found anything interesting yet sergeant hard to say been here over an hour starting from the top and weve found nothing that strikes me as suspicious in itself dr macdonald does seem to do himself pretty well i must say and one of my men campbell whod dead keen on all this art rubbish says that a lot of the pictures pottery and other junk about the place is worth a fair bit of anyones money and you ought to see the darkroom he has in the attic theres a thousand quids worth of photographic equipment there if theres a pennys worth darkroom that might be interesting never heard that dr macdonald was interested in photography lord bless my soul yes hes one of the best amateur photographers in the country hes the president of our photographic club in alfringham theres a cabinet through in his study there thats fair loaded with trophies he makes no secret of that i can assure you sir i left him and his men to their search if they couldnt find anything neither could i and went upstairs to the darkroom carlisle hadnt exaggerated any dr macdonald did himself as well in the way of cameras as he did in the other material things of life but i didnt spend much tune there i didnt see how cameras came into the business at all i made a mental note to bring an expert police photographer down from london to check the equipment in the one in a thousand chance that something might turn up and then went downstairs to see mrs turpin im really most sorry about all this upset mrs turpin i said pleasantly just pure routine you know must be a pleasure for you to look after a beautiful place like this if youve got any questions to ask ask them she snapped and none of your smartalecky beating about the bush that didnt leave much room for finesse i said how many years have you been with dr macdonald four ever since he came here a finer gentleman you wouldnt find anywhere why do you ask he has a great deal of valuable stuff here i listed about a dozen items ranging from the magnificent carpeting to the paintings how long has he had those i dont have to answer any questions mr inspector the helpful type no i admitted you dont especially if you wish to make things unpleasant for your employer she glared at me hesitated then answered my questions at least half the stuff macdonald had brought with him four years ago the rest he had bought at fairly regular intervals since mrs turpin was one of those formidable women with a photographic memory for all the more monumental irrelevancies of life and she could more or less quote the date hour and the weather conditions at the time of the delivery of each item i knew id be wasting my time even trying to confirm her statements if mrs turpin said such and such was so and so then it was and that was all there was to it this certainly helped to set macdonald in the clear no sudden suspicious influx of wealth in recent weeks or months hed been buying on this lavish scale over a period of years where he got the wherewithal to buy on this lavish scale i couldnt guess but it hardly seemed important now as hed said himself as an independent bachelor without relatives he could afford to live it up i moved back into the sittingroom and saw carlisle coming towards me with a couple of large files in his hands were giving dr macdonalds study a thorough goingover now sir listing everything of course but i thought these might interest you seems to be some sort of official correspondence it did interest me but not in the way i expected the more i turned up about macdonald the more innocuous he seemed the file contained carbon copies of his letters to and replies from fellowscientists and various scientific organisations throughout europe mainly the world health organisation there was no doubt from these letters that macdonald was a highly gifted and highly respected chemist and microbiologist one of the top men in his own field almost half of his letters were addressed to certain affiliations of the who particularly in paris stockholm bonn and rome nothing sinister or unpatriotic about that this would be unclassified stuff and the frequent cosignature of dr baxter on the carbon was guarantee enough of that besides although it was supposed to be a secret all the scientists in mordon knew that then mail was under constant censorship i glanced through the file again and put it aside as the phone rang it was hardanger and he sounded fairly grim what he had to say made me feel grim too a phone call to alfringham had stated that if police investigations werent suspended for twentyfour hours something very unpleasant was going to happen to pierre cavell who as they would be aware had disappeared proof that the caller knew where cavell was would be forthcoming if police investigations were not halted by six oclock that evening it wasnt the first part of it that made me feel grim i said well we were expecting something like it with all the threats i was dropping at the crack of dawn today they must have thought that i was making too much progress for their comfort you flatter yourself my friend hardanger said in his gravelly voice youre only a pawn the call wasnt made to the police but to your wife at the waggoners rest telling her that if the general he gave his full name rank and address didnt pull in his horns then she mary would receive a pair of ears in the mail tomorrow the caller said that he was sure that though she had been married only a couple of months she would still be able to recognise her husbands ears when she saw them i felt the hairs prickle on the back of my neck and that had nothing to do with any imagined sensation of earcropping i said carefully there are three things hardanger the number of people in those parts who know we have been married only two months must be pretty few the number of people who know that mary is the generals daughter must be even fewer but the number of people who know the generals true identity apart from yourself and myself can be counted on one hand how in gods name could any criminal in the land know the generals true identity you tell me hardanger said heavily this is the nastiest development of the lot this man not only knows who the general is but knows that mary is his only child and the apple of his eye the one person in the world who might be able to bring pressure to bear on him and shed bring the pressure all right the abstract ideals of justice dont matter a damn to women when their mens lives are in danger the whole thing stinks cavell to high heaven i agreed slowly of treason and treason in high places i dont think wed better talk about it over the phone hardanger said quickly no tried tracing the call not yet but i might as well waste time that way as any other he hung up and i stood there staring at the silent telephone the general was a personal appointee of the prime minister and the home secretary his identity was also known to the chiefs of espionage and counterespionage it had to be an assistant commissioner hardanger himself the commandant and security chief at mordon and that ended the list of those to whom the generals identity was known it was an ugly thought i wondered vaguely how general cliveden was going to enjoy the next couple of hours i didnt require any powers of telepathy to know where hardanger would be heading as soon as he had put down that phone of all our suspects only cliveden knew the generals identity maybe i should have been paying more attention to general cliveden a shadow darkened the hall doorway i glanced up to see three khakiclad figures standing at the head of the outside steps the man in the centre a sergeant had his hand raised to the bellpush but lowered it when he caught sight of me im looking for an inspector gibson he said is he here gibson i suddenly remembered that was me im inspector gibson sergeant ive something here for you sir he indicated the file under his arm ive been ordered to ask for your credentials first of all i showed them and he handed over the file he said apologetically im under orders not to let that out of my sight sir superintendent hardanger said it came from mr clandons records offices and i understand its highly confidential of course followed by the sergeant who was flanked by a couple of hefty privates i walked into the livingroom ignoring the outraged glare of mrs turpin who had belatedly appeared on the scene i asked her to leave and she did glowering savagely i broke the seal and opened the file it contained a spare seal for resealing the cover and a copy of dr macdonalds security report id seen the report before of course when id taken over as head of security from the vanished easton derry but had paid no particular attention to it id had no special reason to but i had now there were seven pages of foolscap i went through it three times i didnt miss a thing the first time and if possible even less the next two i was looking for even the tiniest offbeat jarring note that might give me even the most insubstantial lead senator mccarthy sniffing out a communist had nothing on me but i found not the slightest trace of anything that might have been helpful the only odd thing as hardanger had pointed out was the extremely scanty information about macdonalds army career and to information easton derry who had indeed compiled the report must have had access but nothing except for a remark at the foot of a page that macdonald entering the army as a private in the territorials in had finished his army career in italy as a lieutenantcolonel in a tank division in the top of the following page held a reference to his appointment as a government chemist in northeast england early in this could have been just the way easton derry had compiled the report or not with the blade of my penknife and ignoring the sergeants scandalised look i pried open the buckram corner holding the top left hand corners of the pages together under this was a thin wire staple the kind of staple that comes with practically every kind of commercial stapler i bent the ends back at right angles slid the sheets off and examined them separately no sheet had more than one pair the original pair of holes made by the stapler if anyone had opened that staple to remove a sheet hed replaced it with exceptional care on the face of it it looked as if that file hadnt been tampered with i became aware that carlisle the plainclothes detectivesergeant was standing beside me holding a bundle of papers and folders he said this might interest you sir i dont know just a moment i clipped the sheets together again pushed them into the fileholder resealed it and handed it back to the army sergeant who took himself oft along with his two companions i said to carlisle what are those photographs sir photographs what makes you think be interested in photographs sergeant the fact that they were inside a locked steel box sir and the box was in the bottom drawer also locked of a kneehole desk and heres a bundle found in the same place personal correspondence i would say much trouble in opening the steel box not with the size of hacksaw i use sir weve just about tied it all up now inspector everything listed if i might venture an opinion youll find little of interest in the list searched the whole house any basement just about the filthiest coalcellar you ever clapped eyes on carlisle smiled from what ive seen of dr macdonalds personal tastes he doesnt strike me as the type of man who would keep even coal in a coalcellar if he could find a cleaner and more luxurious place for it he left me to his finds there were four albums three of them were of the innocuous squintingintothesun type of family albums you can find in a million british homes most of the photographs were faded and yellow taken in the days of macdonalds youth in the twenties and thirties the fourth album of much more recent origin was a presentation given to macdonald by colleagues in the world health organisation in recognition of his outstanding services to the who over many years an illuminated address pasted to the inside front board said so it contained over fifty pictures of macdonald and his colleagues taken in at least a dozen different european cities most of the photographs had been taken in france scandinavia and italy with a sprinkling from a few other countries they had been mounted in chronological fashion each picture with date and location caption the last having been taken in helsinki less than six months previously the photographs in the album didnt interest me what did interest me was one photograph that was missing from its place in the album it had almost certainly been taken about eighteen months previously its caption had been all but obliterated by horizontal strokes made in the same white ink used for all captions i switched on the light and peered closely at the obliteration no question but that the place name had once started with a t after that it was hard to say the next letter could have been either an o or a d o i felt sure there was no city in europe beginning with td the remainder of the word was completely obliterated to about six letters in length possibly seven but none of the letters projected below the line so that cut out all words with ps and gs and js and so forth what cities or towns in europe did i know beginning with the letters to and six or seven letters in length not so very many i realised at least not of any size and the who didnt hold its meetings in villages torquay no good letters projecting below totnes too small in europe tornio in sweden tondor in denmark again both relatively insignificant toledo now no one could call that a village but macdonald had never been to spain the best bets were probably either touraai in belgium or toulon in france tournai toulon for a moment or two i mulled the names over in my mind i picked up the bundle of letters there must have been thirty or forty letters in the bundle faintly scented and tied of all things with a blue ribbon of all the things i would have expected to find in dr macdonalds possession this was the last and i would have bet a months salary the most useless they looked like love letters and i didnt particularly relish the prospect of making myself conversant with the good doctors youthful indiscretions but just at that moment i would have read homer in the original if i thought it would be any good to me i untied the bow on the ribbon exactly five minutes later i was speaking on the phone to the general i want to interview a certain mme yvette peugot who was working in the pasteur institute in paris in and not next week not tomorrow but now this afternoon can you fix it sir i can fix anything cavell the general said simply less than two hours ago the premier put the entire resources of all the services at our disposal hes as windy as hell how urgent is this maybe lifeordeath urgent sir thats what ive got to find out this woman appears to have been on very intimate terms with macdonald for about nine months towards and after the end of the war its the one period of his life about which information is lacking if shes still alive and traceable she may be able to fill in this period is that all the voice was flat disappointment barely concealed what of the letters themselves only read a couple so far sir seem perfectly innocuous though not the sort of stuff id care to have read out in court if i had written it it seems very little to go on cavell a hunch sir more than that it is possible that a page has been abstracted from the security dossier on macdonald the dates on those letters correspond to the missing page if it is missing and if it is i want to find out why missing his voice crackled sharply over the wire how could a page from a security dossier possibly be missing who would have or have had access to those dossiers easton clandon myself and cliveden and weybridge precisely general cliveden a significant pause this recent threat to mary to let her have your head on a charger general cliveden is the only man in mordon who knows both who i am and the relationship between myself and mary one of the only two men with access to security dossiers dont you think you should be concentrating on cliveden i think hardanger should be concentrating on cliveden i want to see mme peugot very well hold on i held on and after some minutes his voice came again drive to mordon helicopter there will fly you to stanton airfield twinseat jet nightfighter there forty minutes from stanton to paris that suit you fine im afraid ive no passport with me sir you wont require it if mme peugot is still alive and still in paris shell be waiting for you in orly airport that i promise ill see you when i return im leaving for alfringham in thirty minutes he hung up and i turned away the bundle of letters in my hand i caught sight of mrs turpin by the open door her face expressionless her eyes moved from mire down to the packet of letters in my hand then met mine again after a moment she turned and disappeared i wondered how long she had been there looking and listening the general was as good as his word all the way through the helicopter was waiting for me at mordon the jet at stanton took exactly thirtyfive hairraising minutes to reach orly airport and mme peugot accompanied by a parisian police inspector was waiting for me in a private room there somebody i thought had moved very fast indeed as it turned out it hadnt been so difficult to locate mme peugot now madame halle she still worked in the same place as she had done in the later months of her acquaintanceship with macdonald the pasteur institute and had readily agreed to come to the airport when the police had made plain the urgency she was a dark plump attractive forty and had readily smiling eyes at that moment she was hesitant unsure and slightly apprehensive the normal reaction when police start taking an interest in you the french police officer made the introductions i said wasting no time we would be most grateful if you could give us some information about an englishman whose acquaintance you made in the middle forties and to be precise a dr alexander macdonald dr macdonald alex she laughed hed be furious to hear himself described as an englishman at least he would have been in the days when i knew him he was the most ardent scottish what do you call it nationalist of course a scottish nationalist fervent i remember forever saying down with the old enemy england and up with the old francoscottish alliance but i do know he fought most gallantly for the old enemy in the last war so perhaps he was not so terribly sincere she broke off and looked at me with an odd mixture of shrewdness and apprehension he hes not dead is he no madame he is not but he is in trouble police trouble she was quick and clever had seized at once on the almost imperceptible inflection in my voice im afraid he may be how and when did you first meet him madame halle two or three months before the war ended the european war i mean colonel macdonald as he was then was sent to examine a munitions and chemical factory that had been run by the germans for years at st denis i was working in the research division of the same factory not from choice i assure you i did not know then that colonel macdonald was himself a brilliant chemist i took it upon myself to explain to him the various chemical processes and production lines and it wasnt until id finished the tour of the factory that i found out that he knew far more about it than i did she smiled i think the gallant colonel had rather taken a fancy to me and i to him i nodded judging from the highly combustible tone of her letters she was considerably understating the case he remained for several months in the paris area she continued i dont quite know what his duties were but they were mostly of a technical nature every free moment we had we spent together she shrugged its all so long ago it seems another world he returned to england for demobilisation and was back inside a week he tried to find employment in paris but it was impossible i think he eventually got some sort of research job with the british government did you ever know or hear or suspect anything shady or reprehensible about colonel macdonald i asked bluntly never if i had i would not have associated with him the conviction of the words the dignity of manner made it impossible not to believe her i had the sudden hollow feeling that perhaps the general had been right after all and that i was just wasting valuable time if on bitter reflection my time could be called valuable on a wildgoose chase cavell returning home with his tail between his legs nothing i persisted not the slightest thing you can think of you wish to insult me perhaps her voice was quiet im sorry i changed my approach may i ask if you were in love with him i take it dr macdonald didnt send you here she said calmly you must have learnt of me through my letters you know the answer to your question was he in love with you i know he was at least he asked me to marry him ten times at least that should show no but you didnt marry i said you lost touch with him and if you were both in love and he asked you to marry him may i ask why you refused for you must have refused i refused for the same reason that our friendship ended partly im afraid because in spite of his protestations of love he was an incurable philanderer but mainly because there were profound differences between us and we were neither of us old enough or experienced enough to let our heads rule our hearts differences may i ask what differences madame halle you are persistent arent you does it matter she sighed i suppose it does to you youll just keep on until you get the answer theres no secret about it and its all very unimportant and rather silly id still like to hear it no doubt france you will remember was in a most confused state politically after the war we had parties whose views could not have been more divergent from the extreme right to the very furthest left i am a good catholic and i was of the catholic party of the right she smiled deprecatingly what you could call a trueblue tory well im afraid that dr macdonald disagreed so violently with my political opinions that our friendship eventually became quite impossible those things happen you know when one is young politics become so terribly important dr macdonald didnt share your conservative viewpoint conservative she laughed in genuine amusement conservative you say whether or not alex was a genuine scottish nationalist i cannot say but this much i can say with complete certainty outside the walls of the kremlin there never existed a more implacable and dedicated communist he was formidable one hour and ten minutes later i walked into the lounge of the waggoners rest in alfringham chapter ten id had a phone call put through from stanton airfield and both the general and superintendent hardanger were in the lounge waiting for me although it was still early evening the general had on the table before him the remains of what appeared to have been a pretty considerable whisky id never before known him to have his first drink of the day before nine oclock at night his face was pale set and strained and for the first tune ever he was beginning to look his age nothing i could put my finger on just the slight sag of the shoulders the indefinable air of weariness there was something curiously pathetic about him the pathos of a man with a broad and upright back who had suddenly finally felt the burden of the weight he was carrying to be too much hardanger didnt look a great deal better either i greeted them both collected a whisky from old shirtsleeves who was safely out of hearing range and gladly took the weight off my feet i said wheres mary out visiting stella chessingham and her mother hardanger said more broken wings for her to mend your surly friend behind the bar is just back from driving her there she wanted to give them what sympathy and encouragement she could i agreed with her that they must both be feeling pretty grim after young chessinghams arrest but said i didnt think it either necessary or wise this was before the general came down she wouldnt listen to me you know what your wife is like cavell and your daughter sir shes wasting her time i said on this occasion young chessingham is as innocent as the day he was born i told his mother so at eight oclock this morning i had to shes a sick woman and the shock might have killed her and shed have told her daughter as soon as the van called for chessingham they dont need either sympathy or consolation what hardanger leant far forward in his seat face dark with rising anger his big hand threatening to crush the glass clasped inside it what the devil are you saying cavell innocent damn it all theres enough circumstantial evidence the only evidence against him is the fact that he very understandably told a lie about his driving and that the real murderer has been sending him money under a false name to throw suspicion on him to buy time always to buy time i dont know why it is but it is essential for this murderer to buy time he buys time every time he throws suspicion on everyone else and hes so outstandingly clever that hes managed to throw suspicion on practically everyone he tried to buy time when he kidnapped me this morning the thing is he knew months before the crime money was first paid into chessinghams account at the beginning of july that it was going to be necessary to buy time why why buy time you fooled me damn you hardanger said harshly you trumped up this story i told you the facts as i had them i was in no mood to placate hardanger if id said he was innocent would you have arrested him you know perfectly well you wouldnt but you did and that has bought ms time because the murderer or murderers will read their evening papers and be convinced that were on the wrong track youll be saying next that hartnell and his wife are being framed too he said gratingly as regards the hammer pliers and mud on the scooter of course they are you know that for the rest hartnell and wife are guilty as charged but no courts ever going to convict a mans blackmailed into having his wife shout and wave at a truck damn all criminal about that all hell get is a couple of years on the entirely unrelated charge of embezzlement if the army choose to press the charge which i doubt but again his arrest is buying us time the murderers planting of hammer and pliers were another method of buying them time they dont know we havent bought that one another point in our favour hardanger turned to the general were you aware that cavell was working behind my back sir the general frowned thats pitching it a bit strongly isnt it superintendent as for my being aware damn it all man it was you who talked me into bringing cavell into this very adroit indeed i must admit he works in a highly unorthodox fashion which reminds me cavell dig up anything interesting about macdonald in paris i didnt answer for a moment there was something offhand strangely indifferent in his manner as if his mind was on other and more important things i answered in kind all depends what you call interesting sir i can give you with certainty the name of one of the men behind it all dr alexander macdonald and beyond all doubt hes been a topflight communist espionage agent for the past fifteen years if not more that got them they were the last two men on earth ever to go in for goggling but they went in for it all the same just for a second then they stared at each other then back at me i told them in a minute flat what had happened hardanger said oh dear god very quietly and left to call a police car the general said you saw the police radio van outside i nodded were in constant touch with the government and scotland yard he fished in an inside pocket and brought out two typewritten notes the first of those came in about two hours ago the second only ten minutes ago i looked at them quickly and for the first time in my life realised that the phrase about blood running cold might have some basis in physical experience i felt unaccountably cold icy even and was glad to see hardanger back from ordering ids car bring three more whiskies from the bar i knew now why both the general and hardanger had looked so ill so close to desperation when id come in i knew now and could understand why my trip to paris had been a matter of relative indifference to them the first message had been delivered at almost the same time to reuters and ap and was very brief the florid style was unmistakable it read the walls of the home of the antichrist still stand my orders have been ignored the responsibility is yours i have taped a virus ampoule to a simple explosive device which will be detonated at this afternoon in lower hampton norfolk the wind is wsw if the demolition of mordon has not commenced by midnight tonight i shall be compelled to break another ampoule tomorrow in the heart of the city of london the carnage will be such as the world has never seen yours is the choice lower hampton is a hamlet of about people four miles from the sea the general said the reference to the wind means that the virus would cover only four miles of land and then be blown out over the sea unless the wind changed the message was received at this afternoon nearest police cars were rushed to the area and all people in the village and as many as could be reached in the area between the village and the sea were evacuated to the west he broke off and stared at the table but thats rich farming land there are many farms and few cars it was not possible to reach them all in time im afraid a hurried search was made in lower hampton for the bomb but it was worse than the needle in the haystack at precisely a sergeant and two constables heard a small explosion and saw fire and smoke coming from the thatch of a disused cottage they ran for their car and you can just imagine how they took off my mouth felt as dry as ashes i washed some of the ashes away by draining half a large whisky in one gulp the general went on at an raf bomber a photoreconnaissance plane took off from a base hi east anglia and flew over the area the pilot was warned not to fly below feet but its a clear evening up there and with the kind of cameras they have in the air force today there was no trouble in making a close reconnaissance the entire area was photographed from two miles up it doesnt take long to photograph a few square miles of territory and the bomber landed half an hour after take off the pictures were developed within minutes and examined by an expert that second paper shows his findings it was even briefer than the first it read over a wedgeshaped area with its point at the village of little hampton and its base two and a half miles of seacoast there are no discoverable signs of life either around houses and farm buildings or in the fields dead cattle in fields estimated between three and four hundred three flocks of sheep also apparently lifeless at least seven human bodies identified characteristic postures of both men and cattle suggest death in contorted agony detailed analysis following i finished the second half of my whisky in a second gulp i might as well have been drinking soda pop for all the taste or the effect it had i said whats the government going to do i dont know the general said tonelessly neither do they they will make a decision by ten oclock tonight and now theyll decide even faster when they hear your news it completely alters everything we thought we were dealing with some raving crackpot however brilliant that crackpot it seems instead that were dealing with a communist plot to destroy the most powerful weapon that britain or any other country for that matter has ever had maybe its the beginnings of a plot to destroy britain itself i dont know damn it all ive just come to the thought and i havent had time to think about it could it be that the communist world is planning a showdown with the west that theyre convinced that they can strike so hard and so savagely that therell be no possibility of retaliation not that is once mordon and its viruses are out of the way god only knows i think id rather be dealing with a crackpot any day besides cavell we dont know that your information is correct theres only one way to find out sir i rose to my feet i see the police driver is there shall we have a chat with macdonald we reached mordon in eight minutes flat only to be told at the gate that macdonald had checked out over two hours previously eight minutes later we pulled up at the front door of his home dr macdonalds house was dark and deserted mrs turpin the housekeeper should not have been gone for the night but she was macdonald had also gone not for the night but for ever our bird had flown macdonald hadnt even bothered to lock the door when leaving hed have been in too much of a hurry for that we made our way into the hallway switched on lights and looked quickly over the ground floor no fires no still warm radiators no smell of cooking no cigarette smoke still hanging in the air whoever had left hadnt left by a back window as we had come in by the front door hed left a long long time ago i felt old and sick and tired and foolish because i knew now why hed left in such a hurry we went over the house not wasting time starting from the attic darkroom the battery of expensive photographic equipment was as i had seen it before but this time i was seeing it in a new light given sufficient facts and sufficient time even cavell could arrive at a conclusion we went over his bedroom but there were no signs of hasty packing or hasty departure that was strange people going on a journey from which they have no intention of returning usually take a bare minimum of supplies to tide them over no matter what their hurry an inspection of the bathroom was equally puzzling razor brush shaving cream toothbrush they were all still there macdonalds old colonel i thought inconsequentially wasnt going to be any too happy when he arrived to identify macdonald and found no one left to identify even more baffling was the kitchen mrs turpin i knew used to leave every night at sixthirty when macdonald arrived home leaving his dinner prepared macdonald had been in the habit of helping himself and leaving the dishes for his housekeeper the following morning but there were no signs whatsoever of any food preparations no roasts in the oven no pots of still warm food an electric stove so cold that it couldnt have been used for hours i said the last of the plainclothes men on the search job would have been gone by half past three at the latest no reason why mrs turpin shouldnt have got on with the cooking of dinner for dr macdonald and macdonald strikes me as a character who would be very huffed indeed if he didnt find his chow ready but she prepared none why she knew he wouldnt be wanting any hardanger said heavily from something she heard or saw this afternoon she knew our worthy doctor wouldnt be wanting to linger too much around these parts after shed told him what shed heard or seen which argues connivance at or at least knowledge of macdonalds activities its my fault i said savagely that damn woman she must have heard me telephoning the general about going to paris god only knows how long she was standing there in the doorway watching me seeing the letter in my hand but i didnt see her because she was on my blind side she must have noticed that and the limp and told macdonald by phone and what i was talking about hed have known straight away that it must have been me limp or no limp its all my bloody fault i repeated it never crossed my mind to suspect her i think we should have a talk with mrs turpin if shes at home that is hardanger moved off to a phone while the general accompanied me into macdonalds study i moved over to the big oldfashioned kneehole desk where macdonalds correspondence and photographic albums had been discovered it was locked i said to the general back in a minute sir and went outside there was nothing in the garage that would be of any use to me backing on the garage was a large toolshed i switched on the torch and looked round garden implements a small pile of grey breezeblocks a pile of empty cement sacks a workbench and bicycle no clawhammer which was what i was looking for but i found the next best thing a fairly heavy hatchet i went back to the study with this and crossed to the desk just as hardanger came into the room you going to smash that desk open he demanded let macdonald object if he feels like it i swung the axe twice and the drawer splintered the albums and the doctors correspondence with the world health organisation were still here i opened the album at the page with the missing photograph and showed it to the general a photograph our good friend didnt seem to care to have around i said i have more than a vague obscure feeling that it may be important see that scratched out caption something about six letters some town certainly starting with to i cant get it with any other kind of paper or with two different kinds of ink it would have been easy for the lab boys but white ink on white ink on this porous blotting paper stuff no good not a chance hardanger gave me a suspicious look why is it important if i knew that i wouldnt worry about what the caption was did you find our dear mrs turpin at home no reply she lives alone a widow as i found out from the local station after id called her number an officer has gone to check but hell find nothing ive put out an allstations call for her thatll help i said sourly i went quickly through macdonalds correspondence picking up replies from his who correspondents in europe i knew what i was looking for and it took me only two minutes to isolate half a dozen letters from a dr john weissmann in vienna i handed them across to the general and hardanger exhibit a for the old bailey when macdonalds en route to the gallows the general looked at me his face old and tired and expressionless hardanger said bluntly what are you talking about cavell i hesitated and looked at the general he said quietly itll be all right now my boy hardanger will understand and itll never go any further hardanger looked from me to the papers and then back to me again what will i understand its time i understood i knew from the beginning that there was something i couldnt touch in this damned business you accepted this job with too much alacrity in the first place im sorry i said it had to be this way you know ive been in and out of a few jobs since the war army police special branch narcotics special branch again security chief in mordon and then private detective none of it really meant anything ive been working for the general here nonstop for the past sixteen years every time i was heaved out of a job well the general arranged it im not all that surprised hardanger said heavily i was glad to see he was more intrigued than angry ive had my suspicions thats why youre a superintendent the general murmured anyway about a year ago my predecessor in security in mordon easton deny began having his suspicions i wont go into the where and the when of it but he came to the conclusion that certain highly secret items in the bacteriological and virus line were being smuggled out of mordon his suspicions became certainties when dr baxter approached him privately and said he was convinced that certain stuff was going astray dr baxter hardanger looked slightly stunned yes baxter sorry about that too but i told you plain as i could not to waste time on him he said to deny that although it wasnt the top secret stuff that was going that was impossible to get out of a laboratory it was nevertheless pretty important stuff very important stuff indeed britain leads the world in the production of microbiological diseases for wartime use against men animals and plants youll never hear of this when the parliamentary estimates for mordon health centre are being passed but our scientists in mordon have either discovered or refined to the purest and most deadly forms the germs for causing plague typhus smallpox rabbit and urdulant fever in man hog cholera fowl pest newcastle disease rinderpest footandmouth glanders and anthrax in livestock and blights like the japanese beetle european corn borer mediterranean fruit fly bollweevil citrus cancer wheat rust and heaven knows what else in plants all very useful in either limited or allout warfare whats all this got to do with dr macdonald hardanger demanded im coming to it over two years ago our agents in poland began taking an interest in the newlybuilt lenin museum on the outskirts of warsaw so far this museum has never been opened to the public it never will be its the equivalent of mordon a purely microbiological research station one of our agents hes a cardcarrying member of the party managed to get himself employed there and made the interesting discovery that the poles were discovering and refining the various bugs i just mentioned a few weeks or at most months after they had been perfected in mordon the inference was too obvious to miss easton deny started investigating he made two mistakes he played it too close to the cuff without letting us know what was going on and he unwittingly gave himself away how weve no idea he may even have taken into his confidence quite unknowingly the man who was responsible for smuggling the stuff out of mordon macdonald for a certainty it would be too much to expect two espionage agents operating at the same time anyway someone became aware that easton derry was in danger of finding out too much so derry disappeared the general here then made arrangements to have me removed from the special branch and introduced into mordon as security officer the first thing i did was to stake out a decoy duck i had a steel flask of botulinus toxin strength one it was so labelled introduced into a cupboard in number one lab annexe the same day the flask disappeared we had a vmf receiver installed at the gates for the flask contained not toxin but a microwave batterypowered transistor sender anyone carrying that and coming within two hundred yards of the gate would have been picked up at once you will understand i said dryly that anyone picking up a flask of botulinus toxin is unlikely to open it up to see if it really does contain toxin we picked up no one it wasnt hard to guess what happened after dark someone had strolled across to a deserted part of the boundary fence and chucked the flask into an adjacent field its only a tenyard throw to clear all the fences not because they had any suspicions of the contents but because this was the way it would usually be done you know how often spot checks and searches are made of people leaving mordon by eight oclock that evening we had microwave receivers installed at london airport southend and lydd airfields the channel ports and wouldnt the shock of having been flung over the fence have smashed the transmitter hardanger objected the american watch company that makes these transmitters would be most displeased if one did break i said they can be fired from a high velocity naval gun without being affected in the slightest anyway late that night we picked up a signal in london airport almost inevitably it was from a man boarding a bea flight to warsaw we took him and he told us he was a courier picking up stuff about once a fortnight from an address in south london hed never actually seen his contact he told you that hardanger said sourly i can imagine how you made him volunteer that information youd be wrong we told him he was a naturalised british subject exczech that espionage was a capital offence and he thought he was turning queens evidence he turned it pretty fast too it was his supplier from mordon we wanted to nail so i was duly thrown out of there and have been haunting this damn address and neighbourhood for the past three weeks we couldnt get anyone else to do the job because i was the only one who knew and who could identify all the scientists and technicians in mordon but no luck except that dr baxter reported that the disappearances had stopped so we seemed to have stopped that leak temporarily anyway but according to baxter and our polish informant that wasnt the only leak we had learnt that the lenin museum had developed viruses that had not been stolen from mordon but which had been produced in mordon someone obviously was sending them information on the breeding and development of those strains and now weve found that out too i tapped the papers macdonalds correspondence with his who contact in vienna not a new system but almost impossible to detect microphotography all that expensive photographic equipment upstairs the general murmured exactly theres a camera expert due from london to look at his stuff but his journeys hardly necessary now look at those letters from dr weissmann in every one you will note that the dot from an i or a full stop is missing in the first paragraph weissmann typed a message reduced it to the size of a dot by microminiature photography and stuck it on the letter in place of some other dot all macdonald had to do was to pry it loose and enlarge it and he of course did the same in his correspondence with weissmann and he didnt do it for pennies either i glanced around the richly furnished home hes earned a fortune over the years and not a penny tax either there was a minutes silence then the general nodded that must be the right of it at least macdonald wont be troubling us any more he looked up at me and smiled without humour when it comes to locking stable doors after the horse has taken off we have few equals theres also another door i can lock for you supposing its any use to you the caption thats been scratched out in this album toulon tournai neither he turned to the back board of the album this had been prepared for certain members of the who by a firm called gucci zanolette via xx settembre genoa the word that has been scratched out is torino the italian of course for turin turin only a word but he might as well have hit me with a sledgehammer it had about the same effect turin i sat in a chair because all of a sudden i felt i had to sit and after the first dazed shock started to wear off i managed to whip a few of the less lethargic brain cells out of their coma and started thinking again it wasnt much in the way of thinking not as thinking went for with the beating and the soaking i had received the lack of sleep and food i was a fair way below my best insofar as anything resembling active cerebration was concerned slowly laboriously i assembled a few facts in the befogged recesses of my mind and no matter how i reassembled them those facts formed the same mosaic every time two and two always came out to four i rose heavily to my feet and said to the general its like the man says sir you speak more truly than you know are you all right cavell there was sharp anxiety in the voice im falling to pieces my mind such as it is is still on its hinges or i think so well soon find out torch in hand i turned and left the room the general and hardanger hesitated then followed i suppose they were exchanging all sorts of apprehensive glances but i was past caring id already been in the garage and shed so those werent the places to look somewhere in the shrubbery i thought drearily and it was still raining in the hall i turned off into the kitchen and was about to make for the back door when i saw a flight of steps leading down to the cellar i remembered vaguely that sergeant carlisle had made mention of this when he and his men had been searching the house that afternoon went down the flight of steps opened the cellar door and switched on the overhead light i stood aside to let the general and hardanger into the cellar its as you said sir i murmured to the general macdonald wont be troubling us any more which was not quite accurate macdonald was going to give some trouble yet to the police doctor the undertaker and the man who would have to cut the rope by which he was suspended by the neck from the heavy iron ring in the overhead loading hatch as he dangled there feet just clear of the floor and brushing the legs of an overturned chair he was the stuff that screaming nightmares are made of eyes staring wide in the frenzied agony of death bluishpurple face swollen tongue protruding between blackened lips drawn far back in the snarling rictus of dissolution no not the stuff that dreams are made of my good god the generals voice was a hushed whisper macdonald he gazed at the dangling figure then said slowly he must have known his time was running out i shook my head someone else decided for him that his time had run out someone else hardanger examined the dead man closely his face giving nothing away his hands are free his feet are free he was conscious when he started to strangle that chair was brought down from the kitchen and yet you say he was murdered look at the streaks and marks in that coal dust a few feet from the chair and that disturbed pile of coal with lumps kicked all over the cellar floor look at the weals and the blood on the inside of the thumbs he could have changed his mind at the last minute hardanger rumbled lots of them do as soon as he started choking he probably grabbed the rope above his head and took the weight until he couldnt hang on any more that would account for the marks on his thumbs the marks on his thumbs were caused by twine or wire binding them together i said he was marched down here almost certainly at gunpoint and made to liedown on the floor he may have been blindfolded i dont know probably whoever killed him passed a rope through the ring and had the loop round macdonalds neck and had started hauling before macdonald could do anything about it thats what caused all that mess in the coal dust macdonald trying to scrabble madly to his feet as the pressure tightened round his neck with his thumbs bound behind his back he made it with the assistance of his executioner but it wouldnt have been easy it only postponed death by seconds the man on the end of the rope just kept on hauling cant you see macdonald almost tearing his thumbs off in an effort to free them by and by he would be on tiptoe but a man cant stand on tiptoe for ever when he was dead our pal on the heaving end got a chair and used it to help him lift macdonald clear off the floor macdonald was a big heavy man when hed secured him there he cut the twine on macdonalds thumbs and kicked over the chair to make it look like suicide its our old buytimeatanyprice friend if he could make us think that macdonald did himself in because he thought the net was closing round him then he hoped that we would believe that macdonald was the kingpin in this business but he wasnt sure youre guessing hardanger said no can you see a neversaydie character like macdonald not only a highly decorated officer who fought in a tank regiment for six years but also a nerveless espionage agent for many years after that committing suicide when things started closing in on him macdonald thinking of giving up or giving in he wouldnt have known how to go about it most probably macdonald was well and truly murdered which he no doubt richly deserved to be anyway but the real point is that he wasnt murdered only so that our friend could cast more red herrings around and so buy more time he had to die and our friend thought he might as well make it look like suicide while he was about it in the hope of stalling us further i was guessing hardanger but not any more macdonald had to die hardanger studied me through a long considering silence then said abruptly you seem fairly sure about all this im certain i know i picked up the coal shovel and started heaving away some of the coal that was piled up against the back wall of the cellar there must have been close on a couple of tons of the stuff reaching almost as high as the ceiling and i was in no condition for anything much more strenuous than brushing my teeth but i had to shift only a fraction of it for every shovelful i scooped away from the base almost a hundredweight of lumps came clattering down on to the floor what do you expect to find under that lot hardanger said with heavy sarcasm another body another body is exactly what i do expect to find i expect to find the late mrs turpin the fact that she tipped off macdonald about me and didnt bother preparing dinner because she knew macdonald wouldnt be staying for dinner owing to the fact that he would be taking off for the high timber shows beyond all doubt that she was in cahoots with our pal here what macdonald knew she knew it would have been pointless to silence macdonald if mrs turpin had been left alive to squawk so she was attended to but wherever she had been attended to it hadnt been in the cellar we went upstairs and while the general went to talk for quite a long time on the scrambler radiophone in the police van that had followed us from alfringham hardanger and i with the assistance of two police drivers and a couple of torches started to scour the grounds it was no easy job for the good doctor who had done so well for himself in the way of furnishing his house had also done himself pretty well in the way of buying himself privacy for his policies half garden half parkland extended to over four acres the whole of it surrounded by an enormous beech hedge that would have stopped a tank it was dark and very cold with no wind the heavy rain falling vertically through the thinning leaves of the dripping trees to the sodden earth beneath the appropriate setting i thought grimly for a search for a murdered body and theres an awful lot of searching in four acres on a black and miserable night the beech hedge had been trimmed some time during the past month and the clipping piled up in a distant corner of the garden we found mrs turpin under this pile not very deep down just enough branches and twigs over her to hide her from sight lying beside her was the hammer i had failed to find in the toolshed and it required only a glance at the back of her head to know the reason why the hammer was there at a guess i would have said that the person who had tried to stove in my ribs had also wielded the hammer on mrs turpin my ribs like the dead womans head bore witness to the insensate and unreasoning ferocity of a broken and vicious mind back in the house i broached macdonalds whisky supplies he wouldnt be wanting it any more and as hed carefully pointed out to me that he had no relations and therefore no one to leave it to it seemed a pity to waste it we needed it badly i poured out hefty tots one apiece for hardanger and myself the other two for the police drivers and if hardanger took a dim view of this theft of property and contravention of standing orders by offering intoxicating liquor to policemen on duty he kept it to himself he finished his whisky before any of us the two policemen left just as the general returned from the radio van he seemed to have aged a year for every minute since last id seen him the lines about the nose and mouth more deeply trenched than ever you found her he took the offered glass we found her hardanger acknowledged dead as cavell said she would be murdered it hardly matters the general shivered suddenly and took a deep gulp of his whisky shes only one this time tomorrow how many thousands god knows how many thousands this madman has sent another message usual biblical language walls of mordon still standing no signs of demolition so has advanced his timetable if demolition doesnt start on mordon by midnight hes going to break a botulinus toxin ampoule in the heart of london at four oclock this morning within a quarter of a mile of new oxford street this seemed to call for some more whisky hardanger said hes no madman sir no the general rubbed his forehead wearily i told them what cavell found out what we think theyre in a complete panic now do you know that some national dailies are already on the streets just before six oclock unprecedented but so is the situation the papers seem to be very accurately reflecting the terror of the people and are begging or demanding that the government yield to this madman for at the time of printing everyone thought it was just a crazed crackpot word of the wiping out of this segment of east anglia is just beginning to come through on constant radio and tv news broadcasts and everyone is terrified out of their wits whoever is behind all this is a brilliant devil a few hours and he has the nation on its knees its the mans frightening speed of operation the lack of timelag between threat and carrying out of threat thats so terrifying especially with every paper and news broadcast plugging the theme that this madman doesnt know the difference between the botulinus toxin and the satan bug and that it may very well be the satan bug he uses next time in fact i said all those who have been moaning and complaining so bitterly that life is hardly worth the living in the shadow of a nuclear holocaust have suddenly discovered that it might very well be worth living after all you think the government will give in i cant say the general admitted im afraid i rather misjudged the premier i thought he was as windy as they come i dont know now hes toughened his attitude amazingly maybe hes ashamed of his earlier panicstricken reaction maybe he sees the chance to make his imperishable mark on history maybe hes like us i said maybe hes been drinking whisky too maybe hes at present consulting with the cabinet he says that if this is a communist scheme hell be damned if he gives in if the communists are behind it he says the last thing in the world we can afford to do is to give in for though not yielding to their demands that mordon be demolished may bring death to many yielding to their demands will bring eventual death to all myself i think that attitude is the only one and i agree with him when he says hes ready to evacuate the city of london before he gives in evacuate london hardanger said in disbelief ten million people in ten hours fantastic the mans mad impossible its not quite as drastic as all that thank heaven its a windless evening the met office forecasts a windless night and its raining heavily it seems that an airborne virus is carried down to earth by heavy rain having a much greater affinity for water than for air the experts doubt whether in windless rainy conditions the virus will get more than a few hundred yards from its point of release if the need arises they propose to evacuate the area between euston road and the thames from portland street and regent street in the west to grays inn road in the east thats feasible enough hardanger admitted place is practically deserted by night anyway mainly a business office and shop area but this virus itll be carried away by the rain itll pollute the thames it may get into the drinking water whats to happen are people to be told to refrain from washing or drinking until the twelve hour oxidisation period is up thats what they say unless the water has been stored and covered beforehand that is my god whats going to come of it all ive never felt so damned helpless in my life we dont seem to have a single solitary lead into this business if only we had a suspicion the slightest pointing finger as to whom was behind all this well by heaven if we could get to him id turn my back and let cavell here get to work on him i drained my glass and put it down you mean that sir what do you think he glanced up from his glass then stared at me with his tired grey eyes what do you mean cavell can you point a finger i can do better than that sir i know i know who it is the general was a great disappointment as far as reaction went he always was no gasps no wideeyed stares no emotional pyrotechnics he murmured half of my kingdom pierre who the last proof i said the last proof and then i can say we missed it and it was staring us in the face at least it was staring me in the face and hardanger to think the country depends on people like us to safeguard them policemen detectives we couldnt detect the holes in gruyere cheese i turned to hardanger weve just made a pretty thorough search of the garden agreed agreed so hardly missed a square foot i persisted go on he rumbled impatiently did you see any signs of freshlybuilt masonary huts sheds walls fishponds decorative stonework anything he shook his head his eyes wary i was going off my rocker nothing there was nothing of the kind then what happened to all the cement in the empty cement bags in the toolshed the ones we saw when we found the tarpaulin there it didnt vanish and the few breezeblocks we saw probably only the remainder of a fair stack of them if outdoor masonry work wasnt a hobby of macdonalds then what would be the most likely place to find such masonry work in a diningroom in a bedroom suppose you tell me cavell do better than that ill show you i left them went out to the toolshed and hunted around for a crowbar or pick i could find neither the nearest was a small sledge it would have to do i picked it up along with a bucket went into the kitchen where the general and hardanger were waiting for me filled the bucket at the kitchen sink and led the way down the stairs to the cellar hardanger apparently oblivious of the presence of the dead man dangling from the ceiling said heavily what do you propose to demonstrate cavell how to make coal briquettes the telephone rang in the hallway upstairs automatically we all looked at each other dr macdonalds incoming calls might be very interesting hardanger said answer it and left we heard his voice on the phone and then my name being called i started up the stairs conscious of the general following me hardanger handed me the phone for you wont give his name wants to speak to you personally i took the receiver cavell speaking so you are on the loose and the little lady wasnt lying the words came over the wire like a deep dark and throaty whisper lay off cavell tell the general to lay off cavell if you want to see the little lady alive again these new synthetic resins are pretty tough so the receiver didnt crush in my palm it must have been pretty close though my heart did a long slow somersault and landed on its back with a thud i kept my voice steady and said what the hell are you talking about the beautiful mrs cavell i have her she would like to speak to you a moments silence then her voice came pierre oh my dear im so sorry her voice broke off abruptly in a gasp followed by a scream of agony silence again the dark whisper lay off cavell and then the click of a replaced receiver i replaced mine the receiver making a sharp staccato rattle against the rest my hand was the hand of a man with the ague shock or fear or both may have frozen my face into an expression of normalcy or maybe the makeup on my face didnt transmit expression too well whichever it was they didnt notice anything amiss for the general said who was it in a normal curious tone i dont know i paused and went on mechanically theyve got mary the general had had his hand on the door now he dropped it to his side in a ridiculously slowmotion gesture that took almost ten seconds while something in his face died hardanger whispered something something unprintable his face was like a stone neither of them asked me to repeat what i had said neither was in the slightest doubt as to what i had meant they told us to lay off i went on in the same wooden voice or theyd kill her they have her all right she spoke a few words and then screamed they must have hurt her badly hardanger said almost desperately how could he have known that you had escaped or even suspected how dr macdonald is how i said he knew mrs turpin told him and the killer learnt from macdonald i stared almost unseeingly at the generals face a face still impassive but with all the life and animation gone from it i went on im sorry if anything happens to mary it will be my fault my own criminal folly and negligence the general said what are we going to do my boy the voice was tired and listless to match the dullness that had replaced the soldierly fire in his eye you know they are going to kill your wife people like that always kill were wasting time i said harshly two minutes thats all i need to make sure i ran down to the cellar picked up the bucket and tossed half its contents against the opposite wall the water spread and ran down quickly to the floor as a cleaning agent it was a dead failure making hardly any impression whatsoever on the ingrained coal dust of a score or more of years with the general and hardanger still watching uncomprehendingly i threw the remainder of the buckets contents against the rear wall where the coal had been piled so high before my recent excavation the water splashed off and ran down into the coal leaving the wall almost as clear and clean and fresh as if it had been built only a few weeks previously hardanger glared at it then at me then back at the wall again my apologies cavell he said that would be why the coal was piled so high against the wall to conceal the traces of recent work i didnt waste time speaking time was now the one commodity wed run clear out of instead i picked up the sledgehammer and swung at the upper line of breeze work the lower portion was solid concrete one swing only i felt as if someone had slid a sixinch stiletto between my right ribs maybe the doctor had been right maybe my ribs werent as securely anchored as nature had intended without a word i handed the sledge to hardanger and sat down wearily on the upturned bucket hardanger weighed sixteen stone and in spite of the calm impassivity of his features he was just clear mad all the way through with all the power and vicious determination that was in him he attacked that wall of breeze as if it were the archetype of all things evil on earth the wall hadnt a chance on the third stroke the first block of breeze was splintered and dislodged and within thirty seconds he had hammered in a hole about two feet square he stopped looked at me and i rose to my feet like the old old man i felt i was and switched on my torch together we peered into the peephole between the false wall and the real cellar wall behind there was a gap of under two feet and jammed at the bottom of this narrow space and halfcovered with broken masonry chips and dust from the fractured breezeblocks lay the remains of what had once been a man broken twisted savagely mutilated but still undoubtedly the remains of a man hardanger said in a voice ominously calm and steady do you know who this is cavell i know him easton derry my predecessor as security chief in mordon easton derry the general was as unnaturally controlled as hardanger how can you tell his face is unrecognisable yes that ring on his left hand has a blue cairngorm stone easton derry always wore a ring with a blue cairngorm thats easton derry what what did this to him the general stared down at the halfnaked body a road crash some some wild animal for a long minute he stared down in silence at the dead man then straightened and turned to me the age and weariness in his face more accentuated than ever but the old eyes bleak and icy and still a man did this to him he was tortured to death he was tortured to death i said and you know who did it hardanger reminded me i know who did it hardanger pulled a warrant form and pen from an inside pocket and stood waiting i said you wont need that superintendent not if i get to him first in case i dont make it out in the name of dr giovanni gregori the real dr gregori is dead chapter eleven eight minutes later the big police jaguar braked hard to a stop outside chessinghams house and for the third time in just under twentyfour hours i climbed the worn steps over the driedout moat and pressed the bell the general was close behind me hardanger was in the radio van alerting the police of a dozen counties to be on the lookout for gregori and his fiat to identify follow but not for the present apprehend gregori we felt wouldnt kill until desperate and we owed mary at least that slender hope of life mr cavell the welcome stella chessingham gave me bore no resemblance to the one i had received from her at dawn that morning the light was back in her eyes the anxiety vanished from her face how nice i im so sorry about this morning mr cavell i mean it is true what my mother told me after theyd taken him away its perfectly true miss chessingham i tried to smile but with the way i felt and with my face still aching from the hasty scrubbing away of the now useless disguise before leaving macdonalds house i was glad i couldnt see what sort of attempt id made at it as far as our respective positions were concerned compared to twelve hours ago the boot was on the other foot now and with a vengeance i am sincerely sorry but it was at the time necessary your brother will be released tonight you saw my wife this afternoon of course it was so sweet of her to come to see us wont you and your um friend come in to see mother shed be delighted im sure i shook my head what time did my wife leave here about fivethirty i should say it was beginning to get dark and has something happened to her she ended in a whisper shes been kidnapped by the murderer and held as hostage oh no oh no mr cavell no her hand clutched her throat it its not possible how did she leave here kidnapped your wife kidnapped she stared at me roundeyed in fear why should anyone want for gods sake answer my question i said savagely had she hired a car taxi bus service what was it a car she whispered a car came to pick her up the man said you wanted to see her urgently her voice trailed away as she realised the implications of what she was saying what man i demanded what car a a middleaged man she faltered swarthy in a blue car with another man in the back seat i dont know what kind except that of course it was a foreign car a car with lefthand drive has she oregon and his fiat the general whispered but how in gods name did he know that mary was out here simply by lifting the telephone i said bitterly he knew we were staying at the waggoners rest he asked for mary and asked if she was there and that fat fool behind the bar said why no mrs cavell wasnt there he himself had just driven her out to mr chessinghams house less than a couple of hours ago it would be on oregons way so he stopped by to see hed everything to gain nothing to lose we didnt even tell stella chessingham goodbye we ran down the steps intercepted hardanger changing over from the radio van to the police jaguar and almost bundled him into the car alfringham i said quickly the fiat he took it after all i didnt think he would take the chance he didnt hardanger ground out had a report just now he ditched it in the village of grayling not three miles from here in a side street and not twenty yards from the local constables cottage the constable was just listening to our radio broadcast lifted his eyes and there it was empty of course empty he wouldnt have ditched it unless hed another lined up an allstation alert is out for stolen cars it would be stolen in grayling hardly more than a hamlet i understand well soon find out we soon found out and it was ourselves that did the finding just two minutes later running into grayling we saw a character doing a sort of war dance on the pavement and flagging us down with a furiously waving briefcase of sorts held in his right hand the jaguar stopped and hardanger wound down his window its monstrous the man with the briefcase shouted thank god youre here an outrage a damnable outrage in broad daylight whats the matter hardanger cut in my car in broad daylight stolen by god i was just paying a call in this house and how long were you in there eh how long what the hell answer me hardanger roared forty minutes but what what kind of car a vanden plas princess litre he was almost sobbing with rage brand new i tell you turquoise three weeks old dont worry hardanger said curtly the police jaguar was already in motion well get it back for you he wound up the window leaving the man standing behind us openmouthed and spoke to the sergeant in front alfringham then the london road cancel the call for the fiat its now a turquoise vanden plas princess litre all stations locate follow but dont close in bluegreen the general murmured bluegreen not turquoise its policemen youre talking to not their wives half of them would think you were talking about their christmas dinner it all started with macdonald i said the big police car was hissing along the wet tarmac the pine trees lining the road cartwheeling back into the pitch darkness behind and it seemed easier to talk than to sit there going quietly crazy with worry besides the general and hardanger had been patient long enough we all know what macdonald wanted and it wasnt just to serve the cause of the communist world dr macdonald had only one deeplyfelt and abiding interest in life dr macdonald no question but that he was a genuine dyedinthewool fellowtraveller at one time madame halle did not strike me as a person who would make a mistake over anything and i dont see how he could otherwise have formed his contacts with the communist world he must have earned a great deal of money over the years youd only to look at the contents of his house but he spent it fairly judiciously and wisely not splashing it around too much at a time the bentley continental he had hardanger said wouldnt you call that splashing it around a bit hed that expense well covered with a watertight explanation but i acknowledged he got greedy he was getting in so much money during the past few months that it was burning a hole in his pockets working overtime sending samples to warsaw and information to vienna the general asked no i said blackmailing gregori sorry the general stirred wearily in his corner seat im not with you its not difficult i said gregori the man we know as gregori had two things a beautiful plan and a stroke of very bad luck you will remember that there was nothing sub rosa about gregoris arrival in this country it sparked off a minor international crisis the italians being hopping mad that one of their topnotch biochemists should turn his back on his own country and go to work in britain somebody somebody with more than a smattering of chemistry and a fairly close resemblance to gregori read all about it and saw in oregons impending departure for britain the opportunity of a lifetime and made his preparation accordingly the real gregori was murdered hardanger asked no question of that the gregori who set off from turin with all his worldly wealth stacked in the back of his fiat was not the gregori who arrived in britain the original gregori met with a very permanent accident en route and the impostor no doubt with a few judicious alterations to his features to make his resemblance to the now dead man even closer arrived in britain in gregoris car complete with clothes passport photographs the lot so far so very good now the bad luck apart from the reports of his work the original gregori was completely unknown in britain as a person that is there was probably only one man in britain who knew him well and by a one in a million chance gregori found himself working in the very same laboratory as this man macdonald gregori didnt know that but macdonald did and knew that gregori was a fake dont forget that macdonald had for many years been a delegate to the who and wager anything you like that the original gregori held a similar position for italy which accounts for the missing photographs in the album the general said slowly the two of them macdonald and the original gregori standing arm in arm no doubt in turin anyway probably after weighing up the situation for a day or two macdonald told the spurious gregori that he was on to him we can guess what happened gregori would have produced a gun and said that it was just too bad but that he would have to silence him and macdonald nobodys fool would have produced a piece of paper and said that that would be just too bad because if he died suddenly his bank or the police had orders to open immediately a sealed envelope containing a copy of that paper which would contain a few interesting facts about gregori gregori would then have to put his gun away and they would have made a deal a oneway deal gregori to pay macdonald so much per month or else dont forget macdonald was now in a position to pin a murder rap on gregori i dont get it hardanger said flatly it doesnt make sense can you imagine the general here having two men working for him on the same project in say warsaw men who were not only unknown to each other but completely at cross purposes and potentially at each others throats im afraid cavell that i have a higher opinion of communist intelligence than you seem to have i agree with hardanger the general said so do i i agreed all i said was that macdonald was working for the communists i never once said that gregori was or that this satan bug has anything to do with communism it was you and hardanger who made that assumption hardanger bent forward to see me better you mean you mean that gregori is just a raving crackpot after all if you still believe that i said nastily its time you had a long holiday there was a very powerful and pressing reason why gregori wanted the viruses and stake my life that he told macdonald what it was he would have had to ensure his cooperation if hed told macdonald that he just wanted to take off with the botulinus i doubt if macdonald would have touched the business but if hed offered him say ј macdonald would have changed his mind pretty fast that being the kind of man macdonald was we were fairly into alfringham now the big police jaguar with its siren switched on doing twice the legal speed limit dodging in and out among the thinning evening traffic the driver was an expert the pick of hardangers own london men and he knew exactly how much he and the car could do without killing the lot of us in the process stop the cart hardanger interrupted me suddenly that traffic policeman we were closing rapidly on alfringhams one and only set of traffic lights apparently handcontrolled at what passed for alfringhams rush hour a policeman white cape glistening in the lamplit rain was still standing by a control box attached to a lamppost the car stopped and hardanger window wound down beckoned the man across superintendent hardanger london he said abruptly did you see a bluishgreen vanden plas princess pass this way this evening an hour ago slightly less as a matter of fact i did sir he was coming at a fair lick on the amber and i saw he would be on the intersection when it was red i blew my whistle and he stopped just after hed passed the second lights i asked the driver what he thought he was up to and he said his back wheels had locked on the wet road when he tried to brake and when he took his foot off he was frightened to brake again or brake hard because his daughter was asleep in the back seat and might have been injured if hed stopped too suddenly and shed been flung forward i looked in the back seat and she way asleep sound asleep even our voices didnt waken her there was another man beside her so so i gave him a warning and waved him on his voice trailed away uncertainly exactly hardanger roared now youre realising cant you tell the difference between someone sleeping and someone being forced to fake sleep with a gun in her side she slept on forsooth he said fiercely you miserable nincompoop ill have you drummed out of the force yes sir the policeman eyes staring unseeingly over the roof of the jaguar stood at rigid attention a dead ringer for a guardsman on parade about to collapse with the thumbs still at the seams of the trousers im sorry sir which way did he go hardanger demanded london sir the policeman said woodenly it would be too much to expect you to have taken his number i suppose hardanger said with heavy sarcasm xow sir what xow consider yourself reinstated hardanger growled he wound up the window and we were off again the sergeant talking softly into the hand microphone hardanger said bit rough on him i suppose if he had been smart enough to notice anything hed have been twanging his harp by now instead of playing about with his traffic light buttons sorry for the interruption cavell it doesnt matter i said i was glad of the interruption glad of anything that would take my mind off mary mary with a killers gun in her side macdonald i was speaking of macdonald money mad but also a pretty shrewd character very shrewd he must be to have survived so long in the espionage racket he knew the theft of the botulinus im certain oregon never mentioned his intention of taking the satan bug as well would start off an intensive probing into the past life of all the suspects those working in number one lab he may also have suspected that his own espionage activities were liable to start a recheck on all scientists he knew that all the known details of his life were down on his security record card and he was pretty certain that one or more of those details the ones referring to his immediate post war activities wouldnt stand up to rigorous examination he knew the security chief derry held those records he told oregon that there would be no dice no cooperation unless he saw that record first macdonald had no intention of being the fall guy in subsequent police investigations so easton derry or whats left of him lies down in that cellar now the general said quietly yes im only guessing now but theyre pretty safe guesses apart from the records macdonald wanted gregori also wanted something the combination of number one lab door which was known only to derry and dr baxter i think they arranged for macdonald to ask derry to call at his house saying that he had something of importance to tell him derry came and when he passed through macdonalds door he was already as good as dead gregori who would have been waiting hidden gun in hand saw to it that he did die first of all they took the keys from him the keys to the safes in derrys house where the records were kept the security chief had always to carry those keys on his person then they tried to make him tell the combination of number one lab door at least gregori tried i dont see macdonald having any part in this although he must have known or seen what was going on while gregori may not be a crackpot i think he must be some sort of psychopath a man with a streak of sadistic bloodlust a yard wide look what he did to derry to the back of mrs turpins head not to mention my ribs and hanging macdonald alive and defeated his own ends hardanger said heavily he tortured and mutilated derry so savagely that derry died before he could talk it shouldnt be too difficult to find out who this fake gregori is a man with his records and techniques is bound to have a record given his prints and cephalic index interpol in paris will identify him within the hour he leaned forward gave instructions to the sergeant yes i said it wont be hard but its not important now having killed derry before he could talk gregori had to find another way into number one lab first of all they searched his house and i would bet incidentally that they searched his private effects also and came across a photograph showing derry as the best man at a wedding my wedding the general is in the photograph too of course thats why they kidnapped me then mary they knew anyway they unlocked the safe abstracted the dicey page from macdonalds dossier and had a damned good look at the other dossiers while they were there they found out about dr hartnells financial troubles and decided he could be blackmailed into helping them by acting as decoy from the breakout from mordon for having failed to get the lab combination from derry oregon had to devise a new plan to get the viruses breakout hardanger frowned breakin you mean sorry breakout while hardanger sat there in the semidarkness in the back of the car looking at me with an expression i didnt much care for i told him the theory id expounded to the general in the early hours of that morning about how two men had been smuggled into number one lab in crates one disguised as the criminal x the other as baxter both leaving at the normal time and handing in their security tags while the real x stayed there till eleven oclock first killing baxter with the botulinus toxin then clandon with the cyanide butterscotch before breaking out complete with viruses through the wire fence very very interesting hardanger said at the end professional interest and pique were in voice and face he said my god and you spoke of easton derry playing it too close to the cuff i suppose you got a kick out of leading me up the garden path damn you i didnt lead you i said you went by yourself we were on parallel paths anyway i tried to think how but i couldnt the breakthrough came from you not me it was you who had the suspicions about the completeness of macdonalds dossier the car radio crackled suddenly the owner of the vanden plas a doctor making a call had gone to the local police station after we had left him and added the interesting fact that his tank had been almost empty hardanger curtly ordered sergeant and driver to keep their eyes open for the nearest garage then turned to me well go on he was only halfmollified by my last remark and i didnt blame him any for his annoyance theres not much oregon not only found out about hartnells entanglements with tuffnell the moneylender but he also made the discovery that hartnell as mess secretary was embezzling mess funds dont ask me how after that i can tell you hardanger broke in too damn late as usual he added disgustedly macdonald was messpresident in mordon and finding out the financial trouble hartnell was in would have made him suspicious as president of course he would have access to the books and he checked of course of course i was as disgusted as hardanger i knew he was president just too damn obvious i suppose good old cavell anyway after that hartnell was at his mercy and knowing from hartnells dossier that hartnell was bound to come under the microscope he confused things still further by dumping the hammer and pliers used in the breakout in hartnells place smearing some red loam on his moped for good measure if not gregori one of his assistants red herring number one red herring number twoposing as a mysterious uncle george he made payments into chessinghams account weeks in advance of the crime he knew of course that bank accounts would be one of the first subjects of police scrutiny red herrings hardanger said in bitter complaint always those accursed red herrings why to buy time im coming to that and then the two killings in mordon and the theft of the viruses just as you suggested the general said no i shook my head i was wrong on that the general looked at me his face not saying very much but saying a great deal all the same and i continued my idea was that one of the number one lab scientists killed both dr baxter and clandon every single thing pointed unmistakably to that i was wrong i had to be wrong weve checked and rechecked and every single scientist and technician in that lab had an unbreakable alibi for the night of the murder unbreakable because they were true two men were smuggled in all right maybe even three i dont know we do know gregori must have quite an organisation working for him three is possible say three only one of those men left at the usual knockingoff time the one disguised as baxter the other two remained but x didnt he also took off at the normal time and arrived home to establish a nice cosy alibi for himself x of course was almost certainly gregori macdonald was a sleeping partner in this business gregori may or may not have taken the viruses with him probably not in case he was caught in one of the occasional spotchecks anyway he certainly left behind him one botulinus ampoule and one cyanide coated butterscotch you will remember that none of us has been happy at the idea of clandon meekly accepting the butterscotch from a potential suspect in the middle of the night but the botulinus the cyanide why the general demanded they were completely unnecessary not the way oregon saw it he ordered them to tap baxter on the head and break open the virus ampoule as they left once outside the lab one of them probably acted as decoy while clandon who had been watching the corridor from the house came baring across gun in hand while he pointed his gun at one of the men the other appeared from behind and took his gun off him they then forced the cyanide butterscotch into his mouth god alone knows what clandon thought it was he was dead before he could find out the fiends the general murmured the ruthless fiends all done to give the impression that the killer was known to both baxter and clandon and it certainly worked the third major red herring and it put us completely on the wrong track buying time always buying time gregori has a genius for deception he fooled me too about the first phone call that was made to london at ten oclock last night he made it himself red herring number heaven knows what gregori phoned hardanger looked at me hard he had an alibi for the time the call was made you checked personally typing a book or something you cant beat cavell when it comes to hindsight i said sourly the sound of a man typing undoubtedly came from his room hed prerecorded it on tape and switched on the recorder before he left via his groundfloor window there was a peculiar smell in his room and a pile of white ashes in the fireplace when i visited him in his rooms in the early hours of this morning the remains of the tape but why all the red herring hardanger began when the voice of the sergeant in the front seat cut in heres a garage now pull in hardanger ordered make inquiries we pulled off the highway the driver switching on his police siren a noise to waken the dead but it didnt waken up the fillingstation attendant on duty the sergeant up front didnt hesitate he was outside and into the brightly lit office within five seconds of our skidding to a halt he came out almost immediately afterwards and disappeared round the back of the fillingstation and that was enough for me i piled j out of the back seat hardanger at my heels we found the attendant in a garage at the back of the station he had been expertly bound and gagged by someone who had not stopped to consider the price of scotch tape the same someone for good measure had also cracked him over the back of the head with something heavy but the attendant had recovered from that more accurately he had regained consciousness by the time we got to him he was a burly middleaged character and what was probably a normally red face anyway was crimson from rage and his struggles to free himself we cut the tape round wristsand ankles pulled it none too gently off his face and helped him to a sitting position he had some highly homicidal observations to make and even in our desperate urgency we had to allow him that but after a few seconds hardanger cut in sharply right thatll be enough the man who did this is a murderer on the run and were police officers every second you sit and curse increases his chances of escaping tell us about it quick and sharp the attendant shook his head i didnt have to be a doctor to tell that he was still pretty groggy he said a man middleaged swarthylooking character came in here for petrol half past six it was he asked half past six i interrupted only twenty minutes ago are you sure im certain he said flatly hed run out of petrol for his car a mile maybe two back and he must have been hurrying some for he was pretty much out of breath he asked me for a gallon in a can and when i turned to find one he let me have it over the head when i came to i was in the garage in the back and tied as you saw me i didnt let on i was conscious the first thing i saw was another man with a gun pointing at a girl a blonde the other guy the bloke who had crowned me was just backing the bosss car out of the door and make colour and licence number of the car hardanger snapped he got them and went on stay here dont move around thats a nasty crack ill radio the alfringham police and thered be a car out here pretty soon ten seconds later we were on our way leaving the attendant holding his head and staring after us twenty minutes i said half listening to the sergeant speak rapidly and urgently into the telephone theyd have lost time pushing the car off the road to fox us then they had a long walk to the garage twenty minutes theyve had it hardanger said confidently theres a halfdozen police cars patrolling in the next thirty miles or so and they know those roads as only local county policemen do and once one of those cars gets on oregons tail well hell never shake them off tell them to set up roadblocks i said tell them to stop him at all costs are you mad hardanger said shortly are you out of your mind cavell do you want your wife killed damn you you know hell use her as a living shield as it is shes safe gregori hasnt seen a policeman except that fellow on traffic duty since he left macdonalds house hell be halfbelieving now that we have called off the search cant you see that man roadblocks i repeated set up roadblocks where are the cars going to tail him to the heart of london where hes going to release his damn botulinus once in london theyll lose him theyre bound to lose him dont you see he has to be stopped somewhere if hes not if hes let loose in london but you yourself agreed that was before i knew for sure that he was headed for london general hardanger appealed cant you make cavell shes my only child hardanger and an old man shouldnt be asked to decide life or death for his only child the general said tonelessly you know as well as any man what i think of mary he paused then went on in the same level voice i agree with cavell please do as he suggests hardanger swore bitterly under his breath and leaned forward to speak to the sergeant when he had finished the general said calmly while were waiting my boy you might fill in a few remaining pieces in the jigsaw im in no condition to fill them in for myself the question the superintendent is always coming up with the red herrings all those red herrings why to buy time i was in no condition to fill in jigsaws myself but what was left of my mind was still working just well enough to appreciate the reason behind the request to try to take our minds off the car in front the trapped and terrified girl at the mercy of ruthless and sadistic killers to reduce the tearing anxiety to ease the destructive tension that was slowly pulling tired minds and bodies to pieces i went on fumbling along mentally our friend in the car up front had to buy time the more false leads we followed and the more blind alleys we blundered into and there were plenty the more time it would take us to get around to inquiring in the really dangerous places he overestimated us but for all that we moved faster than he bad expected dont forget that its only forty hours since the crime was discovered but he knew that sooner or later we would get around to making inquiries in the one place he feared macdonalds he knew he might have to dispose of macdonald sooner or later and the later the better for within a few hours of macdonalds death a sealed envelope in a bank or policestation would be opened and then wed be on to him like an express train whatever oregons ultimate intentions are he would obviously have preferred to carry those out while still a respectable member of the alfringham community instead of a wanted murderer on the run from half the police in britain its difficult to threaten the government and the nation with the law breathing down the back of your neck the general conceded the old mans detachment his iron control was almost more than human but why did macdonald have to die because of two things because he knew what gregoris ultimate end was and if macdonald had lived to tell it all his gregoris plans would have been ruined and because of mrs turpin macdonald was a pretty tough character and he might not have talked even when the police got on to him after all although he almost certainly had no hand in any killing he was pretty deep in the mire himself but mrs turpin would have made him talk if not shed have talked herself madame halle gave me to understand in paris that macdonald was pretty much of a philanderer and philanderers dont change their ways easily not before eighty anyway mrs turpin was a goodlooking woman and her fiercely protective attitude towards macdonald was a dead giveaway she was in love with him whether he was with her i couldnt guess and it doesnt matter if things had gone wrong shed have had macdonald turn queens evidence and lower the boom on gregori by betraying his plans i think his evidence might have been so important so vastly important that either she or macdonald or both would be convinced that at the most macdonald would have received no more than a light sentence with all hopes of his money from oregon gone i dont think macdonald would have hesitated between turning queens evidence if it was important enough he might even have received a free pardon and being held as an accessory to murder for gain which still calls for a walk to the gallows in this country and if he had i hesitated mrs turpin would have made up his mind for him i my guess its only a guess but we can check at mordon is that mrs turpin phoned macdonald at the lab immediately after i had left and that gregori either overheard or was told what had happened he probably accompanied macdonald home to see how the land lay and it didnt take him a couple of minutes to find out the heat was on macdonald and that could have been fatal for gregori to prevent that gregori had to make it fatal for macdonald and mrs turpin all neatly buttoned up eh hardanger said his face was deadpan he was still a fair way from forgiving me net tightened and completely closed i agreed the only trouble is that the big fish has already escaped and whats left is useless but one thing we know we can forget all this rubbish about demolishing mordon if that was oregons plan it wouldnt have helped or hindered him in the execution of it if macdonald had talked for the whole country knew of it already whatever it is is something on a much bigger much more important scale something that might have been foiled probably would have been foiled had we known of it in advance such as what hardanger demanded you tell me im done with guessing for the day and i was through with guessing and talking for the day except when necessity absolutely demanded it slumped back in the warmth and comfort of the deeplycushioned seats reaction was beginning to set in the anaesthetising effect of the need for nonstop action and urgent thinking was beginning to wear off and the more it wore off the older and more worn i felt and the more pain i thought of the widelyheld belief that you cant feel more than one pain at one time and wondered what misinformed idiot had started that one i wondered what part of me was causing me the most pain my foot my ribs or my head and came to the conclusion that my ribs won by a short head was that a pun the driver was reaching over ninety on the longer stretches of wet road but he drove so smoothly and skilfully that even with my fear and anxiety for mary i think i was beginning to doze off when the loudspeaker up front began to crackle first came the identification sign then the message grey humber saloon answering description of wanted car number not identified has just turned left from london road to b road to avoid block at flemington crossroad two and a half miles east of crutchley am following flemington crossroads the voice of the sergeant in the front seat an alfringham man held a rising note of excitement hes on a blind road it doesnt lead anywhere except to flemington and then back on to the main london road about three miles farther on again how far are we from whats the name of the place crutchley hardanger demanded near enough four miles sir so that would make it between nine and ten miles to the junction where gregori must rejoin the main london road this side road through flemington the one hes on how long is it how long would it take him five or six miles sir its pretty twisty maybe ten minutes if he kept his foot down and took chances all the way the road is full of blind corners do you think you could get there in ten minutes hardanger asked the driver i dont know sir he hesitated i dont know the road i do the sergeant said confidently hell make it he made it the rain was sluicing vertically down me roads were slippery straight stretches were at a premium and i think we all added a few more grey hairs to our quota that night but he made it he made it with time to spare from the constant stream of reports pouring in from police cars pursuing oregon it was quite evident that the man at the wheel was anything but a skilful driver our car braked to a halt parked broadside on across the flemington road completely blocking the exit on to the main london road we all climbed quickly out of the car while the sergeant trained the powerful roof spotlight up foe side road in the direction from which oregons stolen humber would appear we took up position in the pouring rain behind the jaguar and as a precaution about ten feet back from it in that blinding rain a misted windscreen or ineffective wipers could prevent the driver of a car travelling at high speed from seeing the jaguar until it was too late especially if the driver was as incompetent as claimed i took a good look around me dick turpin couldnt have chosen a better spot for an ambush the top and one side of the rightangle t junction were completely covered in dense beech woods the third side of the t illuminated by the still blazing headlights of the jaguar was open pastureland with a treelined farmhouse about two hundred yards away and at less than half that distance a barn and scattered farmbuildings i could just make out a light from one of the windows in the farmhouse blurred and misty through the heavy rain there was a deep ditch on one side of the remington road and i considered hiding myself there about the point where oregons car would be forced to pull up then rising and heaving a heavy rock through the drivers window thereby eliminating fifty per cent of the opposition before they could even start anything the only trouble was that i might also eliminate mary the fact that she hadnt been in the front seat when gregori had passed through alfringham was no guarantee that she wasnt there now i decided to stay where i was over the sound of the rain hissing whitely on the tarmac and drumming heavily on the roof of the car we could suddenly hear the steadily rising note of an engine being revved up furiously and far from skilfully through the gears seconds later we caught sight of the first white wash of its headlights the barred beams shining eerily through the boles of the beeches and the pale rods of rain we dropped to our knees behind the shelter of the police jaguar and i eased out the hanyatti slipping the safety catch then all at once to the accompaniment of a highpitched grating of gears and mad revving of the engine what wouldnt have got its driver very far at le mans the car was round the last corner and heading straight for us we could hear it accelerating as it came out of the corner just over a hundred and fifty yards away then came the abrupt cessation of engine noise succeeded almost immediately by the unmistakable tearing hissing sound of locked wheels sliding on a wet road i could see the headlight beams of the approaching car swing wildly from one side to the other as the driver fought to retain control and i instinctively tensed waiting for the crash and the shock as the car ploughed into the side of the jaguar blocking its path but the crash and the shock did not come owing everything to good luck and nothing whatsoever to good management the driver managed to pull up less than five feet from the jaguar in the middle of the road and slewed only very slightly to the left i straightened and walked up to the side of the police jaguar my eye screwed almost shut against the glare of the humbers headlights sharply outlined though i was in that blinding wash of light i doubted whether the occupants of the car could see me the spotlight on the roof of the jaguar was a powerful one and shining directly into oregons windscreen im no annie oakley with a gun but at a distance of ten feet and a target the size of a soupplate i can hold my own with the worst two quick shots and the headlights of the humber shattered and died i walked round the front of the jaguar the others following as a second car the pursuing police car pulled up behind oregons i was still rounding the nose of the jaguar when the two right hand doors of the stolen car were flung wide and two men scrambled quickly out for one second and one second only i had the game in my hands i could have gunned them both down where they stood and the fact that i would have had to shoot one of them through the back wouldnt have worried me at all but like a fool i hesitated and was slow in bringing up my gun and then the second was gone and so was my last chance for mary was out of the car now jerked out with a brutal violence that made her gasp in pain and was held in front of gregori while his gun pointed at me directly over her right shoulder the other man was a squat broadshouldered and very toughlooking latin type with a pistol the size of a sawnoff cannon held in his hairy left hand his left hand i noticed it had been a lefthanded man who had used the wirecutters to break out of mordon here probably was the killer of both baxter and clandon nor had i any doubt but that he was the killer when youve seen enough of them you recognise one instantly they may look as normal as happily innocuous as the next man but always far back in the eyes lies the glint of empty madness its not something they have its something they dont have this was such a man and gregori another he was the same gregori as id ever known tall swarthy with grizzled hair and a quizzical expression on his face but at the same time a completely different man he no longer wore his glasses cavell his voice was soft colourless conversational almost i had the chance to kill you weeks ago i should have taken it negligence i have known of you for a long time i was warned of you i didnt listen the boy friend i said my own gun was hanging by my side and i stared at the barrel in that hairy left hand it pointed straight at my left eye lefthanded the killer of baxter and clandon indeed gregori tightened his grip round mary her fair hair was wildly dishevelled her face streaked with mud and there was the beginning of an unpleasant bruise above her right eye she must have tried a breakaway on the walk between abandoned car and garage but she wasnt scared much or if she was she was hiding it i was rightly warned henriques my as lieutenant he is also responsible for some other slight accidents arent you henriques including the slight damage to yourself cavell i nodded it made sense henriques the hatchetman i looked at the hard bitter face and the empty eyes and i knew gregori was telling the truth not that that made gregori any more innocent it just made him more understandable master criminals of gregoris class almost never touched the physical side of their business gregori glanced quickly at the two policemen who had come out of the pursuing car and gave henriques a quick jerk of the head henriques swung his gun and lined it up on the two policemen they stopped i lifted my own gun and took a pace nearer gregori dont do it cavell gregori said evenly he pressed the muzzle of his gun into marys side with such violence that she moaned with the pain of it i wont hesitate to kill i took another step forward four feet separated us i said you wont harm her if you do ill kill you you know that god only knows what it is that you have at stake but its something almighty big to justify all the work and planning youve put in the killing youve done whatever that is you havent achieved it yet you wouldnt throw it all away just by shooting my wife would you gregori take me away from this horrible man pierre mary murmured her voice was low and not steady i i dont care what he does he wont do anything my dear i said quietly he doesnt dare to and he knows it quite the little psychologist arent you gregori said in the same conversational tone suddenly completely unexpectedly his back braced against the side of the car he sent mary catapulting towards me with a vicious thrust of both arms i broke ground to lessen the impact staggered back two steps before steadying us both and by the time id put her to one side and was bringing my gun up again gregori was holding something in his outstretched hand a glass ampoule with a blue sealed top in the other hand he held the steel flask from which hed just abstracted it i looked at oregons impassive face then back at the ampoule in his hand and i could feel the sudden moisture between my palm and the butt of the hanyatti i turned my head and looked at the general hardanger and the two policemen behind me both the general and hardanger i saw with heavy pistols in their hands turned front again and looked at the other two policemen under henriques gun i said slowly and distinctly dont do anything anybody that ampoule in oregons hand contains the satan bug youve all read the papers today you all know what will happen if that glass breaks they all knew all right wed have made the figures in any waxworks look like characters with the st vituss dance doing the twist how long would it be gregori had said yesterday before all life in britain would become extinct if that refined polio virus escaped i couldnt remember but not long it didnt matter much anyway correct gregori said calmly the crimson top for the botulinus virus the blue top for the satan bug when cavell was gambling with his wifes life just now there was an element of bluff involved i would beg you to believe that i am not bluffing tonight i hope to achieve something that i have set my heart on he paused and looked at us all individually his eyes glittering emptily in the glare of the police searchlight if i am not permitted to go unmolested then i cannot achieve this object and have little wish to prolong this life of mine i shall then smash this ampoule i would beseech you all to believe that i am in the most complete and deadly earnest i believed him implicitly he was as mad as a hatter i said your lieutenant henriques how does he feel about your casual attitude towards his life i have once saved henriques from drowning and twice from the electric chair his life is mine to dispose of as i see fit he understands that besides henriques is a deaf mute youre insane i said harshly you told us yesterday that neither fire nor ice seas nor mountains can stop the spread of the satan bug i believe that to be essentially correct if i have to go it matters nothing to me if the rest of mankind accompanies me but i paused good god gregori no sane man not even the most monstrous criminal in history would ever dream of such of such in the name of heaven man you cant mean it it may be that i am not sane he said i didnt doubt it not then i watched him gripped with fear and fascination such as i had never known as he handled the ampoule carelessly then stooped swiftly and laid it on the wet road under the sole of his left shoe the left heel was still on the ground i wondered briefly if a couple of heavy slugs from the hanyatti would drive him over backwards jerking his foot off the ampoule but the thought died as it came a madman could juggle carelessly with the lives of his fellowmen but i had no justification of madness even had there been only one chance in ten million of being executioner instead of keeper i could never have taken it i have tested those ampoules in the laboratory empty ones i need hardly say gregori went on conversationally and have discovered that a pressure of seven and a half pounds is sufficient to shatter them incidentally i have taken the precaution of providing concentrated cyanide tablets for henriques and myself death from the satan bug as we have observed from experiments on animals is rather more prolonged than death from botulinus and most distressing you will each come forward one at a time and hand me your guns butt foremost at arms length you will take the greatest care to do nothing that might upset my balance so transferring my weight to my left foot yon first cavell i reversed the gun and handed it to him slowly and deliberately at the full extent of my arm taking excruciating care indeed not to upset his balance our complete defeat the fact that this madman and murderer would now escape and almost certainly achieve what evil and desperate ends he had in mind just didnt matter a single solitary damn then the only thing that mattered was that oregons balance should not be in the slightest upset one by one we all handed our guns over to him after that he ordered us all to line up while henriques the deaf mute passed along behind us searching swiftly and skilfully for further weapons he found none then and not until then did gregori carefully remove his foot from the ampoule stoop pick it up and slide it back inside its steel jacket i think conventional weapons will serve us now he said pleasantly one is so much less liable to make mistakes of a well a permanent nature he picked up two of the guns that henriques had piled on the bonnet of the humber checked that the safety catches of both were off he beckoned to henriques and spoke rapidly to him it was a weird sight because there was no sound gregori doing his speaking with exaggerated lip movements in complete silence i know a little lipreading but could make out nothing possibly he talked in a foreign language not french or italian he stopped speaking and henriques nodded comprehension looking at us with a queer anticipation in his eyes i didnt like the look one bit henriques struck me as altogether a very nasty piece of work gregori pointed one of his guns at the two policemen who had been in the pursuing car off with your uniforms he said curtly now the policemen looked at each other and one said through clenched teeth ill be damned if i will youll be dead if you dont you fool i said sharply dont you know what kind of men you are dealing with take it off i wont take my clothes off for any man he swore bitterly its an order hardanger barked savagely urgently it wont give him much more trouble to remove your uniforms when there is a bullet between your eyes take it off he finished with slow and heavy emphasis reluctantly sullenly the two officers did as they were told and stood there shivering in the cold heavy rain henriques collected the uniforms and threw them into the police jaguar who operates the shortwave radio in this jaguar gregori said next i felt as if somebody had run a skewer through my middle and given it a twist but i had been expecting it all the same i do the sergeant admitted good get through to headquarters tell them that you have taken us and are proceeding to london tell them to call all police cars in the area back to their stations except of course those on routine patrol duties do as he says hardanger said wearily i think youre too intelligent to try any fancy stuff sergeant exactly as he says so the sergeant did exactly as he was told he didnt have much option not with the muzzle of one of gregoris pistols grinding into his left ear when he had finished oregon nodded his satisfaction that will do very well he watched henriques climb into the stolen humber our car and the one belonging to our two shivering friends here will be driven into the woods and their distributors smashed for good measure they wont be found before dawn with the search called off the other police car and those two uniforms we should have little trouble in clearing this area then we switch cars he looked regretfully at the jaguar when your hq catch on to the fact that you are missing this car is going to become very hot property indeed that leaves only the problem of what to do with you he waited until henriques had disposed of both cars gazing out with empty disinterest under the dripping brim of fedora then said is there a portable searchlight in this jaguar i believe such equipment is standard sergeant we have a batterypowered light in the boot the sergeant said stolidly get it gregoris eyes and mouth crinkled into a smile fee kind of smile a tiger trapped in the bottom of a pit shows when the man who dug the hole trips and falls in beside him i cant shoot you though i wouldnt hesitate if that house were not so near i wont try tapping you all on the head because i doubt if you would submit quietly to that i cant tie you up for im not in the habit of carrying on me sufficient ropes and gags to immobilise and silence eight people but i suspect that one of those farm buildings there will offer all i require in the way of a temporary prison sergeant switch off the car headlamps and then lead the way with your light to those buildings the rest will follow in double file mrs cavell and i will bring up the rear the gun in my hand will be pressed against her back and should any of you try to run for it or otherwise cause trouble i shall merely pull the trigger i didnt doubt him none of us doubted him the farm buildings were deserted of human life that was from the byre i could hear the moving and slow champing of the cows but the evening milking was over gregori passed up the byre he passed up the dairy a stable now converted to a tractor shed a large concreted pigsty and a turnip shed he hesitated over the barn and then found exactly what he wanted i had to admit that it certainly suited his purpose a long narrow stone building with headhigh embrasured windows that made one instinctively look for the crenellated battlements above it looked more like an oldtime private chapel than anything else its true function couldnt have been more different it was a cider house with a heavy oldfashioned oaken press at the far end one long wall lined with duckboard shelving for apples the other with bunged casks and covered vats of freshly made cider the door like the press was made of solid oak and once the dropbar on the outside was in position it would have taken a batteringram to break it down wed no battering ram but wed even better we had desperation resource and between us all a fair amount of intelligence surely gregori wasnt so crazy as to think that that cider house could hold us indefinitely surely he wasnt so crazy as to think that our shouts wouldnt be heard eventually either by passersby on the road or the occupants of the farm itself not much more than a hundred yards away with a sudden dread conviction and heartchilling finality that momentarily paralysed all reasoning i knew that gergori was indeed not that crazy he knew we would be making no assaults on the door he knew we wouldnt be shouting out for help because he knew beyond all question that none of us would ever be leaving the ciderhouse again except on a bier and covered by a blanket somebody with superchilled icicles in lieu of fingers started playing rachmaninoff up and down my spinal column get to the far end and stay there while i lock the door from the outside gregori ordered time does not permit of elaborate farewell speeches twelve hours from now when ive shaken the dust of this accursed country from my feet for the last time i shall think of you all goodbye i said steadily no magnanimous gestures towards a defeated enemy you beg cavell i have time for one little thing more time for the man who cost me so much so nearly ruined all my plans he stepped forward jammed the automatic he held in his left hand into my stomach and with the sights of the pistol he held in his right deliberately and viciously raked both sides of my face i felt the skin tearing in thin lines of whitehot pain and the warm blood trickling down cold cheeks mary said something unintelligible in a high voice and tried to run to me but hardanger caught her in powerful arms and held her till her futile struggles ceased gregori stepped back and said that is for beggars cavell i nodded i didnt even raise my hands to my face anyway he couldnt have disfigured it much more than it had been before i said you might take mrs cavell with you pierre marys voice was a sob anguish in it a cruelly hurt and stricken despair what are you saying hardanger swore softly and viciously and the general looked at me in dumb incomprehension gregori stood very still dark expressionless eyes looking emptily into mine then he gave a queer little duck of the head and said it is my turn to beg forgive me i did not know that you knew i hope when my turn comes he broke off and turned to mary it would be wrong a beautiful child i am not cavell devoid of all human sentiment at least not where women and children are concerned for instance the two children i was forced to abduct from alfringham farm have already been released and will be with their parents within the hour yes yes it would be wrong come mrs cavell she came instead to me and touched my face lightly what is it pierre she whispered no reproach in her voice only love and wonder and compassion what is so wrong goodbye mary i said dr gregori doesnt like to be kept waiting ill see you soon she made to speak again but gregori had her by the arm already leading her towards the door while the deaf mute henriques watched us with mad eyes and a pistol in either hand and then the door closed the heavy bar dropped solidly into place and we were left there staring at each oilier by the light of the spotlamp which still burned whitely on the floor you lousy filthy swine hardanger ground out savagely why shut up hardanger my voice was low urgent desperate spread out watch those embrasures the windows quickly for gods sake hurry i i think there was something in my voice that would have moved an egyptian mummy quickly silently the seen of us started to space out i whispered hes going to throw in something through a window hes going to throw in an ampoule of the botulinus toxin any second i knew it would take moments only for him to unscrew the top of the steel flask that held the ampoule catch i you must catch it if that ampoule hits the floor or the wall were all dead men even as i finished we heard a sudden movement outside the shadow of an arm fell across the side of an embrasure and something came spinning into the room something that glittered and flashed in the light from the lamp on the floor something made of glass with a red seal on top a botulinus ampoule it came so swiftly so unexpectedly and thrown at such a deliberately downward angle that no one had a chance it spun across the room struck at the precise junction of stone wall and stone floor and shattered into a thousand tinkling fragments chapter twelve ill never know what made me do it ill never know why reacted with what i can only regard now looking back on it as incredible swiftness the split second that elapses between the downward sweep of the enemy club and the reflex upflinging of your arm in defence that was all the time it took me to react it was automatic instinctive without any thought in the world but there must have been thought behind it an instantaneous form of reasoning below the level of awareness that didnt have time to be transmitted to the surface mind in the form of conscious thought fori did the one thing in the world that offered the only the slenderest the most desperate hope of survival even as the ampoule came spinning through the air and i could see there was no chance on earth of its being intercepted my hands were reaching out for the barrel of cider on the trestle by my side and the tinkling of the shattered ampoule was still echoing in shocked silence in that tiny little room when i smashed down the barrel with all the strength of my arms and body exactly on the spot where the glass had made contact the staves split and shattered as if they had been made of the thinnest ply and ten gallons of cider gurgled and flooded out over the wall and floor more cider i shouted more cider pour it on the floor down the side of the wall spray it through the air above where that damned ampoule landed for gods sake dont splash any cider on yourselves hurry hurry what the hell is all this in aid of hardanger demanded his normally ruddy face was pale and set and uncomprehending but for all that he was already carefully tipping a small vat of cider on the floor what will this do its hygroscopic i said quickly the botulinus i mean seeks out water in preference to air every time it has a hundred times the affinity for hydrogen that it has for nitrogen you heard the general speak of it this evening this isnt water hardanger objected almost wildly this is cider god help us i said savagely of course its cider we havent got anything else here i dont know what the effect the affinity will be for the first time in your life hardanger youd better start praying that an alcohol has a high water content i tried to lift another smaller cask but gasped and dropped it as a sharp spear of agony struck at the right side of my chest for one terrible second i thought the virus had struck the next i realised i must have displaced my strapped broken ribs when i hurled that barrel through the air i wondered vaguely whether a broken rib had pierced the pleura or even a lung and then forgot about it in the circumstances it hardly mattered any more how long to live if some of the botulinus virus had escaped into the atmosphere how long before the first convulsions what had oregon said about the hamster when wed been talking outside number one lab yesterday fifteen seconds yes that was it fifteen seconds for the satan bug and about the same for botulinus for a hamster fifteen seconds for a human being heaven alone knew probably thirty seconds at the most at the very most i stooped and lifted the portable lamp from the floor stop pouring i said urgently stop it thats enough stand high if you want to live stand high dont let any of that cider touch your shoes touch any part of you or youre dead men i swung the lamp round as they scrambled high to avoid the amber tide of cider already flooding rapidly across the stone floor and as i did i could hear the police engine of the jaguar starting up gregori taking off with henriques and mary towards the realisation of his megalomaniacs dream secure in the knowledge that he was leaving a charnel house behind thirty seconds were up at least thirty seconds were up no one twitching yet far less in convulsions more slowly this time i played the lamp beam over each and every one of us starting at strained staring faces and moving slowly down the feet the beam steadied on one of the two constables whose clothes had been taken take os your right shoe i said sharply its been splashed not with your hand you bloody idiot ease it off with the toe of the other shoe superintendent the left arm of your jacket is wet hardanger stood very still not even looking at me as i eased the jacket at the collar and slid it down carefully over arms and hands before dropping it to the floor are we are we safe now sir the sergeant asked nervously safe id rather this damned place was alive with cobras and black widow spiders no were not safe some of this hellish toxin will escape to the atmosphere as soon as the first of those splashes on the wall or floor has dried up theres water vapour in the air too you know my guess is that as soon as any of these splashes dry up well all have had it inside a minute so we get out the general said calmly fast is that the idea my boy yes sir i glanced quickly round two barrels on either side of the door two more in line with them and a bit back four men standing on those and swinging the ciderpress between them i cant do it somethings wrong with my ribs that press must weigh three hundred pounds if it weighs an ounce think four of you could do it superintendent think we can do it hardanger growled i could do it myself with one hand if it meant getting out of this place come on for gods sake lets hurry and hurry they did manoeuvring casks into position while having to stand on others was no easy trick more especially as all the casks were full but desperation and the fear that borders on overmastering panic gives men ability to perform feats of strength that they can never afterwards understand en less than twenty seconds all four barrels were in position and in another twenty hardanger the sergeant and two constables a pair on each side of the heavy ponderous ciderpress were starting on their back swing the door was made of solid oak with heavy hinges to match and a drawbar on the outside but against that solid battering ram propelled by four powerful men with their lives at stake it might as well have been made of plywood the shattered door was smashed completely off its hinges and the winepress released at the last moment went cartwheeling through the doorway into the darkness beyond five seconds later the last of us had followed the ciderpress that farmhouse hardanger said urgently come on theyve probably got a telephone wait there was twice the urgency in my voice we cant do that we dont know that were not carrying the virus on us we may be bringing death to all that family lets give the rain time to wash off any virus that may be sticking to the outside damn it we cant afford to wait hardanger said fiercely besides if the virus didnt get us in there its a certainty it wont get us now general im not sure the general said hesitantly i rather think youre right weve no time he broke off in horror as one of the unclothed constables the one whose shoe had been splashed by the cider screamed aloud in agony the scream deepening to a tearing rasping coughing moan clutching hands clawed in a maniac frenzy at a suddenly stiffened straightened neck where the tendons stood out whitely like quivering wires then he toppled and fell heavily to the muddy ground silent now the nails of his fingers tried to tear his throat open his crewmate the other uniformless constable made some sort of unintelligible sound moved forward and down to help his friend then grunted in pain as my arm hooked around his neck dont touch him i shouted hoarsely touch him and youll die too he must have picked up the toxin when he brushed his shoe with his hand then touched his mouth nothing on earth can save him now stand back keep well clear of him he took twenty seconds to die the kind of twenty seconds that will stay with a man in his nightmares till he draws his last breath on earth i had seen many men die but even those who had died in bullet and shrapneltorn agony had done so peacefully and quietly compared to this man whose body in the incredibly convulsive violence of its death throes twisted and flung itself into the most fantastic and impossible contortions twice in the last shocking seconds before death he threw his racked and tortured body clear off the ground and so high in the air that i could have passed a table beneath him and then as abruptly and unexpectedly as it had begun it was all over and he was no more than a strangely small and shapeless bundle of clothes lying face downwards in the muddy earth my mouth was kilndry and full of the taste of salt the ugly taste of fear i cant say how long we stood there in the heavy cold rain staring at the dead man a long time i think and then we looked at each other and each one of us knew what the others were capable of thinking only one thing who was next in the pale wash of light from the lamp i still held in one hand we all stared at each other one half of our senses and minds outgoing and screwed up to the highest pitch of intensity and perception to detect the first signs of death in another the other half turned inwards to detect the first signs in themselves then all at once i cursed savagely perhaps at myself or my cowardice or at gregori or at the botulinus virus i dont know turned abruptly and headed for the byre taking the lamp with me leaving the others standing there round the dead man in the rainfilled pitchy darkness like darklypetrified mourners at some ageold heathen midnight rites i was looking for a hose and i found one almost immediately i carried it outside screwed it on to a standing plug and turned the tap on full the results in the way of volume and pressure would have done justice to any city hydrant i clambered awkwardly on to a hay wagon that was standing nearby and said to the general come on sir you first he came directly under the earthwardpointed nozzle and the jet of water on head and shoulders from a distance of only a few inches made him stumble and all but fall but he stuck it gamely for all of the halfminute that i insisted he remain under the hose and by the tune i was finished he was as sodden as if hed spent the night in the river and shivering so violently that i could hear his teeth chatter above the hiss of the water but by the time he was finished i knew that any toxin that might have been clinging to face or body would have been completely washed away the other four all submitted to it in turn and then hardanger did the same for me the force of the water was such that it was like being belaboured by a nonstop series of far from lightweight clubs and the water itself was icecold but when i thought of the man who had died and how he had died a few bruises and the risk of pneumonia didnt even begin to be worth considering when he had finished with me hardanger switched off the water and said quietly sorry cavell you had the right of it it was my fault i said i didnt mean my voice to sound dull and lifeless but that was the way it came out to my ears anyway i should have warned him i should have told him not to touch his mouth or nose with his hand he should have thought of that himself hardanger said his voice abnormally matteroffact he knew the dangers as well as you theyve been published in every paper in the land today lets go and see if the farmer has a phone not that itll make much difference now gregori knows that the police jaguar is too hot to hang on to for a second longer than is necessary hes won all along the line damn his black soul and nothing is going to stop him now twelve hours he said twelve hours and then he would be done twelve hours from now gregori will be dead i said what i could sense him staring at me what did you say hell be dead i repeated before dawn its all right hardanger said cavells mind had cracked at last but lets play it casual lets not any of us make a song and dance about it he took my arm and started out for the lamplit rectangles which showed where the house stood the sooner this is over the sooner well all get the rest and food and sleep we need rest and sleep when ive killed gregori i said im going to kill him tonight first i get mary back then ill kill him mary will be all right cavell mary in that madmans hands that was what had sent cavells last few remaining grey cells tottering over the brink he thought hell let her go hell have no reason to do anything to her and you had to do what you did you thought mat if she stayed there with us in the cider house she would die isnt that it cavell im sure the superintendent is right my boy the general was walking on my other side now and his voice was quiet because loud voices excite the unhinged she wont be harmed i said rudely to both if im round the bend what the hell does that make you two hardanger stopped tightened his grip on my arm and peered at me he knew that those whose minds have gone off the rails never talk about it for the simple reason that they are unshakably convinced that their minds are still on the track he said carefully i dont think i understand you dont but you will i said to the general you must persuade the cabinet to go on with this evacuation of the central london area continuous radio and tv broadcasts theyll have no difficulty in persuading the people to leave you can believe that it shouldnt cause much trouble that areas pretty well unlived in by night anyway i turned again to hardanger have two hundred of your best men armed a gun for me too and a knife i know exactly what gregori intends to do tonight i know exactly what he hopes to achieve i know exactly how he intends to leave the country and exactly where he will be leaving from how do you know my boy the generals voice was so quiet that i could hardly hear above the drumming of the rain because gregori talked too much sooner or later they all talk too much gregori was cagier than most even when he i was convinced that we would all be dead in a minute he still said very little but that little was too much and i think ive really known ever since we found macdonalds body you must have heard things that i didnt hear hardanger said sourly you heard it all you heard him say he was going to london if he really wanted the bug set loose in london to have mordon destroyed hed have stayed in mordon to see what happened and have had some stooge do the job in london but he has no interest in seeing mordon destroyed he never had theres something he has to do in london another of his neverending red herrings the communist red herring of course was purely fortuitous hed no hand in that at all thats the first thing the second mat he was going to achieve some great ambition tonight the third that he had twice saved henriques from the electric chair that shows what kind of a man he is and i dont mean a criminal defence lawyer of the us bar association and what kind of ambition he has in mind ill take long odds not only that hes on the interpol files but also that hes an ex bigtime american racketeer who has been deported to italy and the line of business in which he used to specialise would make very interesting reading because the criminal leopards even the biggest cats in the jungle never change their spots the fourth thing is that he expects to be clear of this country in twelve hours time and the fifth thing is that this is saturday night put all those things together add see what you get suppose you tell us hardanger said impatiently so i told them the rain still fell as vertically as heavily as ever just as heavily as when we had left that farmhouse some hours previously where the torrential rain in conjunction with the quick evacuation of the area had robbed the botulinus toxin of all victims other than the unfortunate policeman who had died so terribly before our eyes now at twenty minutes past three in the morning the rain was icecold but i didnt really feel it all i could feel was my exhaustion the harsh stabbing pain in my right ribs that came with every breath i took and the continuous rending worry that in spite of the confidence id shown to the general and hardanger i might be hopelessly wrong after all and mary lost to me for ever and even if i were right she might still as easily be lost to me with a conscious and almost desperate effort of will i turned my mind to other things the highwalled courtyard where id been standing for the past three hours was dark and deserted as dark and deserted as the heart of london itself evacuation of the centre of the city the temporarily homeless going to prepared halls ballrooms and theatres had begun shortly after six oclock just after the last of the offices businesses and shops had closed it had been hastened by radio broadcasts at nine oclock saying that according to the latest message received the time for the release of the botulinus toxin had been advanced from four am to half past two but there had been no hurry no panic no despair in fact there would have been no sense of anything unusual happening had it not been for the unusual number of people carrying suitcases the phlegmatic londoners who had seen the city set on fire and suffered a hundred nights of mass area bombing during the war werent to be stampeded into anything for anybody between half past nine and ten oclock over a thousand troops had combed their methodical way through the heart of the city checking that every last man woman and child had been moved to safety that no one had been inadvertently overlooked at half past eleven a darkened drifting police launch had nosed silently into the north bank of the river and put me ashore on the embankment just below hungerford bridge at midnight troops and police all of them armed had completely sealed off the entire area including the bridges across the thames at one oclock a power failure on a large scale had blacked out the better part of a square mile of the city the square mile cordoned off by troops and police twenty past three fifty minutes after the timed release of the botulinus toxin it was time to go i eased the borrowed webley in its illfitting holster checked the knife that was strapped handle downwards to my left forearm and moved out into the darkness id never seen a picture of far less visited the new helicopter port on the north bank but an inspector of the metropolitan police had briefed me so exhaustively that by the time he had finished i could have found my way up there blindfolded and that to all intents and purposes was exactly what i was blindfolded blind in that blackedout city and oh that weeping overcast night the darkness was just one degree short of absolute i had been told that there were three different ways up to the heliport perched on the roof of the station a hundred feet above the streets of london there were two lifts but with the power failure those would be out of operation between those lifts was a glassedin circular staircase without a shred of cover from top to bottom using which would be as neat a way as any of committing suicide if there was a reception committee waiting and i could not see gregori as a man who would leave his main line of approach unguarded and then there was the third way the fireescape on the other side of the station that was the only way in for me i walked two hundred yards from the courtyard along a narrow cobbled lane when the wall gave way to a high wooden fence i reached for the top pulled myself up slipped quietly down on the other side and set off along the railway tracks the reference book compilers who assert that clapham junction has more sets of parallel tracks than any place in britain wouldnt go around making silly statements like that if theyd tried this lot on a pitch black october night with the sleety rain falling about their ears there wasnt a single piece of ironware in the whole interminable width of those tracks that i didnt find that night usually with my ankles and shins railway lines wires signalling gear switch gear hydrants platforms where there shouldnt have been platforms i found them all to add to my discomfort the burnt cork that had been so heavily rubbed into my face and hands was beginning to run and burnt cork tastes exactly as you would expect it to taste and when it gets in your eyes it hurts the only hazard i didnt have to contend with was live rails the power had been switched off i found the fence on the other side of the track easily enough just by walking into it once down in the lane on the other side i turned left and made my way towards the fireescape which came down i had been told into a small recessed court i found the court crossed the entrance and flattened myself against the far wall the fireescape was there all right just barely discernible twenty feet away against the fractionally lighter darkness of the sky gaunt and stark and angular and zigzagging upwards out of sight the first two or three flights of the fireescape were invisible lost against the darkness of high walls beyond for three minutes i stood there showing as many signs of life as a wooden indian then i heard it even above the drumming of the sleet on my sodden shoulders and the sound of water running in the gutters i heard it the slight shuffle of a shoe on the pavement as someone changed his cramped position the sound didnt come again but then i didnt need to hear it again once was enough someone was standing directly under the lowermost platform of the fireescape and if he turned out to be toe soul of innocence doing it for his healths sake it would be surprising to say the least it was also going to be unfortunate for him but he wouldnt be caring much when he was dead finding this man here didnt give me any feeling of dismay and frustration because of the possible threat and setback he offered all it afforded me was the sense of profound satisfaction and relief that could not be described i had gambled but i had won dr gregori was doing exactly what id told the general and hardanger he would be doing the knife came free of its sheath and i brushed the blade with the ball of my thumb it had a point like a lancet and an edge like a scalpel it was only a very little knife but three and a half inches of steel can kill you just as dead as the longest stiletto or the heaviest broadsword if you know where to hit that is i had a fair idea where to hit and how and at anything up to ten paces i was twice as accurate with a knife as with a gun i covered sixteen of the intervening twenty feet in just over ten seconds making no more sound than the moonlit shadow of a drifting snowflake and now i could see him quite clearly he was directly under the first platform of the fireescape to get what shelter he could from the rain his back was to the wall his head was bowed as if his chin was resting on his chest as if he was halfasleep on his feet hed only to glance sideways under raised eyelids and hed have had me he wasnt going to remain so obligingly unseeing for an indefinite period i twisted the knife until the blade pointed upwards then found myself hesitating even with marys life in the balance i found myself hesitating whoever this character was id little doubt but that he deserved to die anyway but to knife an unsuspecting and halfasleep man however much he deserved it this wasnt the war any more i slid out the webley quiet as a mouse tiptoeing past a sleeping cat caught the barrel and swung for a spot just below the dripping brim of his hat just behind the left ear and because i was feeling illogically angry about my uneasiness in knifing him i struck him very hard indeed the sound was the sound of an axe sinking deep into the bole of a pine i caught and lowered him gently to the ground he wouldnt wake up before dawn maybe hed never waken again it didnt seem to matter i started up the fireescape there was no hurry no haste in my going haste could be the end of it all i went up the steps slowly one at a time always staring upwards i was too near the end of the road now to let rashness be the ruin of everything after the sixth or seventh flight of steps i slowed down even more not because my leg and queer shortness of breath were troubling me which they were but because i had become suddenly aware of an area of diffused light in the darkness of the wall above me where a light had no right to be there shouldnt have been any light anywhere for all the lights of central london were out if ghosts were allowed to have black faces though i suspected mine was getting pretty streaky by this time then i want up the next flight of steps like a ghost as i approached the light i could see that it came not from a window but from a grillework door set in the wall cautiously i raised my head to the level of this door and peered inside it was on a level with the massive iron girders that spanned and supported the roof of the station at least a dozen lights were burning inside the station small weak isolated sources of illumination that served only to emphasise the depth of the gloom that lay over most of the huge and cavernous building six of the lights were directly above sets of hydraulic buffers at the end of tracks and i suddenly realised why they were burning there some lights are essential to the safe operation of a railway station and those must have been batterypowered lamps designed to come on in the event of a power failure a prosaic enough explanation and i was sure the correct one i looked for some moments at the geometric tracery of sootblackened girders that dwindled and vanished into impenetrable darkness at the farthest reaches of the station then put a slight experimental pressure on the door it gave under my hand and the damned thing squeaked like a gibbet creaking in the night wind a gibbet with a corpse on it i put the thought of corpses out of my mind and withdrew my hand from the door enough was enough but the door was sufficiently open to let me see a couple of vertical iron ladders leading away from the steel platform just inside one led upwards to a long gangway immediately below the vast skylights the other down to another gangway about the level of the highest of the lights inside the station the former would be for the windowcleaners the latter for the electricians it was a great help to me to know that i straightened at least six nights of stairs to go yet before i started getting really interested the arm that locked round my throat and started throttling the life out of me belonged to a gorilla a gorilla with a shirt and jacket on but a gorilla for all that in those first two hellish seconds of immobilised shock and pain i thought my neck was going to snap and before i could even begin to react something hard and metallic smacked down on my right wrist and sent the webley flying from my grasp it struck the iron platform and then spun off into space i never heard it land on the roadway beneath i was too busy fighting for my life with my left hand my right hand was momentarily paralysed and quite useless i reached up caught his wrist and tried to tear his arm away i might as well have tried to tear a fourinch bough from an oak tree he was phenomenally strong and he was squeezing the life out of me and not slowly something ground savagely into my back just above the kidney the unspoken order was clear as day but for all that i didnt stop struggling a few more seconds of that pressure and i knew my neck would go i smashed my right foot against the grille door and sent us both staggering back against the outside platform rail i felt his feet leave the platform as the rail struck him about hiplevel and for a moment we both teetered there on the point of imbalance his arm still locked around my neck then the pressures on neck and back were simultaneously released as he grabbed desperately for the rail to save himself i staggered away from him whooping painfully for bream and fell heavily against the next flight of steps leading upwards i landed on my right side just where the ribs were gone and the world darkened and dimmed in a haze of pain and if id then let myself go relaxed even for the briefest moment and yielded to the bodys clamorous demands for rest i should have passed out but passing out was the one luxury i couldnt afford not with this character anyway i knew who i had now if hed wanted merely to knock me out he could have tapped me over the head with his gun if hed wanted to kill me he could have shot me in the back or if hed no silencer and didnt want noise a tap on the head and a heave over the rail to the roadway sixty feet below would have served his purpose equally well but this lad didnt want anything so quiet and simple and painless if i was to die he wanted me to know i was dying for me he wanted the tearing agony of death by violence for himself the delight of savouring my agony a vicious and evil sadist with a dark mind crimsoned by the lust for blood oregons hatchetman henriques the deaf mute with the crazy eyes halflying halfstanding against the steps i twisted to face him as he came at me again he was crouched low and he had his gun in front of him but he didnt want to use that gun not if he could help it from a bullet you died too quickly unless of course you were very careful with the placing of the bullet suddenly i knew this was just what he had in mind the muzzle was ranging down my body as he searched for the spot where a bullet would mean that i would take quite some time dying unpleasantly i straightened my arms on the step behind me and if the scything upward sweep of my right foot had caught him where i had intended henriques wouldnt have worried me any more but my vision was fuzzy and coordination poor my foot glanced off his rightthigh swept on and struck his forearm jarring the gun from his hand the gun carried over the edge of the platform and clattered down a couple of steps on the flight below he turned like a cat to retrieve it and i was hardly any slower myself as he leaned over the top step scrabbled for and found his gun i jumped and caught him with both feet he grunted an ugly hoarse sound then crashed and cartwheeled down the steps to the platform below but he landed on his feet and he still had the gun i didnt hesitate if id tried running up the remaining flights to the heliport on top of the station roof hed have caught me in seconds or picked me off at his leisure even had i managed to reach the top assuming that the days of miracles were not yet over secrecy and silence would have vanished and oregon would be waiting for me id be trapped between two fires and everything would be over for mary it wouldhave been just as suicidal to go down and meet him or wait for him where i was id only the knife strapped to my left forearm and my numbed right hand was not sufficiently recovered to ease it out from its sheath far less use it and even had we both been weaponless even had i been at my fittest and best i doubt whether i could have coped with the dark violence of that phenomenally powerful deaf mute and i was a very long way from my fittest and best i went through the grille door like a rabbit bolting from its hole with a ferret only half a length behind desperately i glanced round the tiny platform up the vertical ladder to the window cleaners catwalk or down to the electricians it took me all of half a second to realise i couldnt do either not with one hand still out of commission and hope to reach either the top or bottom of the ladder before henriques came through that door and picked me off in his own sweet time six feet away from the platform was one of the giant girders that spanned the entire width of the station roof i didnt stop to think of it subconsciously i must have known that if i had stopped to think even for a second id have chosen to remain there and have it out with henriques on that platform gun or no gun but i didnt stop i ducked under the waisthigh chain surrounding the platform and launched myself across that sixty foot drop my good foot landed fair and square on the girder the other came just short and slipped off the thickly treacherous coating of soot deposited there by generations of steam locomotives as my shin cracked painfully against the edge of the metal i grabbed the beam with my left hand and for two or three dreadful seconds i just teetered there while the great empty station swam dizzily around me then i steadied and was safe for the moment i rose shakily to my feet i didnt crawl along the girder i didnt pussyfoot along with arms outstretched to aid my balance i just put down my head and ran the beam was only eight or nine inches wide it was covered with this dangerous layer of soot and the two rows of smooth rivetheads running along its entire length would have been my death had i stepped on their slippery convexities but i ran it took me seconds only to cover the seventy feet to the great central vertical girder that disappeared into the darkness above i grabbed it edged recklessly round and stared back in the direction from which id come henriques was on the platform by the grille door his gun was extended at the full stretch of his right arm pointing directly at me but he was lowering it even as i looked hed seen me all right but too late to draw a bead before id vanished behind the shelter of the vertical girder he looked around him seemed to hesitate i stood where i was clinging on to the girder while some of the numbness drained from my right hand and while henriques was making up his mind i cursed myself for my folly all the way up that fireescape from street level id never once thought to look behind the deaf mute must have been making a round of the posted guards found the unconscious man at the foot of the fireescape and drawn the inevitable conclusions henriques had made up his mind the idea of the leap from the platform across to the girder didnt appeal to him and i couldnt blame him he swarmed up the iron ladder to the window cleaners catwalk above moved over to a position directly above the girder i was standing on crossed the catwalk rail and lowered himself until his feet were only inches above the girder he dropped steadying himself with his hands on the wall turned carefully and started coming towards me his hands outstretched like a tightrope walkers i didnt wait for him i turned and started walking also i didnt walk far for there wasnt far to walk the beam i was on stretched to the other side of the main hall of the station and there it ended vanishing into the grimy brickwork there was no convenient platform here no catwalk above or below just the beam vanishing into the wall and sixty feet below the dull gleam of rails and hydraulic buffers just myself and the girder and the blank wall the end of the road and no way out i turned and made ready to die henriques had reached the vertical girder in the centre had safely negotiated his way past it and was advancing on me fifty feet away he stopped and even in the gloom i could see the white glimmer of his teeth as he smiled he had seen how it was with me that i was trapped and quite at his mercy it must have been one of the highlights in the life of that crazy man he started moving again slowly closing the distance between us twenty feet away he stopped stooped lowered his hands to the girder and sat down locking his legs securely under the beam he was wearing a very smooth line in italian sacking and all that soot wouldnt be doing it any good at all but he didnt seem to care he raised his pistol holding it with both hands and pointed it at the middle of my body there was nothing i could do with my hands at my back bracing myself against the wall i stiffened in futile preparation for the slamming rending impact of the shock i stared at his hands and imagined i could see the fingers whiten in spite of myself i winced and closed my eyes only for a second or two when i opened them again hed lowered the gun until his hand was resting on the beam and was grinning at me for sheer calculated sadism and feline cruelty id never met its equal but i should have known it i should have expected it the monstrous madman who had forced a cyanide sweet down clandons throat who had strangled macdonald alive at the end of a rope who had pulped in the back of mrs turpins head who had tortured eastern derry to death and for good measure had stove in my ribs such a man wasnt going to pass up the exquisite pleasure of watching me die by inches even although for once the dying was to be by terror of the mind instead of agony of the body i could visualise those empty eyes now hot and greedy for the suffering of others i could almost visualise the wolflike slavering of that twisted grinning mouth he was the cat i was the mouse and he was going to play with me until he had extracted every last ounce of pleasure from his macabre game and then regretfully he would shoot me although he would still have that one last joy of seeing me fall and being smashed and mangled on the steel and concrete far below i had been very afraid im no hero when i see that death is certain when my murder is certain nor do i believe anyone else is i had been close to physical paralysis with that fear and that numbness had extended to the mind but now the petrifaction of body and mind vanished in a suddenly overwhelming warm flood of pure anger anger that my life and the fate of mary should be at the mercy of the whims of a subhuman creature like this i remembered my knife slowly i brought together the hands behind my back until they were touching the fingers of my right hand painful still but no longer numb reached up under my left sleeve and closed on the haft of the knife henriques lifted his gun again pointing it at my head this time his lips lifted back in a snarling smile but i just kept on working away slowly till the knife was clear of the sheath it was too soon for the deaf mute to kill me yet there was still a great deal more of innocent pleasure to be extracted from his harmless game before he grew bored and blew the last whistle on me by leaning on the trigger henriques lowered the gun a second time shifted slightly to lock his ankles even more securely under the girder and dug into his jacket pocket with his left hand he brought out a packet of cigarettes and a book of matches he was smiling like a crazy man because this was the zenith the towering pinnacle of refinement of torture the killer taking his luxuriantly insolent ease while the trembling terrorstricken victim waits not knowing when the last moment will come but knowing it must inevitably come and hed thought it all up by himself he got a cigarette into his mouth bent over a match to strike it the gun was still in his right hand the match flared and for half a second of time he was blind steel flickered and gleamed briefly in the weak backwash of light and henriques coughed the knife buried itself to the hilt in the base of his throat he jerked violently arching over backwards as if a heavy electric shock had passed through the steel girder the gun flew from his hand and curved earthwards in a long crazy curve it seemed to take an age to fall and i couldnt look away from it i didnt see it land but i saw sparks on the line below as steel struck steel i looked back at henriques hed straightened and bent slightly forward and was staring at me in perplexity his right hand reached up and pulled the knife clear and in a moment his shirt front was saturated in the pumping blood his face twisted in a snarl a snarl already tinged with approaching dissolution and he raised his right hand up and back over his shoulder the blade no longer gleamed in the lamplight he leaned back to give impetus to his throw and then tiredness came into the dark and evil face and the knife slipped from his dying hand and clattered to the concrete below the eyes closed and he slipped to one side slipped right over until he was beneath the girder and held only by his locked ankles how long he hung like that i couldnt later say it seemed a very long time and then at last in a weird slowmotion sequence the ankles slowly unlocked and he fell from sight i didnt see him fall i couldnt see him fall but when at last i did look i saw him far below his broken body hanging limply over the gleaming ram of a gigantic hydraulic buffer for henriques sake wherever he was now i hoped the shades of his victims werent waiting for him i became vaguely aware that my cheek muscles were aching i had been smiling down at the dead man i had never felt less like smiling sick and dizzy and trembling like an old man with the ague i made my way back across the girder by crawling on my hands and knees i took me a long time i think and never be clear how i managed the six foot jump from girder to platform even although it was easier this time for the chain was there for my hands to catch i staggered through the grille door to the fireescape and halflowered myself halfcollapsed on to the platform the night air of london had never smelled so sweet how long i lay there i dont know i cant remember whether i was conscious or not most of the time but it couldnt have been long for when i looked at my watch it was still only ten minutes to four i pushed myself to my feet and made my way wearily down the fireescape when i reached street level i didnt even bother looking for my webley it might have taken me long enough to find it and the chances were that some part of its mechanism had been damaged in its long fall i would have been very surprised if the guard id disposed of hadnt been carrying a gun i wasnt surprised i didnt know what make of automatic it was but it had a trigger and safety catch in the usual position and that was all i wanted i started to climb the fireescape again i made the last two flights to the roof of the station on my hands and knees not from the need of stealth or secrecy i just couldnt make it any other way i was as far through as that i rested for a bit with my back to the wall of the passenger lounge then walked slowly across the concrete to the hangar in the far corner a faint wash of light shone weakly through the open doors it would be invisible from below for the hangar doors opened on to the centre of the heliport the light came not from the hangar itself but from what was inside it the big twentyfourseater voland helicopter that the intercity flights were now operating on their new routes i could see the control cabin thrust away over the nose of the helicopter and it was from there that the light was coming i could see the head and shoulders of the pilot hatless and in a grey uniform jacket in the lefthand seat in the righthand seat sat dr oregon circling the hangar i came to the side door and pushed it back slowly on its oiled tracks it made no sound the base of the short flight of portable steps leading up to the open passenger door in the centre of the helicopters fuselage was less than twenty feet away i pulled the automatic safetycatch off from my coat pocket and crossed to the steps if you could have heard a blade of grass growing then you could have heard me going up those steps the passenger cabin was also lit but the illumination was poor one single overhead lamp in line with the door i poked my head cautiously through the doorway and there not three feet away sitting with wrists bound to the armrests of the first of the backwardfacing seats was mary the bruise above her eye had swollen to duckegg proportions her face was scratched and deathly pale but she was wide awake and staring directly at me and she recognised me with my sootblackened and battered face i must have looked like a man from mars one moreover whos just managed to walk away from the smashedup remains of his flying saucer but she recognised me immediately her lips parted her eyes stared wide and i at once raised finger to mouth in the ageold gesture of silence but i was too late i was a lifetime too late she had been sitting there in the black thrall of a hopeless and defeated misery and grief with the bottom dropped from her life and nothing left to live for and now her husband whom she surely knew to be dead had returned from the land of the dead and the world was going to be all right again and if she had not reacted immediately and instinctively then she would not have been human pierre her voice was part shock part hope all wonder and joy oh pierre i wasnt looking at her my eyes were on one place only the entrance to the pilots cabin so was my gun from up front came the sound of a dull blow then gregori appeared one hand clutching a gun the other above his head to steady himself as he peered through the low archway the eyes were narrowed but the rest of the face still and cold the gun curiously was hanging by his side i shifted mine slightly till it centred on his forehead and increased the tension on the trigger the end of the road scarlatti i said and the end of my long wait for you therell be nobody coming here tonight only me scarlatti only me chapter thirteen cavell gregori hadnt realised who i was until i had spoken and now the swarthy face paled and he stared at me like a man seeing a ghost which for gregori was exactly what i was cavell its impossible dont you wish it were scarlatti into the cabin and dont try lifting that gun scarlatti he didnt seem to have heard my order the second shock had staggered his mind already reeling from the first he whispered how do you know five hours since interpol and the fbi gave us your life history and quite a history it is enzo scarlatti onetime graduate research chemist who became the bigtime czar of american crime in the midwest extortion robberies killings machines drugs the lot the great kingpin and they could never lay a finger on you but they got you in the end didnt they scarlatti the usual incometax evasion and then they deported you i advanced two paces towards him i didnt want mary in the line of fire when the war started right into the cabin scarlatti he was still staring at me but his face underwent a subtle change the mans resilience his powers of mental recuperation were fantastic he said slowly we must talk about this later inside now or drop you where you stand no you wont youd like to but not yet i know when i look at death cavell im looking at death now you wish me to come and sit down in a chair and then you will kill me but not until i am in that chair will you kill me i took another step towards him and his left hand came into view this is what you are frightened of isnt it cavell you were afraid that i might have one of those in my hand or on my person that would smash when i fell isnt mat it cavell that was it indeed i stared down at the ampoule in his hand the little glass vial and the sealed blue plastic top he went on his face strained and tight i think you had better put that gun down cavell not this time as long as i have this gun pointing between your eyes you wont try anything the moment i put it down you let me have it with your own gun and i know now what i didnt know before you wont use that ampoule i thought you were insane scarlatti but i know now you were only using the threat of insanity to terrify us into doing what you wanted but i know you now and i know your record you may be crazy but youre crazy like a fox youre as sane as i am you wont use that thing you value your own life the success of your plans too much wrong cavell ill use it and i do value my life he glanced quickly over his shoulder and then turned back to me eight months now since i entered mordon i could have had the vaccine out any time i liked but i waited why i waited till baxter and macdonald had successfully developed an attenuated strain of the satan bug a strain still deadlier than the botulinus toxin but with an oxidisation life of only twentyfour hours i waited till they had come across the precise combinations of heat phenol formalin and ultraviolet to produce a killer vaccine for this weakened strain he held the vial between finger and thumb in this glass the attenuated satan bug in my bloodstream the inactivated microorganisms we have produced against it the cyanide was a bluff i dont need cyanide you will understand why baxter had to die he knew about the new virus and vaccine i understood you will understand also that i am not afraid to use it i will he broke off the swarthy face suddenly cold and grim what was that id heard it too two short bursts of harshly metallic sound like a riveters gun only five times as fast why dont you know that was the merlin mark scarlatti the new type of rapidfire machine carbine issued to nato forces i looked at him consideringly didnt you hear what i said theres no one else coming tonight only me what are you saying he whispered i could see his knuckles whiten as his left hand clenched involuntarily over the glass vial what are you talking about about all your friends that wont be seeing their homes again for many years to come about all the scum the top scum admittedly of the criminal world who have vanished so mysteriously in recent weeks from their haunts in london america france and italy all the top specialists in oxyacetylene work nitroglycerine combination twiddling and what have you the worlds best at blowing and opening vaults and safes we knew weeks ago from interpol that those men had disappeared we did not know that they had all been assembled together in the same place here in london the dark glowing eyes stared into mine the breath whistled thinly between his teeth his face was like a wolfs the fbi regard you as the best planner and organiser theyve been up against since the war scarlatti its quite a compliment isnt it but deserved you had us all fooled this insistence on knocking down mordon this demonstration of the botulinus drug in east anglia this pretence that you were unaware that three of the vials you had stolen were of the satan bug strain this apparent ignorance of the effects of the satan bug you had us all convinced that we were dealing with a madman we were sure that this threat against the square mile of london was to achieve the destruction of mordon to satisfy the whims of a lunatic then we thought it was part of a communist plot to destroy our last but most powerful line of defence it was only a few hours ago that we realised that this threat against the heart of london had one purpose and one purpose only to empty the heart of london to evacuate it so that not one person remained in this small area of london are a score of the greatest banks in the world banks bulging with the negotiable currencies of fifty nations banks with fortunes in bullion banks with safedeposits containing jewels that would ransom a dozen millionaires and you were going to take the lot werent you scarlatti your men and equipment have been hidden in empty buildings or innocentseeming vans since last evening all they had to do was to walk into the banks during the hours of darkness after the last man had vanished there would be no trouble every one of those banks has a double security system guards and automatic alarms that ring in any of the local police stations but the guards had to leave hadnt they they didnt want to die from botulinus toxin as for the burglar alarms some of your men with access to the electricity boards wiring diagrams that would cause no trouble pulled the switches blew the fuses tripped the overload coils or cut the cables supplying electric power to this area which is why the city is in darkness which is why no alarm bells would ring in the police stations youre with me scarlatti he was with me all right his face was masked in hatred after that it was easy i went on i suppose you kidnapped that poor devil of a pilot earlier in the day you bring the stuff here load it aboard the helicopter and make a fast takeoff for the continent it was the only way you knew the entire area would be cordoned off and that there would be no other way to get the stuff out your men would just stay put until the scare was over mingle with the returning crowds and disappear as for the banks no one would find out anything till at least three oclock this coming afternoon which will be the earliest that people would be allowed to return to the area and as this is now sunday it would probably have been monday morning before the discovery of the looted banks was made by which time you would have been a couple of continents away but not now its as i told you scarlatti this is the end of the road you mean you mean its all over mary whispered behind me its all over by ten oclock tonight long before the troops had finished clearing the area there were two hundred detectives scattered at strategic points all over the city in banks or close to banks hidden with instructions not to move before this morning its after four now its all over every single one of those men was armed with the latest merlin submachine gun loaned fromthe army with specific instructions to shoot to kill if anyone batted an eyelid that noise we heard a couple of minutes ago someone must have batted an eyelid youre lying scarlattis face was twisted and vicious and his lips were working even when he wasnt speaking he went on in a hoarse whisper youre making all this up you know better than that scarlatti you know that i know too much that is true for the rest not to b true he looked at me with murder in his eyes then said softly and savagely close the cabin door close it i say or by god ill end it all now he took two steps down the aisle the vial of the satan bug virus lifted high above his head i watched him for a moment then nodded hed nothing to lose now and i wasnt going to throw away marys life and my own not to mention the pilots over a thing like that i moved back and closed the sliding passenger door my eyes my gun never left him he took another two steps forward his left hand still high above his head and now your gun cavell now your gun not my gun scarlatti i shook my head and wondered whether he wasnt after all mad or whether he was just a magnificent actor not my gun you know that then youd kill us all while you escaped as long as i have this gun you wont escape you may smash that vial but get you before the satan bug gets me not my gun he advanced again his eyes wide and gleaming the left hand moving back as if ready to throw maybe i was wrong maybe he was crazy your gun he screamed now i shook my head again he said something in a high wild voice and his left hand came arching over his shoulder the back of his hand facing me instead of the front as i would have expected darkness flooded the cabin as his bunched fist smashed the single overhead light a darkness momentarily illuminated by two stabs of orange flames as i squeezed the trigger twice an illumination and reverberating roar followed by darkness again and sudden silence and in the sudden silence a gasp of pain from mary and scarlatti saying my gun is in your wifes throat cavell she is about to die he hadnt been crazy after all i dropped my gun on the composition floor it clattered loudly i said you win scarlatti the main cabin switch he said by the left hand side of the door i groped found it and pulled it down the entire cabin flooded with light from a dozen lamps scarlatti pulled himself up from the seat beside mary where hed flung himself as soon as hed smashed the light lifted the gun from her neck and pointed it at me i lifted my bent arms and looked at his left hand the vial was still intact hed taken a hellish risk but it had been the only risk left to him i noticed where the upper sleeve of his left arm was torn id come pretty close to getting him and pretty close to ending it all for us too if id have hit him the vial would have been smashed but then i had thought it was going to be smashed anyway move back scarlatti said quietly his voice was controlled conversational hed won his oscar for the night and packed in the acting right to the back of the cabin i moved he came forward picked up my gun stuck the vial in his pocket and gestured with both guns the pilots cabin into it i went forward as i passed marys seat she looked up at me and smiled through the tangle of blonde hair that had fallen forward over her face her green eyes were masked in tears i smiled back as actors not even scarlatti could show us anything the pilot was slumped forward over the controls that explained the sound id heard just after mary had exclaimed at the sight of me before coming to investigate scarlatti had made sure that the pilot wouldnt be giving him any trouble the pilot was a big man with black hair and the part of his face i could see was tanned and sunlined at the back of his head a little blood oozed through the dark hair into the copilots seat scarlatti ordered wake that man up how the hell can i under the unwavering eyes of the two pistol barrels i eased myself into the seat you coshed the poor devil not hard he said hurry up i did what i could id no option i shook the pilot slapped his face gently and spoke to him but scarlatti must have hit him harder than he thought in the circumstances i thought grimly he hadnt had much time for finesse scarlatti was becoming impatient and as nervous as a cat staring out through the windscreens towards the hangar doors for all he knew there was a regiment of soldiers or police out there in the darkness he wasnt to know that id begged and pleaded with the general and hardanger to be allowed to go alone secrecy and stealth not only offering the only chance ofsaving marys life but also being far less liable to panic scarlatti into indiscriminate use of the satan bug id certainly done a great job after five minutes the pilot stirred and awoke he was as tough as he looked for he came out of the unconsciousness fighting mad and it was all i could do to hold him off until the ungentle nudging on the back of his neck from scarlattis pistol let him know he was picking on the wrong man he twisted round in his seat recognised scarlatti and said a few words to him that left no doubt but that he came from the other side of the irish sea what he had to say was interesting but irrelevant and unprintable he broke off when scarlatti stuck the barrel of a pistol into his face scarlatti had an unpleasant habit of sticking pistol barrels into peoples faces but he was too old to be cured of it by now get this helicopter airborne scarlatti ordered now airborne i protested hes not fit to walk far less fly scarlatti prodded him again you heard me hurry i cant the pilot was sullen and savage at the same moment it has to be towed out cant start the engines in here exhaust fumes and fire regulations the hell with your regulations scarlatti said she can roll under her own power dont you think i checked you fool get moving the pilot had no option and he knew it he started his engines and i winced as the deafening clamour echoed back at us from the narrow metallic confines of the hangar walls the pilot couldnt have liked it any more than i did either that or he knew it was dangerous to linger whatever the reason he lost no time he engaged the two giant rotors moved the cyclic pitch to tilt the blades forwards and downwards and released the brakes the helicopter began to roll thirty seconds later we were airborne scarlatti more relaxed now reached for a rack above his head and handed me a square metal box he reached again and this time brought down an ordinary closemesh string bag open the box and transfer the contents into this bag he said curtly i advise you to be careful you will see why i saw why and i was very careful i opened the box and there packed in straw lay five chromed steel flasks under his direction i opened each in turn and with infinite gentleness laid five glass ampoules inside the net bag two with blue tops two vials of the satan bug three with red tops three vials of botulinus toxin scarlatti handed me another bluetopped vial from his pocket that made six altogether i placed that in also gingerly gathered up the string bag and handed it back to scarlatti it was cold inside that cabin but i was sweating as if i were in a steam bath and it took an effort of will to keep my hands steady i caught a glimpse of the pilot looking at the bag and i cant say he looked any happier than i felt he knew all right excellent scarlatti took the bag from me reached back into the passenger aisle and placed the bag on the nearest seat you will be able to convince our friends that i am not only willing but ready to carry out my threat i dont know what you are talking about you will i want you to make a radio call and get in touch with your fatherinlaw and then give him a message he turned to the pilot you will keep circling above the heliport we will be returning there shortly i said i dont know how to operate the damned radio youve just forgotten he said soothingly he was getting too confident of himself for my liking you will remember a man who has spent his life in his countrys intelligence service and cannot operate a transmitter if i take a walk back into the passenger cabin and you hear your wife scream do you think you will remember then what do you want me to do i asked savagely get on the police wavelength i dont know what it is but youre bound to tell them that unless they immediately release all my captured men and the money they have i shall be compelled to drop botulinus and satan bug toxins over london i have no idea where they will fall nor do i greatly care further if any attempt is made to follow trace or capture me or my men i shall use toxin regardless of consequences do you see a flaw cavell i said nothing at once i stared ahead through the highspeed windscreen wipers into the rain and darkness finally i said i see no flaw im a desperate man cavell he said with quiet intensity when they deported me from america they thought i was completely finished completely a hasbeen i was laughed out of america i was and am determined to show them all how wrong they were to bring off the biggest criminal coup of all time when you intercepted us in that police car this evening much that i said was false but this one thing was true i shall achieve this ambition regardless of cost or shall die trying i am not acting now nothing is going to stop me nothing on this earth is going to thwart me at this very last moment they should not have laughed at enzo scarlatti i am in the most deadly earnest cavell you believe me i believe you i shall not hesitate to do exactly as i threaten you must convince them of that youve convinced me i said i cant speak for the others ill try you had better succeed he said evenly i succeeded after a few minutes twiddling and dialtwisting i managed to get through on the police wavelength there was a further delay while the call was relayed and rerouted by phone and then i heard superintendent hardangers voice cavell here i said im in a helicopter with helicopter he swore i can hear the damn thing almost directly above what in gods name listen im here with mary and a pilot of the intercity lines a lieutenant i glanced at the man beside me buckley he said harshly lieutenant buckley scarlatti has the drop on us all hes got a message for you for the general so you fouled things up cavell hardanger said savagely god above i warned you shut up i said wearily this is his message youd better listen i told them what id been told to say and after a pause the generals voice came through on the earphones no reproaches no timewasting he said what chance that hes bluffing not one in the world hes in deadly earnest hell wipe out half the city sooner than fail whats all the banknotes and bullion in the world compared to a million lives you sound as though you were afraid the generals voice came softly im afraid sir not just for myself i understand ill call back in a few minutes i removed the earphones i said a few minutes he has to consult that is understandable he was leaning back negligently now one shoulder against the doorway but the guns as steady as ever he hadnt the shadow of a doubt about the outcome now i hold all the cards cavell he wasnt exaggerating any he held all the cards all right they couldnt afford not to let him win but far back in my mind was the first stirrings of hope that he might yet lose the last trick of all a despairing one in a million hope but then i was a man in the extremes of despair and willing to gamble on a one in a million chance and it would all depend upon so many imponderable factors scarlattis state of mind the confidence and fractional lowering of relaxation that might just might come with the knowledge that the day was finally his lieutenant buckleys acuteness intelligence and cooperation and my speed of reaction the last was the biggest if of all the way i felt if scarlatti could cope with an ailing nonagenarian then he shouldnt have much trouble with me the earphones crackled i slipped them on and the generals voice came through he said without preamble tell scarlatti we agree yes sir im most desperately sorry about it all you did what you could thats over our first concern now must be to save the innocent not to punish the guilty one of the earphones was knocked forward none too gently and scarlatti said well well he agrees i said wearily good id expected nothing else find out how long the release of my men and money will take when the police would expect to be clear of the area i asked and told him the answer half an hour again excellent switch off that radio we shall cruise around for that length of time and then descend he leaned back comfortably against the doorway and for the first time permitted himself to smile a small holdup in the execution of my plans cavell but the ultimate results will be the same i cannot tell you how much i look forward to seeing tomorrows headlines in all the american newspapers which so contemptuously wrote me off as a nonentity and washedup hasbeen when i was deported two years ago it will be interesting to see how they set about eating their words i swore at him without enthusiasm and he smiled again the more he smiled the better for me i hoped i slumped down in my seat huddled in bitter dejection and said sullenly any objection if i smoke none at all he put one pistol in his pocket and handed me cigarettes and matches with my compliments cavell i dont carry exploding cigars around with me i growled i dont suppose you do he smiled again he was really going to town tonight you know cavell bringing this off gives me an immense satisfaction but almost as much i get from outwitting an opponent like yourself you have given me more trouble and more nearly caused my downfall than any man i have ever met except the income tax inspectors of america i said go to hell scarlatti he laughed i drew heavily on my cigarette and at that moment the helicopter shuddered slightly as it lifted over some rising current of warmer air this was my opening i twisted in my seat and said to scarlatti halfpeevishly halfnervously i wish to god youd sit down or hang on to something if this chopper hits an airpocket you might be thrown back on top of those damn toxins relax friend he said comfortably he leaned his back against the doorway and crossed his legs you dont get airpockets in weather like this but i wasnt really listening to him and i certainly wasnt looking at him i was looking at buckley and then i saw buckley looking at me not a movement of the head just a sideways shift of the eyes that scarlatti behind him couldnt see he lowered one eyelid in a low wink no question the big irishman caught on fast he dropped one hand negligently from the controls and laid it on his leg he rubbed his hand down his thigh till the fingers stretched out horizontally over his kneecap and then his fingers dipped sharply into a vertical position i nodded twice slowly staring out the windscreen so as not to give any significance to the action it wouldnt have meant anything to even the most suspicious and by now scarlatti was too confident and content to go looking for signs of trouble where none existed he wouldnt be the first man who relaxed too much when the game seemed overwhelmingly as good as won and finished up at the losing end when the final whistle blew i glanced at buckley and saw his lips frame the word now i nodded a third time and braced myself out of the corner of my eye i saw scarlatti shift his position slightly as buckley eased the helicopter a fraction upwards his legs were still crossed suddenly buckley thrust the cyclic pitch right forward at the same time banking heavily and scarlatticompletely offbalance pitched headlong forwards almost directly on top of me id twisted and halfrisen to my feet as he came lurching towards me my roundhouse right caught him a fraction too high just on the breastbone and his guns went flying wildly to clatter against instrument panel and windscreen scarlatti went berserk not viciously fighting mad but completely berserk knees feet teeth fists head elbows he used the lot on me smashiing me back in my seat and utterly ignoring the blows rained on him in return he growled and screamed alternately like some wounded animal battering at me with frightening power and speed and with everything he could bring to bear i was twenty years younger and twenty pounds heavier but i couldnt even begin to hold him i felt the blood begin to hiss dangerously in my ears my chest felt as if a giant vice were crushing it in half and then seconds before i knew i was going to pass out tee insensate battering suddenly stopped and he was gone dazed bleeding halfcrazed with pain i tore myself out of the seat and went after him the helicopter was still in its dive and scarlatti was scrambling desperately up the aisle pulling at the seats to give him purchase against the force of gravity and he could use only one hand the other held the bag with the botulinus and satan bug viruses momentarily crazed scarlatti may have been almost certainly was but there was still one corner of his mind working he could no longer threaten us directly with the satan bug for seconds after the release of the viruses the helicopter with a dead pilot at the controls would have crashed into the streets of london with scarlatti the only person left alive aboard it hopelessly trapped he reached the door before i was halfway up the aisle he grabbed the handle and tried to slide it open but found it impossible against the pull of the plummeting plane he braced his feet against the seat next to marys and hauled with all the power he had his swarthy face crimsoning with the effort slowly inexorably the door began to slide open and i was still six feet away then abruptly the floor levelled as buckley brought the craft back on even keel the door flew open and scarlatti staggered and fell a second later i was on him i wasnt worried about scarlatti i was worried about what he held in his hand i tore it from him viciously hearing one of his fingers break as it was caught in the mesh then hed leapt to his feet and i was fighting for my life and fighting for it with one hand he was silent now his face the face of a madman and he was going to kill me he caught me by the throat shoved me violently backwards i thrust my left foot behind to gain enough purchase on the side of the cabin to thrust him off and mary screamed my foot met no resistance there was nothing behind me only the open door instantly i flung wide both arms and stiffened my back and shoulders both forearms smashed with cruel force against the raised metal edges of the doorway and the upper edge was like a guillotine against the back of my neck momentarily the world was a red haze shot through with blinding flashes of light and then it cleared mary sitting in the doorway seat just beside us was staring at me with terrorstricken eyes green and enormous in the deadwhite face and scarlatti still had me by the throat his face was inches from mine i warned you cavell he shouted hoarsely i warned you therell be a million dead tomorrow cavell a million dead and you killed them you not me he sobbed sunk his hooked fingers deeper into my throat and started to thrust me out into the sky and the darkness there was nothing i could do i couldnt even use one of my hands to fight him off take away any one point of my supports and id be through that doorway in front of me was scarlattis face and whatever he had been in the past i knew he was insane now my rigidly outthrust arms were beginning to bend inwards at the shoulders rubbing along the raised metal edges of the door and my shoulders were afire with agony as scarlatti thrust me farther and farther out into the darkness i could feel the cold wind rushing by the rain drumming against my back and side with the force of a howling storm this was the way some people die i tried to open my left hand so as at least not to take the satan bug down with me when i fell but i couldnt even do that my fingers were caught in the meshes and jammed against the metal it was then that mary broke through her terrorridden thrall she was tied to the arms of her seat but her feet were free and suddenly she jackknifed herself and kicked up with both legs with all the strength that was hi her she was wearing italian shoes and for the first time in my life i put up a prayer of thanksgiving for those sharply pointed monstrosities scarlatti cried out with pain as they caught him just behind the right knee his leg sagged and for the one moment that was the only moment i would ever have his grip on my throat slackened with a convulsive jerk of arms and neck i braced myself forward my left leg swinging high and he staggered backward and then i was clear of the door chopping aside his snarling crouched figure as i passed him and ran up the aisle i didnt run far buckley was coming through the doorway at the other end a gun in his hands i wondered dimly what in the name of god had kept him until now it shouldnt have taken more than ten seconds to set the helicopter on automatic pilot and scrabble around for a gun after hed straightened out and then i realised that no more time than that had passed since he had straightened out the helicopter it had only seemed like an eternity that was all he saw me coming threw the gun to me i caught it taking care even at that moment not to let it strike anywhere near the viruses i whirled gun in hand but scarlatti wasnt coming for me any more he was standing quietly by the doorway still doubled over with pain his eyes were on me but they didnt seem crazed any more he straightened slowly and said dont bother to fire cavell i wont fire i said end of a dream he said conversationally he was standing close to the doorway the wind and the rain were driving in hard against him but he didnt even seem to notice it maybe this is the way the dreams of people like myself always end he paused then looked at me almost quizzically you never really expected to see me in the old bailey no i said i never really expected it can you see a man like me on trial for my life he persisted i cant see it i said he nodded as if in satisfaction he took a step nearer the open doorway then turned again but it would have been nice he said to see what they would have said in the new york times his voice was almost sad then he turned away and stepped out into the darkness i cut mary loose and chafed the blood back into her hands while buckley went forward to contact the police and call off their flying squad cars after a few minutes we both went forward as buckley drifted down towards the heliport and i picked up the phones the general said so she is safe yes sir shes safe and scarlatti is gone thats it sir scarlatti is gone he just stepped out of the plane hardangers voice broke in harsh and gravelly as ever did he fall or was he pushed he fell i hung lip the phones i knew they would never believe me the end
