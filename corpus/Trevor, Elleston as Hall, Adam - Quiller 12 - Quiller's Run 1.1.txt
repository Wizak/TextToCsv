quiller is back on a freelance mission in southeast asia probing the shadowy secrets of a deadly arms deal shoda little kiss of steel the enigmatic and ruthless cambodian beauty becomes his most deadly opponent their duel takes them from the teeming backstreets of singapore to the dense jungles of cambodia but the true battleground is in the mind and never has quiller been closer to the edge adam hall quillers run smoke the whole place was tight with tension when i got there people huddled in hushed groups along the corridors and hanging around the signals room croder standing outside codes and cyphers with one of the cryptologists his eyes pinning the poor bastard against the wall and his voice like a knife being sharpened then why the hell didnt you get me on the phone i dont care what time it was you ought to know that by now i went on past them and thought for gods sake if graders lost his cool then something big must have blown and the fallout was still coming down but the thing was the thing was you know i couldnt have cared less loman had asked me to meet him at six in his office but he wasnt there and i had to stand listening to radcliffe talking on the phone with his mouth tight and his face pasty under the lights tensing is no longer in service he glanced up at me and gave a nod and went on talking no officially were calling it suicide now that was spelling it out wasnt it not pretty but at least honest no longer in service was one of those coy little euphemisms coined by the bureaucrats on the third floor why couldnt they put us down in the records as dead when we came unstuck or was there something offensive about the idea something not quite nice not to be talked about of course we are his pale fingertips drumming on the desk weve called howatch in from belgrade and johns from rome and theyre trying to locate hockridge through his director in the field i stood with my raincoat dripping itd been drizzling the whole day again bloody spring for you theyd called johns in what on earth for the last id heard of him hed been passing the hat round to the sleeper agents right across the communist bloc for any leftover scraps of information they could give him because thered been five redsector contacts supporting sable one when it had come apart and left them terminally exposed as those snottynosed twits on the third floor called it no radcliffe said hes still unaccounted for i got fed up with waiting and went outside and along the corridor to see if i could find loman anywhere and if i couldnt id check back at his office and if he still wasnt there he could go to hell but when i got to the stairwell i saw him standing against the banisters on the floor above talking to someone then he suddenly looked down and saw me i stood with my hands in the pockets of my raincoat staring up at him waiting if the bastard wanted to talk hed have to do it now calthrop was with him and they came down the stairs together im sorry i wasnt in my office loman said but theres a lot going on short dapper smelling of shoepolish i could have killed him on the spot and he knew that lets go in here shall we it was a room next to the janitors closet no number on the door no name just like all the other doors in this anonymous building no one was in here it was used to store things in by the look of it empty filing cabinets and some worn leather armchairs and a coffee urn inside a torn cardboard box someones bike with the tyres flat and the chain hanging slack loman shut the door and turned to look at me it was good of you to come i didnt answer didnt look at either of them calthrop was here i knew in case loman needed protection he might the room was quiet with only the rain dripping on the windowsill outside why dont we take a pew calthrop very smooth almost jolly pouring lots of oil he slapped the dust off one of the armchairs and dropped into it crossing his legs looking up at me with an amiable smile loman went to sit down but stopped when he saw i hadnt moved we feel we owe you an apology quiller we er deeply regret the circumstances that obviously prompted you to hand in your resignation and very much hope youll reconsider the rain dripped dripped on the windowsill from his chair calthrop added gently you mustnt think youre not still among friends you know were friends loman flinched though i hadnt shouted or anything he recovered fast annoyed with his show of nerves oh come now you know perfectly well that every shadow executive has to be considered expendable in justifiable circumstances after all you signed the clearance forms as usual before the mission his face made me sick and i turned away and looked at a picture on the wall instead a faded photograph behind cracked glass the queen at the trooping of the colour sidesaddle upright plumed and in full scarlet there was a dead moth lying on the top edge of the frame when i was ready i turned back and looked at loman again with a dead stare yes i signed the forms i said it quietly but he knew my ability to keep control to contain even rage if i had to with none of it reaching the eyes its what they expect of us isnt it the shadow executives total control were required to behave like deadly reptiles out there in the field and then turn up here at the bureau and comport ourselves like civilised people and we do i signed the forms i also defused the bomb and if id known youd had it planted for me i would have brought it all the way home at the end of the mission and blown this whole fucking building apart loman turned and took a pace or two with his bright polished shoes his black onyx cufflinks glinting under the light his short arms held behind him the necessity he said thinly was agreed upon and at the highest level as you may well imagine the fate of nations was at stake we its always at stake thats the type of operation you always give me he shrugged there was the risk of your breaking under interrogation if you were caught i had a capsule we can never be absolutely sure of course he shrugged again that well use it quite so do you know how many missions ive completed i acknowledge your experience but youve directed me in the field yourself thats correct i took a step towards him and did you find me to be the type of spineless wimp who wouldnt even suck on a peck of cyanide to protect the mission did you the cracked glass of the picture on the wall vibrated and the little bastard flinched again and i felt sudden compassion for him because he was locked into a system that sometimes demanded that control deliberately condemned a firstclass shadow executive to death somewhere out there where the people in london couldnt see him where they couldnt in fact make absolutely certain that his death was essential with no choice but to order it done and cut off a career and leave a corpse somewhere in hostile territory where itd be found and treated as trash and tossed onto a rubbish dump a feast for rats but there was one thing worse perhaps even worse for the people in london and that was to have the intended dead come back alive and curse them to their face we have to do loman said in a moment what we have to do i didnt answer that calthrop spoke gently on what terms quiller would you perhaps consider staying on none loman said we would offer you rather good ones quiller your sole discretion for instance as to backups shields signals liaison contacts and so on i didnt say anything calthrop took over smoothly including your presence at mission planning with chief of control and of course he tried to soften the crudeness of the next titbit with an apologetic smile a more appropriate retainer the rain dripped on the windowsill how appropriate calthrop glanced at loman who said quickly double what makes me so valuable suddenly considering you tried to get my guts blown into christendom out there in russia loman looked trapped but got out fast im sure the directorate would feel as indeed we do that some measure of compensation would be in order after all they bullshit you think theyd try and buy me back i wouldnt put it quite if you left the bureau calthrop cut in quickly what would you do have you thought of that theres a life outside this bloody place dont worry for someone like you yes you wont find it easy loman took over and once youve gone we can never ask you back thats a bloody shame i took a step towards him and i suppose there was something in my eyes now that made him inch back before he could stop himself you could never send me into another mission with any guarantee that you wouldnt do the same thing again if you had to so id always be looking behind me for some bastard with a knife or a bomb and it wouldnt work ive got to know where my friends are and ive none here theyre outside and thats where im going i went to the door and heard the creak of leather as calthrop got out of his chair quitter i turned to look at him and he brushed the air with his hand sorry i pulled the door open and it swung wide and hit the rubber stop with a little thump as i went into the hall on my way through the building to the rear exit i tried to avoid people but charlie saw me through the doorway of the caff i thought youd chucked it in i went over to him in case he tried to get up his last mission had left him with a smashed thigh and a few other things just covering traces youd never be sure would you charlie said a burned hand hooked round the teacup of what never be sure they wouldnt try it again thats it exactly i touched his shoulder and went out to the corridor again michalina was going into signals with a file but she didnt see me a door came open near the staircase and holmes came out passing me absently and then stopping looking back someone said youd resigned yes youll go mad out there that should be interesting i went to the end of the passage and through the narrow doorway of the screened rear exit into whitehall and splashed through the puddles on my way to the jensen not looking back at the building not looking back at anything at all as i got into the car and started up and took it westwards through kensington and chiswick and out to the m turning the phone off and switching the wipers to high and flipping the radarscope on pulling the slack out of the seatharness and letting it snap back putting the lights onto high beam with nothing in front of me now but the steelgrey veil of the rain as i pushed the throttle down and kept it there wanting only to put distance between myself and london and the bitter acrid smoke of a burned boat the worm i cant she said ive got to be up bright and early are you flying not till noon she kissed me for the last time her hair falling across my face cool and scented then why not stay the night ive got an interview at nine im trying to get onto concorde wouldnt that be fantastic i mean apart from the pay id have the name on my uniform all the other crews look when you go through the airport talk about prestige she slipped off the bed and looked across the room which door is it that one guest towels on the left god i can hardly stand up are you normally like that no it was the way you kissed she stood looking down at me the light from the street catching the sweat on her skin turning it to satin i always kiss like that but it doesnt normally set up a tornado then it should she stood smoothing her thighs maybe considering staying that would be all right i was feeling intolerably lonely what are all those bruises shed only just noticed them i looped a motor sounds expensive if youll stay ill cook up some eggs and bacon thats not what id stay for but anyway i cant tomorrows the chance of a lifetime on her way to the bathroom she said over her shoulder but im based in london i got off the bed and put some clothes on with strange thoughts coming into my mind should i look for someone to marry now someone like this girl settle down open some kind of business id been getting ideas like those since last night when id got back to london in a hired porsche but they were alien to me not because a wife and a normal job wouldnt give me a certain amount of satisfaction but because ideas like that belonged to other people not to me it was like having a total stranger trying to get inside my head and if i started to lose my sense of identity i could finish up in the funny farm youll go mad out there holmes and possibly that was what i was doing but marriage wouldnt work or a normal life i had to have absolute freedom satisfaction wouldnt be enough i wanted risk occasional terror life at the brink and you couldnt share a life like that with anyone what do you do she asked me when she came out of the bathroom im between jobs are you an actor she was watching me in the mirror no theres something different about you she combed her long hair and then began putting it up into a chignon i mean you looked after me absolutely marvellously in the restaurant but i had the feeling that there was something on tout mind all the time have you been fired close i resigned leave what from government work terribly dull leave your number will you if you like it was gone midnight when we went down to the street the rain had stopped at last and i managed to flag down a cab straight away i hope you get the concorde job god so do i imagine she reached up and we kissed while the cabs diesel went on idling thanks for such a good time martin give me a ring if you feel like it ill be back in london next week next tuesday the flat felt deserted when i went back which was odd because i normally enjoyed its space and its silence shed scribbled her phone number on the back of a british airways check slip it was lying on the dressing table under the lamp next to a blond tangle of hairs and i picked it up and tore it in half and then in quarters dropping them into the wastepaper basket and turning off the lamp i wouldnt be in london next week next tuesday god knew where id be but it wouldnt be here well well it was pepperidge hunched over the bar with a glass of mescal in front of him the worm curled at the bottom i didnt want to talk to him or anyone else id come to the brass lamp to be alone as a change from being alone in the flat but i couldnt just walk away now that hed seen me i asked the man for a tonic and bitters and looked at pepperidge how are things he squinted under the brassshaded light i suppose theyll work out somehow i hadnt seen him for months he specialised in picking up classified info at ground level cryptographic key lists and cards message traffic communications data operations orders whatever he could get working mostly at the asian desk at the bureau what happened i asked him bastards fired me he watched me with cynical eyes his thin hair lying untidily across his scalp his moustache at a kind of angle sloppily trimmed his shoulders hunched im like you old boy sometimes i wont obey orders his hand shook a little as he picked up his drink and i dont regret it you know that i dont bloody well regret it is that all youre going to drink for the moment he sat gazing into his small amber glass for the moment i suppose that means youre working not really i walked out he swung his head up to squint at me with his yellow eyes taking time to focus walked out a little disagreement i didnt want to talk about it the whole thing had been tearing at my mind for the last ten days like a pack of dogs walked out of the bureau it can happen to anyone for christs sake he went on watching me but youre one of their top shadows tell me about yourself he ignored that youll go back of course i mean after a while wont you no i picked up my drink id give him another three minutes for old times sake and then out when did you leave he asked me ten days ago you must have been going mad probably thats what i shouldve done before they had a chance to fire me i know what it feels like i mean i know what it feels like to me whats it feel like to you none too funny arent you afraid of swallowing that bloody thing he looked into his drink rather fondly but i always do old boy hes my little friend you see poor little perisher died of drink and you know something so will i eventually he straightened up on the stool making an effort glancing across my eyes of course i dont really mean that but christ you know what i did the day i walked out of there i put down half a bottle of black label and went along to the funfair and bought every bloody seat on the rollercoaster and tried to see if i could hop from the front to the back before it came in again fucking near fell off theres a really rotten bend on that thing the next day i took a up there with me and had a go at shooting out the bulbs on the tower in the middle got most of them arrested me for public endangerment or some such thing he gave a short laugh that turned into a cough you should do something like that you know get it out of your system i did jolly good show stick a pisspot on top of the palace gates or something ive always wanted to do that you know nothing so fancy the cop hadnt been able to put the actual speed down on the ticket because the needle in the jensen had been tight against the mark when the front end had started aquaplaning on the wet road somewhere past windsor and the whole thing had taken off id been lucky the cop had found me there was a bit of concussion involved i suppose scobies after you is he what scobie yes id got the letter a week ago three days after id left the bureau scobie worked fast there was an official crest at the top of the paper and the name of a department which didnt in fact exist coordination staff foreign and commonwealth office it has been suggested to me that you might be interested in a discussion with us about appointments in government service in the field in foreign affairs which occasionally arise in addition to those covered by the diplomatic service grades and the letter was signed illegibly over the title recruiting officer scobie ran an undercover staffing operation for the british secret intelligence service from warwick square and hed picked up the vibrations at once when id walked out of the bureau the next thing would be an invitation to lunch at the travellers club in st james to sound me out you wont take up with that gang of course pepperidge was watching me steadily now will you not really too much bloody red tape he finished his drink and i looked away hes my little friend you see but then where else is there there is nowhere of course or i wouldnt be sitting here sitting here wishing to christ he squeezed his eyes shut and sat rocking gently on his stool for almost half a minute then let his shoulders go slack and gave a short laugh wishing to christ i wasnt because i had an offer too not from scobie he swung his head to look for the barman not from scobie same again mr pepperidge yes that is to say no he looked into the shadows behind him and touched my arm lets go and sit over there every table had a small brass lamp on it burning dimly between them it was almost dark you didnt come here to be seen or to see anyone i nearly said id got to go but changed my mind in case there was any small thing i could do for him because in the last ten minutes id been chilled appalled pepperidge had been first class in the field before hed come home to the asian desk hed never touched booze hed kept in training at norfolk and he could take on anything they gave him a totally shutended checkpoint situation without papers or contacts and get away with it he could stalk infiltrate kill if he had to and get out with the product ferris had run him in sapphire croder had run him in foxtrot two of the major ones and now he was sitting here with his thin blue hands restless on the polished oak of the table his eyes needing time to focus his memory slow a burnout finished and not yet forty this wouldnt happen to me i knew that but id have to find a good reason for going on a new direction and it would have to take me back to the only life i could live with but there is nowhere of course pepperidge had his shoulders against the panelled wall even this dim light bothering his eyes the attempt at wry humour was done with now it had been an act id seen through and hed dropped it not from scobie no this came from cheltenham government communications hq out in the west country the nervecentre for international classified traffic so hed been keeping his ear to the ground at least it was offered to me personally he said under the desk when last week his yellow eyes watched me steadily defiance in them it surprises you of course that anyone should offer this this shipwrecked fucking sailor any kind of mission i see that i quite understand but spare me the violins i told him and finished my drink one more minute and out id joined him here at the table because the poor bastard had started talking business but it couldnt add up to anything he was just wandering in the wastelands of the lost to pick over the shreds of his pride i will spare you the violins he said with heavy articulation yes of course there was a light in his eyes now that carried a warning and i noted it but if the poor devil tried coming at me in his besotted rage id only have to subdue him and that would make things worse humiliating it so happens you see that a certain party knew of my accomplishments out east and thought this one might catch my interest its for me to accept or turn down as i think fit he sat with his back straight again watching me with a dreadful steadiness waiting to see if he was getting the message across that he was still on his feet still in the running well thoughtof then youre in clover i said and tried to make it sound genuine there was a moments silence and then he gave a kind of sob squeezing his eyes shut and just sitting there without moving his fists pressed onto the table to keep him upright their tremor conveying itself to the brass lamp and setting up a vibration then it was over not much above a whisper dont humour me you bastard spare me that aware suddenly of his clenched fists he opened them and brought his hands slowly together as if for comfort of course youre perfectly right theres no kind of action i could take on now without getting killed in a moment i said dry out somewhere im sorry go into a clinic and dry out then do a bit of training youll soon get it back yes yes of course i shall do that one day he drew a slow breath meanwhile i shall find someone to take this thing over because its too good to miss and im buggered if ill give it to the bureau they couldnt touch it anyway its too sensitive have another drink if thats what you call it ive got to be going it wasnt the first time id seen a wrecked spook pushing his doom he was only just this side of a breakdown and i didnt want to be here when he pulled something out and blew his head off with it as north had done youve only just come for gods sake he lifted a hand for the barman you know floderus dont you he asked me which one he gave a wintry smile good question charles of course charles floderus the other one i remembered had broken up a courier line through trieste and wiped out a queens messenger before the bureau caught a whiff of something rotten the man had been doubling for five years before he blew his own cover because of a woman charles was different they were distantly related but the blood was thin and charles was known for his total integrity throughout the secret services he was also a very highechelon director of operations for the sis what about him i asked pepperidge he was the one who made me this proposal he watched some people coming in behind me id done him a bit of good you see at one time decent of him to remember id begun listening floderus had approached him that had been decent of him yes he was very cautious very demanding i got it over the phone pepperidge said we didnt actually meet his eyes dipped away he didnt know i was not quite at my best just the main drift you see over the blower no names or anything absolute security when the barman came over pepperidge asked for the same again and then told me also as i said he knew id done quite a bit in asia his head swung up you were out there too werent you a couple of times yes are they anyone we know what nobody know are you worried no its just a man and a woman holding hands across the table as long as youre happy he frowned am i talking too loud everythings relative if floderus had really offered him an operation then he should keep it well under cover a lot of people who came to the brass lamp were from the corridors of codes and cyphers together with a few second or third secretaries of foreign embassies pepperidge kept his eyes on the other table for a bit longer and then said more quietly theyre just spooning but anyway old boy this one isnt for you the barman came with their drinks and pepperidge said cheers whatve you got an ulcer or something thats right reflectively he said itd mean working for a foreign government you see and id hardly imagine you ever doing that which one friendly to the west does it matter not really i shook a few more drops of angostura into my tonic and watched it fizz working for a foreign government would be totally strange i was used to the ultrasophisticated services of the bureau meticulous briefing prearranged access to the field even across the curtain a signals board in london with only my name on it and a hour staff and a director in the field who could get me anything needed contacts couriers papers limitless and progressive briefings as the phases of the mission changed and liaison through gchq cheltenham with the chief of control in london and his decisionmaking authority which gave him immediate access to the prime minister wherever she might be fabulous money of course pepperidge said thats what loman told me he gave a derisive grunt loman he couldnt get you enough to buy a bag of chips i mean the real thing i wouldnt know what to do with it buy some more jensens arent they what you use i mean apart from toys then give it to the dogs home and do it for kicks he was watching me steadily again youve got me interested you know that what in handing this thing over to you forget it i wouldnt work for floderus or a foreign government have you got a card on you no well heres mine i took it out of courtesy and pushed my chair back i wanted to be out of there before he got down to the bottom of his drink again and swallowed that bloody worm you ii go mad out there holmes dead right it was eight oclock and a lot of the options had run out giselle was playing at covent garden but id never get in without booking itd be the same thing at the theatres the only shows i could get a ticket for wouldnt be worth seeing i didnt want to go down to the club because the only people id see there would be talking shop and id just had a gutful of that with pepperidge eating out alone was a bleak enough thought food was a celebration of life and had to be shared moira was in paris and liz on her way to new york again yvonne was in london and might be available but what was it coming down to that i had to find a girl because id got nothing else to do better not tell her that i could go along to the dojo and hope to find tanaka there and knock some of the rough edges off kanku dai but even though i could use the exercise hed see i was out of condition and that would embarrass me because he wouldnt say anything i could go up to norfolk and ask for a session at the longdistance night range and blast lomans face all over the sandbags theyd let me in even if they knew id left the bureau the bastards would let me do anything i liked in the hope of getting me back but there wasnt any point in going to norfolk as if nothing had changed everything had changed id known it would feel like this in the first few weeks id cut myself off from a way of life that had exposed me to the most deadly risks time after time and pushed me into that frightening ethereal zone where i had to face those things in myself that in cold blood id never have the stomach for weakness in one form or another cowardice a blind eye to the need for mercy lack of grace id expected yes to feel like an electric circus with the plug pulled out the tension gone and the noise dying away and the dark coming down but i wasnt ready for this sense of loss of loneliness bloody shame get used to it some time after nine i made some toast and opened a tin of sardines and got out the too of physics and wrestled with it no sound in the room but the occasional muted horn of a taxi and the fretting of a casement as the night wind got up the phone hadnt rung since id got back from the brass lamp and at some time or other i went across and checked to see it was still working later i went to the safe behind the sliding japaneselacquered panel and took out the experimental cypher grid that tilney had asked me to evaluate and slipped it into its black selfdestruct container and broke the seal and let the acid go to work then i found myself standing in the middle of the room with the book in my hand again not knowing why i was trying to read it the weight of the most appalling depression was pinning me down so at last i forced myself to move and it was then that i did what i must have known i would do sooner or later and dropped the book onto the sofa and picked up the phone and rang floderus ducks perfectly true absolutely floderus grabbed the strap as the cab lurched past a bus hed asked me for a mobile rendezvous with maximum security and id picked him up in carlton street last night on the telephone hed kept the conversation down to careful monosyllables now he was more relaxed though not much i offered it to him because this is something we cant possibly touch ourselves since were government so is the bureau of course what on earth made you the bureau cant touch it either absolutely not but what made you leave i went on looking out of the window floderus tugged a sleeve back shooting cuff sorry not my business coming in with us not bloody likely a brief laugh things arent that bad you know we leave the top level people more or less alone and youd be one of them naturally i personally run chepping and shahan among others theyre pretty wild the cab slowed as a troop of the household cavalry rode past plumes bobbing sabres bared breastplates flashing in the pale sunshine in a moment i asked have you seen him recently who pepperidge not for a month or two why his hornrimmed glasses caught the light as the cab swung into piccadilly and for a moment i couldnt see his eyes he wants to give me the mission floderus watched me thoughtfully you could do it of course its rather head on one side exotic but why not come in with us and do something we could help you with id look after you personally nice of you floderus was the assistant chief of his department and notoriously choosy about the people he ran but your operations dont go near enough to the brink we try to please he said drily its a different kind of field i need i shrugged you know what i need youll get yourself killed one day i dont want to the in bed i gave it a moment which foreign power is involved he clasped his thin pale hands and stared down at them the shadows of leaves in the early light washing over them as we neared the park then his head came up suddenly look if you want to take this one on youll have to do it exclusively through pepperidge hes with your sanction absolutely its there for anyone to pick up anyone of your capability but weve got to keep right out of it our department its the kind of thing the uk darent get involved in or be seen to get involved in what makes it so sensitive i wanted to get as much out of him as hed let me he was the source he glanced round to make sure the dividing window was shut then leaned closer its not only because theres an element of drugrunning and the international armaments trade southeast asia is terribly complicated politically and what you would be doing quiller would be making an attempt to remove or render neutral certain elements threatening the balance of power in that region including the potential risk of a confrontation between western and soviet forces in thailand we an armed confrontation in these days he said bleakly nothing is impossible after the disastrous failure of the summit conference this isnt just the cold war any more its the freeze potent stuff where did this thing come from my department was approached by a foreign power in that region via the diplomatic bag you would be working for that power but the success of the mission would benefit the uk and of course our ally the united states not to say world peace he leaned back it doesnt sound like my kind of operation its too geopolitical the background is a geopolitical yes but that wouldnt concern you operationally in fact its very much your kind of thing the very careful clandestine infiltration of a major opposition network he tugged a sleeve back but why dont you go and talk to pepperidge again before you decide im due at the travellers in ten minutes and youll want to be on your way he turned to the window to find out where we were and slid the glass panel open driver you can put me down anywhere here he turned back to me and said softly we havent made contact as im sure you understand ive booked you out pepperidge said on singapore airlines flight change at bombay first class he threw another crust for the ducks all expenses paid though not by me the hotel in singapore isnt very posh but theres a good reason its tucked away in one of the market streets and you might want to make it your base crouching beside him i held the paper bag while he dug for another crust a light wind came across the lake ruffling the surface in the distance the flags above st jamess palace made patches of crimson and gold against the gunmetal clouds not that one you silly little bugger youll choke yourself wait till it soaks a bit what about cover i asked him access liaison comunications i was instantly sorry but couldnt take it back this wasnt the bureau sending me out this was just the remnant of a oncetalented shadow executive shrugging off a mission he couldnt handle himself never mind im rather afraid he said quietly youll be pretty much on your own old boy this time of course take a little getting used to a thin smile yes id got a dozen passports and visas and borderfranked papers in the safe and i could work out my own access once i was in the field if i decided to take this thing on at all the cover id suggest pepperidge was saying would be either importexport or some kind of weapons specialist youd get a briefing on that locally he tossed the last crust at a pretty emeraldwinged mallard and crushed the empty bag into a ball stuffing it into his pocket as to access theyll come to you dont worry its all in there hed given me a sealed oblong envelope when wed met as far as liaison goes youll have to pick a few people yourself if you can find anyone you can trust he stood upright and i noted the stiffness in his legs he was out of training an old man for gods sake and not yet forty i cant promise anything i told him of course you cant just go and see them and listen to what they have to say if you dont like it youre not committed i gave them no guarantee i caught a note of wistfulness youve nothing to lose this trips on them enjoy yourself i met pepperidge again two days later over a coffee in a wimpey along the edgware road as we came out on to the street i told him id drop him off on my way to the airport not to worry old boy i feel like a walk do me good he stood with his hands buried in the pockets of his mac as it flapped against his legs a spring wind was buffeting through the streets reeking of diesel fumes and listen i his thin mouth tightened suddenly then he made himself go on i havent had a drink since the day before yesterday and thats how im going to go on if you take this thing over i just a slack hand emerged making a throwaway gesture just wanted you to know and youd better have this he offered a card im renting a cottage in cheltenham not far from the gchq mast the pubs around there are full of interesting info of course and if i pick anything up that might help you ill pass it on thatll be my number not my name you see its the owners but just make a note of the number ill put in an answering machine all right you can always leave a signal on it if im out sweeping for data in the pubs one of his wintry smiles tonic water and angostura that correct god not a festive prospect i must say a doubledecker swung past blotting out the sky its exhaust drumming against a dressshop window ive got friends pepperidge said in cheltenham of course a tone of pride redeemed if necessary i could possibly get a signal you over the mast itself through the british high commission in singapore he looked away for a moment then his yellow eyes came back to rest on mine squinting against the wind not quite the service youre used to sorry an hour and fourteen minutes later at got out of my cab at the singapore airlines departure point at heathrow another one pulled in behind and i checked the single passeager as a matter of routine flight taxied to runway half an hour later and then got held up while an executive jet came in we were cleared by the tower at and got airborne seven minutes after the scheduled departure time the evening sky was almost clear with a scattering of cumulus along the southern horizon and the windsocks hanging limp nine hours later in bombay waiting to change flights i picked up a copy of the times of singapore and found a seat in the departure lounge in kuala lumpur a top national front leader had called for an end to unbalanced promalay government policies and urged prime minister datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad to crack down on corruption in bangkok thailands new military commander general chovalit had ordered the army and its nationwide radio and television networks not to play politics in the coming general ejection in singapore a government minister had accused police officers of being too strict and suggested they should mix more freely with the public they served fights among teenagers in coffeeshops and at wayangs were becoming more violent following the increasing practice of staring down in order to provoke attack which had yesterday led to a twelveyearold boys ear being severed by a knife there was nothing in the paper to do with drugrunning or the armaments trade after twenty minutes i left my seat and picked up a copy of glitz at the gift shop and went aboard flight for singapore at i was almost the last on during the flight i reread the instructions pepperidge had given me memorised their main points and went forward to the toilet tearing the three sheets of feintruled paper into small pieces and flushing them in the pan as i went back to my seat a stewardess was pulling the curtain closed between the firstclass and coach sections after pushing a drinks cart through i notched my seat back a little and relaxed slipping from beta to alpha waves there were a couple of moles of course digging away in sis it could be that would you like some champagne almond eyes heavily shadowed an exquisite silk hanbok ochre shot with emerald pattern of white cranes a few stitches gone at the shoulder seam i shook my head are we running on schedule she glanced at her thin jadefaced watch ten minutes early we should land in singapore in about three hours from now at pm local time is there anything i can bring you sir nothing patchouli on the air as she passed behind me it hadnt been floderus whod told me about the moles everyone along the grapevine knew it and a lot of them couldnt sleep at night they were having a swine of a time trying to find them and until they found them they couldnt tell how much damage was being done so it could be that one of the moles had caught wind of the mission floderus had been offered or pepperidge had talked too loudly in a pub or somewhere i wasnt totally surprised even at the clearance and briefing stage of any given mission there could be vibrations picked up and passed on for what it was worth however tight the security last year theyd got on to me very fast indeed moving in and having a go at me before i even left london smashing my car against the thames embankment and putting me into hospital this time theyd picked me up almost as fast but this was just lowkey passive surveillance one man with a black dressbag for camouflage i hadnt been looking for anyone id just been checking the environment as a matter of routine and the asian with the bag the one whod got out of the cab behind mine at heathrow had turned away a couple of times in the departure lounge in bombay avoiding eye contact and id followed up at once heading for the mens toilet and fading before he got there hed panicked right away checking the toilet and coming straight out again not terribly professional at the moment he was somewhere back there in the coach section there was no actual problem he wasnt strictly a tag he wasnt trying to find out where i was going you cant shadow someone and hope to get a seat on the same flight at the last minute if thats where he takes you this man had just been told to make sure i got to singapore without changing flights and finishing up somewhere else where theyd never find me again i couldnt shrug him off until we landed and in any case i knew now that thered be others waiting at the baggage claim they wouldnt leave it to one man to keep track of me through terrain as tricky as singapore action later sticky heat struck the face as we went through the walkway then there was the cool of the airconditioning again i behaved precisely on cue at the baggage claim checking no one taking my time chatting up a nice little american girl and helping her pull her two streamlined cases off the carousel in the cab outside i told the driver to take me to the marina bay area and when we were moving along fullerton road i leaned forward on the seat whats your name ahmad a big grin how are you i passed him a us bill let me have your card and head for chinatown this money not enough hundred dollar fare listen carefully ahmad im going to leave my bags in your care drop them at your office and make sure theyre kept safe ill pick them up there in an hour and then you get another fifty a hundred i cant ahmad look at my eyes in the mirror do i look like someone you can bullshit his eyes met mine then he looked away what place you want to go keong siak street okay when we got there the other cab was still close behind us but i hit the door open and dropped pitching between two fish stalls and ducking under a bead curtain scattering birds near a grain merchants cart the wet noon heat against my skin and the smell of sandalwood on the air sandalwood and lamp oil and fish and curry and incense a voice yelling out in malaysian as i dodged past a medicine man and under a flower stall finding an alley and lurching among bicycles and canework and dustbins coming out into new bridge road and stopping the first cab chong street off boat quay i slammed the door shut not this way through cross street whens it going to rain for christs sake maybe tonight cool things off jolly good show party the screams were coming from the room next door and i went into the passage the door was locked so i shouldered it open and it swung back with a crash and i saw the woman standing on the windowsill clutching the thin canvas curtain the window was open and she let go of the curtain and began tilting forward just as i got to her and pulled her back into the room she started screaming again in chinese beating at me with small cold fists her halfstarved body naked under the cheap cotton wrapper a huge mole standing out on her stomach whats up al said from the doorway she was trying to jump out of the window tamen shassu le wo ti erhpzu take it easy now al said six in the morning for christs sake youll wake everybody up he ran this place the red orchid they hung her son he told me over there dawn this morning lets get her onto the bed she went on struggling for a minute and then suddenly went slack and we laid her down pulling a blanket over her thin ivory body as she went into a paroxysm of shivering i went and shut the window drawing the curtain to keep the brightness out we were all praying for him al told her all of us take it easy now he sat on the edge of the bed and stroked the womans thin untidy hair as the sobbing began worse than the screaming had been the quiet desolate sound of a breaking heart what then one of the kitchen boys stood in the doorway white slivers of wood from the smashed frame scattered around his feet get lily up here al told him lily ling nowla the boy flapped away in his rubber sandals a fucking rope i heard al saying softly though his clenched teeth they gave him a fucking rope he went on stroking the womans hair his face bunched and his eyes flickering voices began in the narrow street three floors below the rattle of carts a mans sudden laughter you want me boss lily ling asked him yes al said stay with her okay he stopped stroking the womans hair looking relieved a man awkward in the presence of suffering stay with her the whole time lily dont leave her unless you get someone else in here to take over the chinese girl came and sat on the bed taking the womans head in her hands laying her face against the others what happen quietly al said she tried jumping out of the window so watch her okay she mrs seng she say a man come to see her maybe last night als mouth tightened and did a man come no good he relaxed again touching my arm lets go i feel like a drink in the bar he said they swung a few guys over there this morning like i said he was one of them her son and the man who said hed come to see her his eyes went hard those bastards move in whenever theres trouble hed have told her he could pull strings see get him off get him just a prison term hed have taken her life savings he broke off to call to a boy going through the lobby mahmood theres a door needs fixing up there number okay go and check it out need some tools he poured himself another scotch three ounces of heroin and they get a life term over there four ounces and they swing malaysias trying to beat the drug problem and i guess thats the way they do it month back they swung a couple australians you read about that everybody sent in an appeal the australian prime minister amnesty international margaret thatcher those boys were caught with just six ounces of the stuff they werent trading a truckload but they swung he hit a mosquito that had settled on his arm leaving a smear of blood they give it a lot of publicity so people are going to get the message theyll give these kids headlines in the evening papers over here he took a swig at his drink her son couldnt read the sound of boots came from the lobby police shit al said under his breath and went to stand in the archway so whats up somebody reported a woman screaming theyre always screaming the young cop stood there hardfaced and angular sharp creases in his uniform the holster shining they said the sound came from this hotel sure people laughing it sounds the same always a party going on at the red orchid right he shook his head anything wrong id know it okay the chinese stood looking around the ceiling waiting to hear if the screaming came again and when nothing happened for a minute he gave al a bright stare and then turned on his heel and went out through the swing door his polished boots clumping and his leather belt creaking his cap set dead flat on his head other sounds came in from the narrow street cyclo bells chickens someone beating a gong then the door swung shut tell me about the drug scene i said to al in this region he swung his head all of it jesus take some time two days later the rain came pelting down out of a black sky on to the roof of the car with a noise like massed drums the windscreen wipers were only just clearing the glass enough for the driver to see through and from the rear seat i watched the thick steelgrey haze on the bonnet as we crossed the river and headed for orchard road the thai security man sitting next to the driver said something to him a quick word or two and the driver nodded without turning they were professionals these two theyd come to the red orchid on foot to meet me because the market street was too cluttered for the embassy limousine to pass and as soon as id come into the lobby theyd hijacked a cyclo and put me into it to keep me more or less dry hurrying alongside like welltrained bodyguards to where the car was parked checking the environment the whole time whole the cyclo bell cleared the way it had been like that yesterday when the two embassy officials had come to find me two not just one both stonefaced asking me for my identity papers first and then presenting their own with a curt formality before they gave me the embossed card his highness the crown prince sonthee sirindhorn requests the pleasure of your company at pm on the evening of april at the embassy of thailand on the occasion of his birthday obviously the man hadnt contrived to celebrate his birth precisely two days after this lone spook had landed in singapore the thais had simply thought it a good opportunity to bring me into the centre of things and check me out from there pepperidge tossing the last crust into the lake had said as to access theyll come to you dont worry just go and see them and listen to what they have to say if you dont like it youre not committed i gave them no guarantee jesus christ he called that access on the other hand there was no actual mission running yet id done all i could do for now id seen the shadow someone had thrown across me on the flight into singapore and got rid of him and since then id put the red orchid through routine analysis and found it safe there was no covert or oven surveillance on the place no bugs no manned observation vectors no one in the bar watching the flyblown mirrors no one cooling his heels in the street outside nothing id also got a lot of information on the southeast asian drug scene from al from what hed told me about his background he seemed a safe man to talk to inside the parameters of my cover otherwise pepperidge wouldnt have sent me to the red orchid but how reliable was pepperidge good question as far as liaison goes youll have to pick a few people yourself if you can find anyone you can trust not quite the service youre used to sorry the car slowed passing a line of others and slotting in to a ropedoff space outside no orchard street the building ablaze with light the thai flag floodlit but hanging like a wrungout dishcloth in the downpour umbrellas everywhere bouncing off each other as the security man snapped open a big one above my head and steered me across the flooded pavement and up the steps our shoes already waterlogged before we got inside two whitehaired diplomats tugging off their macs with the help of the embassy servants peeling off their galoshes hello george where did you moor your car gusty laughter drinks in the offing wheres daphne isnt she here a gold cufflink came off with the mackintosh sleeve and someone dived for it her mother didnt feel like turning out on a night like this a man with a mole an asian suddenly close watching then youre off the hook old boy make the most of it an asian with a small mole below the left ear now speaking to one of the security men and then melting not glancing at me a bit embarrassed probably he should have kept up with his assignment a little more efficiently between the fish stalls and under the bead curtain and past the grain merchants can and through the alley full of bicycles and canework and dustbins into new bridge road but it was reassuring to see him again i knew now that it hadnt been some kind of opposition cell that had thrown him across me on the flight out it must have been the thais whod sent him over to london to shepherd me across and make sure i wasnt got at civil of them the security man took me smoothly through the crowd of people under the dazzling chandeliers and edged me into the receiving line ahead of the rest only three in front of me now the crown prince sporting a sash and cluster his hand moist with sweat how kind of you to come mr jordan and at such short notice a pleasure your highness and allow me to offer my congratulations the security man steered me deftly away and collared a flunky with a tray of champagne something soft it took a bit of time and i eased my way to the silkpanelled wall and stood with my back to it noting five or six more people from the old country mildewed dinnerjackets and pinchedin satin a shoulderstrap hanging down over a plump powdered arm a small contingent of japanese keeping close formation beautifullytailored a couple of filippinos standing stiffly with set faces not touching their drinks radio singapore had put out a news flash just before id left the hotel a major coup on the part of the military was in full swing in manila a group of chinese all smiles and some frenchmen arguing energetically about cheese pas possible dans ce climat pas du tout possible de le garder en bonne condition four or five turbanned pakistanis and a lone african in uniform and a rather tenselooking girl in a green buttonthrough dress her face pale under the chandeliers canada dry mr jordan thank you this way please he took me down a long corridor lined with portraits in gilt frames a potted palm ten feet tall stood at the end under a domed ceiling then we were in a small ornate anteroom with a circle of brocade chairs and a polished mahogany sidetable with a copy of the times lying on it and someones hornrimmed glasses please wait here mr jordan all right jordan had been the name on the papers id got from the safe in my flat in london theyd offered the nearest cover to the one pepperidge had suggested martin jordan was an overseas representative for a small armsmanufacturing company in birmingham laker foundry the security man had left the door open and i could still hear the distant murmur of the reception but it only accentuated the stillness in this small room which i found encapsulating unnerving there was no mission running yet and there might never be with me in it if i felt like turning it down but pepperidge and floderus knew the kind of thing i liked doing and they wouldnt have sent me out here to waste my time at this days end i could be moving into something dangerous something terminal mr jordan i appreciate your coming to see me he was a small bland hesitant man his eyes halfhidden behind tinted glasses his hand outstretched his body turning sideways a little limping as he approached two other men came into the room with him aides not bodyguards and one of them said quickly his highness prince kityakara minister of defence how do you do sir how do you do now lets sit down theres no one with you mr jordan i came alone excellent he looked around quickly lets shut the door shall we he had a restrained oxford accent and his speech was jerky a little breathless this is captain krairiksh of interior security and majorgeneral vasuratna of military intelligence he crossed his legs we shall understand perfectly mr jordan if your knowledge of the political scene in southeast asia happens by chance to be slight its a small corner of the world of course i dont take long to learn pepperidge hadnt put any political briefing in the envelope and there was no point in taking a crash course because even that would need several weeks kityakara would have to pick the flesh off and give me the bare bones excellent his hand dipped quickly to a pocket and tugged out a small inhaler whisking it across his mouth and slipping it back ill endeavour to give you the essence then do you want to take notes no very well well do what we can to put things into perspective he spoke for more than an hour asking krairiksh and vasuratna to fill in the picture from their points of view and breaking for questions on the way it didnt seem i thought to be much different in southeast asia than anywhere else a scenario of territorial fear at the brain stem level and a general atmosphere of dog eat dog now let me try to put all that in a nutshell mr jordan kityakara got up and limped across to the black marble fireplace using sleight of hand again with the inhaler soviet russia is at present subsidising the vietnamese armed forces in laos and cambodia to the tune of five billion us dollars a year in return the vietnamese permit the use of the naval bases in da nang and cam ranh bay by the soviet pacific fleet he let a moment go by those bases are vital to the soviets vital i tilted my chair back until i was balanced comfortably listening to kityakara and at the same time wondering about the asthma and the limp and the tinted glasses a lot of people of his age in this area had been lucky to come out of the khmer rouge holocaust alive even those in power especially those he was one of them and hed come through a nightmare so how paranoid was he about the vietnamese about the soviets id need to find out because paranoia always distorted the facts now since the soviets took over those two former us bases in theyve added five submarine dry docks and installed underground fuelstorage tanks and antiaircraft batteries so that in terms of its sophisticated electronic arrays the base at cam ranh bay is one of the most important soviet communication and intelligencegathering facilities outside russian territory the aircraft carriers minsk and novorossiysk have made port calls and those two bases alone offer the soviets all the elements of a naval warfare strategy in southeast asia torpedo and cruise missile strikes from aircraft submarines and surface ships linked by a landbased communications centre would you care for some tea yes vasuratna opened the door and spoke to the guard outside the soviets then the prince said when the door was closed are holding a very strong position in indochina bearing in mind the estimated number of advisers here seven thousand in vietnam three thousand in cambodia and two thousand in laos but the main concern of my government given this background is that by invading cambodia vietnam has moved its borders west right up to our doorstep he whipped the inhaler across his mouth and it confirmed what id noticed since hed first come in here that he used it whenever he was saying something that made him anxious that makes us nervous mr jordan very nervous the disastrous failure of the summit conference last month with its critical heightening of international tension and the increasing accord between the united states and china where three us ships of the th fleet actually made port calls last october together with the first signs of nationalistic restlessness of the vietnamese as erstwhile hosts to the soviet fleet all threaten the soviet position in the pacific he broke off as a whitejacketed steward brought in a massive silver tea tray and put it down prince kityakara lifted the lid of the heavilychased teapot and sniffed lapsang souchong would that suit gentlemen i tilted my chair back again and watched the ceremony of pouring a soviet connection in indochina i hadnt been ready for that lastly mr jordan there is this thanks to the increasing supply of arms reaching the rebel forces in laos and cambodia those countries are approaching the brink of civil war this of course would normally be seen as advantageous we would hardly view the overturning of communist power as undesirable but no one can predict the extent of the bloodshed that would ensue or the critical increase of soviet power in indochina sugar no its not unlikely you see that if the soviets decided to support the vietnamese in an invasion of thailand we might be forced to invoke the terms of the ruskthanat agreement of under which america is pledged to support us militarily the agreement is an executive not a treaty but it is valid and extant we have the option of invoking also the manila pact which is a treaty and extant he sipped his tea and i noted the slight shaking of his hand what we are talking about mr jordan is a possible military confrontation between soviet and us forces the first in history i stopped rocking on my chair by the window majorgeneral vasuratna uncrossed his legs looking at no one the other man captain krairiksh was watching the prince his hands locked tightly together on his lap in the courtyard outside the rain fell steadily ringing on something metal perhaps the shade of an ornamental lamp i remembered the quiet urgent voice of charles floderus inside that london cab the background is geopolitical but that shouldnt concern you this is in fact precisely your kind of operation the very careful clandestine infiltration of a major opposition network the objective then didnt involve making a critical document snatch or bringing a hot spook across a frontier or digging out a mole it involved defusing an eastwest military confrontation in thailand and floderus had offered a job like this to pepperidge something wrong and such an event kityakara was saying quietly should i feel be energetically avoided i got up and paced needing movement something wrong yes or maybe the people in london hadnt realised the size of this thing maybe kityakara had played it close to the chest and just asked them to send someone out but that couldnt actually happen i told him i mean the actual engagement of soviet and us forces on thai soil not quite that mr jordan his cup rattled on the saucer as he put it down but any element of armed confrontation with eastwest tension as high as it is could bring about a cataclysm by escalation yes by a naval vessels going off course at the wrong time and the precipitate order for a carrier to send up its aircraft and finally someones finger on the button in a missile silo and the sheer lack of time to use the hotline and call a halt inhaler once inertia has been overcome mr jordan in whatever field of experience the momentum is difficult to stop it has happened before in two world wars and it took everyone by surprise perhaps this time he shrugged uncertainly we can avert the third i waited then said does that complete the background sir that completes the background and it seems to me and to my advisers that the best way of preventing catastrophe is to restabilise the power structure in the region to discourage the rebel anticommunist forces and render them incapable of overturning the present regimes in laos and cambodia this can be done by cutting off their supply of arms and equipment he picked up the teapot again but got nothing more than a dribble captain krairiksh got up at once and made for the door but the prince stopped him it doesnt matter he finished the dregs in his cup unfortunately the supply of arms and equipment has been increasing of late and substantially weve been allowing a steady trickle across thai territory from china of course and that will now be stopped but the greater part of the increasing supplies has been coming from five major international sources funnelled through one distributor in southeast asia and that distributor is very powerful so far weve been quite unable to effect countermeasures what have you tried weve tried negotiation by offering a high government post with its attendant advantages weve tried threats including vigorous legal proceedings weve tried massive police action in the hope of discovering drug shipments alongside the armaments without success he glanced to the door and away again and we finally tried assassination i moved my head who was the target the chief of the organisation how many attempts were made three and the prince hesitated then looked at his chief of military intelligence you know the details better than i do would you vasuratna sat to attention sir he turned to me we decided the only way was to make a personal attack on each occasion but this organisation is extremely capable of defending itself the first of our agents was dropped off the tailboard of a truck outside the gates of the presidential palace full of bullets the second was dumped outside police headquarters with signs of having been rigorously tortured we have not found the body of the third agent but his head was delivered to my office in a cardboard box he looked down suddenly they were my best men very experienced very efficient i have accepted the blame of course i realised he was no longer speaking to me but to kityakara so here was the mission if i wanted it youre not expected to blame yourself the prince told vasuratna were up against someone exceptional this time who is it i asked him a woman mariko shoda yasma here for long im not sure yet come and see us at the commission always something going on lots of parties how nice i gave him a nod and turned away finding a gap in the crowd and using it id left kityakara half an hour ago and hed wanted to give me an escort to take me back to the red orchid but id said no on the face of it the mission they had to offer looked feasible and at this stage i didnt want to be seen around any more with security men in any case i wanted to stay on a bit here and check out the guests to see if i knew anyone pepperidge as far as liaison goes you ii have to pick a few people yourself id already noticed mason di backed up into a corner with a glass of champagne hed been doing a little reconnaissance work from time to time moving in to some arabs in the thick of the crowd and standing with his back to them tuning in he hadnt picked up much by the look of things a stringer for the telegraph was near the staircase and i would have gone over because the man had done me a good turn a year or so ago in hong kong but he was deep in chat with a stunning young eurasian girl and i didnt want to spoil his fun there wasnt in any case all that much chance of finding anyone at an embassy party whod be any use to me in this kind of mission if i took it on id need people i could trust with my life id asked kityakara what decided you to call on london it was a joint decision the prince had asked the other two men to leave him in private with mr jordan majorgeneral vasuratna he told me when theyd gone has run some very successful operations in the past but those three agents are on his conscience last week one of his aides found him sitting at his desk with a gun to his head he leaned forward on the edge of the brocade chair his slight body at an angle i have no one else capable of undertaking a task so critical and so dangerous to attempt to get anywhere near mariko shoda is like walking through a minefield i want you to understand that i gave it some thought did you know i was coming here personally no we simply asked for someone of the highest capability how did you contact london sir i approached the foreign office directly no through your ambassador in bangkok in a personal meeting yes was there anyone else present no one did he contact di im afraid i have no idea i was told he would find someone if he could i got up and went to the window the rain had almost stopped and there was only the sound of dripping from the flooded gutters under the eaves outside there were things i didnt like about this whole setup id moved into the field across dead bodies before though id always taken a lot of persuasion because they might have messed things up when they were alive in this case the opposition had been alerted three times already i was still prepared to go in if i could find some kind of access but it worried me that id been offered this mission by sheer chance and by a burntout spook with a gutful of worms i didnt like it i didnt like it to the extent that as i sat facing prince kityakara in the silence of the little room i could feel the hairs rising on the back of my hands and that sour familiar chill along the nerves why did you contact london sir instead of washington considering the background youve given me majorgeneral vasuratna is wellversed in the international intelligence field he left his chair and limped to join me at the window he told me that the cia tends to work as a team often with paramilitary support he believes despite our lack of success so far that its still a case for a single agent going in alone without attracting attention you people have a certain reputation for that approach he used his inhaler of course that might not be accurate and in any case im not pressing you for a decision immediately give it your consideration mr jordan for a day or two and then let me know all right at this stage ill simply tell you that since you would be working for the thai government on private service we would expect you to name your own fee and of course you would have unquestioned access to personnel and facilities in our security and intelligence services id stayed another ten minutes to let him end the meeting with some diplomatic smalltalk then shook hands with him and left him standing there in the ornate little room with a courteous smile and his eyes still hidden by his tinted glasses thompson isnt it what bill thompson no oh sorry he weaved away a pink hand wiggling in apology by this time people were starting to bump into each other spilling their drinks on my way through the marbled entrance hall i checked for company and saw none id told kityakara i didnt want any and hed understood he was obviously could you help me the girl in the green silk dress her eyes dark angry i stopped how just see me into a taxi would you she was looking behind her without turning her head of course she took my arm and we walked out between the two uniformed staff and down the steps the street was running with irridescent water under the lamps and a boy was sloshing through puddles our feet were soaked and as i opened the door of the taxi for her she slipped quickly inside and began tugging a bright green shoe off youll be all right now but she just pulled the door shut and i stood back from the storm drain as the taxi pulled away a last glimpse of her pale face through the window please excuse mr jordan a chauffeur in navyblue uniform with the thai insignia yes i have a car here sir please this way i followed him along the streaming pavement and got into the limousine the driver closed the door and went round to the front shoes off yes a good idea they felt good evening mr jordan she was in the shadows halflost in the opposite corner small asian her voice childlike now she sat forward at attention legs together hands clasped on her lap giving me a little bow my name is yasma asian hospitality i couldnt see her in detail even now there was just the impression of liquid eyes set in heavy kohl makeup the glow of ivory skin and the scent of jasmine im happy to meet you yasma i leaned forward to tell the driver to pull up because i didnt like women being used as toys then i let it go where would you like to have dinner shed be interesting to talk to for a while shed be informative on the local scene then id get her a cab wherever it would please you mr jordan is the siam garden still going yes i told the driver and sat back how pretty you are yasma were you born in thailand thank you yes in bangkok i was there once hunched over a loaded husqvarna with a mans head in the sights showing faintly in the aureole of the temple across the square my family is there she said softly one of my sisters is a dancer with the royal thai junior ballet you must be very proud an exchange of the niceties while the car ploughed through the flooded streets how can i get close to mariko shoda can you tell me that not really yes she was saying later but tomorrow we shall have sunshine again though it will be humid of course sticky she gave a little laugh covering her mouth sticky yes i leaned forward again driver the siam gardens in mosque street yes sir but the direct way is flooded tonight always problem with storm drains there we swung left going south you live in england mr jordan in london yes i have seen picturecards i would very much like to visit london youd feel at home it rains like this most of the time the streets were narrower here and the car stopped for a cyclo blocking our way you are here in singapore for long time mr jordan just a few days its an interesting i broke her wrist like a dry stick but the knife had come close ripping into my jacket and shirt and cutting the flesh before id caught the glint of steel in the gloom both rear doors came open and i shifted to my left because i was righthanded and could bring the force of my hip and shoulder against the attack from that direction but a hand locked round my throat from behind and i used a fourfinger eyeshot across my shoulder and connected and heard a squeal of pain i couldnt see much detail but there was the figure of a boy or a woman silhouetted in the open doorway on the left side and i got purchase for my hands on the pile carpet and thrust upwards with my right leg feeling resistance and then the release as the target fell away kaleidoscopic glimpses of the interior of the car flashed across my retinae the face of the driver above the seatsquab and the play of light through the open door from a street lamp and the eyes of the woman yasma as bright as the blade that was rising again this time in her left hand the only sounds were the voices of women two of them in pain and another spitting out a vicious tirade in what sounded like khmer as i blocked the knife and curled my wrist and got a grip on yasmas hand and turned it forcing the point of the blade into her small shadowed face and feeling it meet bone and then go through to the hilt as something flashed above me and i twisted on the floor and rammed my body against the rear seat and felt a slash of pain burning into my ribcage from the side the driver was angled across the front seatsquab and lunging down at me and i used a heelpalm with a lot of force and drove his nosebone upwards into the brain and then twisted again and thrust my body through the doorway on the left side hitting shallow water and stone and lurching clear of the car and starting to run but they blocked me two of them their fineboned faces etched against the lamplight as they came for me in their black tracksuits their hands bright with steel and their breath hissing the bittersweet scent of blood on the air and a man standing a little way off shouting something in english the shuffling of feet as people hurried away the slam of a door in the distance my hands were wet with blood theirs and my own theirs because i knew id killed my own because the pain in my ribs was flaring as the air got to the wound i had time to see a knife driving upwards at my face and time to block the womans arm and force a strong flattened halffist into the throat seeing her pretty mouth come open and the lamplight glistening for an instant on her bright curved tongue as her eyes opened very wide to stare into the face of death as she came down like a puppet with the strings cut the other woman had turned and was running and i staggered up slipping and lurching forward against a soft wave of resistance like deep water my eyes losing focus and finding it again seeing the womans shadow fluttering along the wall this side of the streetlamp as she moved through the pool of light and merged with the darkness beyond i kept going driving my legs against the rising tide of resistance my ears filling slowly with the high single note of a violin string kept on going because i wanted to know who she was who they were and if i could catch her id make her tell me but it was no go because the rising wave and the endless singing of the string were bringing information to me blood loss information that faded from my brain as the dark wave leapt and brought me down phone for you lily said ill come down they dont have telephones in your room at the red orchid nothing so fancy i picked up the receiver in the bar and said hello what sort of condition are you in i froze pepperidge in a moment i asked him horn did you know some people came into the lobby and al went to meet them i checked them through the archway two middleaged europeans with sleptin clothes and air france tags on their luggage i checked everyone now things had changed i told you pepperidge said id keep tabs on you from here the thing is are you what was your source paranoia perhaps so be it theyd come close to wiping me out the high commission of course he sounded pained the high commission doesnt know a thing about it singapore put out immediate smoke there was nothing in the press and nothing on the air short silence then youre not thinking im afraid perfectly right the thai embassy and singapore had got in touch very fast because of the dead drivers uniform and thered been a british national taken from the scene to the hospital so theyd automatically signalled the high commission the thing is i heard pepperidge saying what sort of condition are you in stink of antiseptics ill need a few days you had some luck dr robert yeo surgeon you had some luck you know good or bad lost on him they reached the radial artery it was a good thing you were found and put into an ambulance in time otherwise she would have picked up the telephone when it rang and they would have told her it has been done shoda the worst thing was the selfanger thrown into a hospital for christs sake with half my blood left behind me in the gutter before id even accepted the mission it was just because this wasnt a fullyurgent fivestar bureau operation right off the planning table with all the pieces in place access communications liaison and a director in the field like ferris id have been on my toes if london had set it up id have been locked in to the approach phase with my nerves already running at missionpitch no that was just an excuse and that was how far gone i was making excuses for the inexcusable anger seething in my blood majorgeneral vasuratna this organisation is extremely capable of defending itself the first of our agents was dropped off the tailboard of a truck outside the gates of the presidential palace full of bullets the second was dumped outside police headquarters with signs of having been mercilessly tortured we have not found the body of the third agent but his head was delivered to my office in a cardboard box but this time thered been some luck or the fourth man would have stayed there with the rest of his blood pumping into the storm drain and the ambulance wouldnt have used its siren on the way to the hospital shoda an eligible antagonist certainly for someone kityakara had called of the highest capability for someone who might one day get back on his feet and find enough savvy to give him a single chance in hell of getting anywhere near her anywhere near shoda rocking a bit i could tell by the way the ceiling was tilting rocking a bit you must expect to feel a little weak for a while i could see his point yes lean against the bar a few days what a few days to recuperate pepperidge said or to make up your mind ive made up my mind but ive also had a bit of surgery what did they do sewed up an artery then youll need more than a few days he sounded worried thats my problem there was a short silence i watched the two europeans giving their bags to a boy and trudging after him to the stairs you said youve made up your mind he sounded cautious you mean to do it if theyll still take me on why shouldnt they i havent made a terribly good start from what i was told you did rather well four dead on the field that right walked straight into a fucking trap dont you understand in a moment calmly steady as you go i took the warning even anger could blow those delicate stitches around that tube i gave it a few seconds trying to centre i need some information all i know that means anything at the moment is my objective for the mission a thought occurred to me do you know what that is short silence not objective target actually yes i do can you tell me anything about her bit of a bitch so they say i think shes got someone inside the thai embassy i heard a grunt of amusement shes got people inside every embassy in southeast asia old boy this ones in the thai secret service the man on the flight out the one id had to get rid of i knew now that on the night of the embassy party he hadnt looked embarrassed when hed seen me again hed just wanted to avoid eye contact with a man hed set up for the kill are you going to tell them pepperidge asked no ill leave him intact if i blew the man hed only go underground and work from there while the opposition sent in someone else whom i couldnt identify look pepperidge said hesitantly i could get you someone out there to protect the rear i mean shes going to try again and next time shell want to make sure i dont like no shields they could be dangerous unless they were first class material and i didnt imagine this burntout spook could find me anyone like that i know someone whos very good he was catching my thoughts its safer for me to work alone but i can use some information what sort any kind of closefocus analysis of the thai secret service i think i know who set me up but it couldve been someone else in their ranks just takes one little mole doesnt it ill work on it for you anything else nothing i cant dig up here id be doing a massive research job in the field as soon as i could find the right people to work with fair enough old boy now take care wont you take a lot of care an hour later i set up the night defense system id worked out since id got back from the hospital blocking one of the narrow beds against the door with the other one jammed sideways between it and the chest of drawers clear of the only exposed vector through the window and across the alley where anyone could use a rifle from the rooftop it was too early to go to ground normally i would do that drop into the shadows and operate from there from safety pepperidge was right theyd try again and the next time theyd want to make certain driven by their pride and their oriental fanaticism i had a rough idea of what mariko shoda would expect of anyone who failed her id heard in the hospital that a woman in a black tracksuit had been brought in soon afterwards found with a knife buried in the heart and her fingers still locked round the hilt theyd come for me again yes but id still have to operate above ground until id got the information id need to reach the target until then id have to move through the open exposed id be as safe here at the red orchid as anywhere id spent the whole day sniffing the place out like a fox in a badgers burrow going from floor to floor and onto the roof and down the fireescapes and into the basement memorising distances blind spots alcoves dead ends doorways until i could go through the building at a run and with five seconds head start get clear and survive if they came for me here it was midnight before i slept lying on my left side because of the long knifewound that had slashed across my back from the right shoulder to the spine the heel of the right hand swollen from the thrust to the drivers face the other wrist throbbing under the dressings where the walls of the artery were slowly knitting the blood pumping rhythmically through it to sustain the life in me that was already running out if she had had her way shoda a last thought before sleep trying to betray me kityakara knew what had happened and he wouldnt now expect me to take on the mission so why not accept that and go home and live because this was home lying curled like a fox in the dark unnerved and bloodied but with cunning still left for the morrow katie he was an absolute shit fantastic in bed but that was all and that was the trouble i suppose she leaned across the little bamboo table her thin shoulders moving forward her eyes intense i mean sex isnt enough for a relationship is it she forked some more satay off the skewer dropping a piece of pork do you think so the girl in the green silk dress today in khaki with a beaten gold necklace her light hair swinging as she moved moved constantly restlessly watching me hard wanting to know what i thought am i talking too much id been coming out of the thai embassy an hour ago and shed seen me and swung round oh hello look im sorry i was so well i dont know brusque the other night the night when shed asked me to escort her to a taxi and then slammed the door on me without any thanks i didnt notice then id suggested lunch because it looked as if she worked at the embassy or had some kind of connection with it and that could be useful i was parched for information and as soon as i could get what i needed i could go to ground where it was safe love to her bluegrey eyes narrowed focusing taking me in what about empress place on the river sitting next to me on the torn plastic seat of the cyclo shed filled me in the divorce was only a couple of months ago and he still thinks im ready to hop into bed with him again taking it in turns with his bloody mistress thank you very much and that night he was halfseas over and if you hadnt got me into that taxi hed have pushed me into a corner and torn my clothes off god doesnt that sound sordid but thats why twisting round on the seat and putting a thin ringless hand on my knee thats why i didnt even have the grace to thank you because i was furious or scared im not sure which she took her hand away im katie mccorkadale martin jordan of course everyones talking about you the nerves tightened where at the british high commission thats where i work you were almost killed werent you so they told me she stared into my eyes beginning to say something and changing her mind and saying instead how did you manage not to be bit of luck the cyclo lurched between a taxi and a standing bus and she grabbed the rail i was terribly upset when i heard the news i said carefully there wasnt any news what oh i know i mean when i heard from my boss there was nothing in the papers the next day and that puzzled me who are you actually another level stare i wondered too i said about the blackout it came from the thai embassy i know that we traced it through their ambassador phoned the singaporean minister for home affairs and asked him if he could hush the whole thing up well this place has got a good reputation for safety in the streets and tourists read newspapers it could be that her eyes didnt leave mine but it wasnt was it i didnt say anything the chief of police was also requested to pursue his enquiries with the utmost discretion in the interests of the state i quote which explained why there werent a whole drove of people from the homicide squad waiting round my bed at the hospital dont know how these things work i said no she blew out a gentle laugh theres something else that intrigues me im pretty certain youre the first man ive ever met who can deal with five assailants armed with knives and smartly they werent very good she laughed again and said do you mind the empress its only a food centre but you can pick and choose among all the hawkers absolutely anything chinese malaysian indian whatever and they bring it to you cooked or do you know all this have you been here before just passing through the empress sounds fine the place was crowded when we got there but some people were just leaving it was a corner table not far from the river and i spent the first ten minutes sweeping the environment simply as a matter of routine because there were upwards of a hundred people in this area and if any one of them wanted to do anything with a gun i couldnt stop him but it was going to be safer for me in the open until i could go to ground shoda didnt want to make any fuss the limousine thing had been set up carefully to provide discretion my little yasma was meant to kill with the first thrust and afterwards my body would have been buried deep in a rubbish dump and the car would have gone back to the hire company shoda would have been very upset by the agitation at political level in spite of the news blackout and the next time shed order the subtlest kill she could think of but that was an assumption and assumptions are dangerous as i sat talking with this reasonably attractive but rather chatty girl at the rickety bamboo table my nerves were crawling just below the skin you take everything in martin dont you she pulled another kebab out of the basket and skinned the skewer i mean you actually listen youre so interesting she gave me another stare then looked down suddenly not really i talk like a bloody she shrugged her thin shoulders coming forward ive made it a rule you see not to bore my friends i mean about him stephen and you turned up as an absolute stranger and i suddenly felt like letting my hair down it looks nice like that two asians watching me from the table twenty yards away twentyfive yards tough tracksuits intent actually katie said the wounds are still raw it hasnt been long do you remember that film a married noan unmarried woman i dont think i saw it they looked down not away when they saw id made contact i didnt like that but there were quite a few tracksuits among the crowd id seen the joggers in the park on the way here they were just walking in the street in new york she was meryl streep no jill clayburg shes asking him about where they ought to go for their holiday and he suddenly tells her hes met someone else and i mean it was a long marriage and she doesnt say anything or i dont think she does all i remember is that she just goes across the pavement and throws up into a rubbish bin god what a script perhaps i shouldnt be wary of men in any case but of women women in black tracksuits she might use women exclusively in her death squads but i glanced across the two men over there at short intervals and others the short burmese standing with his back to the rail with the river behind him and his head turning in this direction every so often and the two thicknecked mongols on the far side of the flower stall they werent anything to do with it because they never spoke to the merchant it was just good available cover the skin crept at the nape of the neck aftermath of the neardeath experience discount but dont discount entirely well that was how i felt you see when he told me the same thing stephen only i didnt throw up i just turned and walked across the street and nearly got killed by a taxi and do you know she was watching me hard with her eyes narrowed to make sure i was listening do you know the thought that flashed into my mind as the thing came hurtling so close to me that it tore my dress i was hoping i was going to the because then hed be tortured with guilt for the rest of his life she shrugged and her thin shoulders came forward so i suppose i must have loved him to hate him that much how long ago was it three months three months and two days and how dyou feel now better for having got it off my chest for the thousandth time to a virtual stranger she puffed out a laugh youre a patient man im glad i could help can i have some more sake i got her some from the stall the two men in tracksuits were leaving not looking back they could have been looking at katie fairhaired and slender when i sat down again she said the reason why i was so terribly upset that night you know the night when you helped me at the thai embassy was because i realised later that when i slammed the door on you like that i was leaving you to go to your death or damned nearly i wouldve been almost the last person in this world youd have spoken to it gave me the willies i didnt sleep much afterwards she put her hand on mine for a moment im so glad youre all right who are they anyhow i dont know no one i recognised so you dont know why they attacked you no the burmese was a plainclothes man id got his attitude down now his movements he was watching a group of chinese at another table not me you must have some idea katie said quietly was it to do with your thai connection shed only seen me twice but each time it had been at their embassy possibly it was time to see what she could give me apart from the pain of a smashed marriage you asked me just now who i was im a weapons specialist i know representing laker foundry you checked with immigration we certainly did after what happened to you shed become quiet attentive maybe this was her real self intelligent serious now that shed got the stephen thing off her mind so it could have been shoda i said either shed pick it up or she wouldnt her eyes were suddenly intense and she straightened on her chair mariko shoda yes why should she want to kill you have i got your confidence you can take my word for what its worth how much is it worth its priceless she wasnt smiling all right weve found a leak at the factory one of our ultraspecial weapons has been reported missing in fact twenty or thirty prototype models we put out immediate feelers and our friends in the thai government said theyd seen this particular weapon being used on a target range in laos i waited id given her enough to get a lot more back if she wanted to talk whose target range which rebel group the thais dont know but they think it could be one of shodas i was using some of the briefing pepperidge had given me and some of what id heard from kityakara but from now on id have to feel my way she sipped her sake are you selling this weapon to the thais were negotiating terms one of which is that we dont sell it to anyone else in southeast asia whatever i said krtyakara would back it up if necessary that had been agreed if its so special mariko shoda would certainly want to get at it she toyed with her heavy gold chain the people who attacked you were women werent they except for the driver she uses women for her bodyguards i know that what else do you know about mariko shoda yes not a great deal but i might be able to find someone who does i mean she levelled her bluegrey eyes at me with that characteristic stillness youre going to need all the help you can get arent you she wont just leave it at that i was watching a short compact woman now not in a tracksuit but a chongsam she looked too athletic to be wearing silk too butch shed glanced across me two or three times from fifty feet away near the sushi bar but it was just my nerves if there were any kind of surveillance on me itd be from behind the kind of help i need i told katie is information she turned her head to watch a greek freighter moving past the docks on the river her eyes narrowed in thought what i know most about is the drug trade its part of my job to keep tabs on it for london were trying to help cut off the supplies but look if you think your special weapon whats it called or is it classified the slingshot pepperidge had said it was already in the press all right if you think its reached laos illegally what are you doing in singapore they wanted to meet me here the thais yes the woman in the chongsam was making distancecontact with someone else someone i couldnt see lifting her head slightly her gaze oblique oblique in this direction in the language of the trade it could mean several things but one of them was hes over there the greek ship gave a blast and the sound brought sweat out on me are you all right martin relatively katie didnt miss much you must still be a bit sore you smell like an operating theatre doesnt turn you on no but everything else does her thin shoulders came forward again as she folded her arms on the table looking down for a moment thinking then raising her head to look at me arent you absolutely scared out of your mind fraction edgy god ive never been so close to so much drama i said quickly i dont think youre in any danger katie im the one they want i dont really think i care she was looking over my shoulder now in my job life is so bloody i waited but she left it looking down again you really ought not to have any more sake i said she blew out a soft laugh its always my undoing at lunch time but it never makes me say things i dont mean now look if you want to know about the weapons trade out here youll have to know about the drug scene too theyre sort of interlocked the games the same in south america and turkey and everywhere else drugs for money for guns only here of course its on a massive scale do you want this now or some other time when dyou have to be back this is my day off i was just delivering a note to the embassy so to put the whole thing into a nutshell the power of the drug traders is just too big for anyone to break them were talking about half a trillion us dollars in annual sales i said trillion and the alliances between the dealers and the drugproducing countries are equally unbreakable the dealers the big ones have got more money than most of the governments in the world and theyve got their own shipping fleets air transports and even their own armies and the governments of the drugproducing countries cant be got at either i can give you a whole file on this from my office if you like i mean xeroxed but im just trying to this is exactly what i need the nutshell i had to take short cuts wherever i could find them on my way to ground all right she wiped the tip of her finger round the sake cup and licked it i mean reagan and thatcher and other world leaders have to give the people circuses you know the war on drugs bullshit but what else can they do they cant arrest foreign governments for producing drugs when theyve got political treaties and trade agreements with them she was looking behind me again her eyes ranging thailand and burma are the big centres here as im sure you know i mean there are some very ritzy clubs around in the major capitals where most of the members are growers refiners couriers dealers middlemen pilots you name it but what interests you is the arms connection ill i was standing over him and he looked frightened to death his eyes very wide and his mouth open and it took a second before i could cancel out the whole operation and get things back to normal though i knew itd take much longer than that for the adrenalin to shut off and the nerves to come down from their high it had just been the noise that was all hed dropped a metal tray and it had touched my left shoulder just lightly but enough to digger me and then the organism itself took over and i had a sensation of flowing light and a series of stopaction photographs the background swinging down as i was suddenly on my feet and then his face and body superimposed in closeup the ear temple neck the vital targets while my right hand was moving so fast that i felt the airrush even on its way up the reflex was still building up its force but the left brain had started doing some very urgent work and the motor nerves of my right arm got the signal just in time and the braced halffist stopped an inch short of his neck even though the necessary imagery was still flickering in my mind the knuckles moving through the sinews and crushing the carotid artery against the spinal column everything had slowed down and for a while we just stood there in a clumsy tableau the chinese in a halfcrouch with his eyes staring up into my face my arm fixed at an angle and my body leaning over as the force died away and the first breath came and sounds filtered into the consciousness and movement started up again faces in the background watching other still figures people poised in whatever act theyd been performing a hawker with a basket three women caught in midstride with their mouths open a small child staring upwards with a doll in its hand im sorry i said he was relaxing and straightening but not trusting me yet i picked up his tray and got my wallet out there was a whole spill of mangoes and papayas and oranges on the ground and my small bamboo chair was quite a long way off sorry i made a mistake i gave him a us note and he stared at it for a moment before he took it gingerly a mistake i told him all right katie was standing up too and i took her arm and she went with me between the little tables and the hawkers stalls and the trunks of the trees neither of us saying anything of course i was making a big deal of it in my mind because of the security situation but in point of fact the whole thing had happened so fast that no one had actually seen the details all theyd seen was a man standing up from his chair and accidentally knocking some fruit out of a hawkers hands but the rule is to get away fade leave as little as possible in peoples memory creating a scene is not terribly good cover we stopped to talk for a moment under a magnolia tree at the edge of the park is that the most help i can be katie asked me just to get information yes her eyes didnt leave my face i had the thought that she wanted to catch the memory of what i looked like in case she never saw me again i was watching the crowd she said behind you i know i dont want them to find you again maybe they wont the woman in the chongsam was just at the edge of my field of vision a blob of colour in the distance ill think of someone katie said who can tell you about mariko shoda thats what you need most of all isnt it yes a good source of information katie said in a moment would be johnny chen how much can i trust him all the way she wrote on a slip of paper and gave it to me you can find him there all right ill phone you as soon as i can i dont know where ill be if i gave her the number of the red orchid there was a risk she wasnt trained ill phone you at the high commission tomorrow all right and take this she wrote on an official card thats my flat in victoria street ill be home all evening i got her a cyclo youre not coming with me ill walk its the other way she touched my arm martin you already know how dangerous mariko shoda is so shouldnt you just call it a day im committed she compressed her lips i see when the cyclo started off she looked back once but didnt wave i began walking and after ten minutes the woman in the chongsam was still with me and after an hour there were two of them and i used right angles windows crowds cabs and any kind of cover that would give me five seconds and a vanishing point but i couldnt lose them and at the end of another hour there were three so it hadnt just been nerves not just nerves johnny chen who are you i didnt move my names jordan lamplight fell slanting across the rough timber wall what do you want here i couldnt see him he was behind me some information but why come here he dug into the psoas muscle katie sent me sent you she told me where to find you the balcony was thirty feet up and there was nothing i could do anyway by his tone he wasnt playing what name did she tell you johnny chen he began whistling softly no actual tune my face was still bleeding from the flying glass open the door i turned the loose brass handle there was a low light in the room and a smell i couldnt identity a chemical smell he patted me down get over there face to the wall crates everywhere crates and rope and a cluster of jade vases a buddha the light brightened as he switched another lamp on pictures of aeroplanes on the wall photos of crashes he was dialling perhaps id got it wrong or shed got it wrong and i wouldnt be able to trust him or trust her this wasnt bureau feeling my way through the dark the blood itched on my face it had taken me another two hours nearly till sundown to shake the tags and even then it had needed luck id gone into an office block and gained enough time to get round a corner and wait it had worried him this particular tag and he was running flat out his rubbersoled track shoes squeaking on the marble floor like a bird chirping and when i tripped him he span in a twisting arc and smashed through the glass door like a bomb fragments flying it was luck because they hadnt had time to cover the rear entrance johnny look theres a guy here says his name is jordan american accent oriental intonation so why didnt you call me to say someone gave a sigh or a yawn not chen i wanted to stop the itching but he wouldnt like it if i moved he wouldnt have put the gun down yet i was in laos he raised his voice okay turn around he was sitting in a bamboo chair with his flyingboots crossed on a table half desk half table the gun on his lap whats he look like i took in what i could a low divan with rumpled clothes in the shadowed corner more crates bamboo furniture mostly chairs some cheap handmade rugs it was a cavernous place a warehouse only two doors no windows lets have a snort it was by the river with the river smell mingling with the chemicals unrefined opium at a guess okay but katie dont ever send anybody here without talking to me first but youre beautiful he put the gun onto the table and sat upright sure see you around he rang off and threw me a packet of cigarettes and i caught it and threw it back trying to kick it sit down jordan i took a chair near him he was a full chinese scarecrowthin closecropped hair beginning to grey at the temples a weathered face something wrong with one ear tsoukai pieh chao wo the blankets on the divan moved and a naked woman rolled over and then stood up in the lamplight ivoryskinned tiny breasts jet black pubic hair walking to the inner door with her knees uncertain like a young colt taking its first steps she closed the door she was starving chen said pick em up for nothing he lit a black cigarette with a gold tip from the packet so whats the story jordan i told him i was with laker foundry and about the leak lets have a snort parrot so what precise information do you want i need to know as much as possible about mariko shoda he gave me a dead stare mariko shoda smoke drifted under the lamp jesus christ a cistern flushed behind the wall katie said you could tell me something about her mariko shoda he got out of the chair tall for a chinese walking like a cat crouched a little eyes on the floor thinking what did katie tell you about me jordan that you run a small freighter service and know your way around the southeast he nodded straightening up looking around the walls sure i fly everywhere i flew with the yanks in nam made good money this is me here come and have a look my whole life history he went on talking while he showed me the photographs four of them of light plane wrecks with chen standing on the top with a big grin and his arm in a sling or a pair of crutches under him what im doing now is kinda worse than those days in nam because youre strictly on your own and the name of the game is russian roulette youre due in at an illegal airstrip somewhere up there in burma or maybe laos and its night and all they can give you is a couple of flares this end of the strip and its thick jungle jesus and maybe youre down to the last sniff of gas even in the auxiliary tank which is often just a waterbed inside the cabin with you a potential fireball if you crash and sometimes youre not sure the strip is still in friendly hands and you can go down into machinegun crossfire thats happened to me twice look at this old crate see the holes but even if the strip is still friendly you can hit bumps or misjudge the flares or whatever and theres a gentlemens agreement youre a helluva long way from any kind of medical aid out there so if youre trapped in the wreckage or its on fire they just put a bullet in your head like you do with horses he led me back to the desk and we sat down you use a drink not just now so what happened to your face new blade he laughed in his throat you want to go clean up in a minute shes not still in the bathroom so you want some information on the telephone rang and he picked it up at first light sure if you can whats going to be the ceiling over the coast he listened and then said hell no im not putting down anywhere they just hung another bunch of guys over there did you hear about that he listened again and asked for an updated met report and rang off i dont ever do any trading see im just a transporter i never take possession that stuff over there is waiting for shipment and anyway most of the freight i hump isnt drugs its arms he got out of the chair cmon and take a look a nail screamed as he levered one of the crates open and showed me neat rows of ammunition perfectly stacked the steel and copper glowing in the light its mm nothing to write home about in this batch the more interesting stuffs in the other crates but i dont want to break the seals semiautomatics and some fullyauto calibres mostly belgian and some very nice riflescopes from hungary and some inserts he kicked a crate with his ripped leather flyingboot put them in a shotgun and you can feed it with mm or ammo just the trick for your triggerhappy anticommunist citizens up north around phnom penh or saravane you want any stuff like that for trading on the side you know where to find it he went back to the desk again then theres other stuff thats worth shipping around bit of gold gems things like that cut a small profit when you can you want some coffee jordan no thanks jesus you must have some very interesting secret vices he lit another cigarette so you want some information on little kissofsteel well i guess i dont have much but maybe its more than most people do he blew out smoke shes still only twentyone cambodian no bigger than this kid in here you saw just now lives very simply and controls maybe forty fifty million us dollars worth of business every year half in drugs half in armaments people who regard her as a friend give her presents an apartment in london or paris or new york or tokyo or a palace in rangoon or maybe a yacht off khiri khan or a shipment of diamonds from south africa people who regard her as an enemy also give her presents to calm her down a permanent suite at the manila mandarin gold ingots from pakistan with her name carved on them or a fleet of limousines she moves around in privacy using her own and going through the vip lounge with dark glasses on and a dozen bodyguards to keep people away because she doesnt like being photographed he got up again and unlocked the drawer of a massive japanese lacquered cabinet across the room and came back with an eightbyten photograph and gave it to me rather a lot of grain but the best i could do i turned it in the light this is mariko shoda that is mariko shoda he sat down leaning his arms on his knees dropping ash i was in transit in saigon and i happened to know she was coming in so i took a chance and hung around while my crate was being refuelled and i was lucky if thats what were going to call it she came out of her without her dark glasses on and i had a zoom lens ready and bingo isnt she pretty the grain was so bad that i had to hold the picture at arms length to smooth out the dots it was an arresting face yes high cheekbones and large eyes black hair cut like a boys her head was halfturned as if she suspected someone was watching what was the distance johnny two or three hundred yards but whenever she lands anywhere see she not only has a whole bunch of bodyguards close around her theyre all women by the way but she has a whole lot more waiting around the area placed there before she arrives one of them saw me take the picture i didnt know that but i wasnt taking any chances either so i mailed the film for processing right there at the airport he shrugged they got me that night on the street i still had the camera and they pulled it open and took the film that was in it no problem it was a new one blank and smashed the camera and then worked me over he tugged one of his earlobes this is my own but the left ones a prosthesis they stuck on for me at the hospital i hear shoda very clearly with it no photographs please he took the picture and said on his way to the cabinet i can let you have another print jordan if you want one nice pinup he locked the drawer again and came back but tell me something are you going to try getting near that gal possibly he pursed his mouth that could be difficult shed have to want a meeting and even then you should maybe think twice she has all these bodyguards but she does her own thing a lot of the time people always tell me the same tiling about little kissofsteel dont stand too close and above all dont touch and shes very spiritual she always prays for you before she kills of course she may take a shine to you but even then id be careful she has a keen sense of the priorities like the praying mantis the phone was ringing and he picked it up and spoke in hokkein which i didnt understand i got up and went to look at the stuff on the wall photographs pinups philosophical maxims there are old pilots and there are bold pilots but there are no old bold pilots some faded lading bills with customs franking a womans black lace glove and a dried monkeys head and a players cigarette packet with what looked like a bullethole through it and a lock of black hair in a blue ribbon i wanted to know as much about him as possible and particularly why hed met me with a gun in my back and ten minutes later had shown me around the place without even telling me to keep my mouth shut did he trust katie that much the way shoda works he was saying putting the phone down and coming over is something quite remarkable she never goes out to public places like restaurants and when she has to visit somebody downtown the most anyone sees of her is between the limo and the building dark glasses and bodyguards and the whole bit and those bodyguards are kind of cute too have you heard of the kunoichi i said i hadnt its the deadly sisterhood of the ninja originally japanese like the geishas they were trained in singing and entertaining see so they could get access into the household of an enemy warlord and just when hed gotten her nice and cosy in his arms hed end up with an icepick through the ear into the brain one of their favourite tricks in my language the ssu chieh wen the kiss of death you know something i was in phnom penh maybe around six months a beeper sounded and he broke off at once and went to the desk and picked up his gun you just stay there jordan ill be right back he went out through the door where the girl had gone not the one where hed brought me in at gunpoint so this was the alarm id tripped on my way up the outside staircase and there must be another one covering the entrance he was going to check on now i was tempted to get out of my chair and take a look at the crates and the other two desks and the japanese cabinet but i stayed where i was because i didnt know this man yet and i didnt know if hed simply asked the girl beforehand to trigger the beeper and give him an excuse to leave the room so that he could see what i did while he was gone i hadnt got access yet the most vital phase of the mission access to shoda and maybe he could give it to me he came back through the same door and went to the desk and dropped a small chamois bag onto it using a key on the padlock chuchu the key stuck and he had to worry it chuchu cmon in here she was wearing a cheap cotton shift now and looked younger than ever glancing at me and standing awkwardly in the middle of the room watching chen hold out your hand sweetheart he opened his own palm upwards hand this thing right she obeyed him hesitantly and he fished in the leather bag and dropped a ruby onto her palm a present okay worth a thousand dollars maybe more he stood over her pleased with himself with her with his gift youre my thousand dollar baby she gazed steadily at the gem it was cut polished and glimmering on her palm and i sensed the uncertainty in johnny chen now hed picked her up for peanuts probably from a refugee camp on the cambodian border or from parents who needed food for themselves more than a daughters mouth to feed and now she was his johnny chens but he didnt know how to get through to her perhaps on an impulse hed taken over a life and wasnt sure what to do with it present chuchu present he circled his hands awkwardly means i love you he kissed her on the brow and touched her cheek and came away you can stay here now gesturing to the divan chuchu stay okay she walked away with the gem held out in front of her gazing down at its colour i was aware of the softness of the nape of her neck the back of her knees okay shes just a kid chen said defensively but kids like her get raped every day over there up at the borders in the villages she doesnt get raped she gets loved okay i can see that okay so whats the deal jordan you want to know if little kissofsteel has this weapon youre talking about very much if she doesnt have it shed sure as hell maim it have you ever seen one no he toyed with the chamois bag but ive seen some of the specs id say if that thing got into the wrong hands in southeast asia we could see the whole damn place go up it can knock choppers out of the sky right any aircraft up to feet the bag hit the desk with a soft thump thirty thousand jesus christ and handheld thats more than the stinger can do by a factor of three he thought for a while his eyes down then he pulled another black cigarette out of the packet and lit up and looked at me through the smoke how long have you known katie mccorkadale we had lunch you must have impressed her perhaps shes just a good judge of character i guess i mean when katie tells me i can trust somebody its for real shes never been wrong thats why you had a gun in my back i didnt know you were from katie he picked some tobacco from his lip so ive told you what kind of woman this mariko shoda is you still want to meet her its why i came thing is he said watching me obliquely she doesnt want to meet you right werent you the guy in the limo few nights ago there wasnt anything in the news but theres a whole bunch of grapevines in singapore she got the wrong impression i said i dont mean her any harm that too was for the grapevine then youre pretty unusual he straightened on the bamboo chair and picked up the phone dialling couple of months back he told me someone divebombed a monastery where she stays sometimes blew it apart she wasnt home on the phone he asked for sam that gal has so many people who want her dead shes kind of jumpy i guess thats why she gave you the grief in the limo sam hows things listen do something for me i believe theres a guy named lafarge in town from bangkok hes due out of the airport some time in the next few days but i dont know which flight i know hes made a reservation because i picked it up when i was coming through anna siangs office can you hit the computer for me he dropped ash into the jade bowl on his desk okay get back to me sam he put the phone down and crossed his spiderthin legs like i was starting to say i was up in phnom penh a while back and took a chance and checked out an illegal airstrip out of the city we have to do that the flyers we need to know where the strips are and how to get in there if ever we have to and you never know when theres hundreds see make it thousands anyway i happened to see some troops drawn up in some kind of a training camp place was thick with barbed wire but you could catch a glimpse of what was going on the guys were being reviewed by their colonel as best i could see a tiny little guy but absolutely impeccable like they all were even from that distance i could see they were all officer rank by the uniform then i kind of put a few things together the location of the camp and the obviously elite performance going on see and then i got it that tiny little guy was mariko shoda because believe me there isnt another female colonel around in this neck of the woods i mean just to see the salute she snapped up even at that distance i knew i was in the presence of real style so thats shoda too shes the phone rang and he picked it up yes sure he pulled a scratch pad towards him and got a pen from a drawer ok i have that sam and listen i never asked you about this guy okay i didnt even call you up with the youknowwhat connection if theres any trouble its going to be my ass or head he asked about someone called lee and said give him my best and rang off tearing the top sheet from the pad and giving it to me okay dominic lafarge is a frenchborn naturalised thai subject and hes booked out on that flight in the morning he got himself naturalised because he works for shoda and she calls the shots from the grapevine i use lafarge has lived in thailand for the past ten or eleven years and at present hes the major source of the weaponry flowing into shodas hands and out again to the rebel forces in indochina he pressed his cigarette butt into the bowl i dont know what hes doing in singapore and i dont know whyhes flying to bangkok in the morning but if you asked me to make a bet id say hes very likely visiting his boss because thats where she is right now he got a fresh cigarette make any sense this grapevine how reliable is it i hadnt expected this amount of luck so early i was desperate for access because once i found a way in to shoda and her organisation i could leave the deadly environment of the open ground and go clandestine and that would give me a tenfold chance of survival and it would give me the mission the grapevine i use chen said is better than most what ive just told you about lafarge is true vouched for im in the arms trade okay i therefore make it my business to know the others so if you aim to tag on to this guy tomorrow youll at least know hes the right guy but whats going to happen to you at the other end of that flight god knows and dont hold me responsible youll be moving in to shodas territory i got up and walked around and looked at the photographs and the black lace glove and the dried monkeys head and the cigarette packet with the bullet hole in it and then came back to talk to johnny chen and took a risk so big that my skin crawled if i took that flight i wouldnt want you to tell anyone he got up and crushed out a butt and stuck his thin hands into his hip pocket and shrugged its your ass jordan if anything goes wrong but if anyone finds out youve got plans to take that flight it wont be from me i dont want your death on my hands i cleaned my face up in the small sandalwoodscented bathroom before he showed me out through the back way down some stairs and across a freightstorage hangar and through a door leading into an alleyway stacked with emptied crates and rubbish bins and oil drums with only one high yellow lamp at the corner of the warehouse happy landings he said and went back inside i spent thirty minutes checking the riverside environment before i walked into the open street and kept to whatever cover i could find trying to talk myself out of the halfknowledge that i was driving myself into a trap and talk myself into believing that id got access access to shoda and that tonight the mission had started running flight will mr martin jordan please pick up the nearest paging phone i didnt move it could only be chen if i took that flight i wouldnt want you to tell anyone i dont want your death on my hands so it could only be chen because only chen know i was here except for the airline staff and they wouldnt have me paged theyd phone the gate desk it could only be chen but the sweat had started running because id spent the last two hours securing the whole of the environment here the checkin counters and the telephones and the snack bar and the gate area because gate could be my way out of continuous and hazardous exposure above ground and my way into the safety of clandestine operation and i had to go through it clean all i could do now was use the softeyes technique and let the immediate scene come into the brain unfocused and ask the memory to alert me to any change there arent many situations worse than finding yourself ten paces away from the breakoff point between overt and clandestine and then have your cover name called out over a public address system i took my time half a minute but couldnt pick up any significant change in the movement around me no one turned on their heel within seconds of the pa call no one had started to move towards me no one was going to a telephone so i moved now because if i didnt theyd repeat the call and i didnt want that i picked up the phone yes is that mr jordan ice along the nerves it wasnt chen it was a womans voice and that was impossible correction not impossible no hed blown me please is that mr jordan a young womans voice asiatic japanese inflection i was still watching but with hard eyes now focusing remembering they were my friends here in this small comfortable area my good friends the three australians over there were booked to play in bangkok in the royal thai tennis championships one of them had just had a row with his wife and wished hed had time to make it up before he flew he didnt like flying the party of four people near the snack bar were from milwaukee theyd done hong kong and theyd done tokyo and now they were going to do bangkok including the phrakaeo wat and the royal palace and the reclining buddha and elmer had said if they didnt take home a halfton of souvenirs hed never let them set foot in the kawanis club again the two nuns by the gate were almost enveloping the teenage french girl in their black habits when id passed close to them twenty minutes ago maman had died at a hospital in singapore yesterday and they were escorting her to bangkok where papa was waiting for her the body had been flown out last night i knew a great deal about the rest of the passengers gathered here in the small comfortable area at gate enough to know that they were my friends my good friends if only because none of them was here to trap me into a shutended situation and set me up for the kill the only one here who wasnt my friend was the voice on the paging phone it is very urgent please are you mr jordan i didnt answer i needed time if i said no or just hung up i wouldnt learn anything and what i might learn could save me if i said yes theyd get here as fast as they could and they might not be far away we are now boarding passengers on flight for bangkok will passengers for bangkok please board at gate things i didnt understand the woman was phoning because she believed they believed i was here then why didnt they come here for me physically because they werent certain or there hadnt been time time since when since chen had blown me as far as liaison goes youll have to pick a few people yourself if you can find anyone you can trust chen katie mccorkadale but id known yesterday the risk i was taking when id asked chen to keep total security on my taking this flight and here was the moment of truth there wasnt a lot of choice if i dopped the phone and got out of the airport i might not be in time before they came in and i wouldnt learn anything anything this soft asiatic voice on the telephone might tell me if i stayed here and said yes this is mr jordan i could be doing precisely what they wanted me to do let her keep on talking to give them time to close in but this was a public place it is very urgent please are you mr jordan this was a public place and there wouldnt be anything they could do until i tried to get clear at the periphery and there was a chance a thin chance yes there was an echo but not on the line in the psyche mr martin jordan yes i began watching the walkway area where they would have to come will passengers on flight please board at gate we are boarding now for bangkoki saw lafarge going through with his two bodyguards id seen them when theyd come into the gate area lafarge dark elegant his initials on his pigskin briefcase the case chained to his left wrist his guards unobtrusive shutfaced tough trained others followed the two nuns with the little girl the americans i watched the walkway not taking my eyes away for an instant they would not be my friends when they came mr jordan you must not board that plane a man came running a man in a tracksuit with a flight bag running towards me along the walkway and i felt my nerves set ready for preservation mr jordan do you understand you must not take flight running hard but not towards me now veering for the group at the gate hey charlie tell em to wait or theyll start the tennis match without you my son so i mustnt take this flight why not you little bitch sweat running all passengers must now board flight for bangkok at gate we are leaving in five minutes it tallied with the figures on the departure screen mr jordan she didnt sound impatient she sounded concerned emphatic please tell me that you understand what i am saying it is very urgent not very ive got five minutes i asked her who are you it is not important mr jordan i have information that concerns your welfare there will be an accident do you understand what kind of accident to the plane to flight then youd better tell someone the pilot might be interested the timing was becoming critical and i began watching the walkway half the time and the departure gate half the time i didnt know if i could learn anything more from the soft urgent little voice on the line or whether this was all that someone shoda was trying to stop me boarding the flight for bangkok the time gap was narrowing quite fast now and the best way i could use it would be to stay here on the line in the hope of learning something more and wait until the girl at the gate began closing it then get there get on the plane if anyone came along the walkway who looked dangerous i could go through the gate anyway and they wouldnt be able to follow if they came here for me at all theyd be in a hurry getting here while the woman kept me on the line this is the final call for passengers on flight for bangkok two more people went through and the girl looked around the gate area for stragglers checking her passenger list and finding one missing there was nothing she could do about it all she could see was a man using a paging phone are you still there mr jordan yes what is the source of your information it is reliable i am your friend mr jordan please listen to me there will be no survivors on flight you must not take it all right ill go and warn the crew they would not believe you any more than i believe you for the first time her voice had a note of impatience the hint of a sigh not impatience exactly resignation if you wish to live mr jordan you must not take the plane that is all i can do for you maybe if i told the girl at the gate i was officially working for the thai government and showed the laissezpasser that prince kityakara had given me shed at least tell the captain but i still had no source to offer except a voice on a telephone what kind of accident will it be is there a bomb on board if i could give them any details they might listen i must go now mr jordan i am sorry there will be no survivors the girl at the gate was giving herself a manicure one pantyhosed leg crooked her head tilted in concentration i am going now the voice on the line told me there was something getting through to me but i didnt know what it was it was simply a feeling there wasnt time to work out the dozen or so explanations for this call on the paging phone a decision had to be made and it had to be made now and there was absolutely no reason to think that this wasnt a crude lastminute attempt to keep me here in singapore and on treacherous open ground instead of going to the gate and apologizing to the girl and slipping through to the safety of clandestine operations but i listened to the voice not hers not the voice on the line but the one in my head in the primitive brain stem the seat of intuition im taking the flight i said on the principle that if you change direction you must cover your tracks then i put the phone down and went over to the gate and showed my thai government credentials and told the girl that id learned from an unidentifiable source that flight to bangkok was compromised she phoned the agent at the other end of the runnel and i was put on to the captain direct as i watched the starboard wing moving slowly past the window the was backing under tow and over the phone i could catch the copilot going through the routine checks with the tower the captain asked me the expected questions and i hadnt got any answers i told him that to satisfy myself i wanted him to know that an unidentified womans voice on a pagingphone had told me that his aircraft would have an accident two of the airlines officials came along to the gate and talked to me but there wasnt anything i could add and they finally told me that the security checks at this airport were the most sophisticated in the world and that id probably been the victim of a hoax my name was noted and i was thanked for my concern eleven minutes later i watched flight turn heavily at the end of the taxiing road and line up with the runway and wait for the green and then gun up and start rolling it was airborne at on schedule it was then that i knew that because of touchy nerves id let shoda set me up and that my chances of seeing nightfall would have been infinitely greater on flight than here on the ground in singapore where she knew how to find me she swung round on the staircase martin framed by the light from a high window her hair was still moving her lips parted her eyes wide shadowed i said hello she came down slowly not looking away from me one foot faltering in its highheeled sandal her thin hand sliding down the banisterrail as if she were feeling her way when she came down the last step she was still watching me mesmerised then she just look a pace and leaned against me with her head on my shoulder and stayed perfectly still in a whisper oh thank god i held her until in a minute she straightened up her eyes were wet and she lifted a cupped hand tilting her head oh bugger can you help me bloody contacts they always float loose when i cry we found it in the palm of her hand and she got it back deftly on the tip of her finger and i wondered how much practice shed had how often shed cried because of stephen she looked at me steadily again why werent you on board i didnt answer there was a lot to work out you do know it crashed i suppose yes it had been on the radio an hour ago no survivors my god its a miracle i mean she brushed the air helplessly i was sitting there in my office today for about half an hour for exactly half an hour because i remember looking at the clock sitting there knowing you were dead i didnt know if the timing was accurate because i didnt know when shed heard the news of the crash but i wanted to when did you hear about it about an hour ago they said youd phoned no when did you hear it had crashed she looked confused about im not sure soon after noon i think and when did you hear i was still alive i told you an hour ago why and how did you know that she was watching me with her eyes narrowing they phoned me the people here one of the staff came down the stairs a thai girl loaded with files dropping a pencil i picked it up thank you are you being helped yes katie said tip from the british high commission when the girl had gone she said theres a little office here where we can talk no lets go up there i told her there was a gallery on the floor above overlooking the entrance and the staircase rooms even small rooms in embassies even the embassies on friendly territory are notorious for being bugged we went up the stairs together her timing was probably accurate then because as soon as id heard the news of the crash id phoned the thai embassy because lafarge was dead and my access was cut off but there was a chance i could rescue just a thread why did the people here phone you i asked her she looked surprised because you were on the passenger list there were windows along the gallery facing the buildings on the other side of the street the strong afternoon light streamed in throwing thick shadows across the carpeting glowing on some crimson leatherbound books i sat clear of the window how did you know i was on the passenger list she pulled her soft briefcase closer to her on her lap hesitating before she spoke but not because she didnt know what to say i sensed but halfdeciding not to answer at all whenever theres a transport accident she said deliberately we always check on the passengers in case theres a british national involved so that we can help relatives i think we do quite a good job at the high commission looking after our people it was very quiet here and motes of dust floated in the sunshine there were the distant sounds of a telephone in someones office thai voices muted quick footsteps across marble i supposed most people were at lunch at this hour why did this embassy call the high commission to say i wasnt on flight she said carefully theyre friendly to us thailand is an ally of the west her eyes were still narrowed and i didnt think it was anything to do with the contact lenses how did they know i hadnt gone on board i knew but i wanted to know if she did they said youd phoned them to when a few minutes after the news came on the radio did they tell you why i phoned them they said you were going to be here who spoke to you on the phone i dont know or id tell you its odd she said looking away its the first time someone hasnt trusted me it makes me feel rather sordid i realised i was aware of totally irrelevant things the soft arch of her neck as she sat with her head down the sharp outline of her nipples under the tan cotton shirt her stillness how long i asked her have you known chen she looked up who johnny chen oh i dont know i think about three years three or four years why didnt you find him helpful not terribly he suggested i should take flight thered been footsteps and they were coming closer along the gallery it was one of the staff all white blouse and navy blue skirt and heavy glasses mr jordan excuse me for disturbing you its thai international airlines on the telephone tell them ill ring them back they said it was urgent mr jordan id been expecting a call i said to katie dyou mind you want me to wait for you if youve the time all right in the girls office i told the man on the phone that id nothing to add id done all i could to warn the captain and all i knew about the voice on the pagingphone was that it had been a young asian womans possibly japanese did she mention what kind of accident might happen mr jordan would happen would as i told the captain and your airport officers you must understand mr jordan that we have to do everything possible to trace that caller we need to establish responsibility this is a major disaster for us so forth and understandable but it brought back the scalding onrush of guilt id felt when id listened to the radio in als bar knowing then that i should have forced them to hold that plane and search it i told the man yes he could send someone round here to talk to me but i might be leaving soon no i didnt know if id be available as a witness at the enquiry katie was sitting just where id left her but hunched on the cushioned windowseat her long legs drawn up and her arms round her knees thank you for waiting she didnt answer glancing across my eyes that was all they dont know anything new i said and took one of the louis chairs johnny chen she said in a moment is a drug transporter not a drugrunner theres a difference but even so i can imagine how youre feeling its the second time youve escaped death in a matter of days so you cant trust anyone i can vouch for chen but whats the good of my word if you dont trust me its nothing personal she swung her head and looked at me isnt it martin you cant be di or wed have been asked to help you but what and she stopped right there looking away again did chen tell you i might take that flight no why should he she came unhunched and put her feet on the floor and sat hugging her briefcase her shoulders forward protecting herself martin do you think they were trying to kill you again no they wouldnt need to blow up a planeload of people just to get at me theyll come for me on the street she leaned nearer me prepared to meet my eyes again after the anger i wish you werent so bloody matteroffact about it i also wish but she had the habit of leaving things unsaid footsteps again and i looked across at the staircase this time it was rattakul the thai security officer id been here to see mr jordan he stopped short and i went over to him your request has been approved when can i leave immediately give me two minutes ill be down there in the hall i went back to katie and found her with the briefcase open this came for you martin from cheltenham long manila envelope thick diplomatic bag frankings the only thing i could imagine pepperidge sending me was a breakdown on the thai security personnel which was why hed sent it to the high commission instead of here he trusted her that much i took it from her im not sure i said when ill be back where are you she left it looking down zipping her briefcase shut i went down and found rattakul waiting for me ash it was difficult to see clearly with the gas mask on who would warn me voiced were muted there were no echoes here most of them spoke in thai a few in american english who would warn me it kept repeating itself in my mind but there was no answer yet it was important for me to know but apart from that what id missed was now being brought home to me another yellow plastic bag was zipped shut and taken away we were north of chathaburi in deep jungle a light breeze was blowing taking the fumes away to the east upwind we could take our masks off and exchange information but they had to be worn in the vicinity of the wreckage itself rattakul the thai intelligence officer whod brought me out here said it was raw opium burning though god knew what opium was doing on a flight from singapore to bangkok there was mess wherever i looked smashed bulkheads seats torn panels windows and lengths of white wire thousands of lengths miles of it buried or halfburied in the churned scorched earth of the jungle some of the bits and pieces were painted with yellowgreen inhibitor that the fire hadnt reached and had serial numbers on them when you pulled just one piece of wire youd unearth a tiny electronic component a miniature junction or relay or fuse i didnt pull at any wire id just seen one of the wreckage analysis team doing it i was here to hunt inside the unburnt forward section flight had come down windmilling someone told me cutting a swathe through the heads of the palm trees and the tropical undergrowth like a spinning scythe and then the rear section had broken away and taken fire and was still smouldering sending a whitish stream of smoke into the emerald green undergrowth eastwards on the breeze the choppers had come down in the clearing to the west upwind of the wreck thered been five of them here already when our own had brought us in more than an hour ago two red cross a military and two civilian machines work had been delayed because of the fumes theyd sent one of the military aircraft up again to fetch the gas masks a young rescue worker with no one to rescue said there was a tiger half a mile to the east hed seen it as the chopper had come down if theres a tiger there the american analyst had said then hes stoned out of his mind another yellow bag was zipped shut and lifted by two men one of them let his end slip from his hands and drop he got it up again and they trudged off through the mess of torn earth and leaves and ash and soot their boots tripping on the webs of white wire everywhere who mould warn me i should have been in one of these yellow plastic bags now but for the voice on the paging phone this morning who was she at a guess she must belong to whatever group had brought down flight it had been a strictly clandestine action and anyone outside the group wouldnt have known what they were going to do there will be no survivors even with the gas masks we couldnt shut out the bittersweet smell of cremated flesh it was heavy on the air before we put the masks on and got trapped inside sweat was running on me stinging and itching under the hospital dressings and my left wrist burned i didnt know if there was anyone here among these twenty or thirty men whod been sent to finish me off somehow i wasnt in good shape and it worried me but i couldnt have stayed away the death of lafarge had cut off the access id hoped to gain and if there were a new thread to follow id find it here at the end of an hour id covered the first row of seats in the forward section looking carefully at the debris for the body i was looking for it was going to take time because the explosion the american analyst had said yes thered been an explosion first and the windmilling action and the final impact had turned the inside of the plane into a maelstrom and the fire had smothered everything in ash and silvergrey soot you didnt expect to find people still sitting in orderly rows the cabin was tilted almost upsidedown in the thick vegetation it was worse in the rear section where they were hunting for the black box because of the fire rattakul had presented his credentials to the chief of security here and got me cleared and now he was covering me watching everything as the rescue team worked alongside their movements slow and their gloved hands gentle there was no hurry now and this was sacred ground i took a break find out will you i asked rattakul who everyone is id like to know it was partly to get rid of him for a bit he haunted me but it would also be useful to know if there was anyone here who couldnt be accounted for hed have the authority to question them a chopper was taking off from the clearing and the turbulence from its rotors stirred the smoke swirling it in a vortex and we put our masks on again silence came back when the machine had gone an eerie silence disturbed by sounds muted by the echoeless jungle men coughing inside their masks the clink of metal as someone used a fireaxe to clear the debris the cackling of a monkey high in the tropical vines rattakul came back in half an hour the minister of civil aviation is here and the chief of the national transportation safety board also the president of the airline the rest are their staffs the red cross workers the rescue teams and the wreckage analysts he watched me wiping out the inside of the mask ive asked all of them for their identity cards all of them thank you he was short compact impeccably dressed in the ubiquitous khaki tunic and slacks and had the eyes of a man id rather count a friend than an enemy whenever a chopper arrives check it out too will you i went back into the wreckage helping one of the rescue team clear the debris from the seat area at some time after the jet had come down the wind must have changed because the whole of the front section was smothered under a pall of ash and soot and as we picked gently at the shapes still hanging from the seatbelts or lying huddled or spreadeagled among the jungle leaves we unearthed bright colours suddenly the red of a childs tshirt the brash gilded cover of a paperback the stripes of a silk tie sometimes often during the next hour the rescue workers would stop and put their gloved hands together in brief prayer one of them working alongside me just stopped moving and crouched there in the mess of soot and began shaking and when i touched him he broke down completely and i led him away and left him with someone then rattakul came over masked and beckoning and i followed him through the swathe of vines where men were working with machetes to clear them when we could take off our masks rattakul took me to talk to the american analyst who was crouched over some kind of mess that was all there was here an assortment of different kinds of mess hi it was a bomb he prodded fragments and pointed to things one of them a mans head he blew himself apart with it look at this heres the central source of the blast see these panels his bodys over there no clothes on it blew them away no identification i was tidalbreathing we all were in the past hours the reek of death had been growing stronger what nationality would you say he was for me thats not so easy he looked up at rattakul i guess youd have a closer idea i would say burmese he crouched with us narrowing his eyes as he looked at the head the face then he looked away and stood up whys it so undamaged i asked the american it was the way the blast went mostly into his body before it took off through those panels his head was forced upwards and back from under the chin see here and this flap of skin why would a burmese want to blow up this plane be a drug connection i guess not political the opium shouldve been unshipped in singapore but maybe there was a check in progress so they had to ferry it back he gave a shrug listen most major crime in this area is drugconnected and theres intense rivalry i went back to the forward section and started work again the thing was how had anyone got a bomb past one of the most sophisticated security systems in the world it could have been sheet plastic pressuredetonated in the heat of the midafternoon the mosquitoes came in and the red cross people handed out citronelle later they brought sandwiches and coffee and we sat on the cool fibrous earth clear of the wreckage to take a break a light plane was circling with big red letters on it tv bangkok banking sharply to get the camera angles it wanted choppers were leaving regularly now returning regularly taking the bodies out and bringing in supplies parka jackets torches tools every time a machine landed rattakul went across to it as soon as the rotor began slowing then he came back to tell me who had arrived four priests were now among us a catholic and three buddhists in saffron robes incense blended with the other smell the thick overall inescapable smell the wind had died and the freight had burned out under the fire foam the air was still and sounds seemed louder and we spoke even more quietly towards dusk they found the black box and brought it clear of the mess it looked intact it had been in the tail section but was fireproof the american carried it to his chopper tenderly later hed listen to the voices that had been silenced here among the trees as the big jet had come whirling through them from the sky mortally crippled and carrying only the dying it was easy to believe as dusk turned to dark that the spirits of the departed were stealing through the shadows thrown by the floodlights the rescue team had rigged because we were tired now and the stress of what we were doing had soaked us in our sweat we itched all over because of that and the mosquitoes things had got worse progressively because the more ash and soot and debris we removed from the mess the more we discovered of people their faces hands feet the colours of their clothes the things that had belonged to them that had been so important a nuns rosary jade buddhas with the price still on a tennis racket kangaroo king later the moon rose and the jungle held back a little the shadows shifting as more lamps were rigged the throb of the generator motors was constant punctuated by the cries of birds and monkeys restless and uneasy among the trees by midnight we were shivering and the jackets were passed round the night had taken on the semblance of a slidelecture without sound as consciousness took pictures sometimes out of sequence a man flicking away a halfdead snake with a bamboo stick a red cross worker standing perfectly still with tears streaking the sootfilm on his face a panel breaking away and a body falling to the jungle floor groaning as the air was forced from its lungs to be surrounded at once by a dozen of us but that yes was all it was just the air in its lungs by three in the morning we were working without any more pauses for breaks because every time we took a rest we knew what we had to go back to and it was easier to stay with it and get it over though by now it seemed wed been here all our lives been born here just to do this and would go on doing it and never be done our eyes fatigued and losing focus had to keep on adjusting as someone moved a floodlight on its stand and the moon brightened and the landing lights of another helicopter flooded the scene and froze us in a silvergrey wash then i found lafarge he was flattened against a bulkhead that had been thrown thirty feet from the cabin section his seatbelt had snapped and hed been catapulted forward it had taken an hour to clear the debris away from him and get a look at his face id seen him at the airport and he was still recognizable though his face was now ashen and his scalp had been ripped away the briefcase was still chained to his wrist and when i wiped the soot away i could see the initials djl heavily embossed in gold his keys were in his pocket and i tried the smallest of them first opening the chainlock and bringing the case away the chain with it rattakul took me across to the chief of the thai police unit and i signed the necessary form undertaking to return the undermentioned passengers personal effects these being one leather briefcase and contents not herein identified then we picked our way rattakul and i across the web of white wires and the lampcables and the torn treeroots to where our small military helicopter was standing this is what you came for he asked me yes it was all he said and all i said we were dogtired dirty and depressed and my mind kept shifting focus from the comfortable airconditioned gate area where the nuns had gathered the young girl to them her pale face upturned and the australian had gone running past me hey charlie tell em to wait shifting focus to the grey and shapeless grave that we were leaving behind us in the jungle night as the machine lifted and the pilot opened his set and reported departure at two thoughts came together in my mind one was that mariko shoda hadnt ordered flight destroyed because lafarge the chief source of her arms supplies had been on board so it had been someone else and they might have ordered the bomber to carry out his mission for the same reason that lafarge had been on board and on his way to meet shoda so what worried me as we headed south for chathaburi was that the briefcase that had been chained to lafarges wrist was now chained to my own voices this sides the flight data recorder which does pretty well what youd think the american wiped the bright orange casing with his sootsmudged handkerchief his name was bob ryan it records the time speed heading and altitude of the airplane and every movement it makes climb descent turns gravitational forces acceleration stuff like that this sides the cvr cockpit voice recorder it picks up from a mike in the flightdeck ceiling every sound there is radio speech and ordinary conversation between the crew he glanced at me with his redrimmed eyes it was now gone six in the morning and we still hadnt slept rattakul had talked to the chief analyst a thai when we landed in chathaburi and arranged the meeting i wanted to know whether the crash of flight had in fact been drugrelated as the analyst had said or not it wasnt anything i could find out from the black box directly but it might give me a lead the tapes run for thirty minutes rayn said and then erase themselves thats considered long enough to give us all we need to know about an accident situation often its much less maybe a couple of minutes or even a couple of seconds like when they hit a mountain in the fog sitting slumped in the tubularframe chair he reached for the box again okay well just give it a whirl while we were listening i peeled off the red cross parka there was no airconditioning in the small cluttered office rattakul sat upright near the window with his hands on his lap his eyes uneasy on our way out of the jungle hed told me hed survived a major crash three years ago and still had nightmares altitude airspeed knots then there was some conversation in thai and i asked ryan to give me anything important he was fluent we heard some laughter and i looked at the american but his eyes were closed his head was forward and i thought he might be dozing off heading medium aircraft at nine oclock four miles five to six thousand feet below i looked at the map on the wall flight was at that time fifty miles or so northwest of chathaburi on an almost direct course for bangkok airspeed were descending to there wasnt a crump or anything but ryans eyes came open it had sounded more like a break in the transmission but now there was muffled noise coming in and he started translating from the thai as speech broke out thats the captain telling everyone to stay calm says theres been an explosion and hes going to try putting the ship down at the nearest alternate there was a jumble of sounds and then the flightdeck door clicked open and a womans voice came clearly she says theres a hole blown in the cabin oxygen masks are mostly in place theres not too much panic but we were listening to screams now one of them a childs then in accented english there has been some kind of explosion in the rear section of the cabin we are losing height airspeed and directional capability please have chathaburi give me a runway and there was a break then more voices in thai quick and urgent the door was still open to the sounds coming from the main cabin i glanced at rattakul he had his eyes shut now squeezed shut eleven minutes after the explosion the jets altitude was only two thousand feet ryan was sitting upright peeling the silver paper off a packet of chewinggum his eyes on the box we are now out of control and starting to spin a left spin a lot of noise came in and the loudest was the screaming and i heard ryan say fuck under his breath before he prodded the stick of gum between his teeth his eyes never leaving the box it is reported that fire has broken out in the rear section and we are sending extinguishers back there but me sound of buffeting now and a steady roaring in the background probably the airrush past the hole in the cabin wall the screams went on and i thought of the little girl and the nuns and the australian while the captain started talking again but now in his own tongue says there isnt anything more he can do ryan told us there was sweat on his face on all our faces says theyre just going to then he broke off and stared at the box in silence for a while i told rattakul he could go outside if he wanted to but he didnt answer maybe didnt take it in okay hes theyre praying now just praying and ryan got out of his chair and stood with his hands dug into his belt his body in a crouch just doing that and asking to have messages sent to their mothers jesus christ its always then a lot of sound like drumming drumming and creaking and buffeting and a mans voice in thai hes saying jesus can you beat these guys hes telling the captain its been an honour to serve with him a lot of sound now and i got up too and stood with my back to the box and began counting for some reason and got to nine before there was a break in the transmission and silence total silence it went on for a bit and then ryan said in frustration i mean i just dont know how many times ive had to listen to that bullshit but its never any different it still gets to you he went across to the coffee percolator and busied himself making a noise you guys ready for your caffeine shot rattakul went out now his face pale and closed the door quietly circumspectly the rest of it is ryan said weve started getting some stuff from the aviation toxicology lab he looked for some papers on the desk near the silent box case no received by j mathieson from dr lee yu samples one bag of human bone one container each of muscle and hair ill have them give you copies of all this stuff as it comes in okay he dropped the sheet onto the desk and paced around the office a cup in his hand some of its always misleading like we get a whole lot of heartfailures on this kind of trip but often theyre not actual failures or even heartattacks when people know they dont have a chance any more they produce tremendous tensions and it just rips at the heart muscle and breaks it down what im saying is you shoot a guy in the back of the head and the autopsy doesnt show any heartfailure but these guys on the flightdeck can see it coming and theyll build up so much tension in them that it kills weve had control columns torn clean out by the roots and captains with their arms broken by the force they used trying to get the nose of the ship up it isnt the contraction of the muscles that does that its the amount of pretension in them but im not an expert on this stuff they could give you a more accurate picture at the tox lab but i doubt youll find that bomber died of what looked like heartfailure jesus anyone who can board a plane and sit there waiting to get blown up with it had to have pretty good nerves he drained his cup and took it over to the sink do you think his motives were drugrelated he swung his head up to look at me id say the only thing that isnt drugrelated in this whole area is the salvation army and you know what that jet was carrying dont you thered been a slipup somewhere along the line no one ships poppymilk from singapore to thailand thats the wrong way around the name on the passenger list was burmese doesnt have to mean anything in this area you get people who are chinesefrenchcambodian britishmalaysianindian you name it shifting populations adopted refugees mixed blood from colonial times that kind of thing then theres singapore he picked up his flightbag cupping a yawn i dont know about you but im ready to crash jesus what am i saying where are you chathaburi air force base thailand a tall steel mast flexing in the nightwind am cheltenham six thousand miles away id slept until noon why did you miss the flight i was warned off it who by i dont know i told him about the voice on the paging phone it could only have been the thais no theyd have stopped the flight and made a search a young lieutenant came into the office whistling oh excuse me he went out again what i asked pepperidge then youve got friends out there not the kind i like you mean the woman on the phone was involved it points to it what are you doing to find out who they are everything i can but thats not much that stuff you sent i said looks clean enough but you wouldnt be able to pick out a mole cant trust the thais totally or anyone why did you send it to me through the mccorkadale woman because shes impeccable spell it out for me her fathers sir george mccorkadale the mp she was at the foreign office for five years and shes been in singapore for three the british high commissioner speaks highly of her otherwise he said tardy i wouldnt have used her to pass the material she sent me to a man called chen and he tipped me off to take that flight ive done some homework on him too at the moment hes in shock the copilot on that plane was his best friend i didnt say anything i was thinking does that help he asked me yes quite a lot i thought he was all right and maybe he is if chen were totally secure i could use him again if things got tricky did you find out anything from the wreck hold it a minute there was an f taking off outside and the office became a membrane filled with its powerscream when quiet came back i told pepperidge quite a bit what was in the briefcase thats not bad i said he sounded indignant again i dont sleep when theres work to do ive been in signals with the thais most of the night no offence none taken so what was in it copies of the blueprints for the slingshot including specifications modifications computerised performance figures and component manifest there was a short silence good god dominic lafarge was the shoda organisations main armament source i know he said but why who is general dharmnoon there was another silence he was doing a lot of thinking which didnt surprise me hes shodas chief army commander in charge of all her splinter groups there was a copy of a letter in the briefcase written to mariko shoda it said that lafarge was at present furthering arrangements for the acquisition of one hundred slingshots as outlined to general dharmnoon thats a quote i waited for him to do some more thinking suddenly aware of the sharp smell of antiseptics an itching under the left wrist hunger theyd changed the dressing for me at the base hospital and i hadnt eaten since the red cross had brought us the sandwiches at three oclock this morning faint voices from outside one of them an americans they cant buy them pepperidge said for acquisition read steal absolutely ill tell laker foundry to double the guard at the factory and i dont know why youre so wary of johnny chen this is a major breakthrough just that it crashed ill get over it the memory wasnt ready to let go yet that was all the memory of the two voices the one on the paging phone there will be an accident do you understand and the one on the radio three hours later it has just been reported that a thai international airlines plane has come down in deep jungle north of chathaburi the names of the crew and passengers are being withheld until more information is available one of the names on the passenger manifest had been martin jordan yes i heard pepperidge saying i know how you must have felt with hesitation he said they kept me up to date you see the thais so i knew you were down to take that flight and when they signalled me that it had crashed i broke the rules and hit the scotch for a while all right now stone cold sober you understand i suppose that a hundred of those things would give mariko shoda complete control of all air movement up to thirty thousand feet wherever she chose to deploy them just a hundred launchers plus say ten missiles to each he was right major breakthrough its coming together i said indeed and too bloody fast ive got to go and get a few people out of bed do some phoning round london look can you send me copies of that stuff in the briefcase theyre on their way where to the thai embassy in london i did it from the air base here through bangkok first rate i need to check them later with laker for authenticity have you got anything else for me no well this is more than enough to get on with listen old boy hesitating again i ran into fletcher yesterday i waited the only fletcher he could mean was a highechelon control at the bureau i didnt say where you were of course or what youre doing but theyd take you back you know any time no once youve gone we can never ask you back that bastard loman changed his tune theyd be pretty accommodating theyd send you a director in the field right away anyone you asked for even ferris my god what wouldnt i give for ferris they cant touch it i said you know that they havent got strictly under the table of course thats where they put that fucking bomb in a moment he said ruefully message understood but i want to ask you something when can you go to ground as soon as i can youre not going to survive otherwise they wont just leave it like that he meant the clowning around in the limousine i know as soon as i can ive got someone standing by he said out there listen if you now dont fidget all ive told him is that i might want to call on him at any given moment hes very good and ive told you i dont i simply want you to know he said with studied patience that if you ever need support youve got it instantly if for instance you decided you cant trust thai intelligence i didnt say anything he waited and then asked have you ever heard of a man in that region named colonel cho how do you spell it cho no if you do tell me hes someone im working on and listen signal me at any time on any subject and ill get to work immediately with a kind of weary persuasion i really am on the ball you know i told him i understood dial then i rang off and wondered if i should have told him that id just made up my mind to do the most dangerous thing id ever done in any mission up to now better to have left it hed only have hit the bloody scotch again shoda dusk was falling it lowered among the cypresses softening the edges of the shadows as the days light died covering them minute by minute until the lawns and the pathways began losing substance leaving only the slender trees to stand on their own holding the sky aloft on their dark columns the air even at this hour was not still it was filled with the gongs vibrations the gong was huge hanging between the beams of its timber frame and the striker itself was massive ten feet long and hewn from a single tree trunk its end capped with cowhide to muffle the sound its cords passing through a pulley as big as a mans head a monk in a yellow robe dragged on the end of the main rope timing the strokes at long intervals so that the gongs sound was a continuous vibration booming and fading but never becoming silent it seemed to possess the power of something palpable as if without its presence filling the air the whole temple would fall down i had come alone the catafalque was ornate red and gold and encrusted with carvings and six men were bearing it step by step across the ancient stones four monks paced beside it intoning the prayer for the dead khor hai khwarm song cham khong thun dai rap karn uay phorn khor hai phraphutthaong rap than wai nai phramahakarunathikhun talord karn dominic edouard lafarge inside the temple the light was low coming mainly from the lanterns hanging from the arched ceiling but also from the rows of candles burning beneath the many buddhas as the guests came in more were lighted and more prayers said khun yang khong pen thi rak loch yang khongyu nai khwarm song cham khong thuk khon khwarm khit khamnueng khong rao thueng than ca tham hat vinyarn khong than pay su sukhati talord kam in here the air was heavy with incense there was no music but the cavernous space made an echo chamber for the booming of the great gong outside the guests were either in black or white many of them robed as the catafalque was lifted to the raised platform two men opened the top and the right hand of dominic lafarge was exposed palm upwards with its fingers curled the mourners had already formed a line and one after another poured the holy water into his hand above a chasedsilver bowl than priap samuean phi khong rao sueng sathit yu ban suang sarvan id come alone because i didnt want the responsibility of anyone elses life i hadnt even told rattakul where i was going because where i was going was into hazard taking a calculated risk this was hostile ground and my only chance was that it was also sacred there werent many guests but i sensed that it wasnt because lafarge lacked status but because mariko shodas organisation practised privacy most of the people here would be the elite of her entourage including i hoped general dharmnoon i suppose the chances of talking to him in any safety were less than a hundred to one but if i could talk to him knowing what i did i could accelerate the mission and get close to the objective and find out what i had to do then how to destroy shoda without killing her this much had been understood by pepperidge and was understood by prince kityakara and his intelligence services the only time ive ever killed except to save my life was to avenge a womans death its never in any case an elegant solution to take a life shows a lack of style chrvit than nai lok manut dot rap toe ktvarm chokdi lath chrvit khong than bon saman korjah pen chen diokan there were several roundeyes among the guests as i knew there would be from what chen had told me shoda employed europeans otherwise i couldnt have come as it was i stayed at the back of the congregation near the massive decorated doors there was constant movement the mourners were now approaching the catafalque again to light candles and leave them on the dais below it with posies of canework flowers smoking with incense one of the mourners was in uniform but not of the thai army two aides flanked him perhaps general dharmnoon i began watching him wherever he moved i was also watching the environment as more people came in along the gallery that circled the temple there was movement sometimes or it seemed like it i couldnt be sure the lamplight threw shadows there and there seemed to be patches of reflected light the size of a human face aware of them i began thinking for the first time that coming here had not been a calculated risk but a fatal error nerves the ritual of death in here was subtly playing on them five monks in saffron robes took their place near the catafalque bareheaded but holding ornate fans to hide their faces as they chanted their prayers rao phu sueng mai dap rap khrvarm karuna hat farm than pai jah raluek thueng chrvit khong than duai khwarm thertthun talord karn then it began and i wasnt ready for it one of the women only halfseen in her black robes was moving down the aisle towards the catafalque and several others were going with her but at a slight distance falling away in a soft wave of silk and giving her room their robes too were black their sandals would be making a susurration on the marble floor but because of the monks chanting they seemed to move in perfect silence spreading out as they reached the wide space before the dais like the petals of a black tulip opening at the same time there was movement among the rest of the throng though hardly even that a stirring an expression of sudden attention as if their breath was now held as they waited i could have been wrong but i thought that the chanting of the five monks had become softer behind their spread fans more resonant like the vibration of the gong outside whose waves of sound had floated endlessly on the air this had been the risk and id taken it and it was too late now the woman was kneeling her hands together and her head lowered facing the red and gold catafalque the others followed and now i could see them clearly enough to know that there were eight of them four on each side and forming a double arc with the single woman at the centre i could have believed theyd rehearsed their tableau for hours a day and knew that they hadnt no one anywhere was moving now and in the great stillness my mind slowed to the rhythm of alpha waves and threedimensional reality began losing its definition drawn into the shadows by the vast stillness here by the heady fumes of the incense the mesmerising glimmer of a hundred candleflames and above all the presence of death too late yes but already i could believe that it wasnt simply a calculated risk id taken but that shed somehow drawn me here to the temple the woman who kneeled alone mariko shoda drawn me here by the ethereal force of whatever demonic spirit burned in her and burned those who touched people always tell me the same thing about little kissofsteel dont stand too close and above all dont touch there was still no movement anywhere the sense of time was slipping away because time too was an illusion a part of the threedimensional reality that no longer held any meaning in this place the monks rhythmic chanting never ceased it had become the sound of endlessness the continuum of the universe the smoke of the incense was the essence of nirvana distilled from the scents of lifes experience long forgotten until now my eyes focused on the slender neck of the woman who knelt there shoda the woman who prayed there mariko shoda could look nowhere else because there was nowhere else danger this mood is lethal yes but i would have thought of that a long time ago if it hadnt already been my karma to come here the left brain can be very tiresome at a time when you mean you re ready to give up life i wouldnt say that then what else can you be saying i think i moved then feeling the return of beta consciousness raising my head and looking along the shadowed gallery yes there were faces there in the gloom between the lamps faces looking down so be it you ii go as easily as that leave me alone it had been a try i suppose id slipped back into reality enough to check the environment and wished i hadnt serves you right so forth my eyes went back to the kneeling woman shes very spiritual chen she always prays for you before she kills so be it a cold draught somewhere though it didnt worry me a movement of the air its chill coming against me but not touching my skin waking me a little bringing enough reality back to let me know what it was the creeping of the sense of death along the nerves then there was nothing for a time for whatever period of timelessness it was that seemed like time we were held all of us in the cosmic thrall that had its centre in the woman there shoda the woman praying there was nothing nihil it had stilled us forever and we no longer breathed because there was no need to breathe no need to experience anything but nirvana the stillness of perfect love shock came and i flinched unprepared for it as she began moving the woman there lifting her head and letting her arms fall beside her as she rose to her feet and stood for a moment facing the catafalque id felt the shock go through the others here some of them had caught their breath the incense smelt acrid suddenly and the monks chanting took on monotony became obtrusive one of the children i had seen earlier had started crying unable to deal with the sudden change of dimension do what you can yes i know what you mean but theres nothing nihil she turned shoda and began walking back towards us and the other women held for a moment where they were and then closed in a little following their steps in unison with hers shodas their eyes were soft in the way that can be seen when karatekas are joined in kumite in contest or when olympic athletes are performing in the zone the eyes are not focused but simply allow vision to come in from the entire field so that you look at nothing but see everything i saw only her face it was long noble the cheekbones rising to wide luminous eyes her brow clear ivorine under her nightblack hair but thats just a description and there is no way of telling you how the face of shoda appeared to me in the temple on that evening because it was more than the face of a woman it was also the face of death fashioned in beauty my own death of course no question of that so easily i know what you mean but when theres no question you dont question it do you surely thats reasonable you havent got very long now what are you going to do the cold draught came again and this time my skin crawled and i went straight into left brain and the shock went through to the bone because it was true id been insane to come here even though id believed there was a chance of getting away with it and accelerating the mission and somehow surviving sheer bloody pride i hadnt got a chance in hell youre just going to let it happen oh i wouldnt quite say that no when it comes ill go down fighting never say the lads so forth nerves like ice while i whistled in the dark because it wouldnt be very long now this time theyd make certain there were some other things done though im not sure i can remember exactly what i think they took the wooden coffin out of the catafalque and carried it into the ornamented hearth where the flames were to be lit people came and went and some kind of reed instrument began playing you could leave now while theres time i looked upwards again but the faces along the gallery werent any clearer even when i centred and relaxed to stimulate the retinae and the optic nerve though i detected a slight movement by one of them and this told me at least that they were yes faces watching well of course theyd be there theyd be everywhere she not only has a whole bunch of bodyguards around her chen but she has a whole lot more waiting around in the area i turned and looked towards the big entrance doors they were wide open still and people came and went bringing candles and wickerwork posies some of them crying as they left the temple one of them a boy of six or seven cest pas vrai maman cest pas vrai the woman with him then was the widow leaving before the anguish of the condolences could begin the bodyguards on each side of the doorway didnt move a dozen of them women in black silk robes because tracksuits of course wouldnt be appropriate have to watch the proprieties but there wouldnt be one of them without a blade on them sheathed under the silk so there we are make your run make it now dont be so bloody silly sweat on my sides i could smell it the raw emanation of fear and that familiar bitter taste in the mouth as the adrenalin began flowing into the blood cest pas vrai mais out cest vrai la man m attend m attend flamelight strengthened against the walls as the fire beneath the coffin burned brighter mourners were gathered there in a circle and the voices of the monks rose more strongly from behind their fans the pipers notes became infinitely sad she hadnt moved shoda she was in her own space isolated by her women standing with a stillness that hypnotised the stillness of a reptile of a creature totally in command of its environment just turn and walk through the doors they cant do anything here no not here theyll wait till im outside theyll need the dark for this the flamelight grew fanning across the coloured walls deepening the scarlets and turning the greens to ochre it was all rather beautiful as it was meant to be and i suppose you could say there were worse preludes to the act of extinction what i mean is we dont often get this kind of luck the shadow executives the busy little ferrets in the field we usually finish up spreadeagled in the dust at a checkpoint with the guns suddenly silent or smeared under a truck or shoved in an unmarked grave because otherwise wed stink and there are the local health laws so forth i mean we dont expect this kind of thing a temple indeed with candles and prayers and everything the impressive trappings of ritual because thats what shes doing now you know shes said her prayers for dominic edouard lafarge and now shes praying for you hasnt that occurred to you for christs sake she prays before she kills didnt you hear what chen said sweat running stinking the place out the mouth like a husk so come on lets get it over with lets make shoda moved moved with that extraordinary suddenness that brought a shock to the senses because now it seemed shed never been still she was turning and walking this way as her women fell aside a little and then closed in beautifully done absolutely firstclass choreography a part of my mind was standing off from the reality of what was going to happen very soon now and indulging itself in an appreciation of the fine arts while the brain stem was producing a stream of desperate lastditch schemes for snatching some kind of survival from the obvious certainty of death she was close to me now shoda and her head turned on its slender neck and she looked at me stopping and standing there a few yards away and i was staring into the eyes of the angel of death the luminous nightdeep eyes of the woman who was to be my executioner and i knew now without any doubt that shed been praying for me because i felt in these last moments of my life raised to a state of grace you mean you wont even oh im not hanging around dont worry im going out there now and let them get it over with too many of them this time but fight like a tiger yes of course as a gesture at least to let everyone know i was capable of doing more than just stand there and bare my chest for butchery so i turned and went out of the temple dodging between people but not running not even hurrying one has to be seemly in a sacred place just making my way out knowing she was following me now shoda knowing also that as i went through the enormous doorway the others were following too the women id seen standing there guarding the doors and when i reached the temple gardens i crossed the grass towards the black columns of the cypresses so that we could play out the matter in privacy and with the cool night air on my face and my shadow moving ahead of me in the moonlight i heard them coming for me with a rushing of silk and i turned to face them and saw the shimmer of drawn blades slingshot dont come any closer no one moved i could hear the plane levelling flight now when youre ready lee the soldier hefted the launcher and set up the aim on the drone dont inhale the smoke its hydrogen chloride gas im ready the soldier said and pressed the trigger i was watching the plane towing the drone what altitudes that thing three thousand feet the missile left the canister and lifted fast but was slowing then it accelerated again thats the main booster coming in hickson told us its to protect the firer theres too much noise and fumes going on when she cuts in so we made it twostage the yanks have done the same thing with their stinger the missile reached the drone and there was a bright orange flash and then bits of debris started flowering from the centre of the explosion thanks lee hickson shoved his hands in his pockets we knew each others names but that was all instructions from pepperidge had been to that effect hickson wasnt to know any more than that i was a civilian guest of the thai government this was an exercise to strengthen my cover not to blow it i asked for that altitude because with a towline as short as that one thered be a very definite risk of hitting the plane instead of the drone thin terrierfaced earnest he swept a look around us that isnt because we cant aim the slingshot accurately even at thirty thousand feet its just the nature of the beast she seeks the most heat she can find and after all youre not going to be towing drones around in a war id phoned pepperidge earlier today and asked him to set up a demonstration for me my cover was that of a rep for laker foundry and to maintain it i needed to know as much about the slingshot as possible i hadnt told him about the temple thing how much does it cost i asked hickson six thousand pounds per missile considering you can take down a twenty million pound aircraft with it i wouldnt say its all that expensive would you i didnt know whether he was being defensive because of the price or because he was uneasy having me here an unknown this was his toy and he liked to know who watched him play with it or he could simply be worried because of the leak in birmingham prince kityakara came over to me would you like to see another firing mr jordan not unless you would sir he turned to hickson i think we might send another one up there was something very attractive about the slingshot the size of the thing only five feet long and its devastating potential and i had the impression that kityakara and his army chiefs here were as pleased as hickson with it they had fifty of them stored under the heaviest security id ever seen one of the aides switched on his radio and asked for another drone it would only have worried pepperidge if id told him there are phases in every mission where you decide to push things right to the brink not because of the exciting way it tickles but because youve weighed the odds and calculated the risk and looked at all the data again and then gone for it shit or bust and thats what id done when id decided to go to lafarges funeral id known that mariko shoda might be there but it wasnt certain and that had given me enough margin of safety to make the decision after that point id relied on what johnny chen had said shes very spiritual she prays before she kills but she hadnt been able to kill on sacred ground mr jordan im sorry he whipped the little inhaler across his mouth you havent seen the slingshot in action before in england no sir are you impressed very we began walking about to relieve the tension you had to stand perfectly still when that thing was being fired it was like watching those people at st andrews shed wanted to scare me of course maybe not scare but get the message across shed one day be my death that was why shed let them get their knives out before shed called them off then all id heard in the shadows of the cypresses was her quiet voice dio korn plot man wai karri it could only have meant no not now or leave him something like that not a pardon though just a reprieve its mounted with these control surfaces in the nose hickson said they produce roll and lateral shift he was holding the thing like a baby cradling it pepperidge had told me that hickson had been in on the actual design i could hear the aircraft climbing again fireandforget kityakara said he was looking at the specifications what does that mean mr hickson pretty well what it says sir once shes fired and on her way the soldier can move off to a new position if he wants to or get under cover if theres the need the slingshots computerised fully automatic she thinks for you a definite note of pride it had been nerves that was all id been in the wrong mood for pushing myself into hazard i was already morbid after the long night in the jungle picking over those tortured bodies and the ritual in the temple had made things worse and what the boy had said that it wasnt true his papa couldnt be dead and finally of course thered been shoda and the almost mystic power coming from her and her eyes when shed looked into mine with the need for my death in them i can put a car through a checkpoint and take the barrier with me and i can undo a bomb in a barn and take the fuse out and i can go through implemented interrogation inside lubyanka and come out sane but shoda was different operating on a psychically different wavelength with a force in her that chilled you to the bone when she came near i didnt just walk away two nights ago dont think that i didnt just walk out of the cypresses and get into the car and drive off id come away shivering with my feet unsteady and my eyes flickering close to what ive read about shellshock and i knew this feeling wouldnt leave me not entirely if i could get through this mission it was going to be with the constant fear of death inside me like a haunting stand away please hickson said the thai soldier plugged in the cable from the battery strapped to his waist and got the pistol grip into his right hand and heaved the canister onto his shoulder and took a sighting then he flicked some switches and swung the missile to the right angling it to something like degrees then he began tracking as the military jet trailing the drone began its pass across the airfield kityakara was using his inhaler every halfminute or so now becoming very tense the others werent moving or saying anything three full generals and a small crowd of colonels and lower brass all immaculate strictly on parade and not only because kityakara was here but because of the slingshot with its sinister potency it outranked them all when youre ready hickson said the soldier nodded and went on tracking the drone watch out for the gas cloud gentlemen dont breathe any in tracking the man squeezed the trigger and there was something like a seconds delay while the pressure from the initial charge built up in the tube and then the missile was forced out and began climbing twisting to the left and correcting its course before the main booster came on and kicked the thing higher leaving a plume of white smoke that drifted on the breeze i was counting and got to ten seconds before the slingshot nosed into the drone and made the hit and left an orange fireball hanging in the sky silence on the ground then the soundwave reached us nothing more than a soft woof because of the distance and the fact that the drone carried no fuel when i looked down the soldier had moved almost fifty yards away demonstrating the slingshots fireandforget capability of course hickson said and i thought his tone was deliberately conversational for the sake of effect with a rocketpowered drone you can shoot at thirty thousand feet theyre on their way prince kityakara gave a brief nod thank you mr hickson an impressive demonstration are there any questions gentlemen it took half an hour with two interpreters picking up when the nonenglishspeaking people wanted to know things then kityakara took me across to his staffcar and we got in im sure i dont need to emphasise mr jordan the devastation that weapon could cause in the wrong hands or the right he tilted his head i am not talking of war but of fullscale revolution initiated by someone like mariko shoda and her organisation its not just the technical capability of the slingshot that makes it so deadly in jungle terrain one man could use it at fiveminute intervals and continue to move around so that he could never be flushed out one man could bring down half a squadron of bombers and of course any given number of helicopters moving in at low level inhaler it means that any armed revolution could proceed with its enterprise in the certainty that it was completely safe from the air he laid a hand on my knee became suddenly aware of protocol and removed it at once it means mr jordan that if the shoda organisation acquired this weapon it could set indochina aflame within a week and that of course is its intention noted im kept fully informed of your reports can you give me any hope that you can move into mariko shodas operation before too long i met her yesterday shoda yes his head was turned to watch me from behind his tinted glasses i dont understand she lets no one near her i didnt talk to her but how he left it hanging i took a chance in the hope of getting some information it didnt come off or maybe it did i know more about her now what kind of adversary she is its not always i told him the angle of the shot or the distance from the target or the timing sometimes you just need to know how to get under their skin and work from there i see his voice was hushed i shall pray for you mr jordan rattakul flew me in a thai military staff aircraft to singapore and their embassy had a rented plain van waiting for us on the tarmac and i climbed into the rear which was facing away from the terminal buildings i was given an envelope with the insignia of the british high commission in the top lefthand corner and i slit it open ive been doing a bit of homework for you that i think might help why not let me cook some spaghetti for you this evening if you re not doing anything you know my address it was now and i thought about it she wouldnt be fooling underneath the ingenue breathlessness she had a good mind and she knew what sort of information i wanted drop me here will you south canal road with some of the best cover in the area to protect my return to the red orchid al said there were no messages but in any case they could only be from the thai embassy because this was my safehouse and security hadnt been breached but just before five oclock lily ling told me there was a phone call and i went down to the bar i am glad you did not take plane a soft womans voice but it sounded like an explosion because security had been blown away what plane flight smells came into the lobby from the street fruit spices chickens it had rained again and the air was sticky even in here i didnt ask her how shed found this number it was better to let her think it wasnt important instead i said i owe you my thanks you are welcome mr jordan may i know your name it is sayako sayakosan how did you know dial plane was going to crash silence then someone tell me who gave the order enemy of shoda target dominic lafarge i said which enemy is not important was important to warn you why are you telephoning me now sayakosan to warn you again about what shoda has ordered you killed quite probably i didnt like the way she was using short sentences which was the classic method of drawing people out she is furious with you i knew that i didnt say anything lily ling came slipping from the kitchen to the desk in the lobby walking like a flame in her red shift al had fired her twice since id arrived here the humidity was getting people down do you know why why shoda was furious with me she lost face i suppose yes you went to temple knowing she could not attack you there it was insult as if you say you wish to kill me so here i am yet you cannot you understand mr jordan this is very important i understand lily ling was still at the desk and i could ask her to get al very fast and ask him to phone the special number i had at the thai embassy and tell rattakul to see if he could get her number traced sayakos through the singapore police but at best it would take twenty minutes and i wouldnt be able to keep her talking that long shoda has ordered one man to kill you mr jordan his name is manif kishnar he has never failed to kill he will leave bangkok soon now what does he look like all indians didnt wear turbans but the real experts favoured pianowire i do not know of course you must now leave your hotel but he will find you unless i can warn you in time where he will be and what he will be doing longer sentences which made me feel better there was also a timbre in this womans voice that attracted me in terms of trust dont trust anyone quite but shed saved my life and even though shed done it for her own purposes it meant she was a friend not an enemy and might remain one a friend in shodas camp was worth having but id better check that out sayakosan are you inshodas organisation in a moment she said i have access to information i watched a cockroach skirting the base of the bar darting around a bottletop and a halfburnt match i knew what ferris would have done with that why are you helping me sayakosan you are here on mission to destroy mariko shoda i wish for that the only way this woman could have got my number was from the thai embassy they didnt have it officially even though i was working for them but theyd come here to take me to the birthday party they could be working then through this woman to help me i didnt think so she sounded like a lone wolverine you wish for shodas destruction i said carefully why shoda had deadly enemies but i wanted to know if there was something personal in a moment it is not important her voice was like ice suddenly but you know that others have tried and not succeed it is because no one can kill shoda with a gun or a way like that you make the right way i think you know how to do this thing by knowledge of woman i didnt ask her but was shoda a woman the divine face the slender body yes but what id seen in her eyes was the evil of diabolus and it was attracting me and i knew it and knew its dangers this was going to end when one of us brought death to the other if we could meet sayakosan you could tell me more about her she hesitated so long that i began listening for background sounds other voices the turning of a tape no we cannot meet it is too dangerous for me i will help you as much as i can by telephone that could be true anyone informing on mariko shoda was in deadly peril all right i said i will need to know where to telephone to you when you will leave your hotel i was going to ground now as soon as i could but it wouldnt be to any kind of safehouse because i didnt know of one and in any case you dont give away the phonenumber of your safehouse even to someone whos just saved your life but a temporary number would work how do i contact you i asked her write your new number down and place into an envelope with name sayako on deposit in night safe at bank of singapore in empress place she added quietly i will call she knew some of the rules ill do that i told her very well now please listen to me mr jordan manif kishnar is to leave bangkok by air at some time on day after tomorrow which is thursday i will find out his movements for you and tell you what i can but please believe me that you must do everything possible to protect your life this man succeed to kill always always noted zabaglione bolognaise too much garlic not for me its excellent i didnt think youd come why not she spilled some spaghetti from her fork god ive always been a messy eater because you put me through the third degree the other day at the embassy that day i wouldnt have trusted my own mother day of the plane crash yes i understand that now but it took a bit of time i was furious when i left there then it didnt show thats not bad for me have you still got a mother what oh no father no i thought not she gave me her level stare her bluegrey eyes narrowing as they focused you come across like an orphan what can you say to a thing like that the shutters were still open to the last of the daylight if i asked her to close them now itd be too early she was looking particularly sensual this evening not exactly looking but behaving with slight body movements bringing her thin shoulders forward in that nowfamiliar way her head tilting in brief gestures as she left things unsaid her hand brushing the air when she couldnt find the word she wanted sensual because intimate knowing i trusted her again did you lose them when you were young mother father i dont remember she puffed out a little laugh or anything about your past at all sorry a shutter or something banged on the other side of the street and she caught my reaction and said quietly martin do you enjoy living like that its not that im paranoid its just that everybodys trying to get at me but she didnt think it was funny i poured her some more wine you sure you wont have any not just now youre safe here darling then she said or are you she turned to glance across the windows i wouldnt have come near you if i werent i dont mind catching some flak id rather you didnt id given it a whole hour before id rung the bell downstairs taking it street by street house by house melting and emerging and melting from cover to cover drawn blank it had surprised me id thought id pick up ticks and have to get clear and call her with an excuse it told me a lot about shoda all she could think about was killing off any kind of opposition the women she used for tagging were good once theyd seen the target but there was no real field work they should have tagged katie too the day wed had lunch at empress place and seen where she worked and put a peep on her night and day on the assumption that shed meet me again that was basic surveillance work sayako was different you go to the thai embassy quite a bit dont you she looked at me steadily we liaise with them why do you talk about me there im not exactly a gossip i know but dont assume that because im in with them they can be totally trusted to look after me it was the closest i could go to the truth her glass remained poised halfway to her mouth this is important isnt it fairly all right she put down her wine and put a thin ringless hand on the table for me to take so you really do trust me now was that true i wasnt sure i dont think youd do me any intentional damage she took her hand away and i saw that her eyes were moist you really are a bastard she said lightly id do bloody well anything for you i cant think why because of what you are she pushed her plate away and wouldnt look at me for a moment furious i thought probably hard up for a man four months into the divorce and hed been fantastic in bed so forth too much of a lady to take the first man she could find too much pride or just too hurt bugger them i hate them all the phone rang and she got up to answer it the flat was small understated a few bamboo chairs and a chaiselongue stereo poinsettias in a chinese vase worn silk rugs half a wall full of books mostly paperbacks a lot of them reread ragged i cant do it now on the phone her slender body arched backwards against the wall leaning examining the nails of her right hand in the light from the windows look ring up holli and ask her if she can pop round there shes always terribly willing to help ill ask her about it in the morning i finished my tomato juice and left the table and went across to the alcove to look at the watercolours romney marsh the shore at rye lewes crescent brighton delicate wistful blues and greys im awfully sorry martin had you finished yes did you do these all my own work she stood beside me faintly scented but it was more her skin theyre charming honestly theres some zabaglione she took my hand are you having some i dont know perhaps later youll be wanting to know about the homework i did for you she turned and went across to finish her wine and then curled up on the floor with one arm on the chaiselongue ive written it out for you and you can take it when you go dont you want a chair i like it here its something i learned as a child or taught myself found out i dont know which when youre on the floor you cant fall any farther anyway its about mariko shoda i dont want that bitch to hurt you so i dug up everything i could you do a lot for me i told you id do anything because of what i am whats that exactly i didnt know if she meant because of what i did how much theyd told her at the thai embassy but of course she was a woman and id missed the point tough as hell on the outside but vulnerable endangered hence dramatic hence sexy she brushed the air feeling for the words she wanted pushing yourself to some kind of brink all the time and therefore she looked away doomed i suppose so i just want to help you her fair hair swung as she looked back at me her eyes resting on mine gravely while theres time piano wire random image unimportant this man succeed to kill always ignore anyway katie said this is roughly the picture her father was prince shoda phomvihane of cambodia and in the khmer rouge stormed his palace that was when they were sweeping across the whole country as you know she was eight years old at that time and when the communists attacked the palace her father tried to get her to safety she was in her fathers arms coming down the steps of the palace when a sabre cut his head in two and shoda fell with his blood all over her i got this from an eyewitness an old woman in one of the refugee camps we help to look after a man picked her up and ran with her through the melee and got her clear but then lost track of her the same night in the jungle this i got from someone who used to know her after she reached safety she stretched out a stockinged leg smoothing it sometimes we dont know the half of what other people go through do we her face was losing definition dusk was down with equatorial suddenness do you mind pulling the shutters across what all right she turned halfway across the room but you said just routine she came back switching on the big oiljar lamp in the corner turning down the rheostat is that too dim no i like dim light shadows darkness night invisibility going to ground soon have to because of manif kishnar are you all right yes thered been nothing in my face in my eyes she was picking up vibrations again thatd be so dangerous in an enemy well curling up on the floor again she was seven months in the jungle alone at the age of eight yes her shoulders lifted an inch i dont think its just legend although there are plenty of legends about her i mean its feasible plausible that a woman like mariko shoda vicious and powerful and so on could easily have been that kind of child resourceful adaptable savage especially after losing her father like that in a literally bloody rite of passage wouldnt you think i said i would or to put it the other way round that a resourceful savage child could have become what shoda is now someone asked her how she could possibly have managed to survive seven months in the jungle and apparently she said it was easy once you became an animal she watched the monkeys and ate only the berries and things they ate so as not to get poisoned she killed a tiger how when she found out which berries were poisonous she stuffed a halfdead marmoset with them and dropped it from a tree near the tigers beat she pulled her hair back that sort of thing is this of any use martin i mean its vital to me oh she touched my arm that makes me feel leaving it looking away johnny chen didnt give you any of this no hes terribly cut up you know about losing his best friend that pilot her eyes levelled focussing hes genuine martin you can trust him and i wouldnt say that unless i were a million times certain i wouldnt want to do or say anything that might hurt you im beginning to wish id never met you as a matter of fact its such a responsibility she leaned and tugged at a loose thread at the fringe of the rug her fair hair falling across her face quietly just joking well anyway when she got out of the jungle she fell foul of the pol pot forces again and went through five years of torture starvation terror repeated rape and an epidemic of cholera hundreds of thousands like her didnt survive she was at the infamous execution centre at tuol sleng but got away when the telephone began ringing and she looked around thatll be the office again unless its for you no one knows im here then it can go on ringing when she reached a refugee camp on the thai border she looked like a skeleton and couldnt even speak it took a year to get her back to something like normal i got this from the actual camp administration there were thousands there still are but she gradually began standing out from the crowd helping with the work and the organisation she was about fourteen by then and shed already had something of an education as a princess of the royal house up to the age of eight she swung her head that bloody phone then it stopped ringing theres a gap after that but someone else said that by the time she was seventeen she was helping them to administrate the whole camp that was when she killed one of the officers for trying to mess about one night in the sleeping quarters there was an enquiry but nothing was proved against her not enough even to have her charged the woman i spoke to was a witness but refused to give evidence like shoda shed been through absolute hell and felt that any man who started any funny business ought to be shot then a year later there was a camp guard found knifed and very expertly the next day shoda was missing so are you getting the picture and would you like some zabaglione now we went back to the table and she brought it in and talked some more about mariko shoda a thai police inspector told me that so far shes killed off fifteen of her top competitors in the drug trade taking care of six of them personally and using her crack hit man for the others hes from calcutta and his names kishnar she went to put on some music kicking off her snakeskin shoes any questions i asked her for the thai police inspectors name and phone number and she gave them to me anything else yes have you heard of a woman probably japanese named sayako who could be in the shoda organisation how do you spell it i told her no where does she come in it was just something i picked up ill keep my ears open she came over to me slowly in her stockinged feet and it struck me that the effect made by a woman taking her shoes off has been underrated well go on talking about shoda she said for as long as you want to martin i asked you here to give you all the information i can but do you feel like a brief interlude un petit apreszabaglione my god ive never seen so many scars on a mans body all ive got is this little one caesarian yes she looked away but he died one of those bloody cot deaths the thing is he might have kept the marriage together and that would have been awful do you believe things like that work themselves out in life i believe we create our own reality you mean we decide to mess everything up she lay against me again one leg dangling off the divan onto the cushions shed thrown down how did you know i like it very slowly i didnt but i mean i never knew foreplay could be so absolutely mindblowing she began moving her hands again stroking the sweat on the skin i felt like a goddess or something do you always she left it the light was soft in the room the recordplayer had shut itself off hours ago the phone had rung twice and shed let it go on ringing the overhead fan was turning slowly in the middle of the room spreading the humid air i hadnt meant to stay looking back i thought it was probably because i didnt want to return to the reality id created for myself outside hes from calcutta and his names kishnar i wish she said slowly we couldve met before i began playing with her again very gently she liked karezza but i suppose it wouldnt have worked out i mean our she left it then said oh my god do you know what that does to me through the kitchen doorway i could hear the fridge cutting on and off the only other sounds were the sounds we made she used pompoir and delightfully which i hadnt expected from her martin will you stay the night theres not much of it left anyway id like to keep back the dawn wasnt that the tide of something sometimes we slept a little and then there was a flush of rose light between the slats of the shutters and she made coffee and we sat facing each other on the floor sharing the discovery wed made i was absolutely wrong she said he wasnt fantastic in bed after all he hadnt got a bloody clue a sleepy laugh was i all right a bit exquisite then the shutters brightened throwing silvered light across the ceiling where the fan still turned and katie made eggs and toast for us not smiling very often now not even talking much i suppose what you need most she said at one time is to know what her achilles heel is shodas that would be useful the cushions were still all over the floor when i left and katie was in a thin kind of nightie looking like a child barefooted and soft martin im a bit telepathic sometimes have you noticed i pick up vibes she came as far as the door with me lifting her thin arms to hold me and kiss at last she said its going to be so bloody dangerous out there for you isnt it i dont remember quite what i said something about my luck lasting i think do something for me will you her eyes were very steady now and dark for gods sake if and when you can pick up a phone and call me so that ill know things are still all right then it was too late to go to ground because an hour after i got back to the red orchid i saw theyd thrown surveillance around the hotel and knew i was trapped countdown i phoned pepperidge but he wasnt there just the answeringmachine i left a message im in a red sector phone me this was at the first thing you do when you find a trap closing on you is to note the time because later it can save your life at there were five of them outside the hotel and i checked them again using shutters the mirror in the bathroom of the vacant room at the end of the thirdfloor corridor and the angle of vision across the courtyard at the rear between the edge of the roof and the ventpipe from the kitchen leaving myself only enough of a gap to sight without exposing more than the width of one eye it took more than an hour i wished pepperidge would telephone thatll be my number ill put in an answeringmachine all right you can always leave a signal on it if im out sweeping for data in the pubs he wouldnt be in a pub at three in the morning then where was he not quite the service youre used to sorry there was a chance of getting clear of the trap if i could talk to pepperidge and set up a lastditch thing before nightfall but in any case id have to assume that kishnar would get here before i could use it theyd send for him of course sayako had said hed be leaving bangkok the day after tomorrow taking his time making his plans while shodas people here in the city did a square search for me in the streets until they found me and cornered me and had me waiting for him theyd had some luck and theyd done that and i was set up for the kill and theyd send for him now had sent for him and he wouldnt waste any time shoda would put him in one of her private jets and it was only a threehour flight at noon i telephoned thongswasdi the thai inspector of police katie had talked to pepperidge had checked out their intelligence ranks for me and hadnt found anyone doubtful but that didnt mean there wasnt a shoda agent in their embassy here if i asked them for information on manif kishnar it could warn him that i knew he was coming and i didnt want that how can i help you thongswasdi you were talking to miss mccorkadale recently about manif kishnar that is so the smells came in from the street as a man went through the swingdoors into the morning sunshine where i couldnt go where i might by nightfall be carried can you describe him for me it wasnt useful a characteristic hindu foot stone black hair brown eyes no scars no other distinguishing features what are his methods excuse me the line wasnt very clear how does he kill with the garrotte exclusively thuggee does he use assistants no he has always worked alone he is a man of great pride in his efficiency does he prefer daylight or darkness he kills only by night that is understandable since he must approach from behind the victim it was kishnar who dealt with one of the agents mobilised by thai intelligence against mariko shoda two men came in from the street and i watched them through the archway is there anything else you can think of inspector that might help me there was a short silence miss mccorkadale mentioned that you might at some time find yourself in danger from this man is that correct yes i could send you a copy of his dossier if you like thats not necessary i think youve given me all i need they were at the desk now talking to lily ling i caught snatches of italian neither of them had been part of the surveillance team id seen outside if you would like my advice thongswasdi said you should take the utmost care to avoid manif kishnar ill do that i thanked him and rang off and went out to the lobby and listened for a minute or two while the italians were booked in representatives of a minor shoe company in naples then i went upstairs and made routine sightings again one of them was a woman whod worked with the team that had got onto me when id been on my way to see johnny chen i recognised her because it had taken me two hours to get clear of them another was the young chinese standing near the salted fish stall fifty yards from the hotel entrance lifting on his toes all the time flexing his ankles hed been in the previous team and had the walk of a karateka at the back of the hotel there were two more men and a woman one of them on the balcony of a shophouse backing on to the river two of them in the street and keeping on the move the whole time blending into the crowd on the narrow pavement as far as the intersections and then coming past again not looking upwards because my room was on the other side looking only at the gate of the little courtyard and along the low whitewashed wall no call from pepperidge at intervals i centred on the area at the top of the stairs where al or lily ling would pass if they wanted me to go down to the telephone then as the long afternoon began i went through the whole building as id done as soon as id got here but now more critically he would come for me barefoot the nerves and muscles in the sole of the foot are infinitely sensitive controlling and balancing and refining all the movements made by the upper body as well as the legs and hips to put shoes on is to deaden the information received by the naked foot from the terrain so that all the body has to work on is the crude fact that its more or less upright the inner ear alone controlling the balance shoes also create noise and he would need to come for me in total silence if he came into the hotel he would look for me in my room first and i ignored it because i wouldnt be there i concentrated on the only areas where he could come at me from behind the corridors the landings and the stairs i started from the roof and worked downwards noting whatever looked useful the roof was dangerous for three reasons access was difficult with small skylights and only one trap door i used the trap door because the skylights were jammed with paint and i might break the glass on the roof itself there was almost no cover and even at night id show a partial silhouette against the citylit haze thirdly the drops were mostly sheer except where the rusted fireescape ran down on the north side but i noted that a jump could be made from the roof to the first landing of the fireescape seven or eight feet below providing the tiles at the edge of the roof didnt break or shift and send me wide of the landing and into the courtyard five storeys down a killing drop at intervals i had to stop work and wait until one of the guests or a whole party of them had left the corridors and gone into a room or down the stairs i saw lily ling twice and she didnt say thered been a call for me i would have liked i would have liked very much to hear the voice of pepperidge this afternoon he was a burnt out spook with no network behind him but in the last couple of conversations with him over the phone id begun sensing a calmness in the man that had come from experience in the field he knew more than most what i was up against how lonely i was out here how afraid he understood my paranoia almost as well as ferris had when he was running me and pepperidge had pride i dont sleep when theres work to do you know ive been in signals with the thais most of the night but i didnt just want to hear his voice on the telephone i wanted to set up the lastchance thing in case nothing else would work the hours were going by and the stress of a trapped animals mounts progressively the work i was doing now was essential vital and could save my life but it was an intellectual exercise and in the brain stem there was a primitive creature shaking the bars of its cage if i went out of the hotel id still be in a trap theyd move with me through the streets and wherever i went they would go and this time they wouldnt let me get clear because kishnar was coming and their orders were to hold me ready for him i was beginning to know shoda you know how to do this thing by knowledge of woman sayako i knew there were enough of them out there to make a concerted kill by sheer weight of numbers but theyd tried it before five of them in the limousine and this time shoda had known that the only way to make certain was to send kishnar to let these minions attempt a kill would be like asking the peons in the plaza de tons to go for the bull instead of leaving it for the matador she had style shoda this time she wanted the act accomplished with certainty discretion and grace she would be praying for me i knew at some time in the hours of this night most of the vacant rooms were on the fifth floor because there wasnt a lift and the stairs were steep they were also ancient and creaked that would be the terrain of my main defence the staircase it would send me immediate and accurate signals if anyone set foot in it even bare kishnar would know that he was a professional he would look at this building and know by its age and construction that the stairs would creak he would therefore try to bring me out to the street and lead me to dark places i didnt know how he would do this but with the passing of these uneasy hours i might come to know or catch a gleam of intuition my mind was already engaged with his as the distance closed between us at three oclock i went downstairs and asked the kitchen boy to bring me some food in the bar a twoegg omelette and wholewheat toast fat protein and carbohydrate i sat with the long window at my right side the window overlooking the street where they could see me and be reassured that i knew nothing felt myself to be in no danger were here for the geegees a sly laugh al was booking them in wouldnt know what geegees were unless he was versed in the vernacular of the suburban londoner its always too bloody wet at epsom rueful chuckle have a nice stay al told them not knowing what epsom was or where its good to have you folks at the red orchid so forth while this compatriot of theirs this undistinguished spook sat eating his eggs and toast and tried to keep his mind off the fact that there was a narrowangled vector running from this window to the roof on the other side of the street from this head to the muzzle of a singleshot rimfire remington xb with redfield olympic sights one quick squeeze and the glass of the window flying inwards and the little grey cylinder meeting the skin and then the bone and then the brain and nuzzling into the consciousness at two thousand revolutions a second and blowing the world away morbid yes just a touch melodramatic but the fact remained the fact remained damn you dial a calculated risk is still a risk and this was going to be a long day and it wasnt over yet hells epsom what al looking down at me a toothpick in his mouth his lazy cynical smile covering his habitual apprehension oh a racetrack near london just a thought that was all they wouldnt use a gun and the geejaws al you slay me now what a turn of phrase geegees horses dont ask me why i get it penang people think we speak the same language you know that they okay looking at the eggs excellent penang was the racetrack just across the border you want anything you name it he went away on his small careful feet his shoulders a little hunched against the rains of providence theres nothing my good friend that i want though its kind of you to ask unless perhaps you can by some ethereal magic erase the beginning of this day and run reality through once more and render the street out there innocent of the deathbringers so that i might stroll through the doors and wander among the stalls and the handcarts and the colourful canvas awnings and pick perhaps at a ripe guava paying too much for it and loving the merchant for his greed which would equal mine though mine would be the greed for life itself someone shouted and the skin crawled suddenly tightening across the skull a man protesting that a cyclo had nearly knocked him down ill have to do better than this my masters better than this if im going to outdo manif kishnar when he comes for me you want coffee said no because i couldnt judge the timing yet didnt know precisely when i would need the stimulus of the caffeine before its effects died away and left a treacherous dip in the energywave no time in the day when breakfast doesnt go down just right what you from the old country red face clipped white moustache club tie a jolly laugh excusezmoi msieur mais je ne park pas langlais ah sorry my mistake er pardong hurried away waving think nothing of it old boy and good luck with the geegees id try a little flutter on kinross lad in the fifth race i think ismails riding and itll be soft going after the rain and pepperidge hadnt phoned so i went upstairs and got on with the good work and put him out of my mind because i didnt know what time it would be when it would become across the span of a single second too late for him to phone too late for me to set up the lastchance thing i took sightings again and saw that two of them had gone to be replaced by a slight woman in a tracksuit with international fitness clubs printed across the front and a male european teutonic very cool adept at the sweeping glance that took in everything still only five they thought that was enough and of course it was because thered be a dozen more in the background waiting to move in and man the mobile trap if i tried to leave the hotel this time you mill please ensure that he does not survive shoda i mean its feasible plausible that a woman like that vicious and powerful and so on could easily have been that kind of child resourceful and adaptable and savage wouldnt you think there was nothing in my room or any of the vacant rooms that would make any kind of weapon better than my hands but what made me nervous was the idea of looking for weapons at all i couldnt remember doing it before even when things were touching the brink of extinction my hands were lethal and i knew that it was the first hint that my nerve had started to go it wasnt the waiting id waited before in moscow and bangkok and tangier waited for hours for days and kept the nerves intact operational it was shoda she kept coming into my thoughts the memory of her face with its high cheekbones and its wide luminous eyes the clear brown under the nightblack hair the face of the angel of death someone asked her how she could have possibly managed to survive seven months in the jungle at that age and she said it was easy once you became an animal voodoo is real it exerts its influence all over the world not just in places like tahiti it is the stage insidiously reached where fear becomes belief what the hell is that bastard pepperidge doing where fear begins to ask questions like that questions that shoot into the mind through the defences you thought were impregnable why hadnt he phoned like bullets coming into the brain already there before you even hear the shot because if he didnt phone before nightfall i knew there wasnt a chance left for me i knew now she watched the monkeys and ate only the berries and things they ate so as not to get poisoned she killed a tiger shoda her name was voodoo so all right the nerve was going and something would have to be done about it and i set up a whole tactical scenario from one end of the building to the other and from top to bottom creating a dozen situations where he could come for me kishnar and i could get clear and survive or engage with him and kill him and survive but it was an intellectual exercise to keep panic away because i knew what the deadline was now the deadline for pepperidge to call before it was too late for me to set up the lastchance thing it was the time the hour the minute when manif kishnar landed in singapore unless of course for some reason unknown to me he hadnt been sent for yet that had been an assumption on my part and assumptions are always dangerous and sometimes lethal he could still be taking his time leaving bangkok the day after tomorrow not hurrying confident perfectly confident knowing i was in a trap and held ready for him that would mean id have two more nights and a day to work something out and surely to god i wouldnt need more than thirtysix hours to set something up that could get me away from this bloody place with its doors and passages and windows and stairs and skylights and blind spots and escape routes spinning around in my mind with the nerves rubbing raw while i soaked in my sweat and listened listened the whole time for the sound of the phone down there mr jordan lily ling i went to the staircase im here telephone please thank you pepperidge i went down the stairs the nerves going slack like the cut string of a cello the legs without any strength in them where the hell had he been all this time i picked up the phone and said hello mr jordan yes this is sayako kishnar has just left bangkok three hours flight countdown whistling tequila sunrise tote penang fruit smells from the street how do you know i know in the third race saracen chacha mambo honest injun is he alone tote penang the winner he always alone i took a slow breath centring the trainer was lint hock chan radio sayakosan you may be mistaken it was an attempt to draw her out that was all tote singapore red plastic radio at the end of the bar not mistaken stink of sweat but the nerves steadying now in the fifth race mudlark ii chankara bumble bee i mentally tuned the thing out the nerves were steadying because now it was certain and all assumptions were blown away certain that he was coming mr jordan yes also your hotel is being watched i know ah so it is then very difficult for you in some way you must leave hotel trying to flush you from cover no she saved my life remember i said all right no point telling her there wasnt a chance be very cartful oh shut up she warned me hed been ordered to make the kill wasnt that in my interests listen please mr jordan i will do what i can for you but there are many watching yes i could see one of them through the window the chinese karateka i wish for you there was a break on the line or shed hesitated good fortune click went dead make a decision then hows about a drink al not just now not really in the mood make a decision yes if we were going to do it here here at the red orchid i was ready the kaleidoscope of images staircase skylights roofdrops escape routes had coalesced presenting me with a complete architectural blueprint for survival there was nothing more for me to do here so i came round from behind the bar and walked through the archway and through the doors and out into the street how much one dollar greedy bugger give me one of those plastic spoons messy to eat but a guava like life is sweet theyd reacted fast you should have seen them hadnt expected the little ferret to walk out of its trap and start stuffing guavas the karateka had turned his head immediately and signalled the woman in the tracksuit and shed swung away from the corner and started down the street on the other side leaving another one to move in and cover while she walked past the doorway of the herb shop glancing in and moving on pawn to k so forth theyd got it worked out but they knew i wasnt a bloody amateur either so i spent almost an hour going through the motions of spotting and evading and closing circuits and breaking out and doubling tracks using three taxis and the alleyway giving onto new bridge road id used the night id arrived here ive got out of mobile surveillance traps in moscow and berlin and warsaw but it was the first time id had to simulate getting clear there was no chance absolutely no chance of getting out of this one because it was massive id counted fourteen of them at the end of the first halfhour they werent just trying to establish my travel pattern or see if i made a contact or dropped a signal for someone they had to make sure i was set up for kishnar when he came because if they failed they were finished a sabre blade across the first vertebra they were responsible to mariko shoda what i had to do was establish the fact that i had a purpose in leaving the hotel that i wasnt just making an attempt at getting clear and going to ground they knew i was professional enough to have seen them in the street and knew i hadnt a chance of getting clear with so many of them manning the trap so i had to make them believe i was flawed and thought i could work miracles so when i walked into the hertz office in south bridge road i didnt even glance behind me what model do you prefer sir compact smaller windows toyota corolla drivinglicence amex so forth and this pretty smile these almond eyes the slight lift of the breasts beneath the silk blouse are they the last i shall see will you please sign here mr jordan and the last signature with a flourish then outside in the car park i walked round the toyota once to check the bodywork and then got in and started up and clipped the belt on without taking in the environment in the first three blocks i picked out the taxi a yellow and black streamline three vehicles behind there would be others closing in i didnt look for them it was tempting to try driving clear but it would mean risking lives not theirs id settle for that but the lives of the innocent on their way home in the evening rushhour so i drove carefully with due circumspection countdown he would be here in two hours there was an alley with a deadend alongside the red orchid where there would be deep shadow by eight oclock als chevrolet was farther down and id be blocking him but he never left the bar at this time in the evening i parked the toyota and locked the doors and went into the hotel by the front entrance not looking back the lastchance thing but only if pepperidge telephoned hi set it up yes six drops you invent this one flash of genius ask him no calls for me guess not i took my drink across to the corner where i could sit with my back to the television screen the optic nerve would have to adjust to the periodicy and tonight i wanted eyes like a cats do something for me will you i could see part of the street from here but it didnt interest me now they were out there and i knew that for gods sake if and when you can pick up a phone and call me so that ill know things are still all right that was tempting too to go across to the phone and hear her voice as she swung her long hair back from her eyes oh martin where are you calling from but no we couldnt meet tonight or ever again unless he telephoned pepperidge and even then it was a thousandtoone shot rain began soon afterwards here we go al said from the bar the stalls and barrows had been cleared from the narrow street an hour ago and the stones began taking on a sheen as the rain fell harder people out there were hurrying some of them with newspapers over their heads it wouldnt change anything an hour to go he would land in an hour the adrenalin began i could feel it like a subtle vibration in the bloodstream in the nerves i centred at intervals of a minute hearing the leather of the chair creak faintly as the tension came out of the muscles and the body sank lower i would need the adrenalin later but not now it was too soon the rain steadied in the street on the rooftops closing us in sequestering us in this small seedy hotel in singapore as if wed been washed up in an ark they would be standing in the doorways now taking shelter from the rain not from the inexorable tolling of the minutes as i was the inescapable measurement of time moving towards the deadline an hour from now not that its a foregone conclusion my friends dont think that ive slipped the executioner a dozen times and hes brought the axe down on the bloody block with an oath i didnt stay to listen to im strong im trained im ready for the moment of truth do you hear the sound of whistling in the dark i do because it wasnt going to be one against one even if i pulled off an overkill with manif kishnar theyd finish me off the peons if they had to those would be the orders from shoda this time it is to be certain the smell of the rain came through the doors as someone opened them the smell of the rain of the fruit lying squashed in the gutters and on a different level of consciousness the smell of the world outside of the deathbringer telephone i didnt move red orchid hotel the man whod come in stood dripping by the desk on the other side of the archway a shapeless bag by his feet oh hi you bet how are things with you i checked my watch at and thought that would be unfortunate wouldnt it if pepperidge finally called me and heard only the engaged tone while al was asking about his girlfriends health or his aunts or whoever the hell it was on the other end my chests easier but theres still this cough and the doctor says i do not care what the doctor says just get off the line look betsy i have to go now theres a guy at the desk okay works like magic you just go into zen and concentrate and create your own reality get people off the telephone get people to call you no matter how great the distance pepperidge are you listening damn your eyes watch it centre yes centre again the chairleather creaked felt better much better if he came in now with his bloody cheesewire iwould rip the heart out of his body and throw it to the dogs sure ill see you get some extra towels guess it caught you when you werent ready noting the time in the register pm happens all the time like that one minute theres a clear sky and the next minute youre trying to find a canoe or in the terminology of international chronometers now because time like life has its rendezvous to meet as do i the adrenalin was still seeping into the bloodstream even though i was spending most of the time in alpha now and coasting along in the philosophical dimension below full consciousness and i tried to go lower still because the conclusion wouldnt be made in thirtyfive minutes from now that was when he would arrive and hed have to take me into the dark to do what he wanted and that could happen at any time at midnight or beyond you bet his footsteps came through the archway and across to the bar behind me i knew als footsteps well if mary was so upset about it why didnt she call me maybe she just didnt want to bother you look she knows im always ready to help cindy you dont ever watch this stuff turned my head i like watching the rain makes a whole lot more sense i guess you okay there you need another of those specials said not just now for fifteen minutes i brought the waves back into beta and went through the building again reinforcing the memory and testing out some of the options there was one that worried me the drop from the roof to the top platform of the fireescape at the rear it was chancy enough in dry conditions seven or eight feet and at an angle but tonight the tiles would be wet and so would the fireescape and it was five floors and a stone courtyard below and in any case theyd cover that area and even if i did the drop and nit it right theyd be waiting for me below on any of the four landings below cancel that one then yes cancel it if i was forced onto the roof id stay there till they came for me not they him kishnar on the dark rooftop early this morning the body of a man was found lying at the rear of the red orchid a hotel in the chinese quarter his identity is being withheld until relatives have been informed sweat starting on the flanks and the adrenalin pumping the very lack of control was frightening and i asked questions id been in a red sector before and id always been able to hold back the defence mode until it was needed minutes or even seconds before the attack but tonight i was ready too soon much too soon i felt primed galvanised invincible i think it was because of the timing the gradual nearing of the deadline the need to wait and do nothing to wait in the trap for the hunter to come in his own good time with his bright skinningknife and there was something else shoda shoda my deadly succuba i could smell the fear on my skin because she had a long reach sending her finelytuned vibrations across time and space to stroke insidiously the tender membrane of the psyche soft as the searching touch of the black widow as she seeks the area where her bite will most easily penetrate and her poison most quickly kill hed be at my throat but shoda was already in my soul in kuala lumpur today a top national front leader addressing his partys annual convention demanded that the ugly encroachment of corruption at high levels be halted as soon as possible eight oclock news datuk dr lim keng yaik also referred to the matter of malaysias threatened economy stressing the sex symbol of the fifties she was fiftyseven al didnt go for politics touching down now with plumes of smoke curling back from the landingwheels and i got up quickly because the only way to get rid of the excess adrenalin was to exercise the body and there was a staircase out there with four flights i could use if i telephone and al took it and said yes hes here and then called out to me and i went over to the bar and took the phone from him hello mr jordan yes he has landed in singapore sayako what is he wearing he is wearing dark business suit head is bare hell need a raincoat is he carrying one he carry only briefcase what had they asked him at the security check in bangkok about the coil of pianowire on the xray screen is there anything else you can tell me sayakosan it might not have shown up it would be very thin there is nothing else mr jordan but i will help if i can you must be very careful and leave hotel if is possible i pray for you now line went dead pray for me yes sayakosan as shoda is praying for me now she prays before she kills i put the receiver back steady rain in the street and al sitting hunched on his stool behind the bar and three men coming in from the stairs asians id seen them before in here and heard them talking they were waiting for a shipment of silk to come in from laos important to them but not important to me because kishnar was here in the city and the deadline for pepperidge to call was past and the lastchance thing was blown away and what i must do now was try to contain the bodys preparedness try to damp down the effusions of lifepreserving hormones as the glands obeyed the panic mode of the mind start with the stairs then bring the muscles into play mr jordan al caught me on the first landing and i looked down you got another call impossible kishnar would never phone me but hed just landed and was coming through the terminal building in a dark business suit not some hessian rag with a headband and a knife in his teeth he would have style shoda would expect style in a man close to her in her organisation a man who had despatched nine of her top competitors in the drug trade her top competitors warlords like khun sa whose income was in the billions of dollars so that each time hed hit one of them it would have increased shodas own fortune by the same figure hed be a millionaire then himself manif kishnar the executioner one of the elite stepping off one of his employers private executive jets and walking through the airport past all the telephones yes he might call me mr jordan my name is manif kishnar and i believe you have heard of me knowing as i do the extensive sources of information at your disposal as a preeminent intelligence agent letting my mind run wild but that was understandable because of the woman i was up against the mystic and i psychotic mariko shoda and because of sayako with her uncanny knowledge of the environment i was moving through shadowed tortuous and cryptic these werent the kgb with their orderly and predictable methodology these werent the paramilitary executives of the state machine they were shadows voices in the night the skilful practitioners of voodoo you will therefore surmise my reason for coming to singapore tonight and since there is no question of my failing to accomplish my mission for my employer may i suggest with all respect that we meet somewhere removed from public gaze and deal with the matter circumspectly i feel that might be your wish dont make the mistake of thinking that manif kishnar wasnt a man like that with a mind like that ive met them before intellectual supremely competent even though their work is deadly they are the elite and they can operate on a level of sophistication you wont find in the lesser breeds removed from public gaze the dark and this would be his reason to draw me into the dark the circumstances mr jordan are well defined if you choose to remain in your hotel then i must come for you there but will that not be a little unseemly the owner is trying to run an honest business after all and we would embarrass him and jeopardise the reputation of his establishment do you not agree sirens in the night the flash of blue and red and white across the walls in the street outside diffused by the downpour the faint squawk of the zipfastener as they closed the black plastic bag before they lifted me als white face on the stairs lily for christs sake get a mop and hot water he had a point kishnar had a point if you agreed to meet me on what we might call neutral ground mr jordan i would offer you all due ceremony men of your calling seldom the with dignity but for you i would vouchsafe it with the rain falling steadily on our heads its drops silvering the dark the exchange of courtesies and then the quick movement and then nothing finis not while theres life my friend but mr jordan it is a foregone conclusion you know that i shall not fail indeed i dare not i am simply attempting to bring this matter to an end in a rational and civilised manner do you see his point a desperate stalking operation through the building here waking the guests however quietly we moved however secretly each seeking the others death until the endgame and the last hot deed enacted in the close confinement of the flesh or a missed foothold and the hideous drop to the stones below or a lost chance and the wires bite and the blood spilling and the cry cut off and then the mess the messiness of a violent death or alternatively his offer of due ceremony out there somewhere in the privacy of the rain and the dark with no one near and no sound but the intoning of my executioners prayer if this was in his mind you couldnt say he wasnt civilised better surely than baring ones neck to a brute i went down to the bar and picked up the phone toyota what kind of red sector pepperidge his tone was sharp brief i think its too late i told him sorry i had to go up to london then your phones been engaged what can i do im in a massive surveillance trap and shodas sent a hit man here who kishnar manif kishnar yes he works for her exclusively what are your chances about nil the clock on the wall said three minutes past eight why not signal the thai embassy theres no point i police then get them to send a gun team no its i can phone the high commission theyd it wouldnt work fuck it was a shutended situation and he didnt like it we never do the reason why it wouldnt work was because shoda was running things and this time she wouldnt let me get clear this time shed ordered a sure hit and even if i could persuade rattakul to risk a diplomatic showdown against every known principle of intelligence policy or persuade the singapore police to send in a gun team itd be the same thing in the end these people would bring me down if necessary with a rush attack if necessary with a suicide run if necessary with an exchange of gunfire with the police team despite shodas wish for a discreet kill that would cause no fuss and leave no trace three minutes past eight but that wasnt significant what could conceivably make any difference was that it would take kishnar twenty minutes to reach here from the airport thered be a car to meet him and the driver would know the way would know this city intimately but in this rain and with the cabs in demand and cluttering the streets it would take twenty minutes at least the earliest he could arrive here would be at eighttwentythree then give it a go i can send you some shields pepperidge was saying i could raise three or four if no but i want a contact to make a letterdrop one man look you can have more than one one man hesitation then all right got a pencil yes i reached for the phone pad his names westerby hes at description thirty fiveeleven thirteen stone dark brown hair brown eyes ive got that give me a backup lee yeo asian hes at no caucasian all right short pause the scuffing of paper veneker at thirtyfive fiveten eleven stone black hair dark blue eyes a sandan in shotokan thats all i need i told him look ill man this phone nonstop youve got immediate access dont lose any sleep because i knew how he felt hed handed me a mission and after twelve days i was trapped and set up for the kill and although it wasnt his fault he knew the situation knew it of old its the time when the laughter stops i pressed the contact and dialled for westerby and got the ringing tone and waited clock nineteen minutes to go went on ringing wasnt there jesus christ this wouldnt have done for the bureau i dialled for veneker and got the ringing tone again and waited again al talking to the three asians they were showing him a swatch of raw silk the tv flickering above the bar mary came straight round here the minute she heard hut cindy was aver at the ballgame with bob and we couldnt give her the news theyd never get their fucking lives worked out went on ringing hello veneker yes jordan yes sir i want you to come to the red orchid hotel in chong street just of boat quay in chinatown its in a i know where it is all right how soon can you be here ten minutes running it bloody close wished i hadnt said it wished id called it offoh yes in this rain yes sir ten minutes it is bring a suitcase or something look like a tourist and register at the desk ill make contact immediately afterwards got it synchronise watches at hours if you cant make it on time stay away youll be coming through heavy surveillance understood sir but ill be there i put the receiver down and asked al for some paper and an envelope then i centred for a moment to slow the adrenalin but the nerves were humming with it and i walked out of the bar and through the lobby and up the stairs climbing them slowly steadily counting them as a mental exercise to keep the left brain occupied while i went through the next sixteen minutes checking to see if there was anything else that should be done and coming up blank everything was done the fuse had been lit and it was burning fifteen stairs and a chinese woman on the second floor carrying a child lily coming along from my room on the thirdyou eat here tonight mr jordan i dont know i told her didnt know what was going to happen tonight could be anything life death the wire biting deep or the courtyard coming up spinning slowly they say you never cry out maybe the air rush or of course the dawn and no conclusion hed take his time make certain of me no hurry negative dunking yes all right try it this way with a bit of luck i might turn it into an overkill catch him off balance and use a sweep or get to his throat whatever blow his world away instead of mine whistling fifth floor and the rain drumming on the roof a crack of yellow sky through a window again like a rat on a treadmill until it was nineteen minutes past the hour and then i went down to the lobby and walked past the man registering at the desk without looking at him going into the short passage that led to the courtyard at the rear turning waiting al was writing in the big book with its worn soiled cover and its oxidised gold tassel a gesture to elegance a suggestion that was in fact the mandarin oriental and not a sleazy dosshouse on the waterfront writing in the book dear christ we havent got time for dial but then it has to be done because the shutters dont fit exactly across the windows and theyre watching him now the man at the desk just as theyve been watching me for the last hour from the doorways opposite two minute to go two not long but within the critical timeframe centre and relax the doors banged open and someone came into the lobby from the street and i froze and waited for them to move into sight a woman with a dog in her arms middleaged caucasian discount okay al said to the man at the desk you need a hand with the bag no early thirties fiveten eleven or twelve black hair dark blue eyes his raincoat soaked hed walked here quicker no cabs available but got here in time good as his word a sandan in shotokan to be expected he picked up his bag and turned and saw me and i made a signal and he came into the passage an easy stride confident veneker jordan nice weather for ducks i gave him the envelope take this to the airport and leave it at the hertz counter to be picked up by this man whos flying in tonight thats all yes i gave him the keys of the car toyota parked in shadow dont be seen getting into it and in this rain youll keep the windows shut anyway if youre followed try and lose them but dont try too hard they wont let you he stood with his feet apart balanced tapping the envelope on the knuckle of his thumb some of the tension in him coming off because hed expected something a lot more dangerous than this roger once out of the car sir do i try and lose them going through the terminal a beat im quick off the mark again try to lose them but dont and once ive done the drop fade they wont be interested in you after that i sensed his hesitation as he stared at the name on the envelope harrison j mackenzie he was wondering why i was doing a drop in a public place and involving other people and what would happen when the surveillance team asked for the envelope but they wouldnt okay sir do i report back to cheltenham ill do that i checked my watch youve got less than two minutes leave the bag here he put it down do i go out by no this way i took him past the kitchen and into the courtyard at the rear rain in the lamplight falling straight down smelling of steel use that door in the wall across there the cars on the other side toyota right he slipped the envelope into his mac and gave me a sudden straight look you be all right will you never say the he nodded and ducked through the rain towards the door i turned back into the hotel and went along the passage picking up his bag and putting it behind the desk and that was when the heavy booming sound came and the slats in the shutters were lit with a white flash and i stood with my eyes squeezed shut no oh no mother of god forgive me crucifix rain on the roof underneath its sound i listened to the silence tuning the rain out listening to the silence but even then i was picking up small sounds that came into the silence and faded a distant voice on another floor of the hotel a door shutting the far faint note of a ships siren from the river it was necessary vital to keep the steady drumming of the rain tuned out and to identify every small sound in the undertow of the silence because he would come for me barefoot and my only chance here on the fifth floor would be the ability to catch any slight sound he might make the creak of a floorboard the rustle of his sleeves as he brought his arms up in the final instant the jerk of his breath dark pitch dark the lights had been burning when id reached here halfway along the corridor a minute ago four dim bulbs under dusty silk shades with burnmarks on them now they were dark the switch was not in the corridor but round the corner by the stair well that was how i knew he was there he needed the dark dead mans shoes in the last few seconds i suppose hed make a rush and all id know about it would be the sudden change in the air pressure and the breath blocking in his throat and the hot sharp bite of the wire before i could she moved the rain drumming louder here than in the other place would al find the bag behind the desk in a dead mans shoes dear mother of god stirred beside me he came at me in a flash and i screamed the hands of a child still fuckee fuckee her small pointed breasts against me the smell of her as she moved close and held onto me not held me held onto me theres a difference no i said and drew a long breath and lay still listening to the only sound that had crossed the bridge of nightmare into reality the rain on the roof louder here because it was falling on corrugated iron and maybe that was why she was frightened and would also be frightened of thunder so i put my arms round her bring her childs body curving into the arch of my own she mistook me and opened her legs and began moving and i whispered no chuchu no fuckee no you must sleep i said she stopped moving and held me now in a different way not dutifully like a prostitute but almost tenderly for her thered been no tenderness for her to receive or express for a long time i suppose in the refugee camp unless chen had thought it necessary to teach her again in between the fuckee at some time in the next few minutes she fell asleep her head in the hollow of my shoulder and i forgot about her and the rage came back the selfrage scalding because when id walked out of the red orchid it had been in a dead mans shoes venekers i hadnt been thinking it was like a dogpack tearing at my throat the guilt i couldnt shake it off sleep was the only anodyne and even then i saw it again the white flash in the slats of the shutters heard it again the dull booming and als voice startled what was that for christs sake veneker you be all right will you hed been thinking of me of my welfare knowing that i was in the middle of massive surveillance and knowing from pepperidge that i was up against shoda hed hesitated hadnt liked leaving me there on my own veneker a man used to helping people out getting them through if he could id known men like that and he was one of them and it was my honour my everlasting privilege and all id done for him was send him straight into a boobytrap and let him get blown apart oh mother of god have mercy on my soul chen had seen the rage felt it so what happened wheel came off hed told me to come in shut the metal door and reset the alarm a wheel came off bureau idiom someone got killed very intense and he stared at me with his lidless eyes and decided not to say anything more he was tense himself shutfaced and i said sorry about your friend the copilot of flight you went out there didnt you yes what was i mean did he look and i waited then he said what the fuck difference does it make come on upstairs in the huge cluttered room he asked me what did you come here for jordan shelter from the rain from people shodas people yes you mean you want a safehouse call it that for a few days he angled his narrow head thinking watching me im due out on a flight in an hour but you can stay if you want guess you could use a shower hang your things over there theyll be dry by morning this place is watertight when i came back he gave me a worn silk robe it smelt of opium some things youll have to do for me while youre here okay whatever you say he was still watching me considering when that flight went down you must have thought i was in on it right it occurred to me ill bet now you know different or you wouldnt be here katie told me about your friend pepperidge had also cleared him ive done the necessary homework chen looked at the aircraft chronometer on the desk sure head on ope side youre putting a whole lot of trust in me right i dont think its misplaced but if it is youre dead correct theres no particular reason he said casually why i should drop you in the shit but if i find a reason thats what im going to do you dont have anything to worry over so long as what youve told me about you is true youre also okay by katie he got one of his black cigarettes and lit up just spelling it out for you because i have to trust you too if youre staying here in my absence blew out smoke watching it im not talking about little chuchu so long as youre gentle with her shes only a kid but feel free im talking shed have stayed here alone if i hadnt come shes learned life the hard way she can take care of herself is anyone likely to come here nope if anyone rings the bell thats just figurative shell deal with the situation you wont be disturbed what i was saying was im going to trust you with one or two things you can do for me that wouldnt get done if you werent here because she doesnt speak english maybe a couple of words we were sitting on two of the leathercovered tabourets and a coin fell out of his pocket as he reached for a notebook he picked it up and wrote in the book and tore out the page and gave it to me thats where you can call me in laos theres an answeringmachine over there and i want you to monitor calls okay okay there wont be too many nothing social this place is a kind of safehouse for me too as i guess you know but if theres anything that sounds urgent call me will do he nodded when did you eat god knows lets have a snort they been giving you a hard time not as hard as it couldve been another wave of guilt hot and overpowering the hard time had been for veneker chen left another telephone number with me it was punched out on an embossed strip and stuck to the side of the autocall machine i should be back in a couple of days tuesday some time if i dont show up by wednesday or havent contacted you here call this number and tell them im overdue okay he was stuffing a walther p into his airline bag this trip im not sure whats going to happen he zipped the bag shut if you want to leave here before then thats okay and shell be fine on her own take care that had been hours ago and now she rested like the child she was curved against me with one thin arm around me her breathing as soft as a young animals i slept again and the next time i woke it was because of the silence the rain had stopped and it was almost first light she stirred johnny no hell be back soon she drew herself up against the pillows and when it was light enough to see her face i said can you smell smoke chuchu she watched me quietly that was all i can smell smoke i told her i think this place is on fire she didnt turn her head to look anywhere are there any extinguishers here chuchu we dont want to be burned alive she gazed at me with soft and uncomprehending eyes and i knew it was all right to call pepperidge venekers dead short silence and i heard something being knocked over alarm clock or something over there it was eleven oclock last night and maybe he was trying to conserve sleep in case i needed him what happened they rigged a bomb i should have thought of that cant think of everything you lthen i bloody well should have in a moment he said quietly youve got a war on we have to expect casualties i got control again he didnt know a thing of course desperate for consolation best way to go but i dont understand that doesnt sound like kishnar no it must have been one of the surveillance people id left a car standing outside and they assumed id use it again and he got in yes it had been a thin chance but any chance had been worth taking so id worked it out veneker would get into the car without being seen and drive to the airport theyd tag him there and when he was under the bright lights theyd see it wasnt me but by that time it would be too late because theyd have been drawn away from the red orchid and i could have walked out when i wanted to and thats what id done but in a dead mans shoes it was obviously a temptation for them pepperidge said they must have been mad shoda had wanted absolute discretion and had sent a softhit agent to take care of me with no fuss and no trace and shed have that mans life when she heard about this have his neck under a sword because this time it wasnt going to be kept out of the papers and veneker would be identified and shed know id got clear and gone to ground have his neck another little shred of consolation an eye for an eye so forth true pepperidge said she wont like it where are you at chens i gave him the number what sort of condition i wasnt anywhere near should have been jesus christ a simple letter drop and bang and he was dead youll be all right pepperidge was saying at chens ill vouch for him personally but youll have to be careful from now on kishnar wont be called off nothings changed except that im now clandestine wouldnt be going to the thai embassy or the red orchid or anywhere else above ground wouldnt be meeting anyone my only exposure the need for transport a plain van a risk that had to be taken can i do anything for you pepperidge asked no you can turn in now pissing down here he was trying to make light of the veneker thing for my sake but hed be taking it hard i knew a firstclass man when i saw one and veneker had measured up bright brief reliable and concerned how long had you known him who veneker oh couple of beats did a job with him once he wouldnt have wanted to die in bed another pause dont worry old boy id give anything i understand he cleared his throat you still havent come across a colonel cho out there no thats ch yes ive been doing some work on him but its not easy at this distance itd be an idea for you to ask johnny chen he might know about him ill talk to him myself if you like hes not here when you see him then cho could be very important all right what we need to find pepperidge said is her exposed flank i mean shodas and cho might tell us katie had said much the same thing i suppose what you need most is to know her achilles heel itd show me the way in i told him and if i dont find it soon i think weve had it there were two dangers but i didnt spell it out for him shodas fury would now be intensified and shed make my death an ambition the very powerful were like that any show of opposition came as a personal affront and they couldnt rest until it was destroyed the second danger was that i was now in a rage of my own and ready to take uncalculated risks to get at her because i didnt like being stalked through the bloody streets and forced into a foxhole and i didnt like the way theyd wiped out veneker a man whod saved my life with his own and there was the voodoo factor and i didnt know how long i could stand up to it because at the red orchid last night id felt a degree of vulnerability id never known before and it had worried me in the background of my mind id almost accepted the foregone conclusion that kishnar would make his kill inevitably and all id been doing was running around the place like a rat in a trap working out the escape mechanisms i couldnt have hoped to trigger once he was inside the building it had been unnerving and it was still on my mind the sense of oncoming doom say again pepperidge if we dont find a way in i think weve had it any specific reason i mean apart from kishnar i just think im outnumbered outgunned im sure you do a different tone sharper and im sure youre not take any mission and theres a time when you cant see the light at the end of the tunnel it gets dark in there ive been down it a good few times you need to rest up for a bit thats all restore the nerves if its any help old boy im working hard at this end and im in constant signals with people in london and the field the sharp tone had faded taking on a hint of false comfort but what else could the poor bastard do but try to rally the ferret he was running yes i told him thats a help its all ive got jolly good show keep in touch she pulled the gun out of the drawer and checked the safety catch with the movements of a trained marksman and i wondered whether shed picked it up in the refugee camps or from johnny chen she went to the door and down the openslatted wooden steps and stopped on the landing halfway down and waited watching the iron door in the side of the wharf the beeper had sounded a minute ago and she was quick to react but not flustered i watched her from the top of the steps and the minutes went by and chuchu turned and came up again and put the gun away and looked at me and made a figure on the top of the desk with her hand three fingers and thumb down and a finger sticking out in front an animal walking along dog i said she walked her hand close to the jade paperweight and lifted her thumb dog yes peeing the alarm was triggered by an infrared ray and angled too low or of course it could be kishnar down there or any one of the surveillance team but id have to watch thoughts like that because id taken infinite care to get here clean and there was no way they could find me they found you at the red orchid because id been walking in and out of the place that was why i hadnt been clandestine dog i nodded to the girl but she didnt repeat it she spent the morning cooking some food and washing the bare wooden floor while i rested on the divan between phonecalls drifting into alpha and working a few things out one of them worried me i didnt know how long it would be before shoda found out i was still alive the toyota had been totally burned out when id left the hotel an hour later going over the wall at the other side where it was dark though the surveillance team had broken up and moved away by then assuming i was dead veneker might have been carrying papers but they could have been under a cover name in any case they were now probably ash the metal figures of the number plate would have been decipherable and the police would have run them through their computer and gone to the hertz office id used my cover name and address and that would have sent them to the hotel but a bitter smell had come into the air and i opened my eyes chuchu was sitting at the small rickety table by the lamp with the dragon shade the ruby chen had given her was on it glowing in the light like a drop of blood she was gazing at it her eyes lost in its colour as she inhaled the tendril of smoke rising from the tin ashtray in front of her where shed lit a slug of opium i closed my eyes again at the hotel then the police would have checked the register and al would have said yes a martin jordan was staying there but he hadnt seen him since a few minutes before the explosion had sounded he would have said this because the instant id realised what had happened id kept strictly out of sight so i would be down as a suspected victim but theyd also go on checking trying to find out where the man named veneker was and why hed registered and left a bag behind the desk and disappeared but had veneker used his own name when hed registered pepperidge might know i didnt have enough data to give me a fix on the deadline the time when shoda would find out i was still alive but it would be some days at least before they could identify venekers body through the dental records if any existed in singapore gimme a kiss honey some days perhaps that was all i would need in the afternoon there were some phonecalls and i made notes for chen three of them were from people who didnt leave their names or use his we didnt make it the strip was waterlogged after the rain and we put down in chiang mai you better tell them aver there you know well try again in a few days two calls in chinese the hokkein dialect which i didnt understand then another americanaccented asian the price is right but they want guarantees can we make them get back to me as soon as you can blue zero in the evening i phoned chen in laos using the number hed given me a woman answered in a tongue i didnt understand but i kept on repeating his name and she got him for me hows it going ive got some messages for you do you want them now sure i read from the notes the rest i didnt understand there were four okay what else nothing by phone the alarm sounded about midday but chuchu said it must have been a dog that things too low ill fix it when i get back is this girl safe with a gun whats she doing she went to the stairs with it when the alarm beeper sounded oh sure yeah shes trained all right shes also using opium so what else is new different viewpoints she doesnt have long jordan shes been on coke for two years thing is to show her some kindness while she has the time left okay thats why i took her in understood i could smell cooking housekeeper concubine gunhandler drug addict and soon to die chuchu fourteen signing off i told chen sure take care the phone rang again in twenty minutes and i went for the note pad this is katie do you know where martin jordan is if he contacts you let me know mil you im worried about him look after yourself too bye to avoid it seeming like a coincidence i didnt do anything for an hour not because i didnt trust her but because this was a safehouse and i didnt want her involved i didnt want her to get in too deep where the waters were dangerous then i took the parrot cage off its hook and took it into the bathroom and shut the door and came back and phoned her martin yes i heard her let out a breath you sound all right im fine where are you then she said sorry as long as youre all right yes how are you her fair hair swinging as her shoulders came forward the fan turning slowly under the ceiling cushions all over the floor the taste of zabaglione im all right too she said and ive been working hard for you is it safe to talk yes all right well listen darling theres a man you ought to see if you possibly can although im told its difficult but he could be terribly important to you his name is colonel cho i didnt say anything martin listening i thought youd gone i was thinking the spelling is cho yes is he in singapore no i dont exactly know where he is but johnny chen does so will you phone him and talk about it yes all right well thats all god i wish i could see you darling soon yes please later i shared the food that chuchu put on the table rubbing my stomach to tell her it was good and pointing to things and naming them for her as if she had time left to learn a new language then when she lit another slug of opium i found a couple of wooden slats from where the crates were stored and got some string and made a rough cross propping it against the wall while she watched me i bent over the little tin ashtray and made a gesture of inhaling then went and lay down with the cross above my head doing it three or four times and pointing to chuchu knowing shed seen enough of western customs to know what a cross meant she got it at last and just nodded knowing that too then her eyes opened wide and she pointed at me saying something quickly a question and its meaning came to me she was asking me if i meant that i were going to the under a wooden cross and the atmosphere in the room the vibrations the malevolent scent of the opium and the eyes of this doomed child that had already seen too much of life brought a sudden tremor and tightened my scalp and i picked up the cross and broke the string and threw the bloody thing into the corner moon drop dropping through the dark hes half crazy chen had said have you met him we were talking about colonel cho pepperidge he could be very important what we need to find is her exposed flank i mean shodas and cho might tell us i havent met him johnny chen told me no hed got back late on tuesday night nobody ever meets that guy hes holed up in a burntout rebel radio station in the jungle in laos and like i say hes halfcrazy there were two guys who tried to get near the place earlier this year and the dogs got them he has killerdogs around lets have a snort dropping through the dark chen was sitting on the floor with his back against the wall and one thin leg drawn up his arm hooked across his knee he looked tired drained the fine lines in his face deepend by the light and shadow his almond eyes strained looking beyond their focus seeing i thought his dead friend so id forget it he said and swung his head to watch chuchu a spark of light coming into his eyes now she was kneeling in front of a garishlycostumed xieng doll that hed brought back for her she seemed to be greeting it formally according to some kind of custom giving it hardly perceptible bows her hands not much bigger than the dolls placed together steepled i didnt like disturbing the silence their thoughts its necessary as quietly as i could for me to see him in a moment chen swung his head in my direction then youre halfcrazy too how was your trip my trip okay i guess he seemed to be coming back to some kind of present she look after you yes very well shes an accomplished lady cooks good thai suki i taught her that she give you thai suki yes i didnt know what it was called he lit a black cigarette squinting through the smoke she likes you said you think youre going to die is that right made some kind of a crucifix i was just doing some mime for her trying to tell her shes going to die if she keeps on with that stuff she knows that he shrugged we all know where death is out here its all in the same place in the poppy fields whys it so goddamned necessary for you to see this goon ive been told he might have some information i need you have any connection some kind of introduction no he blew out a stream of smoke with a whistling sound jesus have you ever seen the front end of a wartrained doberman that never gets anything to eat there are ways of handling dogs oh sure you shoot their ass off and the next thing you know is your owns gone up in smoke cho is real mean but you dont seem to be getting the message dropping through the dark the lines hissing what else do you know about him johnny not much he was watching the child again you look cute sweetheart cute she looked up knowing the word sweetheart it wasnt quite a smile that came into her eyes but a lessening of melancholy the most i knew now that shed ever be able to give him he was chief of intelligence to me now of an insurgent group affiliated with shodas organisation he was clever but he wanted to handle things his way and she didnt like that she had him arrested and slated for execution but he got away with it somehow with a head wound youd never believe a current of air drew the smoke beneath the dragon lamp and upwards through the shade quickening as it reached the heat of the bulb making me think of ectoplasm of ghosts hers mine his whos with him there i asked chen in a moment at the radio station hes on his own been there a couple of years maybe more i doubt anyone really knows hes become a kind of legend i guess but if you want cold facts the cold facts are that he doesnt like anyone going near him which is why understandably hes holed up in a remote place like that in the jungle thirty or forty kilometres from the nearest village which is a narcotics centre anyway buried out of sight ive made a few runs in there otherwise i wouldnt have picked anything up on the guy ask me to guess id say theres damn few people in the whole of indochina who know about him just the villagers and fliers like me who go there does shoda know where he is i doubt that too shed have the place divebombed if she did well he tilted his emaciated hand rotating it in the french manner maybe thats not true he cant do her any harm for christs sake the way he is now thats how he knew about the place himself he ordered it divebombed for his group to wipe out some rival operations does he use the transmitter thered be nothing left of it and nobodys ever picked up his signals or theyd have said he plucked some tobacco from his lip studying it who the hell told you he has any kind of information for anybody i got it on the grapevine he shrugged dyou trust it yes well okay but i mean if you want to go see the guy i guess its as good a death as any but what am i saying youd have to shoot every goddamned dog first to get yourself your own bullet theres better ways in the poppyfields would you drop me there johnny impatiently he watches the track see theres a track from the village where they ran the stuff to build the station with you can still get a vehicle through but werent you listening you try i mean by night a moon drop by parachute yes he shifted his position letting his long thin legs rest on the floor his flyingboots angled fuck i just dont know why you wont listen it was dark inside the van almost dark chen had hired it for the day and bought some gear for me a backpack with things i might need sleepingbag torches flares firstaid insectrepellent snakebite kit a machete look hed said youre going to have to walk up to the goddamned place even if i drop you from the air so why not walk up to it by the track he cant see in the dark he wont expect anyone to approach from the other side nor will the dogs hed settled for a thousand us dollars we parked the van on the tarmac near his windecker ac and checked out at the crew station hed found me a pilots uniform and sunglasses but i wasnt worried about the environment the van hadnt picked anyone up and the only people we went anywhere near were the airport officials and i was here in my dead mans shoes you been in deep jungle before jordan in training training how real real commando type yes hed been putting questions like that all the way to the airport a man with a sense of responsibility i dont need a thousand lousy bucks that bad and what i dont like about this whole thing is im offering myself as a party to suicide before the fact dropping through the dark the lines hissed in the airrush and somewhere high in the canopy a tag of fabric fluttered sometimes so fast that it produced a musical note a low whining the canopy was grey because the moon was almost full otherwise we couldnt have done it the sky was clear of cloud or haze the colour of white eggshell with the moons brightness blanking out most of the stars hed dropped me from three thousand feet and there was no wind his computer had done a fairly accurate job i could see the shape of the radio station almost directly below and i still had a minimal drift from the aircrafts one hundred knots at the droppingpoint the lines hissed thered been doubts and id expected them i still didnt know what resources pepperidge could tap what kind of information he could get at that distance he could pick things up in the pubs and theyd be from the communications mast but the raw intelligence going through it nonstop was massive before it hit the computers and was broken into streams for analysis but hed just got back from london and that was probably where hed been working on the colonel cho lead the only thing i had to rely on was that he knew that whatever move i made would be dangerous and he wouldnt willingly expose me without good reason signal me at any time on any subject and ill get to work immediately i really am on the ball you know or i wouldnt be here now the jungle was coming up moonlight shadow a spread of dense leaves like a dark sea rising id told chen that if katie asked about me he wasnt to tell her how difficult it would be to talk to cho the sound of his plane faded to silence southwards in the direction of the village cho wont take any notice if he hears us at the drop altitude planes run in to the strip most nights hed told me i was crazy not to bring a gun and offered me his or are you one of those nuts that get their kicks making things tough for themselves the last thing i want to do is make a noise shit even if its to save your life the first shot would bring the dogs johnny he had certain blind spots the nightglasses for instance hed finally put a pair in the bag for me but i wouldnt be using them even though it was a strong temptation theyd reflect dark sea rising the light and shadow of the leaves taking on the semblance of waves running below me all i could see was the rough shape of a building halfburied in the undergrowth with a thin stem of a mast leaning at an angle there was no flat ground no clearing the place looked like a wrecked ship lying on the seabed smothered in weeds stink of the insectrepellent on my face and hands i wore no gloves i wanted to feel things the lines the handle of the machete a dogs throat perhaps i didnt know it could go any way an easy fall among the leaves or an errant movement in the air and my legs smashed against the mast or a hot death with my own throat ripped by their teeth i never have liked dogs though they werent the worst i guess youve got everything jordan stuffing the gear into the bag for me couple of tilings i should tell you if you sleep on the ground check for ants theyre this size and in that region there are black mambas and they hunt by night if you get unlucky dont bother with the snakebite kit their venom takes less than a minute to knock out the heart muscles zipped the bag shut have fun dark sea rising fast now with the mast leaning away from me its shadow lying across the broad leaves silver under the moon i held the machete behind me its bright blade hidden from the light i couldnt hear any dogs but it didnt mean they were sleeping if theyd been welltrained they wouldnt bark even when they attacked but they could be jungle happy by now undisciplined halfstarved voracious air spilled from the canopy on the left side and i tensioned a line and straightened the drop watching the spread of leaves and their shadowed gaps the radio station was half a mile away and the distance was closing but i was almost down and i drew my legs up and brought them together and became aware of the real speed of the drop as the jungle rose fast and the shadow of the canopy spread suddenly black on silver to my right and grew in size and swept in a dark wave as the leaves leapt to meet me and i was among them with the machete out of its sheath and its thong tight round my wrist and we were down and i shielded my face with the other arm and felt the tugging of the lines and the whiplash effect of stems straightening as i plunged between them and found nothing under my feet nothing but the air and then the rush of undergrowth and then the ground impact my legs doubling as i leaned into a roll and dragged on the lines and started work with the machete at once because i might need the ability to move at any given second move fast cut myself free and waited damp smell rising my flyingboots had churned the fibres of the jungle floor a smell of fungus silence overall with small sounds coming into it and breaking off fading i stood still waiting for the retinae to accommodate vines hung overhead festooning the patch of sky lacework against the moons light something was moving not far away making a rhythmic whispering sometimes fading coming back then a sudden rush of sound as a bent stem freed itself and straightened like a whip tearing leaves away it wasnt dark here it was worse than darkness the moonlight spilled through the gaps overhead and dappled the undergrowth creating a mosaic of black and white with nothing defined except the edges of shadow i knew where the building was and that was all if there were tripwires i wouldnt see them if the dogs came i would only hear them the rhythmic whispering had stopped not far away a snake wouldnt attack unless i seemed threatening or was near its nest if that sound had been a snake it would have come for me by now but the thought of it persisted its sinuous length contracting forming coils the flat head held still as it heatsensed me a trickle of sweat gathered and ran i breathed tidally the better to listen there were no distant sounds only near ones small and subtle and once a creature voicing a swift kill in progress it sounded like because of a cry cut off and then scuffling i waited another few minutes and then unbuckled the harness and lowered it to the ground stepping away tripping on a tendril and getting my balance again there was no accurate measurement possible but if the jungle were this dense as far as the building it could take me the rest of the night to go half a mile given the need for silence it was now and in four hours the moon would be down and thered be total darkness here under the leaves with only the glow from sirius through the gaps overhead i could stay here and sleep and acclimatise during the coming day but thered be heat moist and enervating and by daylight the dogs might roam hunting and if a wind rose in the wrong direction theyd pick up my scent at once or i could move now and try to reach the building before first light and deal with whatever i had to deal with in the dark i thought that was the best way it was just before three oclock when i saw the top of the radio mast leaning across the gaps in the leaves and i put the distance now at three or four hundred yards the silence was still not absolute though there was no sound from inside the building all i could hear was the nocturnal life of the jungle around me some kind of big cat had voiced an hour ago perhaps a tiger a low wickering in the distance two miles away maybe three id heard a dozen more kills one close the scream of fright piercing the night and bringing the sweat out on my sides thered come the smell of blood raw and intimate then the swishing of leaves as the predator had carried the prey into the deeper reaches and then towards dawn there was another sound of a snout rooting scenting and in the mottled light i caught the shape of the dog as it froze for an instant and then came leaping for me with its ears flattened and its jaws bright colonel cho bassai the jungle was in here creeping through cracks migi gedan barai and then hidari the triple blocks very fast a rat ran along the far wall in perfect silence i was kneeling migi shuto chudan uke a whipping swordhand his breathing was steady then explosive the final swordhand hidari kiai he bowed and in bowing saw me stillness from my kneeling position i returned the rei not only out of respect for his obvious rank but also to emulate the male woolf that arches its neck to the side offering its death to the adversary in the hope of life os when i looked up again he hadnt moved he was in the centre of the room a big room almost bare its floor earthen its walls fissured with leaves and whole branches of the undergrowth thrusting inside the jungle was slowly devouring the place though i could see where hed been hacking at it regularly working his way round he was above average height but not tall his gi was worn patched but clean his feet of course were bare his one eye watched me the other eye had been buried in the hideous cleft made by a blade of some sort that crossed his face diagonally cruelly distorting it his mouth had escaped the blow but it was no more than a thin line set in an expression of total cynicism or hatred or hostility the mouth can only express so much unlike the eyes his eye watched me with the look of a wild creature assessing the presence of another of a smaller creature who could offer no threat but might be considered prey the ice along my spine was because of this look he was giving me robbing me of my identity i was nothing his look told me human there was also the similarity between this mans head and the dogs because as the dog had leapt for me i had buried the machete in it splitting open the skull sunlight pale and slanting was coming through one of the gaps in the wall and around the mans feet were motes of fibre drifting still airborne from the final movements of the kata of bassai the place smelled of damp of fungus of the jungle a raw blend of animal droppings fresh blood and chlorophyl the shadow of colonel cho leaned right across the earthen floor thrown by the lowangled light its head against the whitewashed wall i waited still in the kneeling position there was nothing else i could do the bombs must have blown the rest of the building down and thered been fire afterwards one wall was missing altogether and on that side the room was crisscrossed with fallen girders plaster and timberwork festooned with creeper the flooring in here must have been burned away and hed cleared the ashes dumping them into the jungle taking great care there was no trace of them hed also found some whitewash and covered most of the blackening the fire had left on the walls the roof was still in place a tilted expanse of corrugated iron almost intact the door id entered by was behind me it had been open and qui etes vous flicker along the nerves un ami sempai acknowledging his rank i would have said godan veus etes arrive comment by air i told him en francais so i went back to french it was the tongue we were going to use obviously we made a moon drop i added when just before midnight colonel he hadnt moved yet i wasnt looking forward to that his movements in the kata had been swift and powerful and underneath his chilling calm he must have been enraged to find me here this place was more than just his territory it was his refuge his only haven in a world where he was an outcast because out there he would have had to see people flinch when they looked at him in coming here i had violated his very soul how did you get past the door his french had the overcorrectness of those who speak a foreign language learned formally and not through usage i could have lied but he would have known and on the wall was a faded picture of funakoshi and there was the ingrained principle in me that disallowed my lying to a sempai but by god it was a risk i had to kill one of them he was silent for so long that i didnt think that any kind of change was taking place he was standing perfectly still as before then i saw that something was happening to his face it was altering its shape moment after moment in a way i didnt immediately understand until i saw that his eye was now almost hidden by his nose and the raised flesh of the scar hed been turning his head and by such infinitesimal degrees that i hadnt noticed he was now sighting me rather than watching me and the impression i had was that hed withdrawn behind himself to observe me from concealment this was my first intimation why it was a whisper it would have killed me silence at the edge of my vision i saw another rat on the move and heard its faint squeaking then i shall throw you to the others but not yet there was something coming into his voice too a different tone that i couldnt quite identify but it reminded me of the way fosdick had spoken to us when hed got back from marxstadt one of the dogs barked outside the sound coining a deep chest resonating others took it up excited by something an animal theyd sighted i showed nothing who is your sensei yamada in london yes sempai he was still sighting me in that strange way as if hiding behind himself this impression was quite clear it wasnt my imagination it was bringing a chill to the nerves they were vulnerable at the moment because i hadnt law whether i was going to come down the wrong way and smash my legs on the building and then thered been the doberman with its jaws wide open and then the sickening business stopping the thing short and now there was cho standing there and i was perfectly sure he meant what hed said about throwing me to those bloody hounds you may rise os i made the ret and got to my feet and then something screamed outside and the sound of the dogs took on a different note it was a kill he was listening to it cho his maimed head lifting a fraction but his eye was still sighting me how many are there i hesitated dogs no there are seven dogs his eye disappeared as his head was turned and then sighted me again with an expression of exaggerated cunning aided by the set of l mouth six now a flash of revelation came to me then vanished before i could grasp it how many men where colonel out there how big an army mother of god yes the same tone that had been in fosdicks voice when hed got back from marxstadt with the burns from the electrodes still on him and that strange light in his eyes the east germans had put him through implemented interrogation for three weeks and it had driven him mad i dont know i said carefully because what could i say i didnt know what theyd done to this man before theyd tried to kill him but it could have been that massive head injury alone that had affected his brain he was probably as big a danger to me as anything out there in the jungle and if his mind were damaged he could blow up at any minute and come for me or call the dogs in the only chance i might have could be in humouring him but you must have seen it he said the army i came down in moonlight colonel all i could see was jungle his face was changing again as he brought his head back by infinite degrees and i noted this the movement could be significant his way of sighting of seeming to hide behind himself might indicate the times when his brain went out of phase he was facing me now and asking normal questions again why did you come here by air i was told you like your privacy yet you still came yes i why i think we can help each other his head began turning again and the hairs on my neck rose in reaction he said nothing and i waited this time the phase didnt last long and his head moved back to do what to destroy shoda you must have seen a cat facing a dog the eyes narrowing and the ears flattening and a hiss coming from the open jaws it was like that its not enough to say that he recoiled he tensed drew back threw up his guard all those things without making much movement or much sound and somehow it looked worse for that it was an expression of total hate total menace barely contained about to detonate if shoda had been here now she would have been ripped into pieces this man didnt need those dogs it took time for him to recover and the aftermath was a grimace of pain not of physical pain now but the pain he had felt when that monstrous blow was struck cleaving his face and the pain hed been feeling ever since day after day remembering what he looked like and what people especially women would think if they ever looked on him again he was still young say forty and that must be his photograph id seen on the wall near funakoshis the picture of a handsome asian high cheekboned in the yul brynner mould largeeyed sensual colonel cho would have loved many women now he was a creature a caliban selfimprisoned in a hermits cave a whisper came shoda something was moving in the background behind him and i noted it even though it wasnt defined cho was watching me intently as if id offered some kind of revelation his expression was perfectly sane now and it occurred to me that in simply mentioning shodas name id recalled memories hed been keeping forced down under his need to forget but i couldnt tell what this would do to him bring him increased sanity through release or drive him deeper into madness i had the feeling of stepping through a minefield in the dark snake that was the movement behind him high among the creeper that itself was winding its way through the beams and girders of the fourth wall the bloody thing was hanging from the leaves by the tail its head down and moving from side to side heatsensing the earthen floor still in a whisper you said destroy yes the whole of her organisation he was chief of intelligence in an insurgent group chen had told me affiliated with shodas organisation he was clever but he wanted to handle things his way and she didnt like that she had him arrested and slated for execution but he got away with it mehow with a head wound youd never believe come he led me across to a corner and that was when the snake dropped and the rat squealed and my skin crawled though he took not the slightest notice he shared the life of the jungle here and was used to it but it came to my mind that if he were ever struck down with a fever or couldnt move around hed the with the jungle too or the dogs would scent easy meat and pick him clean tell me he said why you wish to destroy shoda i was his guest at table towards noon we sat on the floor japanesestyle on each side of a slab of redwood with a great crack in it hed lashed thin cord across and across to keep it together you know of course that there have been many attempts to kill her yes we ate some kind of root peeled and sliced with dried fruit and a bowl of mashed turnip by its taste and you are confident that you can achieve what so many others have failed to achieve no but i shall try its a matter of intelligence colonel the gathering of intelligence information that was your own field i believe he didnt answer that who told you that i might have such information one of the pilots who flies into the village here told me youd once been involved with mariko shodas military forces he didnt ask chens name i wouldnt have given it god knew how many rats were in this place one of them was moving close to the table smelling the food i doubt cho said carefully if i would have any information that would be useful to you but the problem was that his head was moving again turning his one eye sighting me it was like having to learn a language he was distrusting me so whatever he said could be almost the opposite of the truth i knew perfectly well that hed got information for me or pepperidge and katie wouldnt have told me to see him then i was misinformed i told him go with whatever he said dont contradict the sleek brown rat jumped onto the table not much of a feat it was only about a foot and a half from the ground it looked rather pretty but presumably had rabies colonel chos eye was still sighting i didnt look at him directly but watched him at the edge of my vision what else have you heard about me the tone silky very little colonel only that you were an exceptionally gifted intelligence chief and a loss to the rebel forces he didnt answer for so long that i looked at him directly the moodphase was over his head was turning back and now he was looking at the rat but how flattering and of course true his movements in the kata had been very swift and it was over before i actually saw what was happening he brought a swordhand down with great speed and perfect control and the neck of the rat gave a delicate sound as it snapped so we have meat today cho said and took his knife and skinned the rat and sliced into the small bright body and worked there bringing out the liver offering it to me theres always some kind of joke we can take back to london if we get through the mission and pass around in the caff thank you colonel but im a vegetarian theyd love that one then i shall profit from your preferences he put the tiny liver into his mouth and broke one of the delicate bones in the rats neck slicing it into short lengths and eating it slowly i feed as the tiger feeds first the vitamin a and then some calcium they are synergistic i dont know why the hell i wasnt sick the things skin looked strange lying there empty on the table and how am i to know he asked me that you are not here in order to spy on me for mariko shoda should i lie to my sempai that got through he looked down considering wiping the rats blood from the corner of his mouth i followed up without waiting ive told you the name of the company i represent in england and you could verify that i left it to him to find out how from the depths of the jungle shoda has already tried to have me killed she set some of her women on me in singapore with their knives he watched me closely his eye calm now intelligent and who came to your aid no one i killed four of them indeed you did well shoda didnt think so he was watching me intently i can well imagine such a thing would have incensed her as a personal affront what action did she take she put her top hitman onto me he put his bloodied knife onto the table carefully without taking his eyes off me kishnar yes when three or four days ago short silence yet you are still alive do you know that is remarkable he didnt get a chance to close in but he will hell try he looked away at last and slipped into one of his contemplative phases i was beginning to know him we had some fruit and he cleared the table and told me to sit with him in the corner where the rugs were and some halfwrecked chairs i begin to see why you expect to succeed in your mission he said quietly where others have failed a mission of this order is not new to you not really you make a formidable antagonist ive upset a few people in my time and you would make a formidable ally if i decided to take you into my confidence an ally against shoda as i told you colonel thats why i came quite so making a bit of progress but oh christ i wasnt at all sure of that because his head was turning again and all i could see was that one eye sighting me from behind what he believed was cover and i thought i knew what was happening these relapses of his into psychosis werent haphazard they happened when he was suddenly afraid hed made himself vulnerable it didnt seem to make sense that hed just offered virtually to let me become an ally and then suddenly retreated but in fact it did he felt hed put too much trust in me and it could be dangerous i waited because i couldnt do anything else if i said a wrong word it could make him enraged violent and in this place i wouldnt stand a chance his head came back to face me and my nerves felt a chill he was two people this man and one of them potentially deadly we shall see he said and got up from the frayed rug where hed been sitting and left me his bare feet padding across the earth he didnt talk to me for the rest of the day except for an occasional word in passing he spent his time hacking at the creepers that were threatening to smother the doorways and a window and i helped him getting the machete that id left outside with the gear id dropped with in the late afternoon he wrote at the long redwood table it looked like a journal the book was as big as a telephone directory and leatherbound two or three times i turned to find him sighting me even though we hadnt been speaking it was obvious that he was giving me a lot of thought and that some of his thoughts led him to distrust me i didnt find it easy to turn my back on him his bare feet wouldnt make a sound on the earth what i had to think about before anything else wasnt to find a way of getting information out of him information on shoda but to find a way of leaving this place alive i had absolutely no protection here cho had kept himself in regular training and from the kata id seen was totally capable of killing me and not by stealth and even if i managed to placate him the whole time and not let a wrong word slip out the dark side of his personality could suddenly decide that i was here to betray him and then hed come for me and even if i could kill him in selfdefence if he came for me there were the dogs theyd smell death and seek the carrion and find me here when night came he lit oil lamps and we had supper but he said nothing about shoda it was as if shed never been mentioned and it occurred to me that as well as his intense bouts of paranoia he might experience lapses in memory and lose its content wholly or partially i wanted to test this out but it was too dangerous the first time id spoken shodas name hed reacted violently for all i knew he might have completely lost the conversation wed had earlier in the day in the end i decided to sleep on it he was behaving now as a dutiful host showing me where the running water was to be had and explaining the system he had of catching it from the heavy rains and directing it into a reservoir there was no bed here he apologised but he himself slept on a straw mattress and gave me one to use when he doused the lamps i curled up in a corner of the room with the machete underneath the edge of a rug and within easy reach we shall talk tomorrow was all he said and this confirmed my assumption that hed spent a lot of his time thinking about me and what id told him hed got the data and needed time to assess it that was fair enough but i had no way of knowing that he might not decide at some time in the dark hours that i was too much of a danger to him and slaughter me out of hand as hed done with the rat not easy to lie there uncertain not easy to sleep it was the same out there in the jungle its creatures slept always at the brink of death and knew it and knew what it meant when a scream came suddenly close or distant the remorseless cycle of life was going on red in tooth and claw under the rising moon i didnt know what time it was when i woke disturbed by sounds id chosen this corner of the enormous room because it was on the opposite side from the wall of creepers where the snake had hung and dropped a rat had moved across my legs earlier and id jerked them and it had gone thered been a cry of a night bird soon afterwards and id been brought awake with my skin crawling coming out of a dream that i didnt remember except for a lingering visual trace of coils and shadows now it was different the sounds coming to me from across the room they were human voices i believed they were faint but i could hear their rhythm changing and their tone there was more than one person speaking it had the sound of dialogue or it was a dream and i waited for some kind of data to come in lying so still that my own breathing was inaudible moonlight was striking softly across the earth floor it came in rays filtering through the creepers on the far wall in it i saw something on the move small longer than a rat some sort of stoat a predator its thin tail held stiffly behind as it darted suddenly and made its kill with nothing more this time than a scuffling the teeth going into the throat before the cry could come the voices didnt stop and for a time i lay listening to them and at last surfaced through the twilight zone and knew for certain i was now awake and that the voices were still going on cho had lain down in the corner where he slept beneath the picture of funakoshi he wasnt there now i got up and moved to the centre of the room and turned slowly until i got the direction of the sound then i went over there to the door in the south wall that id never seen open the voices were louder here and the words audible radio no there was no consistency it wasnt a programme but i told him there was absolutely no certainty of that so what was his reaction he simply said we would be going ahead in any case since the ambassador wanted to yes radio then but taped these were tapes i was listening to being played over to check the contentsbut im damned if im going to give in to him the prime ministers quite adamant on that score we dig our heels in she told me and tell them were not going to budge all right sir what it i tell blakeney tell him to go to hell the real issue et je vous assure msieur le consul que nous aliens faire tout le necessaire pour produire le resultat que nous cherchons cest tout a fait impossible de faire autrement en consideration des nouvelles de paris surtout as i guess you know but if theres anything that sounds urgent call me will do when did you eat god knows lets have a snort the rat this time it was a womans voice on the tape colonel cho was watching me intently do you know who is speaking no it is the voice of shoda the sibilants were silky and drawn out emphasising certain words but the tone of her voice was harsher than id imagined carrying a deep energy filling the small studio commanding authoritative there was a break in transmission and cho stopped the recorder do you understand cambodian mr jordan no what was she saying she was ordering one of her army chiefs to hold back the mobilisation of his forces until the shipment arrives she also told him that it was essential for him to remain in close liaison with her other forces to avoid a precipitate action they were right pepperidge katie this was a major breathrough my target for the mission was mariko shoda and in the temple in thailand id been close to her physically for the first time and now i was listening to her voice as it issued orders to one of her army commanders there was massive data coming in for questioning and analysis and id have to take it in stages one johnny chens place was bugged but id have to get the answers from cho with infinite care because hed come close to killing me five minutes ago when hed opened the door and found me outside god knew how hed sensed me there but he lived in the wild and was junglesensitive he hadnt been startled and his head had turned slowly to sight me and in his one eye there was the light of rage his body was also moving subtly his breath drawing deeply from his abdomen as he gathered force his right shoulder lifting by degrees as he brought the arm back preparing the vector that would bring the edge of his swordhand slicing against the carotid artery in my neck id initiated this blow often enough to recognise its preparation he was ready now and when i spoke i think it was within a halfsecond of my death sempai funakoshi watches you i waited id run through the whole gamut of options open to me and none of them would have worked i knew that but id remembered something that had got through to him when hed seen me here for the first time and was ready to attack me for my flagrant intrusion id addressed him punctiliously as my sempai my respected superior in the sacred tradition of shotokan and it had given him pause i went on waiting movement in him had ceased and his mind alone was active its dark side ravaged and traumatised and vengeful willing his body to destroy this creature this threat to his sacrosanct privacy while the light of reason flickered also within him a candles flame beset by the wind then it was over and his head turned to face me come in i want you to see my communications centre the tension went out of me and as the left brain began functioning again i noted that whenever this mans mind returned to reason he had no memory of his lapse into psychosis the room was small but walled on three sides with dials signalstrength meters switches charts and timeschedules it must have been the original receivingtransmitting studio and it had escaped the worst of the bombing cho went to the ripped vinyl chair on the dais in front of the main panel and began running the tapes ignoring me as the signals came through again there were cassettes everywhere stacked on the shelves and along the console with boxes of blanks bearing the sanyo shipping label then the voice of shoda came again its sibilants lingering the consonants frank and articulated cho turned his head that was monitored some days ago she was giving instructions for the british agent named jordan to be brought to his death really you are a fortunate man he went back to his editing and when signals came in english french or russian i listened to them when they were in a language unknown to me i worked on the data that was still coming in two chens place was bugged by whom not by cho id noticed that whenever an english signal came through he stopped it short even though one of the dialogues had been on a high level politically mentioning the british prime minister chens place could have been bugged by one of his competitors in the drug trade but i doubted it he wasnt bigrime running a whole network leave it for now three who had bugged shodas communications sayako sayakosan id asked her over the telephone at the red orchid are you in shodas organisation i have access to information sayako then yes it was logical this could have been the signal shed picked up just before shed warned me the one id just heard giving instructions for the british agent named jordan to be brought to his death another signal was coming through in english and i listened to it before cho cut it short it was from the flight deck of a northwest orient jet the accent japanese not a bug i began listening the whole time now as cho made notes and fastforwarded some of the signals running others back to monitor again id have said at this stage that he was searching for specified transmissions and i could have been right but i was beginning to realise that there was no order in this material no sequence he was picking up bugs in four languages but among a whole range of random signals a lot of them aircraft some of them hams two of them radiotaxis in singapore what worried me was that he didnt edit out the garbage he should be doing that and wasnt he looked up suddenly fixing me with his eye he is always late that one taxidriver oh jesus christ late i asked him yes they will fire him soon you mark my words he turned back to the console and listened to a signal in french chinese accent aircraft to base while i tried to think how to get out of him what i had to get because he was just listening at random picking up whatever signals he could find as he turned the dials and he was just as interested in what some bloody taxidriver was talking about in singapore as he was in what shoda was giving him check that where is the bug colonel on mariko shoda he flinched at the name and i expected him to react as he had before but it was all right this time we could talk about her now i am not sure i think in one of her limousines or perhaps an aircraft the wavelength tells me nothing there was some speech in what sounded like laotian in the background and in a moment he said without changing his tone this man is drugrunning but he is an amateur it is a bug placed by the narcotics branch it will be amusing wont it when they catch him the spider and the fly no not in the least amusing this poor bastards mind was like the console here filled with random signals dial had no pattern when that sabre had swung down and cleft his face it had turned his brain into a mental kaleidoscope all i could do was put questions have you any idea colonel who placed the bug in shodas communications system no but i didnt think hed heard that or understood do you think it could have been a woman named sayako his hand stopped moving the dial and his body became totally still he didnt turn his head didnt look at me just sat there i didnt know what id started in him i was ready for anything no movement in him for what seemed minutes then his head lowered and something fell onto the chipped grimed shelf of the console glinting in the light it was something so extraordinary to issue from such a man that i felt the strangeness of compassion the stirring of a mood in me that i believed was long ago buried within the shell of indifference demanded by the life id chosen and so we sat there in the cramped cluttered room in the laotian jungle a foreign agent and a former chief of intelligence while on the console the human tear made a dark patch that had already begun drying colonel cho turned his head at last and looked across at me his riven cheek glistening no he whispered it was not sayako at first light i woke with a jerk of the nerves but there was no threat that i could see it was simply that id slept with me subconscious awareness that my host might at any time go pitching over the edge of his fragile sanity and come for me in the hours of the morning he spent his time hacking at the creeper and writing in his journal and towards noon he went into the radio room and talked into one of the microphones at the transmitter console speaking sometimes in his own tongue laotian and sometimes in one of the chinese dialects i stayed near the open door and once went in to ask him if i could take a message with me when i left here it was the first time id mentioned it and i watched him carefully hed been lucid for the past hour except for that fact that the mike he was using was dead none of the transmission dials were registering when you leave here yes i need to go on with my work he sat looking in front of him not up at me your work my plans to destroy shoda he turned now and faced me his eye rational so i couldnt tell if hed remembered what id said when id first come here or whether it was something new to consider i thought id follow up with the big question if you agree to let me have the wavelength of the shoda bug i can use it very effectively colonel he gazed at me for a time and then looked away we shall see we shall talk of that so i had to wait and in the afternoon he took off his kimono and put on his gi moving to face the portrait of funakoshi and giving the ret the punctilious bow with the head lowered and the eyes down expressing trust in an opponent he then worked out for an hour and went through kanku and jion allowing me the privilege of watching for a time there was no sound but the movement of his feet through the stances and his deep guttural kiai the powdered earth churned by the kicks and turns floated above the surface of the floor again i noted his great speed and strength it didnt reassure me later he motioned me to sit with him on the rugs in the corner his eye was calm but his head turned a little sometimes and i sat facing him with a kind of prayer running through my head it was the first time in any mission id had to deal with a deranged mind and in a man capable of overwhelming me with his bare hands you wish to leave he said yes why should i trust you with what he moved a hand with my presence here i have enemies who would like to find me i understand that but you can trust me because i am your cohei sempai his subordinate in shotokan is that sufficient funakoshi would think so his eye flicked to the portrait on the wall even so you would be carrying my life in your hands if i let you leave here i understand that too it would be an honour sempai that i would respect even at the cost of my own it would have sounded less formal in english but the meaning was there what had happened after all id come here by stealth a stranger killed one of his dogs and entered the privacy of his dwelling uninvited yet hed offered me food which is basically an offer of life itself he had also forgiven me for looking upon his maimed grotesque countenance that hed hoped to keep hidden from the world for the rest of his life that was the least i owed him his life you are persuasive he said its not my intention i hope simply to reassure his head began moving and i held my breath and centred hed been slipping into the psychotic phase less often than yesterday perhaps because hed learned to trust me a little but he was now having to make up his mind to trust me totally and his brain was in overload i sat perfectly still and faced him as id learned to do faced his one eye as it sighted from the edge of his riven cheekbone i still found the effect chilling transfixing he was so certain that he was now in hiding and watching me from behind cover that there was a degree of transference i halfbelieved that this wasnt his body but some object that concealed him a rat squeaked in the silence even this slight sound bringing shock cho hadnt heard it deep in his meditation his eye didnt change expression which was one of fierce enquiry i could have imagined a ray of light playing on my face searching it i wanted to move but couldnt darent wait all i could do wait and then i heard his breath come releasing the turning of his head was so gradual that for a moment i didnt catch it after a while he was facing me again his eye calm very well cohei i left the next morning cho gave me the wavelength of the shoda bug but none of the tapes they were his voices as he put it though i wasnt quite sure what he meant unless they peopled his selfmade prison if hed been normal it would have been easier for me he would have given me the shoda tapes for editing and analysis in singapore they offered the kind of information that an intelligence agent would give his soul for but there was nothing i could do about it they were his and i couldnt steal them or force them out of him they were his voices and his obsession and he couldnt see the logic of letting me have them to use as a weapon for shodas destruction but the wavelength alone was a breakthrough and id have to settle for that i asked him about the reference to the arrival of a consignment on the shoda tapes but he said he didnt know what she meant i asked him if shed mentioned a missile but drew blank again i didnt want to press it because hed agreed to let me leave and i wasnt keen to have him change his mind he took me to the door that id never yet seen open outside were the dogs dont move he told me six of the bastards the seventh was lying at the edge of the jungle a skeleton theyd found it and dragged it here and picked it clean this was their stampingground the jungle floor beaten down and littered theyd brought other carcasses here half of them rotting when they saw me they went into the attack posture at once ears flattening and the neckmuscle rising the dry mangy fur bristling they had teeth like bright knives colonel cho was talking to them in a chinese dialect hed had them brought here from the village probably but i didnt know whether he could control them or only believed he could he lived half his life in fantasy and this could be part of it he was less predictable in a way than a raving lunatic you couldnt tell reality from the dream the nightmare ta shih shou jen pieh yao ta telling them i was a friend presumably yes he was putting his arm round my shoulders to show them and i had an instants mad idea that in this pose we should be asked to smile the bastards didnt look too impressed they backed off a little but moved in restless circles their heads hung low and their eyes up to watch me a concerted snarling deep in their throats didnt care for it i tell you i did not fucking well care for it in a pack this size they were sudden death and the only man in control was stark raving mad sweat running on me only two options left go back and stay with him until he had a brainstorm and did me in or walk out there through the dogs and let them do it they will not attack you cho said and took his arm away didnt ask him if he were sure too much bloody pride thank you sempai took six paces turned gave him the ret and turned again not looking at the dogs because thats the first rule if you look into their eyes theyll take it as a challenge and thats all the excuse they want kept on walking looking straight ahead and listening to the snarls they were making getting louder because theyd stopped circling and started to follow closing on my heels look straight ahead its a pretty view everything green and moist with a blue haze above the trees something to remember but not for long if they get their bloody way itd be like sharks in a feeding frenzy the first taste of blood sends them crazy and what was he doing cho turning his head like that perhaps turning it very slowly sighting me from behind himself deciding once and for all that i was going to give him away the minute i reached civilisation ta shih shou jen pieh yao ta jesus christ whats he telling them now but its too late anyway because im past the point of no return and in the end its going to depend on karma kismet whatever the hell you want to call it running with sweat the bastards are coming after me i can hear them keep on walking and dont look back look straight ahead its such a pretty view waterbed are you all right yes where she left it hot as hell and humid phone sticky in my hand listen theres something you might be able to do for me anything she said whats your signals staff like at the high commission pretty keen types theyre friends of mine slapped my left arm left a streak of blood ask them if they can monitor a signal on megahertz short wave theyll need to understand cambodian ill try whos sending the signals shoda who line rather dodgy wonder it worked at all in this beatenup hole mariko shoda silence then my god but why should she oh you mean shes being bugged yes strictly under your hat katie of course ill start action on it right away is that everything for now you mean we need a roundtheclock monitor dont you yes i should have thought of that walked forty kilometres through the heat of the day no bloody excuse yes nonstop all right martin this is very good isnt it how did left it very important isnt it yes ive got to go now all right when can i see hesitated left it again take care rang off how many degrees was it in here it was a wonder the bloody mosquitoes could even fly the fan didnt work the last time it was switched on it left the ceiling charred a close thing in a place like this i got the operator again and asked for the number and waited view through the filthy window pane of the street the only one they had here no cars on it just mules and cycles and people walking a lot of them bent double under yoked baskets full of poppy seeds this whole place reeked of wet sacking and something else something bittersweet there was a refinery across there by the look of it a ramshackle corrugatediron hangar like a lab long windows daylight tubing it was getting near sundown the thumping from the next room got faster then some moaning the bed was against the wall and kept on hitting it girls everywhere when id checked in wanna girl no but have you got anything for mosquito bites gave me a bottle kept a whole supply on the front desk chinese one word chen who are you in english jordan short silence jesus youre still alive listen johnny your place is bugged say again theres some kind of electronic surveillance on your place a bug just crackling on the line for a bit no way its never left empty but he sounded shaken then it could be somewhere in the telephone circuit outside or on a wall you need to have a good look silence again then are you sure yes how he left it just like katie because hed realised that if i were right we were being bugged now okay over and out i rang off priorities first the most urgent thing had been to man the monitor on shoda and start logging her signals the next had been to warn chen and id done that what i hadnt done was to ask him if he could fly me out of here but i wasnt putting that on the bug id give katie an hour and phone her again my aircrew uniform was pretty well in shreds after the drop and the trek through the jungle and i went into the street and found a shophouse festooned with jeans and jackets and kimonos and bushshirts and spent some time there and then took the clothes i needed back to the hotel and had a shower and changed smearing the mosquito stuff on my face and hands again as the sun went down across the jungle i shut the window and pulled the thin faded blind down and put on the only light a bulb in the ceiling katie wasnt at her flat so i tried the high commission and got her were running she said you mean that im quite good when theres something important to do sounded pleased not piqued shed worked damned fast i didnt have any doubts that makes me very happy why are you calling again are you all right yes but theres something else you could do for me call johnny chen and ask him to meet you inside the high commission building inside it when he comes ask him if he can fly me out where from he knows i didnt want her to be seen with chen in the open and i didnt want her to know where i was whoever was bugging chen could be tailing him too and i didnt want her exposed all right she said tell him to see if hes being watched tailed if he is tell him to lose them before he goes to your building if he cant lose them he doesnt go there in a moment is he in danger no chen could handle whatever came up that was the way he lived finally tell him that when hes found the bug i want it the bug when he finds it let me have it all right sound of a shot and i reacted somewhere on the far side of the street but quite loud a heavy calibre i said thats it for what was the bang car backfired short silence then shit didnt believe me look after yourself martin i rang off at once in case there was more shooting someone out there was yelling his head off and there was another shot and he stopped id have said it was just the lifestyle in this place when id got here along the halfobliterated jungle track the first thing id seen were three burntout aircraft near the airstrip and a troop of laotian soldiers guarding the muletrain coming in from the mountains and half a dozen ranking police officers and an army colonel guns on their hips in the street thered been people with attache cases chained to their wrists on their way to the refinery and more soldiers guarding a flatbed cart leaving the refinery for the airstrip everyone looked tense except the local workers and a lot of those were stoned out of their minds in this heat i wouldnt have thought it needed much to provoke some gunplay id been surprised at first to find a phone in the room here because it didnt go with the rusty washbasin and the burntout fan and the caked flypapers and the peeling walls but this was the only hotel id seen and this was where a lot of the business must be done so theyd need telephones i tried calling cheltenham but the girl on the switchboard told me it couldnt be done so i stripped off and lay on the bed under the mosquito net reeking of citronelle and waited for chen to call and tried not to think that he might not do that i didnt know how long that bug had been there it could have been for months a routine narcotics operation by the singapore police or it could have been put there recently by people whod decided to move in on chen and itd be logical for them to stake out his place with surveillance on the other hand wed got into the van perfectly clean the night hed taken me to the airport and flown me out so it could be just the narcs they couldnt have done the same thing at chos place but it was too late anyway because i was past the point of no return and in the end it was going to depend on karma kismet whatever the hell you wanted to call it running with sweat the bastards were after me i could hear them teeth like knives phone ringing woke me id drifted off yes nightmare are you surprised for christs sake you didnt see those dogs thought theyd got me yes jordan yes chen on my watch id slept for two hours after that bloody trek where are you calling from the british high commission you werent tailed there no by the way he said it he was sure did you find the bug i havent had time to look what do you want it for in case i want to talk to colonel cho johnny can you fly me out of here silence thinking no but hold it a minute i heard the sound of paper scuffing on the line the bed was hitting the wall again one of the girls rooms then poor little bitch one of them told me once that bordeoms the worst thing about it you there yes theres a guy named tex miller a yankee hes putting a partenavia p victor down on that strip some time around midnight you got a pencil yes the id numbers nk tex is okay talks a lot but hell do whatever i want hell get you as far as nah trang on the vietnamese coast theyre shipping his goods from the seaport its a civil airfield and you can get a scheduled flight from there to singapore if thats where youre aiming for got that said yes if you dont have the right papers ask tex to get you through he can do that they earn big from him okay im grateful think nothing telling me about that fucking bug you dont know what you might be saving me from i thought of asking him to tell katie id be back in singapore soon but didnt never chance fate the whole village was blacked out except for a few chinks of light where the blinds didnt meet all i could see from the edge of the airstrip was the glint of metal as the soldiers moved in the moonlight some of them carrying rifles cigarette smoke hung on the still night air laced with marijuana i thought he was running late but that was because i hadnt picked him out from among the stars he was coming in with no lights on there was just the sound of his twin engines gunning up for the approach and then a generator tripping in from somewhere near then the strip lamps came on only six of them and halfhooded his landing lights blazed suddenly a thousand feet from the ground and the planes shape began blotting out the stars as it passed against them the wings yawed as he corrected the angle and he gunned up some more and then settled throttling back and as his lights threw a pathway down the strip i could see how rough it was pitted and undulating as the edge of the jungle was tit beyond it there were cries of alarm it sounded like monkeys and parrakeets some nightbirds by the time the p had come to a halt it was surrounded by troops and as miller dropped to the ground a police captain flashed a light on him briefly and then asked for his papers i waited for him in the halfdark then stopped him as he came through the group jordan who he peered at me oh yeah cmon over here okay metal attache case chained to his wrist cold cash he peered at me again as light from a window passed over us and stopped suddenly jordan okay you got some id i showed him my thai papers and he held them to the thin ray of light squinting a short man potbellied redhaired a pilots cap stuck on his head at an angle a gun outlined under his bush shirt his left hand loaded with rings diamond ruby emerald one with a snake sculpted from gold and topaz okay yeah johnny briefed me he lit a cigarette and drew the smoke deep jesus thats better you cant smoke up there gave me my papers back lets go in here i got a little business to do first under the tube lights of the refinery he looked ready to drop redeyed pouchy his skin sallow his hands shaky as he unlocked the wristchain and pushed it into his pocket pakdee here he called out hes on his way tex well christ i hope so im down on time stink of ammonia in here it was a small hangar tinroofed with twenty or thirty girls working at the lab benches five or six supervisors walking constantly down the aisles two offices at the end their doors closed you been in places like this no they stink right put a hand out im tex miller i guess you know that whats your first name jordan martin its good of you to offer to take me out my pleasure i guess i owe johnny the ride he was watching the girls this is kuhns operation the whole village i mean its just one of them hell pay around a couple of thousand bucks for a batch of raw opium out of the fields up there in the mountains and then they do the refining in this place and a good few others like it spread around the triangle jesus look at those tits big for a coolie girl he dragged on his cigarette she looked about sixteen they all did sixteen and dulleyed and half dead then they ship the pure heroin out in kilo bags to bangkok where itll retail at around fourteen thousand maybe around that figure then itll go direct by air to the states or through the mafia labs in sicily and itll wholesale in the big apple and la at around eighteen thousand maybe twenty thousand before its cut with lactose quinine baby powder strychnine brickdust you name it going through a whole chain of dealers before it hits the street where that original two thousand bucks worth of opium brings in around two million bucks as street scag he turned as a man went past him hey wheres pakdee for christs sake im due out in three hours goddam it and i need some sleep he turned back course in laos they have their local trade going too they run a cigarette factory lab turns out no heroin and sells under the brand name double uo globe hundred per cent pure guaranteed and you know what the logo is couple of fucking lions roaring at each other over a globe kind of appropriate considering the competition around here you wanna smoke marty these are straight camels not just now is that why the village is blacked out the competition tardy that partly the way things are run sure you could have some competitor vang heng or tricky lee or mariko shoda people like that you could have them send a couple of divebombers in here and wipe everything out so they just dont make things easy for them then theres the official side see the laotian army general running this operation for kuhn greases the narcs division in the government to let the place alone but just for the look of things they pretend it isnt here then the government can say they never knew what was going on its big money okay maybe three or four million bucks runs through this place every day and thats hey pakdee for christs sake take a minute marty ill be right back he was fifteen minutes and brought his attache case back but didnt bother to chain it to his wrist again okay theyll be loading the stuff on right away at the hotel he signed his name in the register all his movements quick in spite of his fatigue i had the feeling his time was short and he knew it the asian at the desk spun the book around you wanna girl tex you bet make it a couple is kim here ill have to see tell em to hurry i gotta get some sleep too okay marty can you be down here again at three thats in he checked his heavy gold watch two and a half hours can you make it said i could we sat at the end of the strip and waited nothing but moonlight so you aint in the trade marty no so whatre you doing in a place like this im an agent shipping narcotics if hed been drinking hed have choked you gotta be kidding but he was close to reaching for his gun just joking yes well jesus keerist that isnt the kinda joke you make around here you know that british sense of humour no wonder you lost the fuckin empire a green light flashed a couple of times and the strip lamps came on and he gunned up and got the brakes off and the pressure came against the spine and we were airborne and the lamps went out below us sorry tex huh oh thats okay you just dont understand the situation you comfortable be there in a couple hours nah trang right in south nam we went into a tight bank and the compass settled at degrees what were those burntout planes doing down there tex its a tricky strip and some fliers are better than others it doesnt take much to burn us out if we get the touchdown wrong if the trip needs extra fuel we shove a waterbed on board full of gasoline thats what this thing is right you wanna smoke you better go out there on the wing and do it american sense of humour tooshay i heard some shots down there earlier what was happening well sometimes one o the coolies or the freighthandlers or the muledrivers gets on a bummer you know has a bad trip and they can just take off and go crazy all over everybody so the troops or the cops shoot em down because we cant have that kinda thing around a place like that you know everyones so nervous and it could start something or i guess it couldve been some dealer on the cheat and the supplier wouldnt stand for it or the buyer got pissed off you know it isnt too different from the wild west with the gold rush on except the money that changes hands in the triangle is about a thousand make that a million times as much on any given day its a jungle see you think thats a jungle down there its just a daisyfield we levelled off at ten thousand feet with the heading southeast how long do you plan to stay in the trade i was talking partly to keep him awake hed looked dogtired when hed brought this plane in three hours ago and he couldnt have had more than two hours sleep given thirty minutes to bring the wall down three in a bed we were flying a petrol tank and the fumes were no help how long do i what plan to keep working give it another couple o years maybe around that by then ill have stacked up three or four million bucks an i guess ill be ready for acapulco or montecarlo for a while ease off a little is there much rivalry between you actual pilots not usually get personal feuds sometimes but we dont often try and cheat each other out of trips you wouldnt bug each other say hows that again you wouldnt slip a bug into a rivals communications guess not we all kinda know whos goin where an we keep our asses clean bugs nope i never heard o that noted we came down from our ceiling at over south vietnam and called up the tower in nah trang there was cloud cover across the coast topped with a gilding of light from the east and we dropped through it into the dark again johnny said youd get me through the barriers is that right sure dont show your thai papers okay gets too political he left me on the terminal side of the tarmac at with a wind rattling the shutters on the cafeteria and the heads of the palm trees rustling shining under the floodlights you want another ride marty check with chen im always around im much obliged and i hope you make it make what two more years he gave a shrug and a wave and left me a cloud of smoke across his shoulder as he walked away id need some secure transport when i landed in singapore so i went to the line of telephones and called the british high commission but she wasnt there katie then i gave i the operator the routing code for cheltenham but the phone went on ringing and i hung up at twenty if its any help old boy im marking hard at this end and im in constant signals with people in london and the field all right but who the hell were the people in london and who were his contacts in the field and why couldnt he get that bloody phone manned near the mast in cheltenham for gods sake because i needed direction and i needed it now as well as a safehouse in singapore because there was nowhere else i could use as a base thatd let me keep the mission running and the police could have identified veneker by this time and if it went into the news media the shoda team would be on the watch for me again and kishnar would close in chens place was hazardous now because we werent certain that sayako had bugged it and if it were someone else they could have mounted surveillance on it as soon as theyd found out the bug had died there was a malaysian airline flight out of nah trang at and i booked on it and tried cheltenham five times while i was waiting and drew blank again that bloody man was as much use to me as a dead duck we were ten minutes late on takeoff but landed early on a tail wind at the moon behind clouds and puddles on the tarmac after rain the air humid and scented with blossoms i used my thai papers and they didnt hold me up with any questions and i used a side exit marked airport personnel only and found myself in an alleyway and came round to the rear of the taxi station and began looking for cover man in a raincoat stepping from a doorway excuse me not quite sure of me in the pilots cap and sunglasses then he nodded good flight pepperidge yes what first thing is to get you off the street come on he took me to a car with smoked windows and diplomatic plates katie at the wheel style give him that the clinic what did you try i tried to overdose on valium thin pale holloweyed still young thirtyodd but you can take a whole bottle of that stuff and it wont work for you that was the last time two male nurses zeroed in on a man going towards the door and got hold of him gently yes how long ago i asked him a week thats why they sent me here wife and two kids killed in a car smash hed just picked up the phone and the police clerk had said is that mr david thomas please how do people stand it feel any better i asked him any different i suppose so thing is when i get out of here and go back to the house where we all he couldnt go on let it all come out david theres nothing left in there hit the wall then it wouldnt bring them back you see nancy chong was waiting for him and he looked up excuse me he said and followed her i was down as paranoid suicidal tendencies nonviolent general health good but traumatised following airline accident voluntary patient agreed readily to curfew and confinement to clinic limits pending initial psychiatric evaluation the advantages pepperidge had told me in the car are manifold everythings found for you there as a patient so you wont have to go into the open you can also make and receive unlimited phonecalls so that youll be in close and constant touch with me either directly or through someone manning the phone night and day how did you get me in there he was different sharper than when id last seen him in london perhaps it was just that hed knocked off the booze the clinic is britishmanaged and i talked to the resident doc at the high commission your cover will be simply that youve been through a tricky time and need to rest they wont ask any questions and you wont be evaluated or given counselling or anything understood yes was it just the lack of booze there was something else hed turned professional and was doing a good job had got katie out of her office and a car with cd plates he would have needed firstclass credentials for that so this little problems taken care of he said and pulled a copy of the times out of his raincoat and slapped it onto my knees front page photograph of veneker following the carbomb incident of last tuesday night the police had identified the victim as james edward veneker a british national enquiries being pursued with utmost rigour so forth it was the photograph that clinched it the shoda hit team wouldnt think id just changed my cover name i gave him back the paper do you know where kishnar is no but youll be safe at the clinic his yellow eyes watched me clearer than theyd been before in london his gaze direct trust in me im beginning to he took it well didnt look down what brought you out here well come to that later the radison clinic was in pekin street and katie got us there without losing her way as pepperidge got out she looked back at me once you all right martin yes you i am now pepperidge was scanning the street and i waited all right he said and i touched katies hand and got out and crossed the pavement with him when id signed in he took me to the small rectangle of lawn in the centre of the building and we sat in shadow on garden chairs still damp from the rain the grass soggy underfoot there were lamps along the verandahs and people moved there some in white coats the air was steamy oppressive what brought me out here pepperidge told me was partly that mccorkadale phoned me in cheltenham and said she thought youd hit on something important she said youd got access to some kind of electronic surveillance on mariko shoda that right yes she had your number in cheltenham i gave it to her a few days ago the last time i phoned her at the high commission for an amateur shes extremely bright im sure youve noticed yes but i dont want her to get too involved now that kishnars back in the picture i dont want her at risk he thought for a moment then said quietly she can look after herself you know pretty accomplished just keep her well in the background pepperidge message understood he was sitting more or less sideways on to me and i watched his profile angular against the distant lights pensive as he worked something out then he faced me suddenly look we need to put this whole thing on the line as ive told you ive been doing a great deal of work in london and a great deal more out here through unimpeachable sources particularly on mariko shoda and her background he waited are you here to brief me no im here to tell you that ive compiled a massive amount of raw intelligence right across the board and im in the process of analysing it when anything comes up that i decide you should know ill tell you he waited again but i let the silence go on because i knew now what his drift was and i needed time to think about it your mission quiller is now at the stage where you can break right through and go for the objective but you cant do that without a director in the field i know of course you do he angled his head im putting myself up for the job thats why i came out here id already had enough time in london hed looked like just another burntout spook and all hed had were a few connections in the trade he was hanging on to people like floderus and a few chums down at cheltenham with an ear at the mast and if id known what it was going to be like to work in a distant overseas field without a director there i wouldnt have touched the mission hed offered me id have turned it down flat but id been smarting from the meeting id had with that bastard loman at the bureau and i was scared to death that id been out for the last time and was going to finish up training recruits or helping costain with the industrial counterespionage network he was trying to set up industrial jesus an armchair operation the end of the bloody line and no future no brink so id done it without thinking taken this one on and wished to christ on half a dozen occasions that id left it alone but it was different now pepperidge had changed hed straightened himself out and got off the booze and established his credibility at the british high commission and found me a safehouse at a time when i couldnt have survived without one and now he was sitting here in the shadows watching me and waiting and i knew he wouldnt say another word until id made up my mind and told him yes or no and the reason why it wasnt an easy choice was that the relationship between director in the field and his shadow executive is close circumscribed and demanding if i said yes then i was going to put my life in his hands my life and the whole of the mission and he was going to have to move heaven and earth if necessary to safeguard them both hed have to feed me with info and provide for my welfare and get me contacts if i needed them couriers drops signals facilities and local liaison whatever i asked him for he would also have to deal with my nerves the accelerating risk of paranoia that always gets into the ferret when hes down there in the dark and starts smelling blood his own or someone elses theirs by the grace of god or the luck of the devil according to how you look at things above all i knew that if i were going to take him on it wouldnt have to be simply because there was nobody else you can get killed that way id have to do it because i wanted him trusted him have you ever directed in the field before no he didnt look away i suppose theres a first time for everything he let out a breath be a privilege he said mutual he got up and took a pace or two watching the lighted windows the people moving along the verandahs not seeing them i knew that i also knew that it had suddenly hit him that he was taking something on that even a seasoned director like ferris would have shied at without the bureau behind him then he turned and took a slip of paper from his pocket and gave it to me my number round the clock i memorised it and gave the slip back to him youve got your thai papers yes any others no if you need any we can get them done here overnight you know mayo street no reliable hed been out here two years ago on flamingo with croder running him that was a help he knew the field he came and sat down again sitting sideways to face me debrief all right thai intelligence did you do any more on mat yes but i didnt get anywhere if theres a mole hes down deep at the embassy itself you know what youre asking of course it was next to impossible to check out a government intelligence agency without months of work and in place im still not easy on that score so im not reporting to prince kityakara or anyone else for the moment and theyre not pressing me thats fair enough they gave you the job and you said youd do it and youve only been out here for how long fifteen days theyve already been months trying to bring shoda down and they couldnt do it thats how i see it and thats why i phoned katie to ask her to get the shoda bug monitored its running now he nodded quickly incredible it might give us all we need now what about the bug on johnny chen it could have been put there by sayako the woman whos been trying to protect you yes it could have been the singapore narcotics people who bugged chen but i think theyd have dropped on him by now it wasnt the shoda hit team because theyd have heard me asking chen to fly me out to the jungle and theyd have brought kishnar in for the kill but it could have been sayako and this is just an idea because theres a connection between her and colonel cho i told him about chos extraordinary reaction when id mentioned her name what is she wife mistress or possibly his daughter married to a japanese not necessarily whats the connection he looked up mr jordan please lee siang one of the doctors id been introduced to him when id signed in ah right pepperidge got up and spoke close dr siang why not go and see admin about our friend here ask mrs yih shell explain need to make examination he tilted his clipboard to catch the light mr martin jordan yes shell tell you all you need to know doctor mrs yih all right oh very well big grin not know about this excuse me i got up too and we made the round of the lawn under the frangipani trees the scent of their blossom heavy on the air theyll take a bit of time pepperidge said so whats the connection with the chen bug it could be anything but he flies into that airstrip regularly and its within forty kilometres of chos radio station well see if we can get her to talk a bit more he put a hand into his pocket again for you he dropped it into my palm a small round plastic component like a black pillbox the chen bug thank you chen gave it to mccorkadale and she gave it to me what do you want it for i might need to talk to colonel cho some time and this is the only way does he speak english french he was monitoring chen not specifically he was picking it up by chance across the wavelengths hes got a whole range of stuff going into those tapes totally at random i reported at length on cho and it took half an hour pepperidge got out a minirecorder and put it on the cassette the only two transmissions i heard in shodas voice were in cambodian and cho translated for me so i got this bit at second hand she was telling one of her army commanders to hold back on mobilising his forces until the arrival of a consignment of some sort she said it was vital for him to stay in liaison with her other forces to avoid precipitate action oh really his voice was quiet a consignment of what cho didnt know i asked him that one of course he stood thinking well be picking up some more about it as the material comes through ill analyse it myself and give you the essence at the moment it looks as if she was talking about the slingshot and ill pass that straight on to my people in london see if theyre willing to do a little research for me go on will you i finished the debriefing and filled him in on the village out there in the jungle and the way it was run then i went over the whole of the material and found something id missed on the chen bug theres something else that points to sayako i was at his place when he said i should take flight and the next day she got me paged at the airport to stop me going at the time i couldnt understand how shed known and now perhaps we do i wonder he said just horn useful sayako could be to us if we really explored the question weve got her phone number now by the way got my attention very fast how she gave it to us he pulled out the little recorder again and changed the tapes she phoned chen today and gave him the number and asked him to pass it on to you he didnt know where you were so he phoned mccorkadale with it and she contacted me i phoned sayako and taped it for you he switched the thing on yes my name is pepperidge mr chen passed on your number to me since im a close friend of mr jordans can i give him any message where is he now please im not quite sure but i shall be seeing him soon a break as she hesitated very well i wish to talk to him if he wishes also it is very important to me personally also he should know that mariko shoda is very angry because of car bomb happening which allowmr jordan to escape kishnar she order execution of person who placed bomb i will tell him more if he wish to talk to me by telephone please tell i will but he has my confidence miss sayako so you can tell me anything that please confidence i mean you can tell me anything that you can tell him it is safe to do that she hesitated again this time for longer i very much wish to talk to him please tell click on the line she rang off i asked him not you right shes protective dyou think i should phone her yes unless shes got some kind of official status she cant have your number traced there was the sound of shoes on the wet grass then a womans voice im sorry but its nine oclock curfew thank you pepperidge told her the rectangle of lawn went dark before we reached the verandah theyd switched off the main lights and now there were only pilot lamps going can we go along to your room yes they dont allow visitors after curfew but ill fix that if necessary the thing is what sayako said on the phone means quite a bit more maybe than you realise the corridors were quiet and he brought his voice down weve been hoping to find shodas achilles heel and i think weve done that and i think it can give us the mission its the bug no its you obsession i want his head the smoke from dr israels thin cheroot hung on the humid air floating in the glow of the pilot lamp in soft grey skeins you have exactly twentyfour hours i want his head do you understand that mine my head tell me i asked dr israel about obsession he was quiet for a while hed had a busy day thered been two more suicide attempts during the evening and id seen three male nurses at a steady jogtrot along the north verandah twenty minutes ago heading for the room where a woman was screaming this isnt a rest home pepperidge had told me earlier its in the front line try not to let it worry you the place was quiet now and israel sat with his short legs crossed and his white jacket hanging open and the end of his little cigar glowing in the halflight in front of us the expanse of lawn was dark obsession he said and smiled what can i tell you about it well its real i mean he waved a thin angular hand people say their husbands got an obsession about golf you know or they say their wifes got an obsession about her diet something like that he shook his head that is not obsession wanted to ask what about heads my head didnt ask it has an infinite number of presentations you see one can be obsessed about so many things but the real obsessions are focused on abstracts hate revenge life death sex sickness health he shrugged there was a man who was convinced he had cancer of the stomach you see and they gave him all the tests and they were negative but he wasnt satisfied he was sure he had cancer of the stomach why probably we never found out probably because his father had died of cancer of the stomach and this man had been unkind to his father so when the old man died the son felt so much remorse that he wanted to suffer the same fate you see not on a conscious level of course not at all another weary smile not much of what we do is ever done on the conscious level so another shrug he walked into a telephone kiosk and called the hospital and pulled out a gun and shot himself in the stomach and told them to come and get him theyd told him you see that he didnt need to undergo exploratory surgery which hed asked them for so now he had to have surgery and he knew theyd find the cancer soft shoes dr israel yes is mary all right he didnt look round yes until she tries again dont let her try again rustic of a skirt as the girl moved away did they find cancer i asked israel all they found was a bullet that is obsession a killing disease sometimes yes often a patient of mine was obsessed with his lack of attractiveness to women he wasnt badlooking and he was gentle with them and he was rich yoy isnt that attractive to women but no someone had said in his childhood that he was a little runt something like that it happens all the time kids are cruel brutal to each other sometimes so this man spent all his money on screwing one woman after another to prove how attractive he was and finally he got aids and hung himself that is obsession the movement of a white coat in the gloom on the far side a womans soft laughter christ how could anyone laugh in a place like this its something you cant stop i said yes he uncrossed his legs and crossed them the other way it starts at ten miles an hour and gets to fifty and then to ninety and you cant stop it you crash twentyfour hours her voice had gone onto the tape three hours ago twentyone but someone very powerful i said someone clever intelligent authoritative say given an obsession what you call the real thing they can finally lose control and crash he blew out a curl of smoke you have heard of adolf hitler the smoke straightened into a long skein under the lamp has gunther been dealt with not her actual voice a translation accented english there was a man on the hit team id told pepperidge watching the red orchid a european teutonic he could have been the one who rigged the bomb gunther pepperidge had nodded concentrating again releasing the pause button where is kishnar i want your report on him tell him i will give him twentyfour hours want that mans head the translator put emphasis on the last word we have not found the body of the third agent but his head was delivered to my office in a cardboard box majorgeneral vasuratna thai military intelligence part of their culture pepperidge told me trying i suppose to make light of it once youre snuffed you wont care where the bloody thing is he switched off the recorder and ran the tape back bit poky this room isnt it looking around bed chest of drawers upright chairs rush mat lamp small mirror and that was it you want me to get it changed i shant be spending any time in here his yellow eyes brooded on me so what i mean is i think weve found her achilles heel and its you agree you mean shes obsessed yes that is exactly the word its beginning to sound like it this was why id got hold of dr israel later to gen up a bit as i told you pepperidge said ive been doing quite a lot of homework some of it with kityakara personally in view of a possible mole he agreed that there was absolutely no need for shoda to order the bodies of those agents sent back to the palace and the police headquarters and so on she took it personally he says its because of her childhood experiences shes intensely vulnerable to challenge also a clock a tin clock by the bed a loud tick getting on my nerves i tried to tune it out she was absolutely incensed you know by your going into that temple to face her out head tilted why did you do that exactly i thought itd be useful to then i stopped because id caught what i was saying and we dont always do that we trot out a convenient rationalisation and leave it at that a standin for the truth wed rather not talk about i started again thought itd be useful to try talking to general dharmnoon because he was the man lafarge wrote to about the slingshot but that was just a reason id cooked up after a bit i realised i hadnt finished still didnt want to talk pepperidge was waiting patiently i wanted to see shoda i said at last silence again to see her i started walking about feeling trapped i think its becoming a bit obsessive on my side too becoming personal and i think its because she scares the shit out of me so i want to confront her face the bitch in a moment i see he didnt ive been scared plenty of times life on the brinks like that you know what im talking about youve been there too and ive been pretty certain ive had it too often enough but this is the first time ive felt i couldnt find the right word so i threw in something close though it was appallingly melodramatic the first time ive felt doomed pepperidge said nothing the word hung around like a whiff of cheap scent i began wishing to christ hed break the silence say anything he liked to cover the ticking of the tin clock finally i stopped pacing and stood looking down at him he was sitting in one of the upright chairs with his feet together and the taperecorder on his knees and his head tilted as he watched me and i was suddenly looking at a new dimension in the man and it shook me it was as if the pepperidge of the brass lamp in london had been an act doomed he said because he knew what id seen and he wanted to cover it not give it any attention i took a step away a step back touched by anger i suppose youre playing straight with me are you yes at once and with emphasis you and your mission are my total concern he wasnt lying i would have known ive no choice i said ive got to believe you oh youve got a choice old boy you could just tell me to fuck off couldnt you deadly serious i suppose i could but youre not going to and of course youre perfectly right tilted his head straight doomed you were saying i let out the tension on a breath yes i mean weve faced situations you and i in whatever mission and weve had to deal with them and get them behind us and go on since were still alive weve had periods of relief in between when we can breathe again i leaned my back against the wall feeling its coolness in the warm room its different pepperidge this time for the last week ive begun to feel ive walked into a shutended operation thats going to be the death of me whatever i do in a moment he said ive never felt that but i know what you mean do you even his understanding would be something to grab and hold on to but even that thought was a warning of how far gone i was the room grew even smaller suddenly the walls pressing in it could just be this bloody place all these poor bastards cutting their wrists and swallowing valium could just be the atmosphere here the vibes it wasnt i understand very well he said what youre feeling its the effect mariko shoda has on people particularly people she doesnt like ive talked to a couple of them they told me the same thing as you in their different idiom she scares the shit out of them cho was suddenly in my mind the way hed reacted when id spoken her name shodas so its not just my nerves i said no he shoved the recorder into his side pocket and got up going from wall to wall ill really have to get you a bigger room you know you need space but were doing some good work here and i think you know that let me tell you stopping and standing in front of me very direct that ive been getting a very distinct picture of what this mission really is i didnt see it at first nor did you this is a very different sort of job from the ones weve been used to doing getting someone across digging out papers or tapes or a hot product cutting down an assassin the usual things this has turned into a duel you agree on a psychological level his eyes narrowed you could even have said psychic because thats what shes like and i know that now and so quite clearly do you which is exactly why i asked you why you felt compelled to go into that temple and confront her though i must say i didnt know you were going to take half the night to come out with it he looked at his watch so how do you feel about the future i took a minute to think bit keyed up he was doing an extraordinarily good job as a local director considering hed spent most of his career life as a ferret in the field he was critically concerned with what was going on in my mind in my nerves and this could be because hed got some briefing set up for me that would push me right to the brink but i didnt think so hed come out here because hed sensed that if hed stayed in cheltenham i would have lost direction and run the whole of the mission into the ground and now that hed got here he was testing the ropes for slack and getting down to business conning a safe house for me and tapping the high commission for resources and debriefing me within hours of his landing in singapore but now he wanted to know what condition the ferret was in and how far i was prepared to go and i didnt know i hadnt had time to think but id have to and soon because shoda was putting a lot of pressure on and wed have to react push it back before it became overwhelming keyed up pepperidge nodded thats understandable but i mean how do you feel about mariko shoda herself as an adversary do i think shes too powerful for me to break sort of itll take a bit of doing but i suppose anything can be done didnt sound too sanguine no all right then yes i know i can bring her down given he said a secure base and a director and immediate access to support the whole works i want you to think about that youre not alone any more youre not hunted as long as you stay inside these walls the thing is he checked his watch again i think youre absolutely right you can bring the shoda organisation down given enough support and briefing and ill get that for you i could feel the nerves steadying when at any minute because itll have to come from the tapes from the shoda bug weve got a window on her now and all weve got to do is watch the critical factor is the slingshot as you know because the minute she gets her hands on it then god help us all now im meeting the thai ambassador in half an hour so why dont you phone sayako before i leave here he gave me the number and stuck a suction pad onto the side of the phone and plugged the lead into his recorder and i dialled ringing tone she said she wanted to talk to you pepperidge murmured about something personal remember she might have meant colonel cho and that could be interesting i nodded ringing tone if you can persuade her to let you meet her id like to know what other bugs she might have been putting around nodded ringing shes not there then try again later and put it on tape for me he dropped the recorder onto the night table anything interesting give me a signal i went into the main hall with him and he got me a laissezpasser from the night staff desk so that i wouldnt have to keep to my quarters after curfew questions yes he knew very well id got a question and hed been waiting for me to come out with it and i hadnt done that until now because it was so very important and i think i was scared of the implications he watched me steadily his yellow eyes narrowed if all further briefing i told him depends on the shoda bug and what it gives us i might never be able to move out of this place if the bug stops transmitting if its found and destroyed well be working on a very thin chance true he waited and theres also kishnar tilted his head true indeed this time i waited but nothing happened and it was then that i knew what he was doing and it was going to change the whole of the mission from this point onwards how much discretion are you giving me pepperidge he looked down then away in a moment let me put it like this the shoda bug and the other data weve got on her is in fact all we have to work with and that could be compromised if someone finds the bug and theres kishnar but for the moment well have to let these things take their course however long it needs now his eyes came back to mine unless you can think of a quicker way i could but i didnt tell him that he knew keep in touch old boy when i was back in my room i tried sayakos number twice in the next thirty minutes and got no answer but she was there the third time at and among other things she told me that mariko shoda had just landed unexpectedly in singapore the birdbath he is my father cho the recorder was running i see silence for a while i think she took a quick breath to say something then stopped herself then decided he speak of me in a way though hed said nothing hed spoken volumes spoken of love when i mentioned your name sayakosan he was very moved move he showed that he has great love for you silence again for longer this time i waited shed heard me talking to johnny chen on the bug making our plans to see her father he say he has love for me yes if his love for her had not been in that single bright tear what else had it meant i want to ask she said as i knew she would and with painful hesitation how is he now that last word told me a lot she hadnt see him since that vicious blade had struck and left him how he was now she had only heard he can only ever be i said as you remember him people say and then quietness again not quite silence he is very strong sayako he trains every day in shotokan and he listens to the voices coming to him by radio he is not alone after a long time so and she was over the worst you ask him for wavelength of shoda bug yes and he gave it to me i am very glad i could not give it to you because i did not place it my brother place it but after he three seconds four she find him and execute dear god what star had she been born under i said nothing he give wavelength to my father he listen to shoda yes he hate her yes i hate her also of course it was then that she said that shoda had landed in singapore what is she here for sayakosan is extremely angry because of you angry with kishnar so you must be very careful mr jordan if possible you must leave singapore perhaps but i would like to meet you first not possible too much danger i didnt press it because if she agreed to a rendezvous itd have to be arranged with so much security that itd hardly be worth it i didnt know if the hit team were aware that shed been in contact with me and if they tagged her to this clinic itd blow the safehouse and leave me exposed finis how did you learn to use bugs sayakosan i work in factor assembly line sanyo i see and why did you place a bug on johnny chen hesitation then somebody say he fly to village often village near my father i hope to learn about my father perhaps chen would have flown you there if youd asked yes but friends of my father tell me he not wish to see me again ever and i might meet with him in village without meaning he you mean your father didnt want you to see aim she thought about that yes i wondered which would break her heart the more effectively for her not to see him ever or to see him as he was now sayakosan do you know where mariko shoda is staying in the city yes she has house in saiboo street i asked for the number and noted it we will keep in touch i said touch we will talk again on the telephone yes but you must leave singapore now mr jordan kishnar not play games thank you for your warning i will phone you again sayakosan tick of the tin clock sweat running on me midnight and the sweat running as the ceiling fan stirred the warm air i could put the clock outside the door or throw it out of the window i didnt necessarily have to listen to the bloody thing but what would that prove itd only prove my nerves wouldnt stand it any more and they were going to have to stand a lot more than a clock in the next twentyfour hours you have exactly twentyfour hours i want his head do you understand that shoda bitch do you know what shes come here for to singapore for my bloody head you know thatthe impudence of the bitch i think that was what had made up my mind but the nerves were rioting in this small quiet room at midnight because i couldnt be sure whether i was going to do what i was doing to do on the impetus of sheer rage or the dictates of a sound mind pepperidge would have said no if id put it to him hed have finished with me walked out of the mission i knew that it is not secure behaviour on the part of a shadow executive in a red sector to break out of his briefing and commit himself to an act that his own director in the field would forbid but that was what i was going to do and the thought of it was firing the nerves and costing me the sleep i needed costing me the strength did she know what my contacts were shoda what my communications were did she know that as soon as she landed in singapore id be informed probably and that was probably why shed come to visit me in the dark of night to creep under my skin with the stealth of a succubus and there spread her venom in the veins as i lay with a dry mouth and my hands cold freezing in the heat of the room my breath quickened and urgent as if each were to be the last as she came close to me now her head turned on her slender neck as she looked at me stopping a few yards away in the cavernous silence of the temple until i was staring into the eyes of the angel of death the luminous nightdeep eyes of the creature that was to be my executioner cup of tea yes would you like a nice cup of tea what ive brought you some tea thanked her yes bright morning light they looked after you well in this place cleared up the mess when you cut your wrists so forth brought you a nice cup of tea and a different view of things of course much more confident not a mistake no it hadnt been a mistake to make up my mind to do it because the thing was it would have to be done before we could move on to the objective needed a shower stank like a polecat shave a slow and careful shave with only one bright bead of blood from the right cheek because id held the blade a degree or two from a rightangle drawing blood before the days had a chance to get into gear now dont start that at i left my room and talked to the girl at the nurses station on b block jasmine jasmine yee with quick eyes and the knack that most of them had of looking into your head and deciding what condition you were in while they were saying yes but itll rain before the afternoon smiling having to be observant because they might be asked later to report precisely how this patient appeared to them had he shown any signs of depression so forth pepperidge would worry if he phoned here for me during the next hour and they told him i couldnt be located but jasmine would at least assure him that id been in b block at and had looked perfectly normal the doors werent locked during daylight hours only at curfew and i used the one at the end of the corridor near the kitchens and walked into the street and blew the safehouse from under me british high commission a twentyminute run and at the halfway point i went through the whole thing again and tested the logic the street had been absolutely clear when id left the clinic and i could still ask the driver to turn back and put me down where wed started it was like paying out a lifeline and it was getting the nerves on edge because i knew that when we reached the high commission the line would break but that was all it was nerves and i sat watching the street noting the people at the cab pulled in to the kerb and i got out and paid the man through the window and turned and crossed the pavement and walked into the building one of them yes at least one of them on the other side of the street and i could almost hear the whip of the lifeline as it broke at the main desk i didnt do more than ask if they had an airline timetable the girl pulled one out of a cubbyhole and gave it to me a new girl one i hadnt seen before fair head bent over her nailvarnish while i flipped through the pages of the timetable a couple of minutes were enough and gave it back to her counted five of them while i waited for the taxi three women in european clothes two men one of them blond but not gunther hed been outside the red orchid i dont like this like dropping into icecold water isnt it i know what you mean but you can shut up all the same this is a hell of a faking risk not really no not in daylight but what about tonight jesus christ youre bloody well shut up there was of course the very reasonable thought that it was her influence that was making me do this pushing me to the brink voodoo can turn a mans head but it was impossible to get any perspective yes it could be her influence and yes there was a calculated chance that tonight i could push the mission into its final phase and reach the objective and destroy it but there was this to be said i knew how to do what i hoped to do there wasnt going to be any luck thrown in except conceivably the slip of a foot on damp ground or an instants loss of balance ignore the effects of luck and concentrate on the demand for excellence in application another taxi had stopped at the corner as we pulled in and a blue toyota cruised past and then accelerated i went into the clinic by the side door and got to my room without seeing anyone i knew two chinese in white coats a woman walking with one hand sliding along the wall a man talking to her carrying her bag i phoned the number pepperidge had given me but it was someone else who answered and i asked him for the parole and got it and responded and said tell him that im not absolutely sure but there might be some surveillance on this place tell him to keep away you want any action a thin voice rather quiet unsurprisable no ill keep you posted over and out then the waiting began i killed him she said i see theyd been wrong it hadnt rained this afternoon the lawn where we sat had lost the glow wed seen last night under the lamps dr israel and i if the rain kept off the grass would be almost dry tonight and not slippery underfoot i got off she said thelma someone i hadnt caught her last name but ive got to undergo treatment for six months not a big woman and not aggressive just withdrawn until id shown i was ready to listen in her thirties why i asked her i told you because i killed him the lawn was a hundred and twenty feet square id paced it there was a birdbath in the centre cast out of concrete and leaning slightly the shallow basin on top of the pedestal didnt move if you tried to lift it i suppose it was bolted down but you told me hed been beating you up for seven years thats right drunk every night and violent yes no particular tone in her voice it was as if she were talking about a play shed seen not a good one so you shot him thats right she needs to talk about it one of the indian nurses had said if you dont mind listening well for gods sake thelma whats wrong with that they call it pathological loss of control it was just gone five oclock it would be dark in two hours and the night would come down suddenly i missed the english twilights out here pathological bullshit i said if youll excuse my french you kept control for seven years didnt you that wasnt enough she was watching me her eyes puffy her hair a mess not unattractive though just unkempt undone by life unwanted and do you take this woman not bloody likely she shot the last one dead didnt she youre doing me good she said and as her pasty face cleared there came a certain beauty not many men would agree with you thats their problem the last of the daylight was leaving the gardens and the lawn well not gardens quite a few bushes and flowering plants a glorious magnolia tree with blooms like waterlilies and as the light lost its brightness the shadows softened the shadows of the trees and the shrubs and the birdbath in the centre where were you pepperidge had asked hed phoned while i was at the british high commission this morning working out in the physical therapy room tell me about the surveillance im still not sure i thought i saw one of the hit team that was round the hotel touch of paranoia possibly but all the same id be rather careful his silence meant worry god knew what hed have said if id told him where id been let me know hed said if you see them again said i would hed taken a lot of care finding me the safehouse and couldnt really believe it had attracted ticks so soon i felt for him keep away i told him just in case i mean that it wasnt a safehouse any more because id blown it across the street but that was going to work itself out i didnt want pepperidge walking into a surveillance net the first day hed taken over the mission in the field if i ever left here with vital signs id need him again by the way i told him shodas in singapore sayako told you yes he hadnt sounded surprised so i said did the bug stop producing yes but it told us that much i think it might be on her private jet as lightly as he could dont worry about it i knew now that he hadnt been going to tell me she was here i liked that it was good handling of the ferret protecting him from unnecessary worry what are you doing here thelma asked me im paranoid the light grew less and sharp edges softened people had started filling the verandahs on their way to the cafeteria for the evening meal what form does it take she asked me i think someones stalking me but only when its dark had some pork pad kee mao but didnt eat the meat just the vegetables the protein id eaten midday was into the sinews by now and all i needed was something light with the chilli paste as a stimulant for the blood david thomas sat next to me in the cafeteria call me dave all right but dont you dare call me marty i cant stand that made him laugh a bit he was the man whod lost his wife and children shut himself in the garage with the engine running boy he said this stuffs red hot good for the circulation according to the pathologists report the contents of the stomach were corn bamboo shoots green beens onion and chilli pork pad kee mao oh balls who he said his name was singh a couple of the doctors had been talking in the hall earlier today when id gone through there ive never heard of him hes new here calcutta university they should have told us at admin coconut icecream how was your day he asked me dave cant complain what about yours okay he held his fork still theres a chap here whose wife jumped out of a window because theyd been rowing how about that you can make a start with that dave find someone worse off even than you and you can take another look thats what israel said terrific youre on your way then i went along to the games room and played some snooker or made an attempt hitting the balls all over the place regardless taking the tension down a degree there wasnt anything worth looking at on the box so i worked out again this time with the weights to tune up the red muscle id worked on the white muscle earlier with some speed punching at the bag watching the time of course watching the people the doctors in their white coats most of them english because the place was run by them but quite a few chinese and malaysian and one or two indians going to bed thelma we were in one of the corridors and it was a few minutes to nine curfew time on my way i said dont let it worry you its all in the mind thats right i went out through the swingdoor and crossed the verandah onto the lawn the scent of the frangipani blossom sweet on the air and sat on one of the wrought iron seats where thelma and i had been sitting earlier and now it was nine oclock and the main lights went off leaving only the pilot lamps burning and the lawn dark so that from here i couldnt even make out the birdbath silence there was no moon it hadnt risen yet above the east wing but sirius was bright its colours changing like a prism in the heatwaves over the city people went along the verandahs now and then a door swinging shut behind them their footsteps quiet rubber soles on the wood planking silhouettes passed across my line of sight becoming fleshed out as they neared a pilot lamp they couldnt see me here at the edge of the darkness wrong whos that white coat i got up not quickly but resting my right hand on the back of the iron seat it would make a good pivoting point or i could push back from it gaining speed jordan he came closer stethoscope clipboard one of the meds as distinct from one of the psychs clinic patois oh hello taking the air thats right he knew about me that i didnt have to be in my room at curfew wonderful scent isnt it he looked up at the trees he was half in silhouette against a lit window beyond and half illumined by the nearest pilot lamp he was all right name was hawkins i was just taking the opportunity of using him as a model trouble is the pollens giving a lot of people hay fever let me know if it bothers you weve got plenty of antihistamine he wandered off and i noted that his shoes made only the slightest sound on the grass peggy was working the evening shift peggy mitchell at reception i could see her through the window on the west side of the building and the less distinct figure of the security guard by the doors in fact security wasnt all that strict id been in the front lobby a couple of times when there was no one at the desk and the doors werent locked in the daytime and anyone could use the little door by the kitchens as id done myself i suppose it wasnt surprising all the patients here had come in on voluntary admission sirius had neared the roof of the psychiatric block in the east wing changing from blue to green to ruby as i watched listening with my head turned to the right so that sounds coming from the verandah in that direction would reach the right ear full on for analysis by the left hemisphere it had been a voice that was all a long way off or halfmuted by the walls the doors on that side had all been shut a minute ago and thered been nobody on the verandah and what i wanted the left brain to work out as fast as it could was the oddness of the voice it wouldnt be audible through the closed doors or the walls or windows id been aware of that since id come out here but it had been audible just now and no one had opened a door unless theyd done it very quietly for some reason tidal breathing the better to listen there was a sound from behind me distant from the verandah a shoe i thought catching on something anyway it was enough and i looked away from sirius and began walking tired of standing still needing a little exercise i walked towards the centre of the lawn and my shadow thrown by the lamp behind me soon faded out because here the dark began i believe analyse fast close was it close feet bare feet went on walking dark now intense walking not hurrying the nape creepingbang of a door unmistakeable jesus christ cant you relax you know what it was now went on walking lifting my feet to quieten them so that i could hear other things caroline are you out here shut the door again putting the whole thing together shed opened a door quietly not for any particular reason and the voice in the corridor had been audible until shed let the door bang shut it was the swingdoor then shed gone in again did that work make sense god it was dark here it was enveloping like a shroud and as i walkedwatch it bumped the right thigh the birdbath id thought it was further to the left went on walking because there was still a chance id been wrong and from behind me id now be silhouetted against that lamp over there the moths spiralling round it gold in the glow reached the iron seat on the far side and turned and looked back nothing but dark between the distant lamps my god the adrenalin i could have jumped clean over the roof strength of ten men so forth well thats the idea thats what the stuff is for have a seat take it easy the whole thing felt like a firework show my body i mean the nerves flaring and the blood on fire well no harm really we just have to be patient because this was the only way it was the only way for several good reasons and id given it a great deal of thought and i knew i was right you dont take major action unbriefed by your director in the field and blow your safehouse and put the mission in gross hazard unless you can justify it later assuming you survive there was of course an added factor not a reason but the necessary impetus that bitch had become too bloody impudent coming here to claim my head thats really very personal you know bitch steady lad dont take on so theres a job to do of course it might not work at all my little master plan make me look a bloody lemon especially in front of poor old pepperidge you mean you blew the safehouse just on the fucking offchance so forth every right to be pissed off about it yes but it might not come to that so lets take another little stroll shall we its such a lovely night in the course of the next hour i put in some more groundwork and chatted up peggy mitchell in reception standing at the desk under the bright lights whos come in tonight anyone interesting we never talk about the patients she said but not unkindly i couldnt talk to david or thelma because they were in their rooms but there were a couple of nightnurses snatching a quick cup in the cafeteria male nurses these some good muscle under their green cotton jackets sometimes one of the patients would go over the edge and try and do something and the male nurses were here for that i did the whole square walking steadily under the lamps along the verandahs checked my watch two or three times because you wouldnt come out here for a twohour stroll just for the exercise have to be waiting for someone perhaps a new patient due to check in jumpy now very on edge because of the adrenalin i could have tossed a caber right out of the field or outrun a train a taste in the mouth familiar the taste of cold steel all the glands working overtime triggered by the alarm that had hit the organism calm down theres a chance yet the night is young is that george no i said and he peered at me in the halfdark at the edge of the lawn one of the doctors moving off again some kind of panic hed come at a trot from the psychsection fumbling for something in his jacket i assumed a syringe rotten life when you come to think of it he made haste along the verandah and said something to a man coming the other way white coat again dark skin what had the first one told him anything i turned my back on him and started walking into the darkness making for the centre of the lawn listening to his footsteps along the verandah hearing them stop not exactly he hadnt stopped hed moved onto the grass and i held my head to the right lifting my feet and breathing tidally silence a pool of silence inside the four walls cutting us off from the city outside a pool of stillness cold enough to chill the nerves deep enough to drown in i thought i caught the movement of a shadow thrown by one of the lamps some way off to my right where the darkness bled away to a field of illumination by the verandah i wasnt sure i kept on walking slowly floating feet down through the pool of silence the ears straining the hairs lifted on the skin the organism brought to that pitch of alertness that will make the difference between life and death between dr hawkins shes up here i span and saw them under the lamps a nurse and the darkskinned doctor and now the other one coming back along the verandah with his white coat flapping shes all right doctor but i think you should come is she conscious yes shes sitting up dont worry then voices fading out and the slam of a door in the distance sweat running as i came off the high the organism lurching trying to find its balance again the onset of raging thirst i walked quite fast to the verandah my legs thrusting me forward the whole of the musculature avid for movement the nearest water was in the toilet in c block and i headed that way going through the swingdoor and down the passage men they normally left the lights on all night in the toilets but this one oh my god kishnar we didnt move we waited when id gone in and found it was dark i turned to switch on the light and had my back to him and i heard a faint rustle of fabric as his arms came up and across my head and started down again past my face with his hands bunched and the wire between them and it was then that everything slowed down and as i brought my right arm rising in a jodan uchi uke it felt as if i were moving it through water through quiet water the forearm bone meeting the wire and my fist snapping back against the front of my skull as his twohanded force pressed it there and we began waiting the initial halfsecond of his attack was over and we needed time a few tenths of a second in which to make decisions he was pulling back on the piano wire very hard and if it had been brought across my throat it would have breached the skin and cut through the thyroid cartilage and the jugular vein and the carotid artery and he could have simply stepped back to avoid the blood and walked away as i suppose hed done so many times he succeed to kill always always sayako it was very quiet and a tap dripping in one of the handbasins made a kind of music bringing us solace it hadnt gone well for either of us id made it too obvious perhaps waiting for him out there on the darkened lawn he would have been confident yes arrogant even certain of the kill because hed never failed but mariko shoda had singled me out as a special assignment and a full hit team had been ordered in to prepare me for him to find and fix so that he could strike it would have told him that i wasnt just another agent untrained in closerange issues and so hed decided to let me go through my charade and wait for me to develop a thirst in the warm night air if i hadnt come in here he would have dogged me through the hours of darkness with the patience of the instinctive stalker who knows that time is not important given the certitude of the kill he moved and i reacted id made it obvious then and let him trap me but so far i had survived it hadnt gone well for him either on this count and it was possible that it was the first time hed ever swung the wire across the victims head and failed to bury it in the throat that would have dismayed him and changed his attitude a little his attitude towards himself his omnipotence the natural order of things wherein he was preeminent unsurpassed the solace of the musical tap was not misplaced he moved and i reacted and a grunt came out of him because what hed tried to do was drop the front of his knee into the back of mine and bring me down and it didnt work because id been expecting it id have tried the same thing if id been where he was the grunt came because id used his own force through his arms and the wire to let my head snap back against his face i couldnt tell how much damage id done the back of the heads insensitive id seen two iguanas once in bali their jaws locked together their size equal and for minutes on end theyd waited with the perfect stillness of the reptile and then one or the other had brought its sinews to the point of explosion and the tails had thrashed and the great heads swung and shaken from side to side until their force was for a while exhausted he wasnt a big man kishnar i hadnt expected it but he was strong and fast understandably he smelled of something of some kind of oil either it was on his hair or hed anointed himself in ritual before the act he was embarked on it was a little like almonds the faint smell on him it wasnt gunoil he wouldnt carry a gun the tap dripped and i was aware of the thirst that had brought me here i let another second or two go by and then i twisted and brought the edge of my shoe down his shin but he stepped back so i brought my heel upwards going for the groin but not connecting and now we were on the move and the waiting was over for a time used an elbow strike and found muscle and brought a hiss of pain from him and he slackened the wire and then dragged on it with a strength that bit through the flesh of my arm and into the bone and sent a flash of nervelight blinding me for an instant though it wasnt critical there was nothing to see in here the vague outlines and reflecting surfaces of the cubicles and basins and tiling and that was all the door had swung shut and the only light was filtering through a small window somewhere i felt the need for a better stance to preserve balance so i shifted my weight and my foot moved something on the floor small and light one of his shoes i suppose he would have taken them off before id come in here because ritual would have demanded it and the need for silence i found my balance again but he tensed and swung his body in a feint move and then swung the other way and i had to shift my stance again and we were both in motion suddenly spinning together in a dance of death faster now the momentum taking us to the point where balance became critical both his hands were still on the ends of the wire and he darent let it go my right arm was useless still thrust between the wire and my throat and with the ulnar nerve paralysed it was keeping death away but couldnt move to make a strike so as we went on spinning i used my left elbow again in a series of fast jabs connecting and then losing him as he lurched away we were relying on our feet to give us some kind of decision but the danse macabre went on and we span together until i tried the first throw and timed it right and he lurched and pitched sideways and took me with him a shoulder smashing against something and my right foot finding an instants purchase and letting me thrust hard away from him but the wire was there and it didnt slacken and what happened was that his body was flung out feetfirst with my trapped forearm as the pivot and a screaming began and glass smashed the mirror the fragments cascading to the floor as we lay there still locked by the wire fatigue setting in now and i didnt like the noise didnt know what it was because conscious thought had blanked out and there was a dangerous degree of disorientation clouding the mind as the screaming went on and the dragons breath blew hot against my face imagination bringing me a flash from a fable we lay on the floor among the shards of mirror glass like drunks or lovers each of us just this side of death and each knowing it while the screaming stopped handdrier yes id hit something with my shoulder as wed gone pitching down i didnt know what he was thinking our heads were close together but that was all there was no transference no communication the infinitely complex process of conscious thought was going on inside the skull brilliant with the flash of synaptic interchange presenting images projections options and alternatives while far distant in the organism was the grosser interplay of emotions the urge to survive overriding the contemplation of extinction who are you kishnar where were you born how old are you my brother under the skin being of this earthly clime and of similar mould with a head and a face and hands and feet and how was it through the course of our complicated lives we came finally to lie here on the floor of a lavatory whose doorway would allow only one of us exit i suppose he didnt want to let go of the wire because it was the weapon he was used to that was a weakness in him its the same thing when a man carries a gun he begins to rely on it and feels naked without it lost vulnerable its why i prefer my hands you cant forget them or leave them somewhere and at close quarters they can be just as deadly if this man kishnar let go of the wire hed have both hands free and that would give him a critical advantage because i could use only one the nerve in the right arm was paralysed and i couldnt feel my fingers on that side the fist was bunched against my forehead and that was all i knew but he wouldnt let go i wasnt going to persuade him the fatigue was setting in because we couldnt take this appalling tension off there was no respite we werent like boxers who could punch and relax punch and relax we were locked together like those two iguanas in a monumental exercise in isometrics the muscles beginning to tremble now and the sweat trickling while the left brain went through a thousand potential moves and the right brain drifted into the imagery of potential death the passing over of one of these two souls to a new dimension and the overall sense of loss of having failed the challenge and been found wanting voices oh christ i wasnt ready for that hed jerked the wire upwards and down again in the hope of my arm falling away and leaving the throat exposed but it didnt work and i felt an explosion of rage and used my free hand driving an eyegouge against his face again and again and he jerked his head away every time no go so i drove a halffist against him lower targeting the neck the carotid artery but he twisted clear and light flashed under my eyelids the first warning of exhaustion listen something will have to be done and soon because if he brings his cultural mysticism into play shifting into the zone where fatigue is controlled and overcome for as long as life demands i shant have an answer well yes but not as arcane as his not as practised and not enough to tip the balance voices outside one of them saying they thought theyd heard glass breaking somewhere he moved again and i reacted and the tails thrashed and the heads swung shaking the scales flashing in the hot sun as i sat watching from the rock my interest caught because it was a contest to the death and if they watch it you re on the edge of hallucinating watch it for christs sake dehydration taking its toll a progressive lack of electrolytes id been thirsty before id even got here and now it was fire in the mouth they were outside now talking about the glass breaking might come in here but what could they do throw water over us hed kill ten men kishnar if they got in his way we were lying on our sides and my free hand moved over the shards of mirror glass feeling them for size for sharpness as careful as the hand of a jeweller assessing the angularity of a diamonds facets for there were gems here more priceless offering more than profit or loss in the marketplace or the envy of a duchess at the opera feeling them tenderly the fingertips appraising while under the eyelids the light flashed to the pulsing of my blood his knee came up and i blocked it with my thigh and the pain burst swelled and diminished to numbness he was very strong welltrained not your thug from the dusty streets with throats to cut for a penny i want his head do you understand bitch i used my own knee and insisted presenting strike after strike and going beyond the matter of physical force and adding the strength of zen and two or three times his breath was caught in his throat and i knew id given pain and perhaps with any luck had found a nerve the femoral or the rectus femoris inducing paralysis but the effort had been appalling because of the tension already there in the muscles and i brought it down dangerously to the point where i could recover a small measure of the strength id need when the final effort had to be made a halfsecond or a minute from now no later than a minute because fatigue moves into a steepening curve towards the point of total exhaustion the voices had gone away there was just the music of the dripping tap each drop worth a diamond in my mouth but each one wasted i listened for sounds from him from kishnar for a loss of controlled breathing for a slackening of the muscles however slight that would tell me that if i could exert and endure this amount of tension i might yet prevail but there was no sign from him that he was weakening i would have said at this stage that his game plan was simply to wear me out to tire me to the point where i could no longer parry a blow from the knee where pain so ferocious could be induced that the whole organism would be paralysed if only for a second giving him time to lift the wire and smash my arm aside and come in again to the throat i think that was his game plan and the decision was close now a longing for water for peace for the sinews to grow slack and lie quiet a longing for cessation for a conclusion one way or another even for death and a rose for moira then he brought his knee up and smashed it into the thighbone and the light burst in the dark and i twisted to avoid a second strike but he connected again and the breath blocked in my throat and something drove through my spirit like a cold wind and that frightened me because i wasnt ready yet to go but he struck again and i twisted again but this was as far as i could move struck again and i rolled sliding my leg downwards and trying to find his neck in the halflight his throat but i was losing strength and he sensed it and came in for the kill hurling away the wire and rearing for an instant and then plunging with both hands for my neck as i turned just enough to do the only thing i could do while everything slowed down again and i saw my left hand moving an inch two inches until the shard of mirror glass was correctly placed so that as he came down against me it went into his throat and for a moment it seemed that nothing was happening until his hands began closing on my neck strong hands reaching confidently for my death and they would have found it but for the sliver of glass it had pierced his windpipe and begun to weaken him as he sucked in air once twice before he began sucking on blood his hands leaving me and reaching up to try to do something but there is nothing to be done when the breath of life itself is compromised and i lay waiting just this side of consciousness as his blood began trickling onto me onto my face its hot touch bringing me back to full awareness and reminding me that it was now honoured the unspoken pact between us that one or the other should come to see his life vouchsafed or vanquished so be it let it now abide i twisted from under him and lurched to the line of handbasins and span a tap wrenching at it until it gushed then bowed my head and drank like a beast at a waterhole pink panties a lot of noise keep them away not loud noise but a lot voices feet shuffling the ring of metal but i have to know keep everyone else away for your own sake sounded like pepperidge theyd put the lights on too bright halfblinding me i was lying on my back all right someone said you can dress it my hand was burning she was a chinese the nurse her eyes intent just take my word for it i know what im doing and i know whats best for you for the clinic believe me pepperidge yes someone had come in while i was still at the waterhole and id told him to phone this number nothing is the matter just go and phone him now and tell him to come here my name is jordan for christs sake dont just stand there go and phone dont move please the nurse said her young face was puckered queasy i turned my head remembering and saw him lying there kishnar my brother in blood in blood indeed it was everywhere but weve got to call the police dont you understand theres been call them by all means then and youll see the whole story spread all over the front page of the times in the morning or dont call the police and i can guarantee you a complete coverup your choice i could see the face of the clinics chief of administation culver met him when i signed in looking a bit upset understandably they were used to the odd suicide here but this was different if you could convince me of your authority look go and ring the british high commissioner hell give you the score but meanwhile dont let anyone into this area head ached a bit id hit it on something when wed been jigging around whats this someone said let me have it pepperidge sharply the piano wire covered at each end with rubber tubing he coiled it and put it into his pocket is painful what is hand painful the nurse no pain anywhere no youre very pretty oh surprise her mouth rounded then a smile that shone right into my soul itd been a nervy twentyfour hours from the time last night when id known what i would have to do then there was all this mess in here most unpleasant you all right pepperidge stooping suddenly over me yes wont be long now theres an ambulance on its way i dont need one i can yes you do he straightened up again keep that door shut throbbing going on there was some feeling coming back into the right forearm where hed held the wire the left thigh felt twice the size because hed driven his knee into it just before wed got it over with left hand sliced somewhat from gripping the shard of glass the medic had put some stitches in there was a residue of shock in the system but i could probably walk all right and pepperidge knew that the ambulance was for security the hit team knew that kishnar had come into the clinic for me and theyd expect me to go out on a stretcher and that was what pepperidge had arranged he didnt want the team to take up station we needed a new safehouse and we had to reach there clean someone knocking pepperidge opened the door an inch and looked through the gap and then pulled it wide open all right this man here on the way to the street i had a sheet over me face as well lights glowed through it coming and going hot under there old boy but it wont be long you all right said yes in the ambulance he pulled the sheet away hunched alongside on the tipup seat there wasnt anyone else in here under the dim pilot light he looked strained his yellow eyes flickering sometimes thirsty yes he gave me a plastic cup of chilled water i couldnt stand the waiting i said when id finished it the what the waiting he thought about it oh for kishnar yes it was a question of time before he found me so i thought the best thing to do was to get it over was that your only reason no i thought itd get shoda to the edge hit her again on her weak point yes youre right of course it could bring us the whole mission this was major you didnt only get kishnar out of the way as a constant threat but you actually turned him to good use as a tool as a weapon could be the turning point i started to pull my shoulders higher against the pillows but he stopped me relax youre going to need your strength later he didnt say why and i didnt think to ask the thing is i told him i had to bring him into the clinic i know of course he knew if id gone into the streets at night and waited for kishnar and taken him on and killed him the hit team would have closed in at once finis i owe you an apology i told him for what blowing the safehouse keeping you in the dark ah he looked away and i couldnt see his eyes their expression then he swung his head back and put his hand on my shoulder dont worry old boy i knew you were going to do exactly that bit fancy he said im afraid we were in the main room a big one victorian decor faded red plush and gilt candlesticks tapestries a couple of dozen small round ironwork tables and chairs bit of a stage or a dancefloor the light coming from roseshaded lamps a smell of stale scent this i said dont worry old boy everythings taken care of why dont we sit down for a bit what is it a nightclub it was the owner couldnt afford to do it up to conform with the new fire laws put a sprinkler system in and so on so its temporarily closed a faint smile were renting it now how dyou feel bit depressed i dropped onto a red velvet couch kishnar yes he nodded clasping his thin hands together looking down post mortem animal triste est i didnt think it was funny i know the bastard had been after my blood and i know his orders were to sever my head and take it to shoda do you know we found an empty cardboard box in that toilet did i tell you with a plastic bag inside and i know he wouldnt have given it another thought id have been just another job done another stiff shoved under the rug but all the same id killed a man and it always slowed me up made me wonder what kind of life id got into when did you fix this up i asked pepperidge this place i didnt answer he knew i meant this place he was giving himself time hed been a bit odd since the lav thing looking down sometimes looking away clasping his hands for something to focus on it wasnt because of what id done to kishnar i knew that he was too seasoned hed worked in the field for years i fixed this place up he said carefully at the same time as i fixed the other place up the clinic when wed been in the ambulance hed said hed known i was going to blow the safehouse i knew you were going to do exactly that and itd shaken me but when i asked him how hed known hed just said we could talk about it later i think if id been feeling less switchedoff about kishnar id have caught the drift dyou want to brief me i asked him because hed also told me to relax id need my strength no he swung his head to look at me his eyes critical youre probably ready for a bit of shuteye arent you no i didnt know what time it was my watch had been sprung off my wrist in the toilet and i hadnt missed it until wed come in here but in any case i wouldnt sleep even if i lay down somewhere the nerves werent off their high yet theyd been tightening all the time since last night when id know what i was going to do and it had been a long day waiting going to stay up for a bit pepperidge said still watching me girls have all gone im afraid but we could talk a bit i suppose girls oh nightclub stale scent so forth then he put his hand on my arm and said look old boy youre not going to like me for this but dont take it too hard its just business after all gave me a rather strained smile and got off the couch and walked between the tables to the doors on the other side of the room and went out and spoke to someone i could hear their voices i think i heard someone say ill get him or it sounded like that and through the doorway i saw pepperidge give a nod and then he started back not hurrying hands dug into his pockets and his head down not looking at me he was about halfway across the room when another man came through the doors on the far side and for a moment i didnt recognise him and then i saw it was loman he came on steadily picking his way between the tables short dapper his arms held behind him passing pepperidge whod now halted letting him go by id stopped linear thinking by this time the left brain was under a kind of random bombardment as data came in to give me the whole picture adding up the bits and pieces and making them fit some of them from as long ago and far away as the brass lamp in london with pepperidge sitting there hunched over his drink with that bloody worm at the bottom ii surprises you of course that anyone should offer this shipwrecked fucking sailor a mission i see that i quite understand sitting with his redrimmed eyes and his thinning hair and his rueful halfsmile and later meanwhile i shall find someone to take this thing over because its too good to miss and im buggered if ill give it to the bureau loman was coming closer looking down watching for the frayed bits in the carpet that might trip him loman long ago and far away in london we feel we owe you an apology quiller we er deeply regret the circumstances that obviously prompted you to hand in your resignation and very much hope you ii reconsider loman walking towards me mincing you could call it wearing as a concession to the heat and humidity a light alpaca suit but with the same black onyx cufflinks and the same regimental tie grenadier guards what a fucking pain in the arse he must have been to the poor bloody troops the rage rising inside me starting in the gut and reaching the throat blocking it because hed conned me this prissy little shit hed entrapped me into a mission for the bureau for the bureau and now hed come out here to lord it over me bloody london for you they think theyre jesus christ got up i got up as he stopped and stood in front of me got up but not out of respect of him for him but because i wanted to hit him and i couldnt do it sitting down very quiet in here very quiet it was the plush all over the place the red velvet curtains the carpeting no echoes everything was quiet quiller what else could he say i mean he couldnt say how are you or its good to see you again or why dont we shake hands on it so forth could he i didnt answer same thing applies you see it would have been pleasant to tell him that if he went on standing there just five more seconds his face was going to look like strawberry jelly or of course i could just tell him to fuck off but hed think that was common probably right but oh my god i wouldve given so much to have left him spread all over the floor and walked away steady lad steady steady yes better get a grip this is going too far and surprising how ready i was so soon after killing a man to kill another steady he made you look a bit of a lemon thats all cant take a joke pepperidge standing there i looked at pepperidge he was staring at me with his eyes hollow haunted and it made a difference suddenly gave me comfort because hed been a spook in the field and he knew what it was like when the bureau did it on your doorstep and he felt for me as he watched me being crucified it helped because until now i hadnt been feeling terribly fond of him either did they fire you to pepperidge not loman i didnt even look at loman no bastards fired me hunched over his drink in the brass lamp im like you old boy sometimes i wont obey orders that whole thing was a setup he didnt look away stood his ground yes and i dont regret it you know that his thin hair king untidily across his scalp his moustache at a lopsided angle sloppily trimmed his hand shaking as hed picked up his drink bloody good actor thanks a wintry smile i used to be in rep i took a deep breath and the last wave of the rage eased away but dont think i was precisely ecstatic a setup to myself more or less it was a mission he said quietly another faint smile ive know easier poor bastard he couldnt have cared much for it hed been as bad as loman really but i didnt hate him for it let me tell you something about loman if you ever meet him youll hate his guts on sight i thought we might have had our meeting tomorrow his small calculating eyes on my face like a couple of snails youve had a fatiguing day but pepperidge told me you werent ready for sleep civil of him hes like that he pretends hes human we dont need a meeting the answers no he tried to look puzzled the answer im not going on with the mission not for the bureau i felt pepperidge watching me id do it for him go on to the objective and bring shoda down but not for those bastards in london but what was i saying he was bureau himself thought flash and i looked at him her too mccorkadale he nodded slowly that was why shed been so useful so efficient behind the act shed put on ive never been so near so much drama so forth and chen johnny chen sayako no anyone else no he turned away and called out you there flood a man came through the doors smartly coming between the tables looking from loman to pepperidge to me quiller this is george flood our main contact out here medium height good suit muscle under it his eyes blanked off professional slight nod of his head sir i nodded back hes manning our station pepperidge said i didnt answer it wasnt my concern i was out of it now the man took a step back looking at no one chilly reception yes but i couldnt help that the station is manned on a twentyfour loman started in got an echo even in here loman gave a sigh hamming it pepperidge looked at flood go and give it another try yes sir he left us clearing his throat to fill the silence embarrassed i suppose and i quite agree i can be terribly common you know when the mood hits me but listen id spent the whole bloody day holed up in a funny farm waiting for a top hit man to come for my head and thered been two false alarms on the lawn out there and then id had to fight for my life in a lavatory and worst of all id finally had to take his away from him and now this bastard i think you know who i mean was trying to con me into going on with the mission and i was fed up to the back teeth dont you understand lets just sit down for a minute shall we loman so i sat down dropped actually onto the couch rather fatigued yes just as mr loman had suggested so courteously just now i heard a breath come out of pepperidge relief i dare say he wanted this mission to go on because hed been right in at the beginning and hed still be my director in the field and earn himself a nice bit of credit if we got the job done he sat down on the other end of the couch and caught sight of something pink stuck in the cushions and pulled it out pair of lace panties glancing up at us and shoving them in his pocket that kind of club an awkward laugh loman sitting there in the velvet wingback chair face like a po he probably didnt even know what the bloody things were can you imagine loman with a woman you must be out of your mind he started talking but i didnt take much of it in because nothing he could say was going to change my mind it was just nice sitting down again that was all various bits of the anatomy still throbbing the hand quite painfully i assumed they knew what they were doing at the clinic when theyd put the stitches in no risk of infection wed been in the lav at the time after all and i want you to know in any case lomans voice floated in and out of my consciousness that this place is under day and night observation by undercover officers of the singapore police with orders to arrest any loiterers on sight so this isnt a safehouse its a fortress quite impressive i would have been quite impressed if in fact id needed a safehouse or even a fortress for that matter secondly if you have any misgivings about the death of manif kishnar there will be no repercussions he was speaking with a lot of care a lot of articulation wanting me to understand every word but the fact was i wasnt interested it was just pleasant sitting down instead of standing up and the idea now occurred to me that it would be even more pleasant to lie down in a nice soft bed and you will appreciate that the government of singapore is every bit as desirous of continuing peace in asia as every other power in this loman he stopped i got up and found some balance and stood looking down at him and the fact that i was rather tired now didnt diminish the pleasure i was going to get in the next few seconds because in the next few seconds i was going to blow this little bastard right out of his overweening bloody complacency i made an attempt to mimic his studied articulation but whether or not it came off i didnt know and didnt much care i dont want to waste your time so you should know that i havent the slightest interest in anything you have to tell me he sat with his eyes turned upwards in a blank stare i do not intend going on with the shoda mission and nothing you can say will change my mind i repeat nothing he went on staring and i went on standing there pepperidge hadnt moved then loman did he gave one of his longsuffering sighs got his briefcase from the end of the couch stood up and without a glance at either of us walked away between the tables and through the doors and as i watched him i had to fight down a wave of disgust because everything id done since id come out here to singapore had gone for nothing was down the drain including six lives lost one of them ours gone for nothing end of mission i dont know how long i stood there wishing loman would walk out of here under a bus wishing pepperidge a man id come to like come to respect hadnt conned me into an abortive enterprise wishing i could go and lie down somewhere and let the throbbing in the blood slow to the delta rhythm of sleep still cant get her to answer sir man standing there flood shes not at the high commission no they havent seen her something trying to get through to me but possibly unimportant ignore keep on trying her flat pepperidge will do sir got my attention now you talking about katie he looked at me pepperidge face was bleak yes whats up shes missing the deal how much does she know not a great deal he didnt like the way id fetched him back so shes expendable loman hedged shes not indispensable so if you cant find her whatre you going to do throw her to the dogs flood had got us some black coffee and i was back on the cutting edge it was loman who looked as if he could use some sleep now it was gone one oclock and i suppose he was still under jet lag i shall be instructed he said from london london i thought about that who in london mr croder oh really chief of control pepperidge eased himself back onto the couch looking beaten the last twentyfour hours had been a strain for him too knowing hed have to blow his own cover with me and confront me with loman croder started this i asked loman he initiated the whole thing it was important to know at the bureau croder ranked about equal to the holy ghost yes loman was still standing briefcase hanging from his right hand polished shoes neatly together but i rather believe you said you werent interested in anything i had to tell you hed had to get that bit over and id been waiting for it and hed put it exactly the way id known he would i rather believe oh my god i just ignored it of course when was she last seen she left her office pepperidge said soon after ten this morning yesterday morning ive been trying to contact her ever since then because mr loman wants her report what report just routine fair enough the london end was out here suddenly and hed want to debrief everyone in the field as a matter of course quiller he said in a moment since you are now prepared to listen to me i have a question for you well its obvious to you that what concerns us is that mccorkadale might have been seized by the shoda organisation to be held as a hostage in a potential exchange for you and since you know a very very great deal more than she does and since you are the sole obstacle standing in the way of the shoda organisations projected coup in southeast asia my question is this if the opposition contacts us and offers to release mccorkadale in exchange for you what would be your decision he was standing with his head lowered looking upwards at me in an attitude of intense concentration i was aware of pepperidge at the edge of my vision equally intent a faint singing noise began somewhere flood had left the coffee percolator plugged in on the marble walltable and its thermostat had just cut in again loman was still waiting id do it i said i heard pepperidge suck in his breath loman kept his cool you would surrender to the opposition id have no choice if i refused theyd begin torture and let me know and theyd finally kill her out of hand in any case she means that much to you not really ive only known her a few days but shes a woman he got impatient now dropped his briefcase onto the end of the couch and put his hands into the pockets of his jacket thumbs hooked over the edge but surely thats rather victorian no im way ahead of my time i took a step closer to him pet subject hed better keep off one day theyre going to be thought of as important to us he watched me for a bit longer and then sat down in the winged chair arms across his knees hands hanging rabid romanticism i think he said it was under his breath louder looking up and what would you imagine shoda would do to you once you were in her hands have my head having done which shed then be free to proceed with her projected coup and set the whole of southeast asia on fire and you would place that as having less importance than the life of one woman right on pepperidge put out a cautioning hand old boy you and then saw my expression and drew it back shrugging your word on this loman said is final yes so if we receive a message from shoda through the british high commission or the thai embassy that mccorkadale is in their hands and an exchange is proposed we simply hand you over yes but it doesnt have to come to that with a bit of luck i turned to pepperidge she was seen just after ten yesterday morning where did she say she was going no one seems to know she leave by car one of the front desk clerks said she got into a cyclo whats your guess he spread a hand its on the cards that she got a message asking her to meet you and didnt question it she was worried about you because of kishnar shodas got a house here in the city in saiboo street did you know yes how did you know sayako told me thats where ill have to start i was halfway to the doors when i heard loman quiller sounded quite urgent sharp made me stop and turn ill offer you a deal a what a deal he was coming towards me between the tables i respect your abilities but how much chance would you say you had of finding mccorkadale and getting her out alive without playing straight into shodas hands and getting killed yourself not much i agree id say you have no chance at all but my own resources are infinitely greater with the bureau behind me this isnt a case for massive support it needs just one man to go in im to go in to shodas house no into the operation but thats got to be the focus we can have it surrounded by police we can what good would that do the first glimpse we get of mccorkadale the first hint we get that shes in there and against her will we can oh come on loman shodas untouchable on a political level you know that otherwise we could have destroyed her before now he took a step closer to me very intent not impatient any more very earnest if you try to save mccorkadale youll be putting it all on one throw quiller youve only got one life weve got hundreds you told me shes expendable in terms of policy shes not indispensable yes but for christs sake say what you mean youre going to throw her to the dogs very fast not if youll make a deal what deal youd need to listen for a moment tone rather thin he wasnt terribly fond of me either youve probably noticed mat and so far youve shown a certain reluctance may god give me patience with this little prick i havent got long so try and use short words he turned away and stood thinking for a couple of seconds id rather thrown him i suppose by agreeing to listen at all turned to me if you will continue the mission i will guarantee that the whole of our resources will be brought in immediately with the object of finding and bringing mccorkadale to safely with the cooperation of the british high commission the thai embassy the singapore police and every sleeper and agentinplace we can mobilise in this city and at once that is the deal i think i started to say something and changed my mind this thing was too big for emotions to play any part in the decisionmaking and id have to come down off the high or id smash things up no better than a small boy in a tantrum loman was a little shit and i couldnt stand him but he was also one of the elite controls in the very highest echelons of the bureau and hed run me before bangkok and tangier and hed been good in the field faultless and hed got me home alive so calm down yes just let him talk for a minute you would also have the benefit of the bureaus resources including the personal supervision of mr croder which carries an importance im sure you appreciate i didnt say anything let him sell it to me give me the whole pitch but if he said a wrong word hed lose me you would still be working officially for the thai government and would receive whatever remuneration youve agreed on with them we wouldnt question it he was watching me hard hoping to see a reaction but he was forgetting a good ferrets got bright black eyes that never show anything its part of the job i must tell you quiller that i came out here because we now have only three days left mariko shoda has set a deadline for the launching of her coup three days from now in view of this i hope that youll decide not to abort your mission at such a critical stage he waited i let him three days how the hell could he say that i wasnt going to ask not yet anything else he got an envelope from his pocket and pulled out a letter and unfolded it and dropped it onto the little iron table near him and turned away you may care to read that like someone throwing down the ace i picked it up very white very crisp embossed paper official seal of the prime minister downing street in view of the very critical issues now endangering peace and geopolitical stability in southeast asia nothing must be neglected that might redeem the situation it is therefore my earnest hope that the agent in question whose record is well known to me can be persuaded to proceed with his present mission and bring it to a successful conclusion you may if you wish convey my feelings to him when i looked up loman had turned back and was watching me with that deadpan complacency he can turn on when he thinks hes won i dropped the letter back onto the table sheer bloody blackmail im sorry it strikes you like that what made you think id need persuading to stay in i knew that the moment you saw me here youd start giving us trouble he came and picked up the letter and put it away so you refuse to stay with the mission no the nerves went slack suddenly relief i suppose id got somewhere to go now do you mean youll stay in under the bureaus direction yes ill do what i can thats all i can say i wasnt looking at him just heard the tone in his voice nothing triumphant just very quiet very cool now thats all we require hed done well hed put a fivestar ferret down the hole again without touching the sides and he hadnt expected to do it and it had left him impressed just find her i said that was the deal of course we shall start immediately he went across to the double giltpanelled doors and i heard him calling for flood talking about signals or something pepperidge came up padding quietly good show i know theyre bastards to work for but can you think of anyone better not really their genius he said is in the way they know their shadow executives he talked quietly and i could hear lomans voice out there on a phone caught the name croder youve been working under their direction pepperidge told me since the day you came out here you know that now but what i like he put a hand on my arm is the way they just gave you the clues and let you run its how you work best and theyre well aware of that take the kishnar situation i didnt want to think about the kishnar situation because the depression was still haunting the psyche but the left brain was catching onto something and i took a look at it and said jesus christ was that briefing faint smile yes old boy all right first class first class direction in the field and not from pepperidge not from loman but from the chief of control london croder because only he had the authority to push the executive for the mission right to the brink and leave him there unless you can think of a quicker way pepperidge at the clinic and id said i could and when hed left there last night hed known almost for certain that i was going to do the only thing that could be done at this phase of the mission because whatever new direction they found for me i wouldnt be able to take it until kishnar was off my back and out of the way it had been the first action conceivable and theyd known id see that and theyd left me there at the brink to make up my mind and that was why pepperidge had set up a new safehouse this place and had it ready for me and got loman here waiting to put the whole thing on the line first class i said pepperidge gave a brief nod i rather hoped youd say something like that because it was something else theyd done but i didnt want to think about that look i said i need some sleep now is there any kind of bed in this place ill show you he shepherded me through the rooms solicitous avuncular which was what a good local director ought to be hit a shoulder on a doorway going through not him i mean i did hand on my arm been a busy day he said theres a registered nurse here by the way if you need any attention she pretty fell on the bed and slept no but you should leave that to us damn him she went on soaking the blood away id simply asked him if there were any news of katie how are you feeling old boy pepperidge on the couch looking taut confident hed got a ferret to run and felt ready operational im so glad understandable loman was going to handle the main briefing in very close liaison with croder in london but when the final action phase began itd be pepperidge whod have to judge whether i was fit enough to go in i was id slept well nearly seven hours woke once to find kishnar bending over me shadow on the wall that was all then it was morning and flood brought me some coffee life beginning again id come close to losing it i want to assure you loman said that therell be no repercussions regarding what occurred last night briefly neither the uk nor singapore want to see the stability of southeast asia compromised and theyre more than willing to protect the clinic from bad publicity and order the police to hold off the media never even caught a whiff the rest of the dressing came away and she dropped it into the bowl same nurse as last night and obviously bureau or she wouldnt be here ive arranged to have the body of manif kishnar delivered in a plain coffin to the house in saiboo street i deemed this not only courteous since he was in effect an adversary defeated in the field but also a gesture of the greatest possible provocation to shoda personally since she apparently came here to claim your head not his yes shed get the point bitch he could have killed me hurt what sting no bloody iodine felt like razor blades she began on the dressing you should also know loman said that early yesterday morning shoda had the radio station in laos divebombed i had to give it a beat is he dead yes cho os sempai his head lowered over the chipped grimed shelf of the radio console a tear falling from his riven cheek to lie there glistening he is my father sayako her soft hesitant voice over the phone at the clinic i let out a breath hurt now no yes hurt now in a moment i thought general cho wasnt a threat to shoda any more she didnt think so until you went to see him she heard about that how from the grapevine in the village there you got this from johnny chen yes if she knew i was there why didnt she put a hit on me she tried but it was too late youd flown out id flown out leaving cho with his last few hours to live first veneker now cho sometimes i hate this trade the important thing loman said is that this is yet another indication of the effect you have on shoda the increasing influence youre developing over her he stopped pacing and looked down at me hands tucked behind him his eyes intent let me tell you something quiller you frighten her i thought about that arent you putting it a bit strong we dont think so a glance towards the couch pepperidge has given me a very clear picture of the relationship between you and shoda which is the fundamental axis of the mission you understand that and i believe it to be absolutely true youve got her frightened pepperidge had put it in a different way debriefing me at the clinic i think weve found her achilles heel and its you loman began pacing again motes of dust rising from the plumred chinese carpet as his polished shoes turned in a beam of morning light let me offer you a picture of our opponent she wields behind the scenes in southeast asia where much of the economy and political infrastructure is centred on the drug trade a great deal of power she is also a psychotic because of her childhood experiences she is on the one hand consumed by hatred of men to the point of pathological obsession and on the other hand fearful of them to the same degree this knifeedge aspect of her personality engenders a strong element of superstition far beyond her orthodox buddhist faith he stopped once and looked down at me and if this sounds like a psychiatric diatribe it is i am giving you a distillation of the expert opinions of three london psychiatrists of the highest reputation whom mr croder consulted after wed received a composite picture of mariko shodas behavioural record over the past five years done their homework dr israel had said at the clinic one can be obsessed about so many things but the real obsessions are focused on abstracts hate revenge life death sex sickness health so our opponent loman said on the move again is a classic type in world history a powerful dangerous megalomaniac embarked on a sacred crusade think of her as an idi amin a gaddafi loman stopped again standing close his feet neatly together that is the situation then in terms of your personal mission and its personal target mariko shoda he didnt glance across at pepperidge but i caught a feeling he was doing that pepperidge was looking carefully at nothing at all since you elected to undertake this mission otherwise than under the aegis of the bureau i was unable to inform you of the various aspects involved you should now be told that mr croder has a second unit in the field under the local direction of one of our most talented people he looked up at me and i felt he was expecting a question i already had a lot so i gave him one what field not this one of course this is yours what director ferris oh you bastard we could offer you rather good ones hed said in london meaning terms your sole discretion for instance as to backups shield signals liaison contacts and so on and hed have asked me to choose my director in the field and you know the man id have chosen dont you right ferris and id have got him so wheres their field nothing in my eyes nothing in my voice to give him joy its very flexible he turned away and began walking like abloody windup toy but i was listening i was listening very hard this was major briefing a consignment of one hundred slingshot missiles complete with warheads has gone adrift somewhere in the near east our second unit is at present trying to locate it seize it and escort it to thailand its intended destination i watched him a hundred a hundred slingshots enough to control the whole of the air traffic across indochina military and otherwise but christ i said what dyou mean by gone adrift tilted his head a euphemism we believe that the shoda organisation has in fact diverted the consignment to a secret destination as far as we can find out its due to reach the shoda organisations forces at some time tomorrow hence the deadline of three days i mentioned to you is now reduced to twelve hours perhaps less the significance of this is of course obvious to you im sure i dont need to emphasise mr jordan the devastation this weapon could cause in the wrong hands prince kityakara when wed seen the slingshot in action it means that any armed revolution could proceed with its enterprise in the certainty that it was completely safe from the air it means that if the shoda organisation acquired this weapon it could set indochina aflame within a week and that of course is its intention we await hourly loman said news from our second unit that the consignment has been found and seized he stopped pacing and stood directly in front of me so you see that your own mission is perhaps even more vital than you might have believed whether or not we can keep the slingshot out of her hands shoda must be destroyed with the missile she can devastate southeast asia but without it she will continue to present a dangerous element in the area ready at all times to provoke havoc we have of course something like a trump card even if she acquires the slingshot consignment i am virtually certain she wont feel able to deploy it while you remain alive he turned away turned back there is therefore no element so crucial so pivotal or so potentially decisive as your personal threat to shoda and hers to you i am convinced in short that over and above the question of the slingshot consignment the outcome of both these missions can only be decided by a personal and conclusive confrontation between yourself and mariko shoda treble think she came in quietly soon after loman had finished his main briefing i didnt see her until she was quite near us because id had my back to the doors talking with pepperidge good morning loman turned pepperidge got off the couch she slung a leather bag from her shoulder it looked like a diplomatic pouch probably was the tapes she said and gave the bag to loman all of them yes sir would you care for some coffee please then she looked at me for the first time just a little swing of her head as if shed had to make an effort but the bluegrey eyes were quite steady flood had come in earlier with the message the glad tidings as pepperidge had called it going on with the charade for the sake of appearances because no one could now admit the truth she phoned her office hed said at the high commission her aunt was taken ill yesterday morning appendicitis thats why she rushed off without telling anyone where she was going loman hadnt been watching him as hed told us hed turned away to do a little pacing she stayed at the hospital till her aunt was out of danger rueful smile all that trala for nothing not to embarrass him id said i was relieved facing me now she said very quietly hello hows your aunt shell be all right with a swing of her fair hair i hope you werent worried about me no she looked down swallowing then im glad i knew there wasnt any need she looked up quickly then glanced across to where loman and pepperidge were sorting out the tapes then back to me oh puffing out a little laugh shrugging i think ive lost the score it doesnt matter the games over now ill go and plug in the thing you like it white dont you yes your hands all right everythings fine i went over to the percolator and plugged it in there were lines under her eyes and she looked as if she hadnt slept too well which probably meant that shed been briefed about my blowing the safehouse and why otherwise she might have gone along to the clinic and walked right into the surveillance team and i didnt want to think about that the thing started singing and i called out to flood asking him for another cup loman was slotting a tape into the stereo recorder katie sat down at one end of the couch slim in her khaki shirt and slacks the heavy gold chain at her throat it had been treblethink and loman and i had worked together like partners in a tennis double each leaving the ball for the other when that was the next move hed been certain id want to stay with the mission but couldnt do that now i knew the bureau had conned me into it after id resigned so he gave me a way of saving my face and told me that katie was missing it was a lie and i knew that and he knew i knew but i went through the motions of believing it and agreed to the deal and stayed with the mission treblethink and in case youve forgotten thats the trade were in weve boiled them down loman said now to the bare essence the shoda tapes i went over to him the recorder was on the floor and we sat around it while katie poured some more coffee these are all translations from the thai or cambodian except the one where shes speaking english presumably to someone whose only language it is if you want to put questions ill stop the recorder he pressed for play i want to stress that we are not mounting a series of isolated revolutionary actions designed to bring in the rabble with us these are planned as military actions and they will be launched simultaneously as soon as the consignment has been received evaluated deployed in the field and readied for use these transmissions loman said have been put onto a single tape theres no continuity they are separate recordings made at different times i will repeat that this agent must be located and dealt with before we can launch our operations it would be fatal if we ignored his influence and allowed him to infiltrate our intelligence and jeopardise our plans there can be no action in any theatre until he is removed i need hardly tell you loman that we for our part are using every endeavour to monitor and harass the various units now searching for you in point of fact by midnight last night london had called in sleepers and local contacts from hong kong saigon hanoi and bangkok and they are now working in the field liaising with mr croder personally through the british high commission here in singapore there is a great deal going on in your support quiller a great deal translated you should never have left the bureau look at the resources we have said nothing he pressed the button our entire action now depends on kishnar until i learn that he has accomplished his assignment there can be no furtherance of our project tomorrow i shall go to singapore and await this information the day before yesterday loman said and lifted the pause button the preparations i spoke of are now set up but our proposed action must await news of an unhampered environment we must not underestimate the britishthai intelligence operations mounted against us loman played three more tapes but they were mostly a distillation of the background political aspects of the revolutionary groups deployed throughout indochina some of them under shodas command this one loman said finally is where she is speaking either to an englishman or an american or at least to someone who doesnt have her various asian languages were trying to find out who he is i am told that pending the now imminent arrival of the consignment every tactical element is now in place but there is still no news from kishnar and i am now on my way to singapore if you need to reach me i shall be airborne at p m and you can use the radiophone it was the first time id heard her speaking in english it was clear and almost without an accent the sibilants were silky and attenuated as i remembered from hearing her voice in the radio station and it had the same energy but there was something in her tone that hadnt been there before it was a degree of tension of strain i had the sense that the world of mariko shoda wasnt any longer spinning the way she wanted it loman shut the thing off do you have any comments i got off the floor wanting movement i hadnt realised things were so close he didnt answer and suddenly i knew why things were close only if they could hit me between now and when the slingshot consignment arrived all right her operation cant start unless im out of the running so shes going to be throwing the whole thing at me now shes got no more time to try doing it by stealth trying to keep it discreet one man with a bit of wire if they see me theyll just shoot from anywhere right thats why weve asked the singapore police for their help through diplomatic channels thats why this place is under guard but for christs sake you cant just keep me cooped up in here so that shes got to put her operations permanently on ice she might easily lose patience and risk it and have a go regardless loman didnt answer and nothing from pepperidge theyd got things worked out and they wanted to know what my attitude was because i was the key factor and theyd have to plan according to what i was prepared to do this was routine direction in the field and that was all right but i couldnt see which way we could make a move or if there were any way at all have you got any more briefing for me i thought he had but was holding it back for some reason pepperidge was looking into the middledistance again and i noted it loman started walking around suddenly it was like a bloody zoo we all felt caged up in this place perhaps you should be informed he said in a moment that in support of your assumption that shoda will now do everything in her power to remove the british agent two charter plane loads of socalled tourists have arrived in singapore this morning one from cambodia and one from laos our contacts are reasonably certain that theyve been brought in to support the surveillance teams meant hit teams all right at least we know the score i felt katies eyes on me she was bureau and shed probably worked with shadow executives before and she knew what we were going to have to do to get out of the shutended situation we were in we were going to have to take one hell of a risk in the hope that itd come off and leave this little ferret still alive bloodied perhaps but still with its whiskers on and listen im putting it lightly as im sure youve noticed because at this particular moment id started feeling scared and it wasnt very long since the kishnar thing and my nerves were on a rollercoaster and there wouldnt be a chance of getting them off it until something conclusive was done something terminal finis one way or the other shoda or me it all came down to that and everyone knew it loman pepperidge katie and halfway round the world in london croder chief of control however nil desperandum so forth try a few more kneebends rough on the left thigh but we need to keep the adrenalin down how long will it be i asked loman before you hear that your second unit has found the slingshots and taken them over if they can in fact do that we shall be informed at once he seemed surprised not through london either through london or direct or both why im not absolutely sure he came and looked down at me i was at the bottom of a kneebend bouncing on the muscles but i think its very important sounded lame but the left brain had started working on something and this was one of the components its important i tried again that we should know as soon as possible if and when that consignment has been seized thats to say has been removed from any danger of shodas getting hold of it thats important i got up and moved around its also very important that if the slingshots are made safe and brought out of shodas reach she doesnt know about it until she and i are face to face i listened to the echo of what id just been saying and tested it out and found some flaws and tried patching them up and ran it through again sensing i was getting close to some kind of overkill action but not quite knowing what it was or how it would work when i stopped and looked around i saw they were all watching me not moving theres a time thing i told loman thats got to be thought about theres a narrow margin of time involved in a moment loman asked overcasually have you got anything potentially constructive in mind what the fuck does that mean quite a long silence yes i know what potentially means and i know what constructive means but id been way out in the right brain and words like those lose most of their meaning because theyre so bloody long that youve got to stop and think what theyre trying to say sorry not at all toujours la politesse and all that but you know i do wish that little snit would speak the queens bloody english when were all trying to think out how to destroy the objective lets start from this i said i cant make a hit silence again they needed more data im not a hired gun you know that the only time i killed anyone in cold blood it was because hed betrayed a woman and she was trapped and shot dead im not i found myself staring at loman wanting the little bastard to get the point im not a hit man for the bureau is that understood of course tone icy so what ive got to do is destroy the objective shoda without killing her the mission youre running is aimed at the destruction of the shoda organisation and im the executive in the field began walking around again and weve got our faces shoved right up against the endphase and we havent got a bloody clue as to how were going to bring this thing off in a minute pepperidge said very quietly i rather think you have old boy what i swung round possibly a very small one im just thinking aloud trying to get feedback i went across and poured some more coffee and put it down again without drinking any because we were in the extreme endphase of the mission and i was on a collision course with a woman whod got a small army out there waiting for me and i didnt want to be caught at the wrong end of a caffeine curve that sort of thing can kill you another thing and i was yes thinking aloud but that was good is that i cant confront shoda without getting her isolated somehow and i knew when i said it that it was a key word isolated though i didnt know why i dont mean separated from her bodyguards i couldnt hope for that i think i mean away from the public somewhere in case people get hurt its not going to be a teaparty long silence but this time useful potentially constructive so forth and something had got through i isolated pepperidge said he got off the couch and stood with his hands shoved into his pockets looking through the wall not in her house no id never get in there alive loman was staring into the middle distance too but he didnt say anything for a minute couldnt hit on anything then he turned and started walking again and said weve got the full cooperation of the singapore police but theres nothing they can do against shoda shes politically untouchable diplomatically she could bring almost any democratic government down in asia simply by hitting its economy or exposing any one of the halfdozen corrupt officials in high places he gave me a direct look we cant help you there i understand that in any case i couldnt see us going into the endphase with any kind of police action they couldnt touch shoda the government couldnt touch her it wasnt a question of an operation it was a question of infiltration very focused very specific just one man going in would anyone like some lunch katie loman stopped pacing as if hed hit a wall and stared at her as if he didnt understand the word perhaps she should have said luncheon good thinking pepperidge some kind of protein i said she passed close to me on her way out saying softly and a little zabaglione and left her scent on the air my god theres nothing like a womans presence to bring the tension down she doesnt even have to touch you look pepperidge said and didnt finish it because flood came through the doors just then and told loman there was a call from one of the contacts in cambodia and loman went out to take it and from that minute the final action of the endphase started running and we were pitched into it headlong mr croder where loman asked them we were in the smokingroom off the main salon reproduction antique brass telephone and plush armchairs and gilt ashtrays and a thin chinese nude on the wall with exaggerated nipples when loman looked very calm one of the things i dislike least about him is that when a missions in a slow phase hes like a fart in a collander and he can drive you stark raving mad but when it swings into momentum again he quietens down and starts running like a welloiled dynamo flood had told him the signal was from our second unit in cambodia what time tomorrow pepperidge was hitched on a bar stool his yellow eyes deceptively sleepy flood was standing under a lamp plaster cherub holding the shade aloft flood behaved like a subordinate and called me sir but that was just because he was a bit younger and he probably found the presence of a top control from london intimidating but i knew who he was now id asked pepperidge a bit earlier is this man flood my replacement pepperidge had looked away looked back again yes old boy but hell never get the job of course it didnt actually bother me in fact there was a certain comfort in the knowledge that if i got things wrong in the next few hours and bought the elysian fields thing at least id know theyd got someone standing by to take over wait a minute loman said and blocked the mouthpiece i and looked at pepperidge and me and said briefly theyve traced the consignment its on its way to prey veng by air wheres that pepperidge asked him across the mekong from phnom penh he looked at me now waiting half the component of the mission was in place and i was the second half and he wanted to know if i had any questions i did this was a breakthrough can they open the crates and switch the contents can they what permission to talk to them strictly formal right out of the book because he was a control and the final decisionmaking was going to be his or croders but id got the whole thing in my head now the endphase ready to run and the timing was so critical that wed have to work by the minute all the way down to zero and that was why i was being formal with loman because i didnt want to get his back up and put everything in hazard not now he hesitated then passed me the phone executive salutations my opposite number listen this is fully urgent can you switch the contents of those crates and let them go through on schedule short silence i hadnt made their endphase any easier you mean shove some pigiron in them or something yes whatever you can find we want them to arrive at their projected destination and eta as if theyd never been touched that possible another silence then like fucking things up dont you meant yes christ i said i wouldnt mind working with you again hed got us this end of the mission thats not mutual he said because youve gone and pissed on the chips but i suppose thats life his tone changed all right you want everything left intact shipping labels manifest routing the whole thing yes yes and once the crates are there our ends in the bag and were completed that right except for getting the slingshots to the thai army oh yes we shant be leaving those things around for the kids to play with in the park dont worry look can i have confirmation from your control hold on i turned to loman you heard what ive asked them to do and they say they can do it and ive worked out our endphase and itll give us the only chance weve got so are you prepared to give me full discretion over this he stood there staring at me with his hands behind him and his feet together and his head on the tilt and i watched him computerising the whole situation including what would happen to him in london if it turned out that hed let me screw up the mission and drive it into the ground pepperidge had taken a step closer and he was watching me too his eyes blanked off and his mouth a tight line because hed catch some of the flak if he let his executive talk his control into a lastditch spectacular fiasco then loman made a curt gesture and i gave him the phone and he said control i am placing the completion of your operation into the hands of the executive here gave me the phone back thank you sir more than id asked for more than i could have expected much more he was giving me immediate responsibility for the whole show i said into the phone whats the eta for that consignment in prey veng today where are you going to make the switch in phnom penh at the airport yes in a holding warehouse clandestine weve bought two customs people not a lot of risk then not a lot id say weve got you know around ninety per cent in our favour i whipped through the main essentials to see if i were missing anything didnt think i was how long is it going to take them to unload the consignment and check on the contents open up a crate i cant say sir i mean its up to them but it wouldnt take more than a half hour to get the stuff off the kite and then all theyll need is a crowbar so id be working inside a time bracket of thirty minutes minimum but then theyd go through all the crates before they contacted shoda how many crates are there twenty think how long would it take to open up twenty crates and go through the whole contents which was what theyd do before they got on the radio and informed shoda an hour say an hour time bracket then of ninety minutes minus an estimated i looked at pepperidge from here to the airport how long forty minutes with the escort minus an estimated forty minutes and another fortyfive minutes for the shoda jet to start up and taxi and get to the grid bracket of five minutes five better than zero and i was having to make estimates and i might have longer than that and we still had a chance even if it were shorter below zero so take the risk go for it all right i said into the phone set it up any questions i dont think so then keep in signals roger i put the phone down and went into the little lav just off the smokingroom and slurped some handfuls of water into my mouth and splashed my face and towelled it and went back and through into the salon and told loman and pepperidge what i wanted to do she kill my father there was a moth circling the lamp im sorry i said thank you thank me mother of god if i hadnt gone there to the radio station she wouldnt have sent the bombers in bitch you know he the yes sayakosan moth round the lamp bulb bumping into it a powdering of gold dust coming down kishnar she said what happen we sent him to shoda in a coffin i heard her catch her breath you do such a thing yes will make her afraid silence came in and i waited gold dust floating down are you out of your bloody mind have you got to go on hitting the bloody thing couldnt stay away i suppose dont take this all the way to the brink i live only now the soft voice came till she the meant for her to the i understand she very strong very hard but like glass one day break easily you make her break i think one day perhaps id been wondering why shed phoned but now i knew more than anything in the world she wanted shodas death and she thought i might bring it about for her shed wanted to talk to the instrument of her hearts most bitter craving will be graceful she said i think she meant that to kill mariko shoda would bring grace upon me if it happens sayakosan you will know yes another silence but for the soft sounds of her crying when she the my father be at peace i said something consoling i dont quite remember what and then there was a click on the line and it went dead and i suppose shed just felt she couldnt talk any more i went back into the salon and we took up where wed left off i dont like your extemporising loman its the only way but surely the risk is high not so high as if we just wait around till they locate me and wipe me out pepperidge was perched on the edge of a chair and hadnt said anything for a long time i dont think he liked it flood was standing near the stainedglass windows with his feet apart and his arms folded listening hard but not saying anything either katie was manning the phone whenever it rang coming back to sit apart from us her face strained i wished she didnt have to be here with us but it was up to loman loman hadnt answered so i said it again trying to sell it to him this is the only way id told them what i wanted to do and how it would have to be handled technically and id told flood to get me what i needed and hed done that and all we had to do now was wait for our contacts to ring us when shoda left the house in saiboo street for the airport and that would be when she got the news from prey veng that the consignment had arrived there loman still didnt answer i think he was simply stonewalling so that id have to keep on pushing him and then if i said something wrong he could pounce on it that was all right that was his job so i went on pushing i know two things when she moves ive got to move or ill lose her and weve got to isolate the confrontation to keep the public out of danger loman was still silent he didnt like this any more than pepperidge a bit earlier pepperidge had said to me quietly hand on my arm you really are taking this all the way to the brink this time told him there wasnt anywhere else left for me to go then loman spoke very well he was sitting in the wingchair with his hands along its arms and his polished shoes together staring down at them but of course i have serious reservations he swung his small head up and stared at me instead of his shoes and i knew what was on his mind he could be looking at someone whod started dying if you cant give me a decision i told him very fast indeed id say weve had it the slingshots out of her hands now but shes still alive and shes the target you cant hope to go on protecting me even with half the singapore police force because ive got to move into the open for the endphase whatever form it takes and theyll simply pick me off with a telescopic rifle if they cant get any closer this situation hadnt happened before the executive at present safe and supported by his director in the field and his london control had a limited life span and during that span hed got to complete the mission we are working on assumptions loman said we assume that when shoda is told that the consignment has been landed shell leave the house in saiboo street for the airport and take off for prey veng confident that youll be taken care of in her absence by her hit teams its logical i told him were not taking wild swipes i agree but youve narrowed down the time element to as little as five minutes the time gaps important but its not critical if she gets the news that shes lost the slingshot before i can break it to her weve still got a chance he didnt answer there was the rustling of paper and i saw katie clearing away the debris from the sandwiches shed brought in for us flood went across to help her he looked as if he hadnt been listening to anything but of course he had he needed to know what kind of mess i might be leaving him to straighten out how do you rate your chances quiller loman was still staring at me with his pale glass eyes look if i start thinking in terms of lifeanddeath percentages its going to sabotage my confidence the thing is this weve still got a mission running and the only way i can finish it is to get close to shoda and this is the last chance weve got waited again i hate waiting the air was still like steam in here because theyd let the whole place run down and there wasnt any airconditioning but there was a chill creeping through me as if winter had come they re right you shouldnt take the risk now dont you start endphase nerves normal ignore you do in fact know what your chances are shuddup and fuck off then loman said i think this is for mr croder to decide if it doesnt take all day to get him he is near the signals console at all times loman got up and gave his shoes another scrutiny will you talk to him or shall i i thought that was nice of him a top control in the field from london doesnt normally leave it to the ferret to contact the c of c and take part in the decisionmaking let me phone him right away i told him and the feeling i had when i made my way round the chairs and tables and into the smokingroom was split right down the middle between total assurance that i could pull off a fivestar spectacular and a numbing certainty that this was the day when i was going to the brink for the last time and right over i asked for c of c yes red lotus executive i told him what id got in mind and he asked me to repeat it and i did that he said no sir let me put it this way if i come unstuck youre not going to lose the mission just the executive my replacements fully briefed and ready to take over he cant i pictured croder thin his face cut out of flint with a battleaxe his black eyes showing nothing but the reflection of the telephone in his articulated metal hand but hes the replacement sir no names yes but from the information ive been given you are in these circumstances unreplaceable your personal influence over the opposition is a special case voice like a knife being sharpened thats my original point i think its strong enough to bring her down look this isnt just a last desperate throw ive given it a tremendous lot of thought and you know my record sir waited the thing was this was something new if id said i wanted to infilitrate a kgb operation or blow a checkpoint or bring a toplevel defector across a frontier hed have let me but there was an exotic untried element to the endphase of red lotus and its name was voodoo tell your control id like to talk to him so i got loman in and left him at the phone and went back into the salon and stood there with my arms folded and the chill seeping along the nerves because if croder finally said no id lose the day and those snivelling little clerks in the records room would take a pen and fill in the blank space at the end of the operations report mission unaccomplished and if croder finally said yes id have to go out there and face shoda alone and with no backups no shields no support and no escape route no chance of getting out alive except the one i was ready to take and god knew what it was worth i could hear flood over by the stainedglass windows whistling between his teeth katie was somewhere behind me i didnt know what she was doing i just knew what she was thinking pepperidge was standing quite still with his hands in his pockets head down for a time then he took a couple of steps towards me and stood close and said softly whatever we go into old boy ill give you full measure i know he turned away and gave me room left me space to move in if i wanted to i could hear loman out there on the phone and thought jesus christ i shouldve stayed with him and insisted on him selling croder my plan on the other hand loman would try and do that anyway because he wanted this mission finished so that he could take a plane back to london of course the executive didnt have a chance of pulling it off until i vent out there bloody tin medal for his sparrows chest hes always no thats unfair he does a good job dont needle the poor little bastard nerves last chance nerves would you stop that i was looking across at flood didnt really know id been going to say it whistling between his teeth got on my nerves sorry sir but of course hed got a lot to think about too because if i came unstuck he could be pushed into this mission within a matter of hours can i katie close to me somewhere behind me but i never heard what shed been going to say could she what get me anything a drink could she ask me something and if so what at a time like this i never heard it all would never hear it all because loman came in just then and we turned and looked at him we have mr croders approval that was at hours with the midafternoon sunlight slanting through the stainedglass windows and we began waiting i went through the whole thing in my mind god knows how many times testing it for faults and unnecessary risks and oversanguine assumptions testing it for possible surprises and unpredictable situations breaking up the overall picture into bits and pieces and changing them around and putting them together again long afternoon it was a very long afternoon with flood manning the phone again taking periodic calls from our people in the streets the bell ringing in my guts every time jangling along the nerves because we were now on a collision course with the deadline and the deadline was plus a minute two minutes for them to radio shoda with the news that the slingshots had landed in prey veng tea we had some tea it revives you nothing like a good hot cuppa so forth even in this stinking heat then at when the suns light began dying in the stainedglass windows we got the signal from the second unit to say theyd flown to phnom penh and switched the contents of the twenty crates for obsolete typewriters and at they signalled again to tell us the freighter was airborne on schedule from phnom penh and at we got the final signal telling us it had landed on schedule in prey veng and seven minutes later our contacts in saiboo street reported that shoda was leaving the house in a limousine with two escorts endphase running endphase havelock road crossing new bridge loman leaned forward and spoke to katie what kind of escort has she got katie undipped the radiophone one hand on the wheel c can you tell me what kind of escort she has smoked glass windows we couldnt see much from inside but i was getting glimpses through the side mirrors is anyone looking after our tail oh yes loman said our own escort comprises five unmarked cars two ahead of us i saw a street sign st andrews we were moving north c please come in she has a car in front and behind thank you katie said she halfturned her head and loman nodded pepperidge was on the other side of me he hadnt spoken since wed left the nightclub i didnt know what was on his mind but i suppose he wasnt feeling dissatisfied with his performance hed successfully entrapped me into a bureau operation and had monitored my action in singapore from cheltenham reporting to london and taking his own briefing from them hed successfully run me as a director in the field until loman had flown out here to liaise with chief of control and he was now going through the endphase with me and his job was to watch me like a hawk for any signs of cold feet or bravado that will often send an executive right into a trap of his own making his fear driving him to doing things he wouldnt normally take on what i was feeling at this moment was a sense of betrayal because i valued this man and as the spook he was personally running i should have told him the whole of my plan for bringing shoda down and i hadnt i darent because hed have pulled me right away now entering nicoll highway going north shoda sitting in her limousine among her lethal bodyguards with their black tracksuits and their kitten faces and their knives ready to do anything for her to give or take lives what was in her mind as she drove north along nicoll highway let me tell you something pepperidge shoda is afraid of you she very strong very hard sayako but like glass one day break easily you make her break i think one day everything depended on that on her fear of me it was the only weapon i could take to her voodoo katie had swung the wheel again and i saw another sign ophir road i asked her where is she now ahead of us on the east coast parkway heading for the airport it looks like it there was nothing else in this direction except for resorts and tennis clubs take stock and report the thigh bruise wasnt any real problem i could run close to the limit if i had to the laceration to the rib had stopped limiting the lungcapacity two days ago or i couldnt have worked as i did with kishnar the right hand was useless but the arm was perfectly fit without any degree of paralysis i could block with it the sutured artery in the left wrist must have healed to the point of handling very high systolic pressure or again couldnt have got through the kishnar thing everything else normal hand on my arm how top line not necessarily telepathy hed been waiting for my assessment and report at this stage within minutes of the action he nodded and took his arm away c please come in floods voice hed stayed behind at the nightclub to liaise can you give a status report for the board signals board that was to say croder loman leaned forward tell him that were proceeding to the rendezvous as planned and anticipate effective action took some saying the man had guts admit it he was reporting to c of c and there were other ways he could have put it estimations are sanguine complications not foreseen at this stage a nice cosy phrase that would mean that we were all sitting here with our fingers crossed and our sphincter muscles tight and our minds turned away from the unthinkable the control and the director were after all escorting the executive in the field to a deliberate confrontation with the objective who had put a small army into the streets of singapore to wipe me out c c katie took the phone come in the is being readied for flight chinese voice american accented english fuelling has commenced and the systems are being checked thank you please keep me informed she turned her head did you get that mr loman yes he didnt speak again until we passed the first of the changi international airport signs two more calls came in giving us the present position of the shoda convoy and flood signalled with a request for updated information obviously for london we hadnt stopped at an intersection since wed left the nightclub when the lights had been at amber or red thered been a marked police car standing there with its lights flashing and wed gone straight through this was why pepperidge had said it was a fortyminute run to the airport with escort i looked out of the windows trying to get the thought out of my mind that i was sitting in a black mariah on my way to the execution block i wasnt having any second thoughts if this thing finally didnt work then that would have been written in the stars there was no other endphase operation we could hope to pull off and we knew that the nerves were tightening that was all normal at this stage ignore the loman spoke its my opinion carefully that your estimate of the time factor is on the pessimistic side id say you have more than a fiveminute period to work in there will be quite a little panic when the crates are opened and they wont signal shodas aeroplane immediately do you want further briefing on this no beacons were coming up red lights at the top of radio masts sliding past the darkened windows thats all i need a jet was taking off its vibrations palpable inside the car if im wrong of course if he was wrong itd blow the whole thing into christendom no not the whole thing just the executive but flood would have a rotten job to take over the main tower showed through the windscreen black against the glow of the terminal lights the smell of kerosene was coming in through the airconditioning ducts gentlemen loman showed us his watch hours pepperidge altered his to synchronise i was aware of the outline of katies face on the right side the curve of the cheekbone the curl of hair i wish we could have met before but then i suppose it wouldnt have worked out slowing a red light flashed from the rear of the mazda ahead of us theyre taking us straight onto the tarmac katie said is that right sir yes she slowed again martin will you stay the night theres not much of it left anyway another jet went sliding across the roofs of the buildings lifting clear and leaving its sound filling the night she swung the wheel following the mazda keep back the dawn wasnt that the title of something slowing gates personnel only two uniformed guards checking the mazda asking for ids two guards i suppose because thered been an attempted hostage situation at this airport a month ago ice one of the gates swung back and the mazda was waved through we followed ice along the nerves hand on my arm the way youve got things worked out old boy it should be a pushover yes perfect direction in the field close attention to the minutiae of the situation tot of rum for the troops so forth tarmac vehicles moving fuel tankers baggage trains security patrols a jumbo on the main eastwest runway rolling under power a windsock flying out in its wake then dropping the last met report had said stillair conditions at ground level a lot of noise now from the jumbo northwest orient when it had died away loman asked me you still prefer a police car yes the high commission limo would stand out i didnt want that the whole thing had to be performed in low key no rush no excitement softly softly catchee monkee too much confidence too much bloody chutzpah its not going to be as easy as that its not going to be a pushover steady lad we slowed and stopped i could see the standing near the line of hangars at least i assumed it was the one is that yes over there katie said th j to loman shall i wait here sir see if you can get in there between the fence and the service truck we moved off did a slow turn and slotted into cover i could see a limousine standing a hundred yards away not far from the and flanked by two smaller cars c c please come in their etd is down as thank you to loman sir yes ive got that he picked up his fieldglasses and focused them seventeen minutes close we were getting very close now the main taxiinglane was behind us and i could hear the aircraft rolling there i could see the red wingtip lights on the starboard side reflected in the outside mirrors the line was almost unbroken ive given this a tremendous lot of thought id told croder and you know my record too much pride not really the way i thought i could handle things there was a chance that was all we needed a chance loman beside me suddenly petulant i would feel very much better if you would arm yourself i think it was just something to say to fill the silence break the waiting because he knew bloody well i never used a gun those things are more nuisance than theyre worth didnt answer this car will stay right here pepperidge said so if and he broke off because we were all watching the limousine over there and an asian woman in a tracksuit was getting out and opening a rear door standing aside at this distance and in this light i couldnt see more than four small figures moving quickly from the car to the steps of the jet the car didnt move stayed where it was within sixty seconds the steps began retracting and half a minute later the cabin door was closed two women loman said with the fieldglasses raised and two army officers noted a mechanic in overalls and with a soundmuffler on his head walked in front of the aircraft and turned and looked up and signalled and the first engine began moaning a feeling of unreality now of floating towards a frontier of some kind not an international frontier with checkpoints and all that just a quiet personal boundary not even physical perhaps the rather blurred line between doubt and certainty past and future life and death it was quite pleasant a releasing i suppose of the endorphins as i approached the zone where i was going to ask exacting things of myself and expect to get them then the feeling passed and i pulled myself forward and caught a glimpse of katies face as she turned then i climbed across pepperidge and snapped the door open and dropped onto the tarmac and went across to the nearest mazda got in jordan yes sir they were in plain clothes both chinese sitting upright in the front of the car i could see more of what was going on now because the windows of the police car were clear glass not darkened the jet began moving i looked back through the rear window and saw five other aircraft strung out along the taxiinglane the first of them turning onto the runway the was joining the line slowing and turning coming to a stop a call came over the radio for the police car and the passenger responded said they were stationary i leaned forward have you got contact with mr loman yes sir you have a message no just wanted to know it was a lifeline in a way the link with my control and my director soon id have to break it the second jet was airborne and the rolled again keeping station she was due for takeoff in four minutes the pervasive burning sensation in the left hand had faded out as the endorphins worked on the nerves no particular feeling of anxiety it was too early yet a sense of suspension of holding back while the clocks flicked to the next digit while the big jets rolled again in their orderly line while life went on the two chinese sat stiffly not talking not moving watching the no more calls came through another jet turned into line behind the rolling to a halt air france i could see the high commission vehicle slotted between the fence and the service truck loman silting inside pepperidge katie were they talking what are you saying my good friends my erstwhile lady love with your thin shoulders and your bluegrey eyes the last aircraft was airborne the last one before the and the sound came back surging across the metal bodywork of the car in a wave passing beyond fading the got the instructions from the tower and rolled forward turning onto the runway its wingtips lifting and falling as the suspension flexed it stood there waiting for permission to take off i could see the main tower with its ruby marker lights loman had said the deputy chief of police would be there in the tower itself and his chief on the tarmac in an unmarked car the action wed called for would have been rehearsed during the last hour and we expected it to take place smoothly especially as the attempted hostage situation of a month ago had brought security bang up to scratch the waited its engines at idling speed saliva came now a slight onrush and i began swallowing waiting for the yawn letting it happen normal at this phase the matador reflex as the bull comes into the arena fast and enraged what we needed was isolation just the two of us isolated shoda and me kept swallowing i would have said that at this stage the organism was probably in the best condition we could expect the odd injury unimportant the nerves reacting as they should the adrenalin beginning to flow becoming copious as the waiting went on the driver started his engine and moved off turning and stopping lined up with the sliproad used by the emergency vehicles he left the engine going sitting and waiting not easy its not easy you know we were a minute overdue but the signal was going through to the flightdeck from the tower and the began gunning up the scream of the turbines rising to a pitch that cut through the night then she was rolling the brakes coming off and the wing tips dipping and lifting as the accelerationphase went slamming in and the big shape began sliding faster against the line of lamps at a quarter distance along the runway until the emergency order went through from the tower and the green lamps changed to red and the scream of the jets broke and the brakes went on and my driver hit the gearshift and we started forward the code lamps sending a flicker of red and blue along the walls of a hangar before we reached the sliproad travelling fast now moving for the halfway point along the runway as the went on slowing under brakes slowing until i judged the timing looked right and told the driver to pull up here just here then i hit the door open and got out and started walking kiss it was very quiet now the tower had instructed the captain of the to shut down his engines and he had done that since then the aircraft standing in line along the taxiing path had received the same order and they too were silent now i heard the cry of sea birds beyond the airport in the waters of the straits it was humid the air clung to the skin heavy with the reek of kerosene i stood looking up at the windows of the flight deck one of them slid open and a face appeared there a voice came something in chinese i didnt know what beyond the smooth shape of the plane the lights of the city stood against the sky and i could see traffic moving along changi road some of the vehicles flashing red and blue i heard sirens the generators of the kept a low singing its lights too went on flashing at the spine of the fuselage and at the tail section i could smell the rubber of the tyres heated by the brakes when the emergency stop had been ordered i felt rather lonely waited flash flash flash i looked away didnt want to become mesmerised the generators sang quietly sweat on my face partly the humidity partly the organism producing heat as it stabilised its systems at the level of optimum alertness waited the cries of the gulls were mournful a plaint from the souls of dead sailors then a door opened a sudden heavy metallic sound and it swung open the cabin door someone standing there army officer revolver trained on me he called something in thai i didnt understand but it could only have been what do you want i want to talk to mariko shoda fly on my face i brushed it away i cant stand these hot wet climates you might just as well be in a sauna bath the gun hadnt moved in good english who are you martin jordan he spoke across his shoulder i could see the blur of a face behind him he never took his eyes off the target bloody things all they do is make a loud bang i hate bangs she would bring a knife if she came theyd all bring knives her clutch of athletic young hags this was one of the assumptions you understand the whole operation was designed like a pintable a carefullyplotted pattern of assumptions and if each one rang a bell id score the maximum which would be the destruction of mariko shoda i didnt know what the chances were of my losing the percentages as id told croder of life and death but i knew that of the series of assumptions id worked out each one would have to be right would have to ring a bell and this was the first of them that she would decide to come and talk to me i wasnt guessing you neednt think that i was relying on the detailed information id been given on her character and what i believed to be her present frame of mind she had set her feline assassins on me in the limousine and id confronted her in the temple and shed tried to have me killed when shed heard i was in the village in the jungle and shed thrown kishnar onto me twice and been sent his body in a coffin and if she could find one single chance in a thousand of finally killing me shed want to do it herself fierce in her pride hot in her craving for vengeance triumphant in the savage decisive termination of our fateful relationship id come here to give her that chance there was movement in the cabin doorway another officer in khaki uniform stood looking down at me for a moment then they both moved back theyd be the two military officers loman had seen earlier from the car shed got her own little army chen had said another bumping noise and the steps appeared in the doorway sliding and angling down the rail rising on the stays until the bottom of the steps reached the tarmac and the movement stopped then one of the officers came down came down steadily uniform immaculate short tropical sleeves polished belt the shirt open at the neck a knife sheathed at the hip on the side opposite from the revolver a short figure even slight shoda she stood for a moment on the bottom step watching me her eyes shadowed by her peaked cap then she came onto the tarmac i stood with my hands by my sides empty at the edge of my vision above her i noted figures faces in the cabin doorway shed ordered them to stay on board sounds faded or seemed to fade and silence fell across us both containing us enclosing us bringing intimacy i could see they were all officer rank by the uniform johnny chen then i put a few things together the location of the camp and the obviously elite performance going on and then i got it that tiny little guy was mariko shoda because believe me there isnt another female colonel in this neck of the woods id expected her to be sheathed in silk sinuous feline seducing me into the shades of lethe with the kiss of her bright blade but despite the uniform she looked as she had when id seen her in the temple her small face fragile ivoryskinned the cheekbones sculpted noble her dark eyes luminous her short hair nightblack under the cap you are not armed a light voice but with the note of harshness id heard before on the tapes and now something else a tone of disbelief understandable no she moved her right hand a delicate fineboned hand a hand you would want to touch your lips to and rested it on her gun i hadnt expected a gun she was looking over my head now scanning the background for snipers still disbelieving you have no support no i was aware of feedback and heard that my voice was totally calm i dont need arms and i dont need support totally calm even though i hadnt expected a gun there was a trace of panic in the organism that i could detect it was tuned by its awareness of mortal danger to a pitch where it would have the speed and the strength to save itself if there were a chance i didnt think there was one now because of the gun id need to take her through rage before shed break and in her rage shed shoot me sounds coming back fading in the high thin whistling of the jets overhead as the tower ordered them into a holding pattern waiting to land shoda spoke but surely you must realise that i shall kill you now looking at me with her dark eyes shimmering the eyes of a woman in love in love with what she was going to do but there was something here on the positive side oh a bare degree of course christ yes what can we expect with her hand on that bloody gun sweat running now cooling the skin but at least a degree a sign of something positive she wasnt thinking straight if shed been thinking straight shed have realised that a professional agent wouldnt just come here and bare his neck for nothing hed come with some kind of bargain to offer a gesture of tit for tat you get off my back and ill get off yours so forth but she hadnt even asked why id come to her alone and unarmed she was too full of her obsession too eager to rid herself of the one obstacle in her path to armageddon to think of anything else or i was whistling again maybe in the dark thered be no point i said in killing me why is that throw in the first one and watch the reaction because youve lost the slingshot without that missile pepperidge shes finished without the slingshot shed struggled from her agonising childhood through the jungles of the golden triangle to seize the almost infinite power shed needed as an antidote for her innermost pain but now shed gone beyond that creating a dream of all asia in flames and to make it real she needed a real weapon the slingshot and now she couldnt go back from there from the heights of her megalomania to the life of a tawdry narcotics tycoon shed have to go on or break i watched the reaction a faint gold spark in the depth of her eyes a hit a direct hit but what id said had shocked her that was all she couldnt let herself believe it the shipment has landed she said in prey veng i was informed yes it landed at hours on schedule but your agents are checking the containers now and there are no missiles we removed them her hand hit the holster and pulled the clip and drew the gun and i tensed but she halfturned calling something to the people in the cabin doorway in thai and i didnt understand but it was obviously something like signal our unit in prey veng and ask whats in the containers then she swung back to face me and now i could see the fear in her eyes the fear that it was true i took the tension off a degree because i needed the calm to work through the project the endphase wed got the timing right wed worked inside the fiveminute bracket and that was over now there wouldnt have been a single chance of breaking shoda if shed already heard shed lost the slingshot ii had been essential that i tell her myself it would give me the power i needed to break her the news she feared most had to come from this man standing in front of her unarmed unassailable omnipotent we were to use it had been agreed by loman by pepperidge by croder himself the psychic chemistry of voodoo she waited shed do nothing say nothing i knew until she received the signal from prey veng telling her whether i was right or wrong whether shed won or lost that would be the moment when shed start to break or shoot me dead i didnt know the weaponry in asia all that well but it looked like a regulation japanese army mm hitaki either five or six shots i couldnt tell because the chamber was polished and highlighted with not much shadow in the grooves but i saw shed been trained in gunhandling her index finger was flattened against the barrel pointing at the target and her middle finger was inside the triggerguard i couldnt tell if shed already got pressure on the primary spring but i didnt think it was likely when the time came shed do it executionstyle formally order me to turn my back and kneel a single shot in the head i could hear voices in the neardistance from inside the jet one of them distorted sounding from a speaker on the flightdeck she was listening too the whistling of the aircraft drifted from the night sky as they circled in their holdingpattern other flights joining them over the minutes seabirds still called from the waters beyond the perimeter road wakeful in the artificial light perhaps they were still fishing closing their wings and plunging through the surface to pierce the sweet flesh of the prey with their stiletto beaks one must live my friends one must survive she went on watching me shoda with her hand on the gun until a voice reached us from the cabin of the plane alarm in it though i didnt understand the words only their meaning and i saw the spark come again into shodas eyes and flare into rage so i said to her the civilised nations cant afford to let you take possession of a weapon like that itd be like putting a live bomb into the paws of a monkey she fired and the bullet hit and i blanked out ordinary needs the temptation to crouch over my diaphragm the point of impact to let out my breath to do anything but stand and watch her stand without moving and watch her face and see the rage in her eyes change to fear as they widened and her mouth parted and her head tilted back as she stared at me the smell of cordite drifted on the air now that your grandiose ambitions are destroyed mariko shoda youve nothing left you are nothing except a sordid little drugdealer feeding the dreams of the deadbeats on the streets of hong kong and berlin and new york an ineffective little revolutionary beating with your small fists at the gates of civilised nations surely your father the prince wouldnt have wanted such a fate for you the gun flashed and i took the shock again and absorbed it watching her face and seeing the fear change to terror as i went on standing there not moving theres this bullshit of course that you see in the movies when a man gets shot and goes flying backwards as if hes been hit by a train and i suppose it looks cute but work it out for yourself in terms of basic physics force exerts equal force in the opposite direction so the gunman would go flying backwards too not that i was actually enjoying myself id told flood i wanted it proof against knives because that was what id expected to be getting into if it came to a showdown a superspectacular barn dance with half a dozen of those jungle cats trying to do a julius caesar thing on me if i couldnt make shoda fall for the voodoo bit but obviously it was also proof against closerange mm ammunition a sixteenthofaninchthick weave of tungsten steel mesh with a covering of toughened nylon according to floods description not though enjoying it no because she was breaking fast now and if she raised that gun and aimed at my head itd be strictly no go finite and a rose for moira i spoke again telling her what she must be told at this stage in the affair i hadnt expected a gun when id come out here to meet her but thered been one so id had to change the script id expected her as an oriental to accord me the executionstyle formality so that i could enter nirvana kneeling in prayer but she hadnt done that because she was now totally dominated by her emotions and all she could think about was pumping the shots into me and focusing on the standard target the heart because if she missed it even at this range shed hit a lung or the spleen or the liver and start death spreading through the system so i continued my assault on her psyche because she was now conditioned for it it is not your karma to kill me mariko as you see this much is now made manifest on the contrary you know that by the law of karma the abusers of power must surrender it this much is ordained flash and in the next millisecond the bang of the gun and then the smoke clouding between us the third shot that was the third shot id been counting but the thing was i didnt know if the chamber held five or six bullets and i was waiting for her to raise the gun and aim at my head and squeeze the thing and jesus christ i didnt want her to do that sweating like a pig wouldnt you waiting for her to do that in the next second the next two seconds blowing my head away what happened to q oh he never got back the opposition blew his head away in the middle of a runway on singapore airport hed bitten off more than he could chew got into some kind of exotic endphase he couldnt get out of he was always a bit like that if you remember the fear of christ in me as watched her fascinated keeping the gun at the edge of my vision and seeing it come up seeing her lift it and take aim at the centre of my forehead not in fact no just the nerves watching her face and waiting for her to do that but shed gone beyond the point of rational thinking because all she could see in front of her was this man this creature an animalistic phantasm that was proving itself omnipotent unkillable immortal and most hideous of all the incarnation of her own appointed nemesis watching her face watching her face as she fired again and i felt the impact just above the heart fourth shot if you had said to an artist a sculptor fashion me a mask that will show fear more than fear terror more than terror the recognition of a force so powerful that the wearer pales before its dread countenance in thrall to the knowledge of impending death the death of the maskwearer a death that is decreed predestined that is fixed by the stars so as to be inescapable if you had asked an artist a sculptor to make you a mask like that then you would be looking into the face of shoda as i saw her now like glass one day break easily you make her break i think one day smoke drifting between us on the quiet air bring her down bring her down now acknowledge your karma mariko and obey it there is nothing more for you here flash and the gun banged and i took the shock and waited fifth shot that had been the fifth shot and there could be a sixth i didnt know stink of cordite and the echoes coming back from the hangars the nerves running with fire because of the effort needed to absorb the impact every time it came the effort to go on standing still to show her the tranquil mien of an immortal so that the voodoo would work not voodoo really id told her the eternal truth and shed recognised it and knew its power one last throw because i had to find out there is nothing you can do now mariko but obey your karma she raised the gun and took aim at my head and fired but there was no flash this time just a click from the hammer a fiveshot chamber yes and i watched the final understanding come into her eyes and dwell there the understanding that this creature was beyond her reach in this world and then her arms went down and her hand opened and the gun dropped from her fingers and i said go to your father now and be at peace and turned my back to allow her privacy for this most intimate of acts and heard the knife hiss from its sheath and the soft cry as the blade was buried and i began walking across the tarmac towards the lights the end
