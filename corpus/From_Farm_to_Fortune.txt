smithers xxx nat comes into his own preface nat nason was a poor country boy with a strong desire to better his condition life on the farm was unusually hard for him and after a quarrel with his miserly uncle with whom he resided he resolved to strike out for himself nat was poor and it was a struggle to reach the great city where the youth trusted that fame and fortune awaited him the boy obtained by accident a fair sum of money and with this he resolved to go into a business of some kind but a sharper quickly relieved him of his wealth and opened nats eyes to the fact that he was not as shrewd as he had thought himself to be the lesson proved a valuable one and from that moment the country boy did his best to not alone win success but to deserve it he worked hard often in the midst of great difficulties and what the outcome of his struggle was will be found in the pages which follow in penning this tale the author has endeavored to show the difference between life in a quiet country place and in a great bustling city and especially as that difference shows itself to the eyes of a country boy many country lads imagine that to go to the city and win success there is easy perhaps they will not think it so easy after they have read of what happened to nat nason more than once in spite of his grit and courage nat came close to making a complete failure of what he had started out to do and his success in the end was perhaps after all not as great as he had anticipated when first striking out from farm to fortune chapter i nat on the farm nat where have you been been fishing answered the boy addressed a sturdy youth of sixteen with clear blue eyes and sandy hair fishin and who said you could go fishin demanded abner balberry in his high nervous voice nobody said i could go answered the boy firmly but i thought youd all like to have some fish for supper so i went humph i suppose you thought as how them taters would hoe themselves eh sneered abner balberry who was not only nats uncle but also his guardian i hoed the potatoes was the boys answer got through at halfpast two oclock if you got through so soon you didnt half do the job grumbled the man i aint goin to have you wastin your time on no fishin understand cant i go fishing at all not when there is work to do on this farm but i did my work uncle abner an i say it couldnt have been done right if ye didnt take proper time fer it nat nason i know you you are gittin lazy im not lazy cried the boy indignantly i work as hard as anybody around here dont you talk back to me ejaculated abner balberry i say you are lazy an i know how many fish did ye catch i only got two they didnt bite very well today humph awastin three hours an more jest to catch two little fish if i let you go your own way nat nason youll be in the poorhouse before you die i dont think ill ever get to the poorhouse uncle abner oh dont talk back take your fish to the kitchen an then git down to the barnyard as quick as you can youve got to help me milk tonight an dont you dare to go fishin agin unless i give ye permission added abner balberry as he strode off towards the barn a sharp answer arose to nat nasons lips but he checked it and turned toward the kitchen of the farmhouse what luck did you have nat questioned the did woman who was abner balberrys housekeeper not much luck mrs felton they didnt bite very well today what was mr balberry saying to you went on mrs felton who had been housekeeper at the place since the death of mrs balberry two years before he was mad because i went fishing i am sorry to hear that uncle abner never wants me to have any sport hes a hardworking man and always was nat he doesnt believe in wasting time but a fellow ought to have a little time off that may be true dont you think i work pretty hard for a boy of my age i do nat uncle abner wants to make a regular slave out of a fellow didnt he say you were to help him milk tonight yes and i might as well get at it right away if i dont hell give me another jawing answered the boy and placing his fish on a bench he strode off toward the barnyard nat nason was an orphan the only child of mr william nason who had been a brother to the late mrs balberry the boys father had been killed in a runaway and his mother had never gotten over the shock of the sudden death when the youth found himself an orphan he was taken in by his aunt mary who did what she could for him the nasons had not been rich so there was little or no money coming to nat from the start he was told that he must earn his own living and this he proceeded to do to the best of his ability the death of his aunt mary was almost as much of a blow to the lad as the loss of his mother for it left him under the entire charge of his uncle abner balberry the latter had no children of his own and he made nat work as hard as if he were a fullgrown man the balberry farm was located in ohio not far from the town of caswell it consisted of one hundred acres of good land with a house and several outbuildings among his neighbors abner balberry was considered the meanest man in the district abner himself thought he was a pretty good man and he counted himself a real pillow of the church as he expressed it for two years life on the balberry farm had been one continual grind to nat nason he was expected to work from morning to night and such a thing as a whole day off was utterly unknown to him he received next to nothing in the way of spending money ill save the money fer ye abner balberry would say when questioned on the subject taint good fer boys to have too much cash on hand it makes em reckless but you never give me anything had been nats answer never mind im agivin you a good home an good eatin was the answer the good home and good fare were something to be questioned nats room was a small one under the roof his clothing usually made over from the garments worn by mr balberry and such a thing as an elaborate table was unknown on the farm many times mrs felton had wished to cook more or make some fancy dishes but abner balberry had always stopped her from doing such a thing plain fare is good enough he would say an if ye eat too much it only brings on the dyspepsy more than once nat went to bed feeling positively hungry when nat reached the barnyard he found his uncle already there with the milk pails and milking an old white cow called sukey go on down the lane and drive up jule cried abner balberry without stopping his milking she just went down that way all right answered nat and passing through the barnyard he hurried down the lane mentioned jule was a new cow that the farmer had purchased a week before she did not seem inclined to herd with the other animals and nat had had quite a good deal of trouble with her before at the end of the lane was an orchard and here he found the cow contentedly eating the fresh grass she tried to get away from him but he was too quick for the creature and soon had her turned around and headed up the lane then he stopped to get an apple for his fishing trip had made him hungry and he knew that supper was still a good hour off i wish i had some other kind of a job he murmured with a sigh somehow farming doesnt seem to be just the right thing for me wish i was in some big city hurry up with that cow cried abner balberry do you think im going to stop here all night fer milkin im coming sang out nat get along jule you old slow poke he gave the cow a slap on the side and away she flew up the lane the boy followed finishing the apple as he went as it happened several cows were bunched up near the entrance to the lane and as the new cow appeared driven by nat the bunch scattered then jule ran directly into the barnyard hi hi stop yelled abner balberry drat the beast stop but the new cow did not stop and a moment later she stepped into a pailful of milk and tipped it over then she ran against another cow that the farmer was milking this cow swerved around and in a twinkling abner balberry was thrown on his back and the milk was sent flying over him chapter ii a quarrel in the barnyard the sight of abner balberry flat on his back and with the milk flowing over him was a comical one and for the instant nat had to laugh outright hi hi roared the farmer git away drat the beasts now nat nason jest see what youve done he struggled to his feet and nat at once became sober for he realized that trouble was at hand its too bad uncle abner began the youth too bad i should say it was too bad cried the farmer an all your fault too i cant see how it was my fault you told me to drive the cow up here dont tell me nat nason its your fault an all that fresh milk gone to waste abner balberry gave a groan i dont know most what im agoin to do with you fer this i cant see how its my fault you made the cows git frightened no i didnt dont tell me dont you know that milk is worth money yes but you scart thet cow out o her wits went on the farmer his rage growing as he looked at the spilt milk nat nason i tell you youre a bad boy to this the youth made no reply im agoin to teach ye a lesson fer it shall i milk jule yes an mind ye dont spill a drop nuther silently nat went to work and milked not only the new cow but also two of the others by this time milking was over and the lacteal fluid was carried to the springhouse to cool then the cows were allowed to wander down to the pasture for the night when nat approached the kitchen again an appetizing odor of frying fish filled the air the boys uncle followed him supper is ready said mrs felton cheerfully you had some trouble with the cows didnt you she continued it was nats fault grumbled abner balberry he made them run around an upset everything nat i said as how i was going to teach ye a lesson you wash up an go to bed at once go to bed queried the boy thets what i said didnt i do you mean right after supper no i mean before supper snarled abner balberry oh isnt he to have his supper first put in the housekeeper timidly no he aint after this abrupt declaration there was an awkward pause do you want me to go to bed without my supper asked nat slowly thats what i said it isnt fair aint it no it isnt it wasnt my fault that the milk was spilt so there you say much more to me an ill tan yer hide well fer ye stormed abner balberry dont you want him to have none of the fish he brought in asked the housekeeper the fish aint worth much maybe youd like to have all the fish yourself put in nat tartly before he had stopped to think angered at this remark the farmer turned around and caught the youth by the collar and began to shake him ill teach ye to talk back to me he snarled ill teach ye now go to bed an be quick about it i want my supper came doggedly from nat he felt that he had earned the meal and he needed it not a mouthful if you dont give me my supper i wont work for you any more uncle abner wot goin to talk to me like this screamed the farmer and caught the boy once again up to your room with ye before i trounce ye well he shook nat fiercely and a struggle ensued between the pair which came to an end when a chair was overturned and then a side table on which rested some of the things for supper oh the eating screamed the housekeeper in alarm and the teapot is smashed she added sadly its all nats fault came from abner balberry he is a goodfernuthin he is off to bed with ye before i git my horsewhip he opened the door leading to the enclosed stairs and fearful of another attack nat retreated as soon as he was on the stairs the farmer slammed the door shut and bolted it a minute later he and mrs felton heard the youth ascend the stairs to his own room it was kind of hard on the boy to make him go to bed without his supper remarked the housekeeper as she gathered up the things on the floor its his own fault snorted the farmer hes got to be took down he has he hasnt had a mouthful since noon and we had a light dinner too i cant help that mrs felton im goin to teach him a lesson nat is a highspirited boy mr balberry maybe he wont stand for it he has got to stand fer it was the answer from the sink where the farmer was washing his face and hands but if he wont wot can he do id like to know im sure i dont know but he may do something that you least expect he wont do nuthin said the farmer and sank down in his seat at the table he cant do nuthin i give him a good home but he dont seem to apreciate it nohow to this mrs felton did not reply but set the food on the table the fish had not been spoilt and the farmer ate all he wished of the dish why dont you eat he asked of the housekeeper seeing that she had abstained from touching the fish i i dont care for it she answered she had in mind to save what was left and give it to nat for his breakfast that boy is gittin too big fer his boots went on abner balberry he acts like he was of age an he is only sixteen last week he wanted to know how soon i was goin to pay him reglar wages and what did you tell him told him id pay him wages when he was wuth it an not before he does almost a mans work now doesnt he not much besides dont i feed an clothe him an give him a comfortable home hes got too highfalutin notions he has but dont you think he ought to have some money went on mrs felton who could be a trifle independent herself at times no money is the ruination o young folks week before last he wanted a quarter to go to the circus with but he didnt git it almost all of the boys in this district went to the circus tom bradley told me it was very good too humph that bradley boy is going to the dogs as fast as he can go deacon slide thinks he is a very good boy well the deacon dont know everything im goin to make nat toe the mark until he is twentyone after that ill wash my hands o him the farmer finished his supper and then went out to see that everything was all right around the farm for the night a little later he took a lamp and went upstairs tiptoeing his way through an upper hall he came to a pause in front of nats room asleep jest as i thought he told himself after listening to the boys breathing then he peeped into the room to behold nat lying under the cover of the bed with his face turned to the wall ill give him another talkin to in the mornin the farmer told himself and then retired with no thought of what was going to happen before the sun arose upon another day chapter iii nat leaves the farm farmer balberry was mistaken nat was not asleep nor was there any thought of sleep in the boys mind the youth had not even gone to bed he had been sitting on a chair by the open window when he had heard his uncle coming upstairs and to deceive his relative had jumped into bed and pulled the blanket up over him when nat was thrust up the stairs his mind was in a tumult he felt that his uncle was not treating him fairly and he wanted his supper very much it is bad enough to have a real grievance of any kind it is worse when one must bear it on an empty stomach as he made his way to his room the boy was in a savage humor and fit to do almost any deed uncle abner is getting worse every day he muttered to himself he treats me worse than i would treat a dog sitting by the open window nat thought of many things of the death of his parents and of the taking off of his aunt and of how his miserly uncle had treated him ever since its not fair he told himself over and over again uncle abner doesnt believe in giving a boy a fair show i wish i lived with somebody else the more he thought over the situation the more he felt that he ought not to stand such treatment he felt that he was entitled to his supper and also to some spending money if not to regular wages at the present time he had not a cent in the world if i had a few dollars i might strike out for myself he reasoned but i havent even a few cents wonder how i could raise a few dollars as said before nats worldly possessions were few in his room he had some trinkets from home and also an old silver watch which had belonged to his father i might sell the watch he thought but then decided that it would be best to keep the heirloom then he thought of jennie the white and brown cow as a calf she had been given to nat by his mother and she was now a part of the herd on the balberry farm jennie ought to be worth twenty or twentyfive dollars he said to himself thats a pile of money for a start wonder how i could manage to sell her thus speculating nat gradually drifted around to the point where he decided that he would leave the farm at once he had told his uncle that he wanted his supper or he would not work for the man any more and he meant to keep his word by the time all was quiet around the house and he was certain both the housekeeper and his uncle had retired nat had settled just what he was going to do making no noise he slipped off his working clothes and put on his best suit something just a trifle better than the others he also donned a clean shirt and collar and necktie and got out his best hat and shoes then with his other possessions wrapped in a small bundle and with his shoes under his arm he tiptoed his way out of the bedchamber along the hall and down to the lower floor of the farmhouse nat knew exactly where mrs felton kept the things to eat so it was not necessary for him to light a lamp the use of a match revealed as much as he wanted to know and in a short time he was devouring what was left of the fish and also some bread and butter and a generous quarter of a cherry pie which the housekeeper had insisted upon baking the day before somewhat against abner balberrys will for the farmer would rather have sold the cherries at the store his meal finished nat hesitated for a moment and then got out an old newspaper into this he wrapped half a dozen slices of bread and butter along with a bit of cheese and two rather stale doughnuts theyll come in handy for breakfast along with an apple or two was the way he reasoned especially if i dont happen to sell the cow the boys next move was to leave the house which he did after tying his clothes and the lunch into one bundle which he slung on a stick over his shoulder once outside he put on his shoes and then made his way from the house to the barnyard and then along the lane leading to the pasture the late moon was showing over the hills and the heavens were bright with stars so it was by no means dark as he entered the lane nat looked back to see if his departure from the house had been discovered a sight met his gaze which caused his heart to jump a man was crossing the dooryard and coming toward the barn it must be uncle abner he thought perhaps he heard me leave after all he looked back again but could not see the man now and then broke into a run soon a row of trees in the orchard hid both the barn and the house from view he continued to run however and did not slacken his pace until he reached the pasture where the cows were at rest jennie did not relish having her rest disturbed and had to be prodded several times before she would arise and move in the direction he desired some of the other cows wished to follow but he drove them back i only want my own he murmured half aloud i dont want a thing that belongs to uncle abner nat had expected to take to the highway which ran directly beside the house but he was afraid that his uncle was watching for him from the barn and so he drove jennie along a back road leading to another highway which was but little traveled and which had along it only a handful of farmhouses he shant catch me if i can help it the boy told himself now ive left im going to stay away nat was still very much agitated in his mind so no thought of sleep came to him as he trudged along mile after mile driving the tired cow before him he met not a soul and thus he progressed until three oclock in the morning boy and cow had now been on the road six hours and jennie refused to go further seeing this he turned into a small patch of woods and there tied the creature to a tree then finding a sheltered nook he threw himself down to rest and was soon fast asleep hullo there what are you doing here such was the demand which aroused nat several hours later and he sprang up to find himself confronted by a farmer boy of about his own age hullo sam he answered i i was driving the cow to market and i got so tired i thought id take a nap going to sell the cow asked sam price yes if i can where over to brookville if anybody will buy her jackson the butcher was after cows only day before yesterday then maybe ill go and see him you must have got an early start went on sam price i did but i must hurry along continued nat not caring to answer too many questions i slept too long youd better hurry your uncle aint the one to let you play is he youre right sam what does he want you to get for the cow it isnt his cow she belongs to me i had her from the time she was a little calf and ive a right to sell her oh yes i remember now well i hope you get a good price for her ill get as much as i can want me to go along you can go along if you wish all right i havent anything else to do for a while but i want to tell you one thing sam can you keep a secret can i try me and see you wont tell a soul ill give you my word but whats up im not coming back what its a fact do you mean that you are going to run away thats the plain english of it sam im tired of living with my uncle he doesnt treat me fairly i believe that my father thinks he is the meanest man in the state of ohio well i dont know about that but he is pretty mean i can tell you that im not going to stand it any longer where are you going i dont know yet most likely to one of the big cities somehow i think i could do better in a city than on a farm do you now i think a country boy has no show in a big city he dont know the ways and he is sure to get cheated out of his eyes so my father says they wont cheat me said nat decidedly father says every big city is full of sharpers on the watch for greenies well they shant catch me for a greeny answered nat alas for poor nat little did he dream of what was in store for him and of the little trap into which he was to fall as soon as he arrived in new york city chapter iv abner balberrys discovery nat abner balberry uttered the name in a loud clear voice and waited fully a minute for an answer nat he repeated i want you to answer me do you hear nat still there was no reply and now in some alarm abner balberry turned back into his bedchamber and donned part of his clothing if that boy is moving around this house im goin to know it he murmured to himself as he felt his way toward nats room coming to the door he threw it open and took a step toward the bed as we already know it was empty the discovery was something of a shock to the farmer and for the moment he stood stockstill gazing at the bed and feeling under the covers to make certain that his nephew was not really there gone he muttered at last he must be downstairs moren likely he went down to git somethin to eat wait till i catch him ill tan him well hoping to catch nat unawares he tiptoed his way down the stairs and entered the living room then he passed to the kitchen and the shed and came back to peer into the parlor not a trace of the lad was to be found anywhere i certainly heard him he reasoned i certainly did mr balberry the call came from the housekeeper are you up yes i am oh all right but it aint all right nats up too is he down there with you no i dont know at all where he is im alookin fer him by this time mrs feltons curiosity was aroused and she lost no time in slipping on her wrapper when she came down she brought with her a lamp where do you suppose he went she asked how do i know snarled abner balberry the housekeeper happened to glance into the pantry she was about to utter an exclamation but checked herself what did you say mrs felton i i didnt say anything he aint in there is he no has he been at the victuals not not very much stammered the housekeeper humph i guess he ate as much as he wanted jest wait till i catch him ill tan him harder than he was ever tanned before maybe he went to bed again no i jest looked into his room abner balberry unlocked the kitchen door and stepped out into the dooryard as he did this he caught sight of somebody running swiftly down the road hi stop he yelled stop nat do you hear to this there was no answer and the fleeing individual merely ran the faster was it nat asked the housekeeper to be sure it was oh wait till i lay my hands on him and the farmer shook his fist at the figure that was fast disappearing in the gloom whats that light in the barn demanded mrs felton an instant later light where up in the haymow abner balberry gave a glance toward the structure the barns afire he screamed thet goodfernuthin boy has set the place on fire oh oh screamed the housekeeper and began to tremble from head to feet for to her mind a fire was the most dreadful thing that could happen ive got to git thet fire out said the farmer and ran toward the barn with all speed be careful or youll be burnt up screamed mrs felton go on an git the water pails said the farmer fill everything with water an bring a rag carpet an ill soak thet too he already had an old patch of carpet used at the doorstep in his hand and this he soused in the watering trough as he passed then he ran into the open barn and mounted to the loft the fire was in a patch of hay at one end of the loft close to an open window regardless of his personal safety abner balberry leaped in and threw part of the hay out of the window then he began to beat out the fire with the watersoaked carpet heres some water came timidly from below and mrs felton appeared with two pails full to the brim he took these upstairs and dashed them on the flames you look out or youll be burnt up cried the housekeeper she was trembling to such a degree that she could scarcely stand git some more water was abner balberrys only reply the thought that his barn might be totally destroyed filled him with dread for there was no insurance on the structure he being too miserly to pay the premium demanded by the insurance company more water was procured by mrs felton and at last it was apparent that the farmer was getting the best of the fire he worked hard and did not seem to mind the fact that his eyebrows were singed and his hands slightly blistered there now ive got it he sighed at last are you sure asked the housekeeper in a faint voice yes but im agoin to hunt around fer sparks git some more water additional water was soon at hand and abner balberry began a minute search of the whole loft on the lookout for stray sparks a few were found and extinguished and then the excitement came to an end how thankful i am that the barn didnt burn down said the housekeeper as the farmer came below and began to bathe his face and hands it was hot work are you burnt much moren i want to be jest wait till i catch nat do you think began the housekeeper o course i do snorted abner balberry didnt i see him arunnin away from the barn i never thought nat would be wicked enough to set a barn on fire he was mad because i wouldnt give him no supper hes a young rascal he is but to burn a barn thet boy has got to be taken in hand mrs felton ive let him have his own way too much im goin to lay down the law good an hard after this maybe he wont come back suggested the housekeeper this thought startled the farmer and he lost no time in finishing his washing im goin after him he announced if he thinks to run away ill put a spoke in his wheel putty quick taking another look around to make certain that the fire was really out abner balberry brought out one of his horses and hitched the animal to a buckboard in the meantime sending the housekeeper back to the house to get his hat and coat where do you suppose youll find him asked mrs felton somewhere along the road most likely maybe hell hide on you he had better not if he does that ill call on the squire about him can you do that o course i can didnt he try to burn down the barn the squire can make out a warrant for his arrest it would be awful to have him arrested well he brought it on himself answered abner balberry doggedly he had no right to try to set the barn afire next thing you know mrs felton hell be atrying to burn us up in our beds oh i dont think nat would be as bad as that you dont know thet boy as well as i do hes sly an stubborn and hell do most anything when hes crossed but ill fix him jest you wait an see how far will you follow him as far as its necessary if he thinks he can git away from me hell find out sooner or later he is mistaken you dont know when youll be back no it may be ill have to wait in town till the squire opens his office that is if i cant find nat but you are going to look for him yourself first yes with this answer abner balberry drove off in the darkness mrs felton watched him and heaved a long and deep sigh too bad she murmured if he catches nat it will surely go hard with that boy well i didnt think he was bad enough to set fire to a barn chapter v the sale of a cow totally unconscious of what had taken place at the farm after his departure nat in company with his friend sam price proceeded on his way to brookville on the journey nat told his friend of many things that had happened to him and of his uncles meanness i dont wonder you want a change said sam id want a change myself at last they came in sight of brookville and nat drove the cow to the yard of jackson the butcher the butcher was a fat goodnatured man of middle age but he was a shrewd business man and firstclass at driving a bargain what do you want boy he asked of nat do you want to buy a cow mr jackson sam says you were out looking for cows day before yesterday i did want cows then but ive got nearly all i want now oh then ill go elsewhere answered nat hold on not so fast what do you want for your cow thirty dollars phew you dont want much shes worth it you can milk her or use her for meat just as you choose whose cow is she mine yours and the butcher gazed at nat curiously yes ive owned her ever since she was a little calf and now you are tired of her not exactly that but i want to use the money will you buy her yes but not for thirty dollars how much will you give twenty dollars i dont care to sell for twenty dollars thats the best i can do then ill have to go elsewhere come jennie and nat turned to drive the cow from the butchers yard again hold on cried the meat man ill give you twentytwo dollars make it twentyfive and ill accept i cant take less i ought to get thirty dollars there was some more talk and in the end the butcher agreed to pay twentyfive dollars and did so he wanted a receipt and nat wrote it out for him so you are nat nason said the butcher i used to know your father a very nice man he was a nice man live with your uncle now dont you i have been living with him yes goodday and much obliged returned the boy and to avoid being questioned further he left the yard at once followed by sam you made a good bargain on the cow said sam i reckon you got every cent she was worth she was a good cow sam im rather sorry to part with her she was almost like a friend what are you going to do next strike out for the city i wish you luck you wont tell my uncle not a word but say well when you get to the city write and tell me how you like it i will sam and you must tell me the news from home and how my uncle gets along without me so it was arranged and a few minutes later the two lads separated and sam price started for home brookville was on a small branch railroad running to cleveland and by consulting a timetable nat learned that a train for cleveland would leave in ten minutes he lost no time in purchasing a ticket and spent the rest of the time in eating some of the lunch he had brought along with over twentythree dollars still in his pocket he felt rich and bought some peanuts and a cake of sweet chocolate when the train came along there were scarcely any passengers aboard so he had little difficulty in getting the seat he wanted he sat down by a window with his bundle beside him and gave himself up to thinking and to looking at the scenery as it whirled past nat had traveled but little on the cars so the ride to cleveland was intensely enjoyable the different places passed were so interesting that he soon forgot to think about his prospects or of what he was to do when he arrived at the city on the lake next stop is cleveland cried the conductor standing at the open doorway all change for trains east and west a moment later the train rolled into the smoky station and bundle in hand nat left the car and stepped onto the platform from there he walked to the street where he gazed in some bewilderment at the crowds of people and the swiftly moving street cars paper cried a newsboy morning paper no i dont want any paper answered nat all about the big fire in chicago boss take a paper yes ill take one said nat and passed over the necessary change off darted the newsboy to be lost in the crowd on the other side of the street nat gazed at the paper to find that a tenement had burned out in chicago with the loss of one life thats not such a terrible thing for a big city like chicago he mused and then noticed that the newspaper was two days old that boy stuck me he muttered and a cloud crossed his face i wonder where he is the boy could not be found and in a moment nat concluded it would be a waste of time to look for him he caught me for a greeny true enough he thought ive got to keep my eyes open after this from one street nat passed to another gazing into the shop windows and wondering what he had best do next he had at first calculated to go to new york without delay but now thought it would do no harm to remain in cleveland a day or two perhaps ill never get here again he reasoned and i might as well see all there is to see noon found him on one of the main streets he was now hungry again and coming to a modestlooking restaurant he entered and sat down at a side table what will you have asked the waiter coming up to him give me a regular dinner said nat seeing the sign on the wall regular dinner to cents the waiter walked off and presently returned with some bread and butter pea or tomato soup he asked whats that questioned the boy pea or tomato soup i dont want any soup i want a regular dinner at this the waiter smiled for he saw that nat was green we serve soup first if the customer wants it and what do you serve after that one kind of meat vegetables coffee or milk and pie or pudding oh well bring me the meat and other stuff i never cared for soup anyway roast beef or lamb roast beef the waiter went off and presently nat was supplied with all he cared to eat the food was good and he took his time finishing off with a piece of lemon meringue pie a dainty of which he was exceedingly fond but which mrs felton had seldom dared to make thirty cents but i guess it was worth it he thought as he left the restaurant nat had never seen lake erie and toward the middle of the afternoon he walked down in the direction of the water the shipping interested him greatly and it was dark before he realized that the day was gone without anything definite being accomplished gracious how time flies when one is in the city he thought tomorrow i must make up my mind what to do next if i dont ill have my money spent and no job either as it grew darker the boy felt the necessity of looking for accommodations for the night seeing a sign on a house furnished rooms by the day week or month he ascended the stoop and rang the bell a young irish girl answered his summons can i get a bed for tonight asked nat i guess yez can ill call mrs ohara said the girl the landlady soon showed herself and said she could let nat have a hall room for fifty cents to the boys notion this seemed rather high i cant take less said mrs ohara firmly very well ill take the room for tonight answered nat can i put my bundle up there now to be sure fortunately for nat the room proved clean and wellkept and the bed was better than the one he had used at the farm tired out the boy slept soundly until seven oclock when he lost no time in dressing and going below will you want the room again tonight mr nason asked the landlady i dont think so answered nat it made him feel a foot taller to be addressed as mr nason if i want it ill let you know by supper time very well with his bundle under his arm nat left the house and walked down the street toward one of the main thoroughfares of cleveland then he stopped at a restaurant for breakfast now ive got to make up my mind what to do he told himself maybe i had better go back to the depot and see about a train and the fare to new york after making several false turns the boy found his way to the depot and there hunted up the ticket office and procured a timetable he was just looking into the timetable when he felt a heavy hand placed on his shoulder so ive found you have i came harshly from abner balberry you young rascal what do you mean by runnin away chapter vi nat on lake erie nat was so completely astonished by the unexpected appearance of his uncle and guardian that for the moment he did not know what to say or do thought you was goin to run away didnt you continued abner balberry with a gleam of triumph in his small eyes let go of me answered nat trying to pull away i aint agoin to nat nason youre agoin back with me an on the next train im not going back uncle abner what i said im not going back so there repeated nat desperately you dont treat me half decently and im going to strike out for myself jest to hear the boy you are agoin back nice doins i must say what did you mean by trying to burn down the barn burn down the barn thats wot i said i never burned down any barn is the barn burned down no because i put out the fire when was this you know well enough i dont know a word about it uncle abner you set the barn afire never you did an youve got to go back uncle abner i never set fire to a thing gasped nat i left because you worked me to death and because you wouldnt let me have my supper after this im going to earn my own living in my own way youre goin back snarled the farmer for answer nat gave a sudden jerk and pulled himself from his uncles grasp then he started to run from the depot at his best speed hi stop yelled the farmer stop thet boy im his guardian and he is runnin away from me the cry was taken up on all sides and soon a crowd of a dozen men and boys were in pursuit of nat who by this time had reached the street nat had always been fleet of foot and now a new fear lent strength to his flying feet he was accused of setting fire to the barn perhaps his uncle would have him arrested and sent to prison he shant do it he muttered i must get away somehow down one street after another went poor nat with the crowd behind him growing steadily larger some thought they were after a thief and some a murderer and soon two policemen joined in the chase coming to an alley way nat darted through it to a side street and then around a corner to a thoroughfare leading down to the docks this threw the crowd off the trail for a moment and gave him a brief breathing spell reaching the docks fronting the lake the boy came to a halt not far off was a steamboat getting ready to cast off where does that boat go to he asked of a man standing near thats the boat for buffalo was the answer and when does she leave she is getting ready to leave now then thats the boat i want came from nat and he rushed to the end of the dock and up the gangplank with all speed a moment later the gangplank was withdrawn and the steamboat started on her trip down lake erie trembling with excitement nat entered the cabin and from the window looked back to the dock they had just left it was not long before he beheld abner balberry and several others on the dock gazing up and down in perplexity they did not know whether the boy was on the boat or in hiding close by what a narrow escape thought nat when the dock had faded from view in another minute uncle abner would have collared me sure had to run pretty hard to catch the boat didnt you remarked a man sitting beside him yes answered nat bound for buffalo i suppose yes first visit to that city yes well its a fine city to visit i can tell you of course youll run up to look at niagara falls i hadnt thought of that its not very far away you know the trolley cars run from buffalo to the falls and back then ill certainly have to go up and look at the falls answered the boy he was too excited to make up his mind just what to do next and so walked away from the man finding a secluded corner of the deck he sat down on a camp stool to think the situation over the fact that his uncle believed he had tried to burn down the barn filled him with alarm certainly the building must have been set on fire but who had done the base deed perhaps that man i took to be uncle abner he cried to himself up to the present time he had forgotten about seeing that individual in the semidarkness while on the way to get the cow the weather was warm and pleasant and had nat been less disturbed in mind he would have enjoyed the trip on lake erie thoroughly even as it was he gazed at the great lake in wonder if this is only a lake what must the ocean be he mused when i get to new york ill have to take a trip to coney island or some other ocean beach the boat nat was on carried more freight than passengers and made half a dozen landings before buffalo was reached but the boy thought the craft one of the best on the lake and wandered over her from end to end with great interest at noon he purchased a light lunch and at supper time a sandwich and a glass of milk they charge pretty stiff prices on a boat he thought after paying over his money ive got to live cheaper after this or ill be a beggar before i settle down and find something to do it was dark when buffalo was reached and here nat was more bewildered than he had been on arriving at cleveland he followed the crowd up from the dock to one of the main streets and then stood on a corner not knowing which way to turn or what to do next what a terrible lot of people and cars was his mental comment its enough to make a fellows head swim he felt that it would be useless to try to do anything that night and so looked around for a cheap lodging house soon he found a place where beds could be had for twentyfive cents a night and he entered ill take a bed he said to the clerk at the desk all right twentyfive cents and as the money was passed over the clerk continued leave your valuables at the desk valuables repeated nat you mean my watch you may leave it if you wish and your money too no ill keep them on me answered the boy he was conducted to an elevator and soon found himself on the fifth story of the building here was a big room containing twenty cots ten on each side here you are no said the attendant and left him on several of the cots some men were already sleeping they were not pleasantappearing individuals and a few of them smelt strongly of liquor this isnt so nice thought nat but its cheap and thats something before retiring he placed his bundle and his clothing under his pillow and stowed away his watch and money on his person nats actions were closely watched by a man who occupied the next cot on the left he was a seedy individual with a face that was horribly pockmarked reckon hes got a dollar or two thought this man who was known among his associates by the name of checkers despite his surroundings nat slept soundly throughout the night and continued to sleep long after the sun came up while it was still early bob checkers arose dressed himself and slipped over to the sleeping boys side making certain that nobody was watching him the fellow began a rapid search of nats clothing and afterwards of the lads person soon he came in contact with a small roll of bills which nat in the belief that they would be quite secure had placed in a pocket of his shirt a thrill of delight shot through the fellow as his hand touched them dis is de best yet he murmured to himself and placing the bills in his own pocket he left the lodging house almost on a run chapter vii an adventure at niagara falls when nat awoke it was so late that he leaped up and dressed with all possible speed ive got to get a hustle on me if i mean to do anything he told himself it wont do to dream away one day after another he was anxious to get to new york to try his luck but being so close to niagara falls he decided to run up to that great wonder and look at it before striking out for the metropolis he had some loose change in his pocket and did not immediately miss the roll of bills which the sneak thief had so cleverly abstracted from his person leaving the lodging house he looked up a cheap restaurant where he obtained a cup of coffee and some rolls for ten cents then seeing a car marked niagara falls he jumped on board do you go to the falls he asked of the conductor certainly trolley riding was new to him and he thoroughly enjoyed the trip which lasted the best part of two hours the car landed him on the main street of niagara falls and he was told that the falls themselves were just beyond the public park listening he could readily hear the thunder of the waters a thunder that goes on day and night and has for ages feeling dry he treated himself to a glass of soda and then asked permission to leave his bundle in the shop where he made the purchase all right said the proprietor leave it there with your name on it and nat did as requested he was soon down in the public park and then went out on goat island the great falls were a revelation to him just as they are to all visitors and he remained for a long time in one spot gazing first at the american falls and then at the horseshoe or canadian falls what an awful mass of water was his thought how grand how very grand from goat island nat walked over to the three sisters on the last of the three sisters he sat down on a great rock to look at the rushing and swirling rapids a sight which to many is as grand as that of the falls themselves no boat could ever live in that river he thought and he was right sitting on a rock he got to thinking of his financial affairs and felt in his clothing for his bills to count them over when he realized that the money was gone a sudden cold sweat came out on his brow he looked around him and gave a groan i must have dropped the bills somewhere he muttered but where never once did he imagine that he had been robbed and it may be added here he never learned the truth to look for the money would have been a hopeless task and nat did not attempt it having gazed around on the rocks he sat down to review the situation just twentytwo cents left he mused as he counted over his change that wont do more than buy a dinner and what am i to do after it is gone what a fool i was not to take care of my money im a regular greeny after all nat was greatly depressed in spirits and he gave a sigh that seemed to come from his very soul then gazing up once more he gave a quick cry of alarm a fashionably dressed young man had appeared before him wearing a buttonhole bouquet and light tan gloves the fellow had a wild look in his eyes and was on the point of throwing himself headlong into the swiftly flowing rapids dont screamed nat and with one mighty leap he caught the fashionably dressed young man by the arm and forcibly hauled him backwards let let me go was the frightened return i i let me go you shant throw yourself in the rapids said nat he held the young man tightly its death to do that dont you know it yes i know it was the unsteady answer then of a sudden the young man sank down in a heap on the rocks great heavens what a narrow escape he was close to fainting and nat supported him until he appeared to grow calmer the wild look left his eyes and they filled instead with tears i i was going to to he did not finish you you saved me you mustnt do anything like that said nat its awful to even think about it but i havent got anything to live for was the jerkedout answer oh yes you have and nat glanced at the welldressed fellow with his gold watch and chain and his large diamond stud youre not poor like i am are you poor am i wouldnt you think a fellow with only twentytwo cents was poor is that all you have yes i had some bank bills but i lost them twentytwo cents is all ive got but i wasnt going to commit suicide on that account the fashionably dressed young man gave a shiver dont mention it he whispered i must have been clean crazy for the minute let us go away from the river and the falls im willing answered nat and walked from the islands to the shore park here they seated themselves on a bench some distance away from the water what is your name if i may ask nat nason whats yours paul hampton so youve only got twentytwo cents to your name well you are worse off than i am after all ive got money aplenty what made you dream of doing such a thing asked nat curiously would you like to hear my story well it wont do any harm to tell it to you an utter stranger and it will relieve my mind maybe you can give me some advice if i can i certainly will answered nat promptly well to start with began paul hampton i am a graduate of yale university and a lawyer by profession i suppose you dont think i look much like a lawyer i dont know much about lawyers answered nat cautiously i practice in niagara falls and also in buffalo i have not paid as much attention to the profession in the past as i intend to pay in the future maybe you dont need the money that is one reason but there is another nat i fell desperately in love the fever is at an end now you drove it out of me when you stopped me from jumping into the rapids paul hampton paused long enough to light a cigar then he leaned back and blew a cloud of smoke into the air i was a big fool i can realize it now he went on i should have passed grace by long ago was that the name of the girl yes her father is welltodo and gives her everything her heart desires consequently she has been leading me around like a puppy dog tied to a string i see that is not very pleasant i thought i loved her but i fancy now that i was too good for her continued the fashionably dressed young man but let me tell you the whole story i called on grace for over a month and finally told her that i loved her she said she thought her father would never consent to our marriage then i asked her if she was willing to elope with me i believe that angered her but she didnt show it she said she would think it over and the next day sent a note saying she would be ready any time i fixed oh what a fool i was to believe her and she wouldnt elope asked nat it was arranged that she should be in readiness the next morning at four oclock and that i should procure a carriage and call for her we would drive to a minister in the next town and be married and then ask her fathers forgiveness and she backed out the morning dawned dark and misty i had obtained from a livery stable the night before a carriage with a span of horses at halfpast three i drove within a few yards of the house when according to agreement i saw a white handkerchief waving from a window very soon grace made her appearance at the door she was heavily cloaked and veiled and refused to speak while i hurried her into the carriage off we went at a trot towards the next town we drew up at the door of the leading minister of the place and i tried to assist my companion to alight from the carriage when she fell and hurt her ankle on the curb well that was too bad said nat sympathetically i asked her if she was hurt when to my amazement she broke out into a rich irish brogue its almost kilt i am said she was she irish irish no it was not grace at all but her cook she had put up a cruel joke on me and that wasnt the worst of it grace had told biddy that i was in love with her and the ignorant cook believed it and what did you do then what could i do i told biddy it was a trick and i had to give her ten dollars to keep from making a complaint to the police wasnt it dreadful yes it was but if i were you mr hampton id consider myself lucky to get rid of such a girl supposing she had married you you would most likely be miserable all your life with her at these words paul hampton stared at nat you are right he answered presently i was a big fool after this i shall drop her entirely and stick to my law business perhaps some day shell be sorry she treated you so unfairly when she sees how you are rising in your profession hope she does but i dont want any more to do with her went on paul hampton decidedly let us talk about something else he added after a pause did you tell me you were worth only twentytwo cents i did do your folks live around here my parents are dead oh well i want to reward you for what you did for me i dont ask any reward nevertheless you must accept something answered the fashionably dressed young man chapter viii a fresh start in life nat and his newlyfound friend sat in the niagara falls park until nearly one oclock talking their affairs over then paul hampton asked the boy to go with him for dinner i want to prove to you that i am not as crazy as i seemed said the young man that was a sudden fit thats all well take my advice and dont get any more such fits answered our hero paul hampton led the way to one of the leading hotels of the town and showed nat where he could wash and brush up before dining then the two entered the dining hall and the youth was treated to the finest spread he had ever tasted i didnt expect this mr hampton said he when the repast was over oh that is not much do you smoke no sir i am glad to hear it i think i smoke too much now to get to business where are you going to from here i am going to try my luck in new york if i can manage to get there i see well ill buy you a railroad ticket how does that strike you you are very kind when do you want to start i am not particular then supposing you make it tomorrow morning you can spend the balance of the day and the night with me i want to do something more for you nat demurred but the young man would not listen and in the end our hero agreed to remain in niagara falls until the next morning a railroad ticket was purchased and handed to the boy and with it paul hampton passed over a fivedollar bill that is for running expenses he said no dont try to refuse it or i shall be angry with you as nats shoes were worn the young man insisted upon purchasing another pair and then purchased the boy some collars and a necktie and also a new hat there now you are fixed to go to new york said he and i wish you the best of luck when you get there thank you very much if you have time write to me and let me know how you are making out i will the night was spent in a hotel close to the railroad station and early in the morning paul hampton saw nat on the train all of the boys possessions had been put in a neat dresssuit case also a present from the young man here is a letter i want you to read after you are well on your way said paul hampton on parting and he handed the missive over be careful of it for i think it contains some advice that will do you good thank you ill take care of it and give it a good reading answered nat and in a moment more the train started and the long journey to new york city was begun our hero sank back in his seat with a good deal of satisfaction his passage was paid through and he had exactly four dollars and seventyfive cents in his pocket i ought to get something to do before i spend that amount he told himself of course its not as much as if i had that roll of bills i lost but there is no use in crying over spilt milk the run down to buffalo was quickly made and then the train started on its long journey to albany and the great metropolis after looking out of the window for a while our hero took the letter paul hampton had given him from his pocket and opened it inside was another envelope also sealed and a bit of paper on which was written my dear friend do not be discouraged no matter what happens when you arrive in new york try your best to get some good position if you run short of funds inside of the next two months open the envelope enclosed with this it contains something that will help you on your way do not lose the envelope ever your friend paul hampton thats certainly an odd letter thought nat as he read it over a second time wonder what that other envelope contains his curiosity was great but he was a thoroughly conscientious lad and after a while he put the sealed envelope in an inside pocket and pinned it there so that it might not drop out he was a curious fellow and this is one of his odd ways of doing things he reasoned well the envelope will give me some hope if nothing else nat had a map of the route in his possession and he spent nearly the whole day in watching the towns and villages through which the train passed at albany came a long wait and he walked out on the platform to stretch his legs then the train went on its way down the shore of the hudson river and about nine oclock in the evening rolled into the grand central depot at fortysecond street new york city the great station was a revelation to nat and when he got out on the street the lines of cabs cars and elevated trains made him stop short in utter bewilderment this is ten times worse than cleveland or buffalo was his comment what a racket on all sides i wonder where all these folks are going cab coupй bawled a line of hackmen standing near carry your baggage came from a boy and he caught hold of nats dresssuit case here let go of that cried our hero and shoved the boy to one side carry it for you anywhere you want to go went on the street urchin i can carry it myself after a struggle nat found himself out of the crowd and on a distant street corner it was late but the many street and shop lights made the scene almost as bright as day he did not know where to go and so continued to walk along until he came to sixth avenue here he came to another halt there is no sense in my walking myself to death tonight he thought i had better wait till morning for that when i go in search of a job at that moment a boy of almost his own age stepped up to him with a bundle of newspapers under his arm sporting extra he asked holding out two evening papers all the latest baseball and racing news i dont want any paper answered nat but i wish youd do me a favor what do you want demanded the other boy promptly i want to find a cheap but good boarding house do you know of any around here the new york boy looked nat over critically the examination brief as it was appeared to satisfy him just come to the city yes looking for work yes how much do you want to pay for board not any more than i have to answered nat with a grin im not rich i see well mother takes boarders it might be she would take you for how much four or five dollars a week oh i cant pay that much why where i come from you can get good board for three dollars a week thats the country aint it yes well new york city aint the country you have to pay more for things here i suppose that is true come on over and talk to mother whats your handle mine is dick talcott nat nason i am glad to know you and our hero shook hands which made the newsboy grin all over with his papers under his arm dick talcott hurried down a side street and around a corner he stopped in front of a fourstory brick house we live on the third floor said he come on up and he led the way up the somewhat narrow stairs it was pitchdark and nat kept close behind so as not to run into anything mother here is a boy who wants board announced dick as he threw open a door then the pair entered a living room where a middleaged woman sat by a table mending some underwear the woman arose and came forward and nat saw that she was rather pleasant looking she was a widow her husband having died only the year previous so you wish board she said i will show you what rooms i have he dont want to pay much mother put in the son hes just arrived in new york from the country and he wants work i can let you have a small hall room with breakfast and supper for three dollars and a half said mrs talcott that is the best i can do of course youll want to take lunch along to your work unless you get work near here where do you come from ohio is that so the late mr talcott came from ohio i think i had better take the room at least for a week said nat the manner of the lady pleased him she was evidently poor but of good breeding very well do you want the room tonight yes have you had supper yes i had a bite on the train very well ill get the room ready for you and ill go out and finish selling my papers said dick talcott and ran out of the room and down the stairs two steps at a time chapter ix first days in new york having paid for his room for one week in advance nat sat down to talk to mrs talcott he found her a very pleasant woman whose experiences in life had been much varied dick is the only person left to me said she he had both a brother and a sister but they died when they were young does he sell papers every day oh yes and he has a morning route besides which he carries for a stationer on the avenue i suppose he makes quite some money doesnt he excuse me for asking but you know ive got to make my living too the route pays him a dollar and a quarter a week and he makes three or four dollars besides well five dollars a week is better than nothing the stationer says he will give dick a place this fall that will pay six or seven dollars a week i wish i had a job at six or seven dollars a week have you anything in view not a thing i am going out in the morning to look for work you may find it very hard to get an opening oh i guess i can find something answered nat confidently i trust you are not disappointed so many come in from the country and find it impossible to get an opening i wish i had a map of new york city i could study it and locate the streets i have such a map was the answer and the lady brought it forth i will put it on the table just as it should be this is east and this is west and here is where this house is located and here is the grand central depot now you can do your best to fix the rest of it in your head nat pored over the map for a good hour and during that time located broadway and a number of other important thoroughfares its certainly a tremendously big city said he one could get lost without half trying you can carry that map around this week if you wish said mrs talcott it may help you a great deal nat went to bed with his head in something of a whirl from the long train ride and from studying the map it was a long while ere he could close his eyes in sleep im up against it now he mused its sink or swim and nothing else he resolved to arise early and as soon as he heard dick talcott get up he dressed and went into the dining room to meet the newsboy hullo how did you sleep asked dick fairly good considering are you going out on your route now yes i want to buy some papers that have advertisements of help wanted in them which are the best papers dick named them you neednt buy them unless you wish ill let you look over my bunch if you want to come with me thank you dick the two procured a hasty breakfast and set out and soon the newsboy had his package of morning newspapers he showed nat where to look for the advertisements and our hero sat down on a stoop while dick ran his route well did you find anything worth looking up asked the newsboy on returning a dozen or more cried nat gleefully it will be an easy matter to get work im thinking at this the new york boy grinned broadly dont you fool yourself nat but here are the advertisements yes and a hundred young fellows after every one at this nats face fell you are sure of this go on and find out for yourself a good job isnt open more than an hour in this city then id better hurry along nat had written down about a dozen addresses on a slip of paper and the newsboy showed him how he could get around from one place to the next with the least walking nat started off at a swift gait dick watched him out of sight with a thoughtful expression on his face that boy means well he murmured but he has got a whole lot to learn the distance to the first place on nats list was almost half a mile it was a shirt factory where an assistant packer was desired at eight dollars per week arriving there nat found about twenty young men and boys assembled waiting to get into the office dick was right a place here doesnt go begging long thought the boy from the country it was some time before nat could get into the office he faced a tall sharpeyed man who was in his shirt sleeves want the job eh said the man had any experience as a packer no sir but cant use you next nat stared at the man in bewilderment wont you please try no the man shook his head vigorously next and our hero was elbowed toward the door by some others who wanted the position in a moment more he found himself on the street again well of all the mean men he began and stopped short all right he can keep his job ill try the next place the next was in a hat store and the place was filled then came a clothing establishment a hardware store and a wholesale rubber factory at none of these places was he wanted by this time it was nearly noon and he was getting just a little discouraged its going to be uphill work thats certain he told himself with a sigh the next place he visited was a seed store here a very elderly man came forward to greet him so you want a place said he slowly have you had any experience as an errand boy no sir but i am willing to learn so they all say but many boys dont seem to learn very fast you look like a country lad and the elderly man peered at nat closely through his spectacles i am a country boy but if youll give me a chance ill do my best we cant pay you very much at the start how much two dollars and a half a week i cant live on that ive got to pay my board the elderly man shrugged his shoulders guess you had better look elsewhere then couldnt you pay me a little more i am willing to work hard well we might give you three dollars a week after the first month but that is our limit for an errand boy i cant take it answered nat ive got to earn more and after a little additional talking he left the seed store he had a lunch in a bit of newspaper and as it was nearly one oclock he sat down on a box on the sidewalk and ate it washing it down with a drink of water from a cooler in a railroad ticket office then he went on his way once more but at sundown had to give it up he was so tired and his feet were so sore from the pavements that he could scarcely walk to his boarding house i trust you found something said mrs talcott as he entered no he answered soberly i could have had one position but it only paid two dollars and a half a week so i didnt take it i am sorry i shall go out tomorrow again i am bound to strike something sooner or later being tremendously hungry nat ate the supper provided with a relish there were two other boarders girls who worked in a large department store and they were quite interested in him you might get work at our place said one of the girls they advertised today for wrappers yes but they want experienced wrappers said the other girl ill try them anyway said nat and i am much obliged to you for telling me about it he added on the following morning he was up as before and got the list from the papers again fortune was now with him and at noon he found a position in a wholesale paper house one of the clerks was going to visit some relatives down south and nat was hired to fill his place at seven dollars per week youve struck luck cried dick talcott on hearing the news i hope the job lasts so do i answered nat but even if it doesnt it is better than nothing nat went to work the next day he found his duties rather simple and wondered how the firm could afford to pay him seven dollars for the little he was called on to do everybody treated him nicely and he considered himself lucky to have made the connection with the firm chapter x out of work once more during the time that he worked in the wholesale paper establishment nat wrote a long letter to sam price telling his friend of his adventures since leaving home and asking for news from the farm a few days later an answer came back which ran as follows i got your letter and found it very interesting i hope you make your fortune in the city its certainly a fine place to go to and maybe ill try it myself some day country life is awful slow and work is mighty hard i have been hoeing corn today till my back aches ready to fall apart your uncle was awful mad to think you had run away and madder still when he found you had sold the cow he thought you were hiding in cleveland and he stayed in that city three days before he gave up the search he claims that the cow belonged to him that he took it for board and clothing for you and he also sticks to it that you tried to burn down his barn he says he is going to make it hot for you if he ever finds you you can make sure i shant tell him where you are nat read the letter with keen interest not once but several times and shook his head slowly over the communication i suppose uncle abner will always think i set fire to the barn he thought wish i could catch the person who really did do it must have been some tramp who was sleeping there and using a pipe at the end of the third weeks work nat had seven dollars saved of which amount he was reasonably proud but now came a setback for which he was not prepared we have sold this concern to another party said one of the proprietors to him after saturday your services will be no longer required wont the new bosses need me no for they have all the help of their own that they can use only our head bookkeeper will remain this was on thursday and during the balance of the week our hero looked around in his spare hours for another position but without success monday morning found him doing nothing as you said it is not so easy to get a hold said he to dick still i dont feel quite so green as when i first reached new york i at least know something about the streets and the stores nat lost no time in looking for another place but nothing turned up monday or tuesday and wednesday it rained so hard that he did not go out until after noon then he visited a fashionable wholesale jewelry establishment here he was asked to wait while one of the proprietors interviewed a young man who had come in ahead of our hero the young man was dressed as a perfect dude with a light checked suit and very light gloves he spoke with a drawl and nat heard every word that he said what is your business sir asked the jeweler i believe sir said the young gentleman that you advertised for a aw a secretary a clerk yes sir aw all the same well sir aw if we can agree upon terms i should be aw flattered to proffer my services ah indeed and the jeweler raised his eyebrows slightly yes sir you will be pleased to learn that all my connections aw move in the first circles undoubtedly that is very gratifying but you mentioned terms may i ask you what you expect well sir perhaps a couple of thousand or so a year then i should wish to make certain stipulations aw as to the time im employed go on for example i never aw get up very early i think it injures the health but i think i could manage to get to the office by ten in the morning i see then i should want aw to have saturday afternoons to myself both in winter and summer i always go to the theater matinйes so many aw pretty girls there continued the dude and what else i should not want to work later than five in the afternoon excessive labor is injurious to the health perhaps that is true then i should aw wish it understood that i could have five or six weeks off in the summer so that i can visit the springs or the seashore continued the dude is that satisfactory i suppose it would be to you answered the jeweler i think so it wouldnt satisfy us at all really that is too bad we want a man here who can work and who is not afraid of long hours and who doesnt set quite such a high figure on his services youll never fill the bill in the wide world goodday really murmured the dude and after staring at the jeweler he turned on his heel and left in utter disgust several who had overheard the interview laughed outright what a perfect fool thought nat i wonder if anybody will ever give him anything to do what can i do for you young man asked the jeweler turning to the boy i am looking for work sir are your expectations as high as those of the chap who just left no sir i am willing to work hard and i am not afraid of long hours then you are not a dude no sir do i look like one you look like a country lad i came from the country about a month ago ive been working for trumbull davison the paper dealers but they have sold out to another firm and dont need me any longer i see well i am sorry for you for you look bright and honest but i need somebody with experience in the jewelry line then you havent any place that i can fill no i but hold on ill tell you what i might do do you know anything about horses yes sir and about a garden yes sir i was brought up on a farm i need a man around my country home in new jersey i might try you there at twelve dollars a month and your board again nats face fell thank you but i want to get something to do in the city said he i am tired of farm life then i cant give you anything and the jeweler turned away during the remainder of the day nat visited several other stores and offices but everywhere he received the same answer that he was too late and the position advertised was already filled perhaps i did wrong not to take that position over in new jersey he thought on his way to his boarding house but i dont want to go back to farm work if i can help it two additional days passed and still nat found nothing to do although he tramped from fortysecond street clear down to the battery several times then he obtained a job which lasted three days and paid him but two dollars this isnt earning a living he reasoned unless i do better ill have to try selling papers or blacking boots one morning he did try selling papers under the tutorship of dick but the effort was not a success by noon he had earned exactly nineteen cents and had sixteen papers still on hand i guess you wasnt cut out for a newsboy said dick frankly what you want to do is to get a steady job in a store or office yes but the jobs are mighty scarce answered nat a week passed and the country boy could find nothing more to do that was steady one day he helped a man distribute bills and on another occasion he carried out packages for a florist and the two jobs brought him in just a dollar by this time the soles were worn from his shoes and he had to have them mended making ones way in the city isnt so easy after all he thought one night as he sat in his little room on the edge of the bed he had been counting up his money and found that he had but a little over four dollars left ill have to give mrs talcott three and a half of that he continued and that will leave me sixtyfive cents ive got to hustle or ill be high and dry by next week nat hustled all of the next week but without results in one store the proprietor was unusually harsh to him and he came back to mrs talcotts house more downcast than ever i guess they dont want me in new york after all he mused if i cant get something to do i cant stay here for mrs talcott cant afford to keep me ill have to starve he was so disheartened that he did not feel like eating immediately after the meal he went to his little room then of a sudden he thought of the letter paul hampton had given him i may as well open that he reasoned goodness knows i am short enough of funds and pretty well discouraged too the letter was in his pocket still pinned fast and he brought it forth and gazed at it speculatively it would be just like him to put a fivedollar bill in it he thought with his penknife he slit the envelope open and looked inside it contained a slip of paper and another slip of a green color a bill as sure as im in this room he ejaculated i dont suppose its less than a five and maybe its a ten if he well i declare nat rushed to the window to look at the bill and then with a gasp he sank back on the only chair which the little bedroom contained he could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses the bank bill was one for a hundred dollars chapter xi what a hundred dollars did nat continued to gaze at the bill like one in a dream he had never seen a greenback that was worth a hundred dollars before but he had no doubt of its genuineness a hundred dollars he repeated several times why its a small fortune then he began to wonder if paul hampton had not made a mistake and turned to the slip of paper upon which he found written i give you this hundred dollars for what you did for me at niagara falls dont be discouraged if you ever need a friend write or come and see me i sincerely hope the money will bring you good fortune what a kind man murmured nat and read the note again it was a mighty lucky thing for me that i went to the falls when he went to bed he felt rich and he came to the breakfast table whistling merrily hullo cried dick have you struck luck at last im in luck in one way answered our hero look at that and he showed the bank bill why its a hundred dollars nat and the newsboys eyes opened widely exactly where on earth did you get the money a gentleman gave it to me what for for saving his life but i didnt know i had it until i went to bed last night youre talking in riddles ill explain and then our hero told as much of the niagara falls episode as he deemed necessary here is the note he concluded showing the slip of paper which was unsigned i dont feel at liberty to mention the gentlemans name i dont think it would be just right a rich man like that would be a fool to commit suicide said dick bluntly what are you going to do with all that money i dont know but i shant squander it i can tell you that you can go into business for yourself on that amount maybe but i guess i had better keep on hunting for a job i can go into business for myself when i know more about new york thats where you are sensible you might lose your money in doublequick time in your own business nat put the bill away very carefully and then went out to look for a position as before but the week passed and nothing turned up on sunday the country boy attended a church in the vicinity of his boarding house and in the afternoon he took a walk to central park in the evening he stayed at home and read a paper which dick brought in as was natural nat read over the want advertisements very carefully it was not long before he came to one which excited his curiosity the advertisement was as follows wanted a clerk to whom a liberal salary will be paid one preferred who comes from the country and is not too old references expected must deposit as security for which interest will be paid inquire room dallax building broadway that ought to strike me mused nat as he laid down the paper just the thing and no mistake ill go and see about it our hero had acquired sufficient knowledge of new york to find the place indicated in the advertisement without much trouble it was a fourstory stone building and he walked up two flights of stairs until he reached room on the door was the sign hamilton dart brokerage and commissions entering the office he found it plainly but neatly furnished with two desks and several chairs in front of one of the desks sat a middleaged man well dressed and smoking a cigar is this mr dart questioned nat taking off his hat that is my name responded hamilton dart with a keen glance at our hero did you advertise for a clerk i saw an advertisement oh yes interrupted the man pray be seated and he motioned to one of the chairs you came to see about the place did you yes sir you advertised that you would like somebody from the country and that hits me you came from the country to try your luck yes sir i got tired of the farm hamilton dart smiled goodnaturedly and blew a cloud of smoke toward the ceiling of his office i dont blame you i got tired of the farm myself when i was about your age and came here with less than a hundred dollars in my pocket well i came with just a little more than that answered nat innocently indeed then you are better off than i was but i shant complain for i have made money right along but what do you think i am worth now i dont know i am sure five or ten thousand dollars maybe nearly fifty thousand dollars and hamilton dart looked at nat coolly and innocently fifty thousand cried the boy youve certainly been lucky i wish i could make that much you have the same opportunities that i had let me see what did you say your name was i didnt say it is nat nason i am glad to know you you have a bright and honest face and faces count a good deal with me this was gratifying to nat and he could not help but think that mr dart was a pleasant gentleman with whom to deal i advertised for a country young man because i was that myself once and i like to help country young men along continued hamilton dart you are out of work at present yes sir i worked for a firm but they sold out to another firm i see have you any recommendations not that they are strictly necessary from one who looks so honest i can refer you to the firm i worked for that will be satisfactory although i dont mind telling you that i am very particular in the selection of my clerks so far i have rejected seventeen who applied i should try my best to do what was right answered nat modestly that is the way i like to hear a person talk then you will take me we havent agreed on terms yet what do you expect in the way of salary i guess ill leave that to you answered nat after some hesitation what did you get at your last place seven dollars a week humph your employer was not very liberal a clerk that is worth anything to me is worth ten dollars a week at least the mentioning of ten dollars made nats heart jump if youll pay me ten dollars a week mr dart ill do my level best to earn it do you write a fair hand here is my handwriting answered the boy and wrote his name on a piece of paper that is quite good for a boy i think you will improve by practice here you will have quite some writing to do and bills to sort out but the work will not be difficult for the summer is our dull season i see by the way i suppose you know i require a deposit of one hundred dollars from each of my clerks went on hamilton dart with assumed carelessness sometimes my clerks have quite some money to handle for me i can make that deposit answered nat will i get a receipt for it to be sure and i will also pay you six per cent interest on the money you can have it back whenever you leave my service when can you make the deposit right now if you say so very well ill make out the receipt hamilton dart wrote out a receipt for a hundred dollars and signed his name with a flourish he passed it to nat and the boy handed him the hundreddollar bill you dont believe in carrying small bills said the man with an assumed smile that is the only big bill i ever owned was the answer hamilton dart pocketed the bill and looked out of the window as if in deep thought i was thinking you might go to work today but perhaps it will be as well to go to work tomorrow he said after a pause come at nine oclock sharp i will sir then that is all for the present i am sure we will get along very well together tomorrow another clerk will be here to help you along hamilton dart turned to his desk and began to write feeling himself dismissed nat said goodmorning and bowed himself out the man listened to his footsteps as he descended the stairs and then gave a low chuckle that was easy nick he muttered two so far i wonder how many more fools ill catch before the game plays out chapter xii on the brooklyn bridge well ive struck luck again said nat when he arrived at his boarding place and met dick talcott got a job questioned the newsboy yes i hope youre going to get pretty good wages ten dollars per week answered nat with just a trace of pride in his voice ten dollars that is luck what at im in a brokers office and im to do writing and sorting out bills where is the place down on broadway im glad to hear of this nat said the newsboy wish i could strike something like that perhaps you will some day dick the trouble is i cant write very well i never had much schooling if you wish ill teach you how to write it always came easy to me will you teach me ill do my best to learn we can go at it nights early on the following morning nat presented himself at the office on broadway he had shined his shoes and brushed his clothes and presented a very neat appearance he found hamilton dart at his desk and smoking as before i wish you to go to the post office for me said the man as soon as he entered go to the general delivery window and ask for letters for samuel barrows that is my sick brotherinlaw who is visiting me from michigan yes sir of course you know where the post office is oh yes ive been past there several times you neednt be in a hurry wait until they sort the elevenoclock mail yes sir the distance to the post office was a considerable one but nat was a good walker and found it was only halfpast nine when he got there to while away the time he determined to walk out on the brooklyn bridge and take in the sights from that elevated structure making his way through the crowd on park row he was soon out on the bridge and walking in the direction of brooklyn there was a stiff breeze blowing and several times his hat was almost lifted from his head suddenly he heard a shout and saw a stout man running wildly after some papers which the wind was carrying along the walk on the bridge the man secured one of the papers but two others were fast blowing beyond his reach when nat rushed up and secured them just as they were on the point of being carried into the river have you got them puffed the man as nat came towards him yes sir here you are and nat held out the papers good i was afraid they were lost to me and the stranger heaved a heavy sigh of relief were they valuable asked our hero curiously quite so they are the legal documents in an important real estate case now before the courts it was very kind of you to pick them up for me oh it wasnt so much to do answered nat nevertheless i am much obliged added the stout man warmly i shouldnt have come out on the bridge with them but i love to get the breeze i think it does me good much obliged and then he passed on i guess hes a lawyer or a real estate dealer thought nat well he ought to walk it may take some of the fat off of him nat walked halfway to brooklyn and then back again shortly after eleven oclock he presented himself at the proper window of the post office has the eleven oclock mail been sorted yet he asked certainly have you any letters for samuel barrows the clerk looked through one of the boxes beside him nothing he answered briefly nothing at all the post office clerk shook his head seeing this nat walked away and started back for the office he did not suspect that his employer had sent him to the post office merely to get him out of the office yet such was the fact hamilton dart had no brotherinlaw named samuel barrows as a matter of fact hamilton dart that was not his real name but let us use it for the present nevertheless was nothing but a swindler he was worth only a few hundred dollars and his brokerage and commission business was such in name only while nat was on his post office errand hamilton dart had two other callers the first was a bright young man hailing from newark new jersey i am sure you will suit me said hamilton dart after questioning the young man i am very much pleased with your appearance thank you was the brief answer you may go to work tomorrow at twelve dollars per week will that suit yes sir you will of course put up one hundred dollars as security added the assumed broker what security will you give demanded the bright young man from newark oh ill give you my personal note answered hamilton dart carelessly well ill think it over eh i thought you wanted to accept on the spot demanded the swindler no sir answered the young man he intended to make some inquiries into hamilton darts financial standing before investing his cash ill come around again tomorrow morning i shall give the place to somebody else before that time was the cold response if you do ill be out of it was the equally cold answer of the young jerseyman and he walked out of the office one fish i didnt land muttered hamilton dart to himself better luck next time hardly had the young man left than a sicklylooking middleaged man appeared he had been in the hospital for two months and out of work for twice that length of time you advertised for a clerk he said sitting down on a chair yes i am a bookkeeper and an allround office man added the sick man i am willing to work hard for low wages i am always willing to pay good wages to the right man answered hamilton dart smoothly at this the face of the sick man brightened i have been sick he went on apologetically but i am getting stronger every day well the work here is not very hard what could you pay me twelve dollars per week that would suit me nicely then you can come to work tomorrow but you will have to put up one hundred dollars as security on that i will allow you six per cent interest at this announcement the face of the sick man fell i am very sorry sir but i havent the money my sickness has reduced me almost to my last dollar then i cant hire you said hamilton dart harshly i can give you some excellent references sir no i dont care for references my clerks have to furnish cash security i employ no others you had better see if you cant raise the money i dont know how i can do it havent you any friends or relatives i have a sister in brooklyn she might possibly loan the amount then you had better see her i will keep the place open for you for a couple of days the sick man pleaded to be taken on but hamilton dart was obdurate and at last the visitor left the office hang the luck he must take me for a charity association muttered the swindler two lost this business isnt paying as well as i hoped it would when nat came back he was somewhat tired from his long tramp he asked his employer what he should do next go and get your lunch and be back in an hour was the answer hardly had nat left the office than a young fellow named harry bray appeared he had been in to see hamilton dart before and carried a hundred dollars in his vest pocket i will take the position he said and handed over his money which the swindler pocketed with alacrity when shall i go to work asked harry bray after lunch you will have another new clerk to help you a fellow named nat nason answered hamilton dart chapter xiii a swindle exposed when nat came back from lunch he was introduced to harry bray and hamilton dart brought forth several packages of old bills and letters and also a couple of cheap blank books i want these things sorted out said he enter all names in the books and file them away according to date this seemed easy work and both of the young clerks said they understood what was wanted then hamilton dart put on his hat and left the office i wont be back this afternoon he said lock up at five oclock and you bray can take the key yes sir answered harry bray this isnt very hard was nats comment when he was left alone with his fellow clerk it is about as easy a job as i ever struck answered harry bray its queer there are no customers coming in said nat an hour later mr dart must do most of his business outside a good many brokers do nat they have to hustle for business or they dont get any the afternoon passed and at the proper time nat left the office and went home youve certainly struck a soft snap said dick when the country boy had related his experience wish i could strike a snap like that perhaps you will some day answered nat come ill give you a lesson in writing and figures tonight and he did dick was a bright scholar so it proved a pleasure more than a task to teach him promptly on time the following morning nat went to the office at the door he met harry bray who had just come in from his home on staten island they opened up the office together one doing the sweeping and the other the dusting in most places like this the office boy or the janitor does such work said harry i dont mind it in the least answered nat oh neither do i they began on their work where they had left off and about an hour later their employer put in an appearance hard at it eh he said cheerily thats the way i like to see things move nat i want you to go to the post office again yes sir in a few minutes our hero had departed and then hamilton dart turned to harry bray bray here is an important document to deliver to a party living near central park said he deliver it and get a receipt i will sir answered harry bray and in a minute more he too was gone an hour later there was a knock on the door and the sick man who had called the day before came in is that situation still open he questioned anxiously why do you ask demanded hamilton dart abruptly i was going to say that i borrowed that money from my sister oh have you it with you yes sir then if you wish the job you can take it right now another man is coming to see me about it in an hour ill take the job said oliver ripple quickly and brought forth his money hamilton dart took it and gave his usual receipt what interest do i get on this asked the new clerk anxiously six per cent thank you i told my sister i thought as much she had the money in the bank but that only paid her three per cent six per cent will be twice as good you may come to work tomorrow morning at nine said hamilton dart ill go to work today if you say so mr dart no my other clerks can take care of the work today both of them are now out on errands when oliver ripple was gone hamilton dart smiled broadly to himself three of them he murmured thats not so bad after all i wonder if that chap who was to come at halfpast ten will show up when nat left the post office he found no letters for samuel barrows mr dart will be disappointed again he thought but it is not my fault the afternoon passed quietly only one man called at the office and when he found hamilton dart was not in he disappeared immediately that evening nat gave dick another lesson for which the newsboy was very grateful no wonder you got that job said dick you can figure like lightning and write fine too i dont have to figure much at the office how do you like your boss i havent really seen enough of him to make up my mind he must be full of business i suppose that is so when nat went to the office on the following day he again met harry bray at the entrance they went upstairs together and found two men standing in the hallway near the door of the office as soon as they entered the place the men followed them neither of these young chaps is the man said one of the newcomers in a low voice where is mr hamilton dart asked the other i cant say sir answered harry bray he may be here shortly are you a partner in this concern no sir i am a clerk are you a clerk too asked the man turning to nat yes sir is there anything we can do for you dont know as there is young man was the short answer well wait here for mr dart a halfhour passed and oliver ripple put in an appearance where is mr dart he asked gazing around he is not here yet answered nat i am his new clerk he engaged me yesterday and told me to come to work this morning at this speech the two men who had come in gazed at the sick man curiously so you were engaged yesterday asked one in a low tone yes excuse me but id like to know if you put up any money as security i did a hundred dollars ah and each of the two men looked at his companion significantly do you know mr dart asked the sick man we know of him he does quite a business doesnt he he does in his own way was the suggestive answer at that moment came a tramping on the stairs then the office door was thrown open and hamilton dart appeared there he is cried one of the men just as i thought he started for the doorway but hamilton dart was too quick for him he backed away leaped for the stairs and went down flight after flight four and five steps at a time both men gave chase but by the time they reached the sidewalk the swindler had disappeared hullo what can this mean cried nat in quick alarm i must say i dont like this those men are after mr dart came from harry bray you mind the office ill see what is up went on nat and followed down the stairs he is gone parsons said one of the men you are sure it was our man yes confound the luck he got away like a slippery eel did mr dart run away from you asked nat thats what he did young man what did he run for perhaps you know as well as i do no i dont how long have you worked for that man only a few days what about that other chap upstairs he came to work about the time i did and that palelooking man too i dont know any more about him than you do did you place any money in your employers hands yes a hundred dollars and harry bray the other clerk put up the same amount humph i reckon youve seen the last of your cash what cried nat aghast do you mean that i sure do but but our hero was so staggered he could not continue for the moment this hamilton dart or whatever he calls himself is a firstclass swindler a swindler nat fell up against the doorway i i then my money is gone more than likely oh what a fool ive been and i thought he was such a gentleman he has fooled lots of folks besides you young man said one of the men kindly for he saw that nat was hard hit he isnt a business man at all he is a confidence man from chicago by this time feeling certain something was wrong harry bray and oliver ripple came below what do you mean by confidence man asked nat doubtfully he is a swindler one of the kind that can tell a good story in order to get your money who is a swindler demanded harry bray our employer cried nat he has run away with our money has mr dart run away asked the sick man nervously yes oh and to think i borrowed that money from my poor sister came with a cry of anguish and then the sick man sank on the hallway stairs thoroughly overcome chapter xiv nat obtains another situation how is it that you know so much about this man asked nat after he had collected his thoughts i am a police official from chicago answered one of the two men who had tried to catch hamilton dart we have been on this rascals trail for some time is hamilton dart his real name no his real name is nick smithers he is a sly rogue do you think there is any chance of catching him asked harry bray i cannot afford to lose my money nor i added our hero i must have my money back groaned the sick man what will my sister say she got it out of the bank only yesterday i wish i could help you said the chicago police official well do what we can all went back to the office and the janitor of the building was called in sure an mr dart has had the office only about a week said the janitor he hasnt paid the rent yet he said he was in the habit of payin in the middle of the month then the owner of this building is out of pocket too said one of the men from the west an examination was made of the desk used by the swindler but nothing of value was found the letters and bills were of no consequence and the blank books were not worth twentyfive cents each let us go to the police station said the men and they went off followed by the sick man this is the worst yet remarked nat as he dropped into the one easy chair of which the office boasted and i thought i was so smart im a regular greeny if ever there was one and he shook his head bitterly im in the same boat responded his fellow victim my father will be pretty mad when he hears of this he lent me the money and i assured him it would be perfectly safe i used my own money but it was almost the last dollar i had said our hero soberly at that moment his heart felt like a lump of lead in his bosom what do you suppose we can do about it im sure i dont know do you know where this hamilton dart alias nick smithers lived no to look for him in a big city like this will be like looking for a needle in a haystack more than likely he wont stay in this city he may be miles away already he didnt want to see those men from chicago they talked the matter over for an hour at the end of which time a detective from headquarters came to interview them the detective took charge of the office and that seemed to be the end of the affair give me your addresses said the detective to nat and his fellow clerk if we hear anything we will let you know and so it was arranged nat felt very much downcast when he arrived at his boarding house that evening mrs talcott was not long in noticing it you seem to be in trouble nat said she kindly for she had taken quite a fancy to the country lad can i help you in any way i dont know he answered bluntly ive gone and made a big fool of myself in what way asked she in astonishment i thought i was smart but im a regular country greeny i let a man swindle me out of nearly every dollar i possessed that is certainly too bad nat how did it happen for answer our hero made a clean breast of the whole matter while he was telling his tale dick came in and he was likewise told and you mean to say that you lost the whole hundred dollars ejaculated the newsboy thats awful nat i wish i could get hold of that nick smithers id id wring his neck for him it wont do any good to look for him i know his kind hes here today and gone tomorrow those chaps work their schemes all over the states nat was in no humor to eat supper and scarcely touched a mouthful mrs talcott and dick did all they could to cheer him up make the best of it said the newsboy youll be sure to strike something good sooner or later i guess im too much of a greeny to do that answered nat that night when our hero went to bed he could not sleep his ready money was running low and how to turn he did not know bitterly he upbraided himself for having trusted nick smithers but this did no good his money was gone and it was doubtful if he would ever see a cent of it again i ought to go back on the farm where i belong he muttered im not smart enough to get along in a city like new york but by morning his thoughts took a turn and at breakfast his eyes were as bright and expectant as ever im going out and get something to do he said firmly and im not going to let anybody get the best of me again do not worry said mrs talcott you can stay here even if you dont get anything right away ill trust you for the board you are very kind answered nat gratefully but i cant stand it to do nothing all of that day he tramped up one street and down another looking for a situation but without success he could have had one job as an errand boy but the wages offered were but two dollars per week i cant take that he said ive got to support myself even if i cant do better on the next day it rained but he went out nevertheless with an umbrella which mrs talcott loaned him he had several advertisements taken from the morning papers and lost no time in applying at first one place and then another the third place offered on his list was in a big office building down near the corner of broadway and park row when nat arrived there he found half a dozen young fellows ahead of him you will all have to wait until mr garwell arrives said a clerk to the crowd i expect him any moment hope he dont keep us too long grumbled one of those who were waiting i dont want to lose the chance of another job if i cant get this you need not wait at all if you dont care to said the clerk two others came in and the outer office was comfortably filled when a stout gentleman walked in quickly and gave a glance around hum said he when his eyes fell upon nat and he looked at our hero more closely nat at once recognized the newcomer as the gentleman he had met on the brooklyn bridge how are you young man said the gentleman very well sir answered nat what are you doing here i came to see about the position that was advertised ah indeed the gentleman gave nat another look come inside yes sir and our hero quickly followed him to an inner office here the gentleman hung up his hat and sank down in an easy chair at a desk take a seat i suppose you remember meeting me this was said with a little smile oh yes sir on the bridge you did me a good turn and ive not forgotten it so you want a job eh whats your name and where are you from nat told him and also told the gentleman some of his experiences since arriving in the metropolis john garwell listened with interest i fancy i can give you an opening said he here write a few lines on this sheet of paper nat did so a very good hand how much do you want to start on enough to support myself mr garwell thats a fair answer can you live on seven dollars a week i can live on less than that some young men want a fortune to start on yesterday a young man called here for an opening he had had no experience yet he wanted not less than twenty dollars a week i guess you didnt engage him said nat with a smile i did not well ill give you a trial at seven dollars a week if you prove satisfactory ill give you eight dollars at the end of three months and ten dollars at the end of the first year thank you very much you can go to work at once mr garwell touched a pushbutton on his desk and a clerk appeared wilson this is the new clerk nat nason you can show him his duties and tell those others that are waiting that the position is filled yes sir wait a minute nason wilson you can go the clerk disappeared closing the door behind him i just wished to say a word about what you did for me the other day oh thats all right here is a fivedollar bill for a reward but i dont want any reward mr garwell it was nice of you to give me the position didnt you just own up that you were short of funds yes sir but thats all right take the money and now let me tell you something as a friend yes sir i like my clerks to look neat and clean at all times it pays to look that way never come down to the office with a dirty collar or with dirty shoes ill remember that i dont ask you to dress in the topmost style or be a dude but keep yourself neat and clean i will sir then that is all if anything doesnt go right in the office dont hesitate to let me know chapter xv abner and the widow guff it was with a light heart that nat went to work for mr john garwell he felt that his employer was a man to be trusted and one who would do the best he could for those under him it was a lucky thing for me that i took that walk on the brooklyn bridge he reasoned perhaps i shouldnt have gotten the job otherwise the clerk wilson proved kind and considerate and under him our hero learned rapidly didnt i tell you that youd strike luck said dick now all youve got to do is to nurse that job carefully and youll be at the top of the firm some day well i am going to nurse it as carefully as i can laughed nat when our hero had time he went to the police headquarters to see if anything had been learned of nick smithers nothing yet said the officer in charge but i think hell be run down sooner or later id like to run him down myself ive no doubt you would nat had been working for mr garwell about a week when he received another letter from sam price sam wrote in part as follows since i sent my last letter there have been great changes at your uncles farm he has discharged the housekeeper and some say he is courting the widow guff for all i know theyll be married pretty soon more than that i heard somebody say that he was thinking of coming to new york to look for you nat read this communication with close attention he knew the widow guff as a person who took boarders in the town where he had sold his cow she had three children and had the reputation of being a rather tart and selfwilled woman i shouldnt think uncle abner would want to marry that widow thought nat wonder what put it into his head and what put it into his head to come to new york to look for me id rather he would keep his distance nat did not know that for the past few months the widow guff had had a hard time of it with a number of her boarders and could scarcely make both ends meet yet such was a fact one day the widow called on a friend and from this friend learned that abner balberry had discharged his housekeeper and was keeping house by himself its a shame for him to be all alone thought the widow and with that nephew of his away too some good woman ought to be keeping house for him the widow had long had her eye on abner balberry whom she knew fairly well she knew abner was welltodo and keeping a boarding house seemed of a sudden a great burden to her wish i could make abner propose she said to herself he just ought to have a wife so the widow kept on thinking and by and by her face brightened she had an idea which she resolved to put into execution the very first opportunity fred said she to her son a tall gawk of a boy i want you to go to mr abner balberrys house and ask him if he will stop in and see me the first time he comes to town wot do yer want ma drawled fred never mind fred just ask him to call say id like a little advice from him fred shuffled off on his errand and found nats uncle down in the henhouse searching for eggs ma wants you to come and see her said the youth wants me to come an see her queried nats uncle yep what for dunno said shed like some advice all right ill come said abner that afternoon after milking he arrayed himself in his best and drove over to the widows boarding house he was glad to make the visit for since discharging his housekeeper he had found life on the farm rather lonely the widow greeted him warmly and asked him into her parlor closing the doors so that nobody might interrupt them she seemed somewhat embarrassed fred told me that you would like to see me commenced nats uncle yes abner i do but im afraid youll think it strange of me at least of what i have to say to you oh thats all right lucy you know you kin trust me he replied suppose the widow cast down her eyes mind i am only supposing a case suppose a person should find a pot full of gold pieces in an old well would the law have a right to touch it or would it belong to the finder at the mention of a pot of gold abner balberry became exceedingly interested as we know he was very miserly and he realized that a pot of gold would be worth a good deal of money a pot of gold lucy he said why unquestionably the law would have nothing to do with it could the one who had owned the house years before or lived in the place come forward and claim it no lucy i think not thank you very much abner for your advice the er question just came into my er mind and i wanted to satisfy myself thats all certainly widow certainly answered nats uncle he wanted to ask some questions but did not dare now you are here you must take supper with me went on the widow guff thank you lucy you are very kind i know you havent any housekeeper any more and nobody to cook for you yes stay by all means the widow was a fairly good cook and nats uncle ate with a relish all that was offered to him ending with a piece of berry pie which was particularly fine he spent a social hour after the meal and then drove home in a thoughtful mood is it possible that the widow really found a pot of gold in the well he thought she didnt really say so but it was mighty odd for her to ask me such questions ill have to look into this a bit and then he got to thinking that the widow was not such a badlooking woman after all and a wife with a pot of gold would be a very nice thing to possess about a week later abner balberry had occasion to go to town to draw a little money from the bank with which to pay for a cow he had purchased he was passing the widows home when she came out on the piazza and nodded to him goodmorning she said goodmorning he returned and stopped for a chat during the course of the conversation he mentioned his errand and she said she was going to the bank too he asked her to ride to the institution and she accepted the invitation when they arrived there he told her he would wait until she was through then he went around to a side window of the bank where he might hear what took place the widow tripped up to the window can you give me change for a tendollar gold piece she asked with pleasure mrs guff was the answer and the change for the gold piece was immediately forthcoming by the way went on the widow the bank is in quite a flourishing condition is it not we are doing finely yes and you receive deposits do you not of course do you receive as high as as five thousand dollars no answered the cashier in some surprise three thousand dollars from one depositor is our limit do you know of anybody who its of no consequence interrupted the widow hurriedly i only asked out of curiosity how much interest do you pay four per cent on the first thousand and three per cent on the remainder thank you and much obliged for the change goodmorning and the widow guff tripped out lightly and hurried up the street abner balberry had overheard every word and his face was a study as he went into the bank to draw what he wanted thirty dollars jest had the widow guff here didnt you he said lightly yes mr balberry the cashier paused do you know if anybody has left her money lately he continued not that i know on why oh she was asking what rate of interest we paid and if we took as high as five thousand dollars i see well i dont know nothin about it and abner balberry pocketed his money and his bank book and walked out after the widow if he had been in deep thought before he was more so now was it possible that the widow had found five thousand dollars she changed a tendollar piece he reasoned i reckon i kin see through a millstone when theres a hole through it tell ye what a widder with five thousand in gold aint to be sneezed at i wonder if anybody else knows o this hope they dont that evening the farmer sat up till late thinking the situation over he did not wish for a wife so much but he did wish to get his hands on that pot of gold if i want her ill have to propose before some other feller hears o this he told himself the farmer made it his business to go to town two days later and drove past the widows house very slowly she saw him from a window and nodded and smiled this was encouraging and on returning from his errand he tied up in front of the place and rang the bell oh abner i am delighted to see you said the widow on coming to the door come in thank you lucy he answered and entered the parlor it was so good of you to come she simpered i wanted somebody to talk to anything special he asked curiously i have received notice to leave this house i guess mr haskell the owner wishes it for himself she did not add that her rent was about due and she did not know how to meet the payment where do you think of going widow im sure i dont know abner i havent a single place you know im all alone in the world she looked at him fondly and he at once fell into the trap better come an live with me lucy oh abner what do you mean i mean that i think a heap o you lucy an id like you fer my wife i know as how we could git along fine together answered nats uncle earnestly just then that pot of gold seemed almost within his reach the widow blushed and pretended to be greatly surprised i i never dreamed of this abner she whispered its its so sudden but you aint goin to say no are you well i i she blushed again i must say i like you a great deal abner then say yes well i will declared the widow and then she allowed him to kiss her abner felt very happy and asked her to set the day at once bein as youre to git out o this house you might as well give up the boarders an come to my house at once he said the widow consented and said she would marry him in ten days he drove home almost in a dream and at once had the house put in order and actually bought himself a new suit of clothes and a new hat its a good bit o money to spend he reasoned but ive got to do the proper thing or she wont feel like lettin go o that gold when the time came they were married in the local church and then he drove her home her furniture had already arrived she at once took possession of the place and began to set things to rights i wont ask her about that pot o gold jest yet mused abner ill have to wait a few days at least chapter xvi abner visits new york several days passed and nats uncle did all in his power to please his new wife he found her very tart at times and inclined to have her own way but she was a good cook and general housekeeper and that counted for a great deal it wont do to cross her he told himself ive got to find out about thet gold first at last he could stand the suspense no longer and so one day while at the dinner table he told the story of a rich find of money by a lady in philadelphia it was in the weekly paper said he and by the way he went on what about the pot of gold you found the pot of gold i found she repeated blankly yes the one you found in the well what did you do with it why i never found any pot of gold in a well abner what put that in your head he shoved back his chair in horror and gazed at her blankly didnt you tell me you had found a pot of gold in a well lucy he demanded never certainly you did you asked me if you could keep it or if the law could take it from you i told you the law couldnt touch it oh i remember now she answered sweetly i read about such a find in a story magazine and i was wondering if the finder could keep it or if it would have to be turned over to the person who owned the property on which the well was located but i certainly never said anything about my finding a pot of gold well ill be jiggered didnt you go to the bank an ask em if they would take five thousand dollars oh i was only curious to know how much they would take that was all abner and she smiled again abner could not endure that smile and pushing back his chair still further he arose and left the house once in the barn he shook his fist viciously at an imaginary enemy of all the fools he muttered ive been tuk in clean an clear she aint got no pot o gold an never did have if this aint jest the worst yet abner balberry you ought to be kicked full o holes and ducked in the pond besides he felt in no mental condition to go back to the house and so did not return until it was time for supper he found a good meal awaiting him and his wife on hand as pert as ever what made you run off she demanded it wasnt a nice way to do you fooled me about thet pot o gold he answered bluntly i never did and i want you to stop talking about it abner balberry this was said so sharply it fairly made him jump eh did you marry me simply for my money she demanded coming up to him with her hands on her hips n no he stammered well then stop talking about a pot o gold i havent any and neither have you aint you got no money o your own lucy if i have im going to keep it to myself she answered come to supper he sat down and ate in silence the next day he wanted to speak about money again but she cut him short i dont want to hear about it she said tartly im your wife and i am going to do my share keeping house and helping around and you have got to do your share and treat me fairly i once heard that the first mrs balberry didnt get all that was coming to her that she had to wear the same dress and bonnet for years now i want to say right now that isnt my style when i want a new dress i want it and you are going to give it to me am i he said slowly yes you are abner balberry and if i want spending money you have got to give me that too if you dont ill quit work and wont do a blessed thing around the house so there she spoke with such vigor that it made him groan he felt it in his bones that she meant to have her way i am agoin to do my duty he said humbly youd better if you dont and she ended with a shake of her head that meant a great deal shes bound to have her way he told himself later ive got to git used to it i suppose drat the luck anyway i wish i had never heard o thet pot o gold in a roundabout fashion abner balberry had heard that nat had gone to buffalo and then he learned through a man who had been to new york that his nephew was in the metropolis abner had often longed to visit new york and here he saw his opportunity to do so im agoin to new york he announced one day shortly after the pot of gold incident what are you going to do there asked his wife im agoin to look fer nat ive heard hes down there an i want to save him from goin to destruction better leave him where he is said the new wife who did not fancy another of her husbands people around the farm no im agoin to hunt him up i feel its my duty to do it then if you go to new york you have got to take me along abner take you along lucy yes ive always wanted to go to new york fred can take care of the farm while we are gone fred and the other guff children had been installed on the place but none of them had proved of much assistance fred himself was decidedly lazy not half as willing as nat so abner himself admitted i dont see how i can take you lucy it costs a heap to go to new york well if you can spend the money on yourself you can spend it on me too she answered calmly but its my duty to go to save nat from goin to the dogs you didnt bother about nat when you were courting me i didnt know where he was exactly pooh well if you go you must take me if you dont you wont find me or the things when you get back this rather alarmed the miserly farmer and he was half afraid she might sell off all his belongings and clear out all right you shall go he said at last but its goin to cost a terrible sight o money he added with a long sigh it was decided that they should start for new york on the following monday morning mrs balberry had relatives at rochester and they made arrangements to stop over at that point for one night for neither the farmer or his spouse wished to take a berth in a sleeping car its money thrown away said abner an besides who kin sleep with a car runnin fifty miles an hour if there was an accident a feller would be killed before he woke up mrs balberrys son fred grumbled greatly at having to run the farm during their absence and the mother had to promise the lad fifty cents a day for the extra work its an outrage declared abner when he heard of this he aint worth his keep he is my son and you have no right to abuse him declared the new wife and then the farmer found it best to say no more he was discovering that his wife had a sharp tongue and could use it on the slightest provocation not to go to the expense of buying meals on the train they provided themselves with a basket full of food and set off bright and early at the time appointed the run to rochester was without incident and mrs balberrys relatives there treated them kindly then on tuesday they took another train for new york and late in the afternoon found themselves at the grand central depot its a fearfully crowded place was abner balberrys comment as he gazed around which way are we to go abner asked his wife and now she clung to him for the bustle and noise frightened her lets git out on the street where i kin have a look around he answered and pulled her along through the crowd a boy wanted to take his carpet bag but he shook the urchin off fortunately while at rochester the farmer had heard of a hotel which i shall call the callac house located but a few blocks from the station a policeman directed the pair to this place and here abner balberry succeeded in getting a room for a dollar and a half a night steep aint it he remarked when he and his wife had been taken to the room on the seventh floor steep i should say it was abner the seventh story its dreadful i know i shant sleep thinking of what to do in case of a fire i meant the price i dont care how high up it is will they give us meals for that too no the meals is extry its most a waste of money i must say well i had to pay it an so there aint no use to talk about it lets go to bed an git our moneys worth an in the mornin ill look fer nat chapter xvii a case of mistaken identity on the day that abner balberry started for new york to look for nat our hero was called into mr garwells private office nat how would you like to take a run down to trenton with me asked the gentleman pleasantly id like it firstrate mr garwell was the prompt answer very well well go in half an hour i wish to look up certain records concerning some property when will we be back mr garwell oh some time this evening answered the gentleman it may be mentioned here that john garwell was a real estate broker he handled only highclass properties and chiefly those used for business purposes he had started years before in a modest way but was now fairly welltodo and his business was steadily increasing he had taken a great fancy to nat and was wondering if he could not use the lad as a private secretary id do it in a minute if the boy knew shorthand and typewriting he told himself perhaps i can get him to learn those branches at the appointed time our hero was ready for the trip to trenton his employer had stuffed a valise full of legal papers and nat took possession of the bag be careful of that valise cautioned mr garwell the contents are very valuable ill look out for it was the answer they walked to the ferry and there took a boat to jersey city and then boarded a train bound for the capital city of new jersey mr garwell had obtained seats in a parlor car and the elegant furnishings impressed nat deeply these cars are like palaces he said they are certainly comfortable was his employers response on the trip to trenton mr garwell asked nat much about himself and at last the boy told his tale from beginning to end i dont suppose you care to go back to the farm said mr garwell with a quiet smile no sir i want to stay in new york i believe there is more of a future here for me than on the farm possibly that is true you had positively nothing to do with that fire at your uncles barn no sir i didnt even have a light around the place but you saw somebody near by yes sir i thought it was my uncle it must have been a tramp just what i think mr garwell and you think your uncle is coming to new york to look for you hell come if the carfare doesnt scare him off he is a very close man hum the real estate broker mused for a moment well if he comes supposing you let me know maybe i can persuade him to allow you to remain in the city at this nats face brightened oh mr garwell will you do that i suppose as my guardian he has a legal right to order me back to the farm well have to see about that but he hasnt found you yet that is true you ought to let him know that you are well and have a position you need not give him your address ill write the letter tomorrow was your father a farmer yes sir although when he was a young fellow like myself he lived in brooklyn his father and his grandfather were both born in new york i see then you have city blood in your veins that may account for your liking new york so much in a short time after the conversation came to an end trenton was reached and calling a cab mr garwell had himself and nat driven to one of the public buildings here both spent some time in looking over legal records and one of the records nat had to copy off in pencil for his employer after this came a visit to a lawyers office and nat was sent on a short errand when the business in trenton was over both found they had two hours to wait before they could get a train for home let us go and get a lunch said mr garwell and led the way to a fine restaurant in that vicinity the real estate broker was on the point of entering the eating place when a child of five ran up to him exclaiming papa i want you to buy me some candy please now as it happened mr garwell was a bachelor so he was taken much by surprise and so was our hero did you speak to me my dear he asked kindly why yes papa answered the little one readily but i am not your father child and the real estate broker began to flush up oh yes you are came from the child no what is your name at this the child laughed heartily what a funny papa you are to ask me my name but wont you buy me the candy please do went on the little one pleadingly what a funny mistake said mr garwell to nat dont you know the little girl not in the least get the candy cried the child petulantly all right ill get you some candy only dont call me papa answered the real estate broker and he slipped into a candy shop and purchased some chocolates he had just passed the confectionery over when a middleaged lady hurried up oh mamma see the candy papa bought me cried the little girl gleefully you shouldnt have bought her so much candy horace said the lady to mr garwell severely chocolates make lulu sick being thus addressed john garwell turned redder than ever excuse me madam he stammered i er this is a mistake my name is not horace not horace the idea my name is john john garwell and i am from new york at this answer the lady looked perplexed and then indignant horace quit your fooling she said coldly i am not fooling madam oh such a man perhaps youll say next that i am not your wife continued the lady with a black look you certainly are not my wife for i am a bachelor madam and now mr garwell began to grow more embarrassed than ever while nat was completely mystified not my husband oh you wretch to say such a thing the lady turned to the child lulu who is this why thats papa answered the little girl promptly now horace do you hear that i i heard what she said answered the real estate broker feebly but but if you are not her father why did you buy her candy just to keep her from calling me papa indeed did you want to bribe her oh horace this is infamous i i have you lost your mind no but i think you and this child have at this the lady stared and gave a gasp she fainted and would have fallen to the pavement had not nat caught and supported her instantly a crowd began to collect whats the trouble here asked one the gentlemans wife has fainted answered another excuse me but she is not my wife said john garwell i dont know her certainly she is your wife cried a bystander ive seen you together lots of times mr mann wait put in nat did you call this gentleman mr mann yes and thats his name you are mistaken this gentleman is mr john garwell go on with you i know mr mann too well to believe such a yarn i dont care what you say this gentleman is mr john garwell and he is from new york city then he has been playing a part here in trenton where he is known as horace q mann said the bystander by this time the lady was coming to her senses she clutched at the real estate broker take me home she murmured oh this is too much better take her home said several i dont even know where she lives answered john garwell blankly she lives at hallock street said a boy in the crowd ill show you the place mister why not take her and the little girl home suggested nat perhaps you can clear up this mystery there all right i will answered his employer nat call a coach im going to see this affair through its the oddest thing i ever had happen to me the coach was called and the lady and the girl got in and john garwell and nat followed i knew you were coming home today from that trip to washington said the lady with a tearful look in her face but i never dreamed you would act this way horace madam will you answer me one question have you a husband who went to washington oh horace seeing he could make no headway mr garwell became silent inside of ten minutes they reached hallock street and the coach came to a halt a servant let them into the mansion as she did this she stared at the real estate broker and gave a low cry of surprise why i er i thought mr mann was in the library she stammered i didnt know he went out to meet you mrs mann let us go to the library said john garwell the lady of the house was willing and hurried hither followed by her daughter the real estate broker and nat as they entered a gentleman who had been seated in an armchair reading a book arose to meet them well clara im back he said cheerily oh screamed the lady and fainted again and not without good reason for before her stood a gentleman who was almost the exact facsimile of mr garwell in face form and general appearance why which one of you is my papa cried little lulu im your papa answered the gentleman of the house why er who who is this he stammered looking at john garwell let us attend to your wife first was the answer and soon the lady of the house was restored to her senses then began a series of explanations it was dreadful of me to make such a mistake said mrs mann hysterically but but i dont wonder at it now answered john garwell your husband could pass for my twin brother i can hardly tell one from the other myself said nat never mind he bought me some candy put in little lulu and this made all laugh i am going to ask you to do something said john garwell to horace mann i think you owe it to me to walk down town so that your fellow citizens can see that there are really two of us yes horace pleaded his wife i made a lot of trouble for mr garwell horace mann agreed readily and soon he and the real estate broker and nat left the residence on the main streets of trenton many stopped to stare after them among the number was the man who had spoken to mr garwell and insisted that the real estate broker was mr mann i apologize said the man promptly but i reckon youll admit the resemblance is simply wonderful i do admit it was the answer still that doesnt make me anybody but myself horace mann insisted upon taking john garwell and nat to dinner and treated them to the best the restaurant afforded after this im going to wear a badge so my wife will know me said the trenton man and ill never dare to come to new york for fear of being taken for you chapter xviii nat meets his uncle nat if you wish to do me a favor do not mention this affair to anybody in new york said john garwell when the pair were on the train bound for the metropolis i wont say a word sir there was nothing wrong about it but i dont want my friends to make a laughing stock of me added the bachelor i shall never mention it to anybody returned our hero and it may be added here that he never did the matter was also hushed up in trenton so nothing more was heard of it our hero was kept very busy for a day or two after his trip into new jersey part of his time was spent over some books and the balance was used up in running errands and delivering important papers and documents once again he visited police headquarters to learn if anything had been heard of nick smithers we have learned that he visited jersey city not long ago said an official but before we could get the authorities to lay their hands on him he disappeared we rather think he is in new york again and if so we shall do all we can to round him up on the following day nat was sent on an errand up to fortysecond street he had to deliver some real estate documents and this done he stopped for a moment to look at the grand central depot thank fortune i am not quite so green as i was when i landed he mused he was just leaving the vicinity of the station when chancing to look down a side street he saw a sight that filled him with astonishment uncle abner and the widow guff he murmured what are they doing talking to that seedylooking fellow our hero was right there near the entrance to a big building stood abner balberry and his bride and a sharpeyed but shabbily dressed stranger was talking to them very earnestly uncle abner must have married the widow thought nat more than likely they are on their wedding tour wonder what that other fellow wants of uncle nats first inclination was to leave the spot so that his relative might not discover him but he did not like the looks of the stranger and so drew closer to learn if possible what the interview meant the man had just come past abner and his wife and had pretended to pick up a pocketbook say did you drop your pocketbook he asked of abner i i guess not stammered the farmer and felt to make certain that his own wallet was safe queer who did drop this went on the stranger pretty well filled too he added opening the pocketbook and looking into it did you jest pick it up queried abner falling into the trap sure right down there say this is a find aint it and the man smiled broadly thats what it is said the farmer i wish i could find a pocketbook sighed mrs balberry id like to return this to the owner went on the stranger i dont want to keep anybodys money taint everybody would say thet was abners comment he wished he had made the find i suppose not but i believe in being honest the stranger scratched his head hang me if i know what to do he continued what do you mean ive got to go out of town soon train leaves in ten minutes i dont want to take this with me it dont seem just right i see cant you find the owner im sure he would pay us a reward me find the owner stammered the farmer yes you might advertise the pocketbook has got at least a hundred dollars in it the owner ought to give you twentyfive for returning it maybe he would ill tell you what ill do said the stranger earnestly you take the pocketbook and give me ten dollars if you can find the owner you can claim twentyfive dollars reward an supposin i cant find the owner then you can keep the pocketbook the temptation was strong and abner looked at his newlymade wife might as well take it abner she said promptly i guess we can find the owner quick enough and she pinched his arm suggestively the farmer drew forth his wallet and began to count out ten dollars at the same time the stranger gazed again into the other wallet must be about a hundred and fifty dollars in this he said ill trust you to do the square thing by the owner oh you kin trust me said abner quickly he was about to pass over his ten dollars when he felt somebody catch him by the arm and turning he beheld nat nat he gasped not so fast uncle abner cried our hero you had better keep your money wh what put your money away see here what do you mean by interfering said the stranger roughly if he gives up the pocketbook take the ten dollars out of that went on nat my idea is there isnt a dollar in the pocketbook nat thats right uncle this is an old game i heard all about it only a few days ago oh you go to grass cried the stranger with a malicious look at nat and then he hurried away with all speed where did you spring from nat i was in this neighborhood on an errand uncle abner how do you do mrs guff im not mrs guff any more said the lady im mrs balberry your new aunt oh so youre married uncle abner yes was the answer but see here nat i dont understand about thet pocketbook said the farmer its simple enough as i said before the game is an old one that fellow had the pocketbook all the time it was stuffed with old paper with a dollar bill wrapped on the outside he wanted to get your money and if he had gotten it he would have left you with a pocketbook worth about a quarter with nothing but old paper and a dollar bill in it and maybe he would have taken the dollar bill out too well i never cried mrs balberry did you ever hear of such a swindle they play all sorts of games in a big city like this youve got to keep your eyes open i know it groaned abner balberry yesterday a cabman cheated me out o fifty cents an a boy got a quarter from me by a bogus telegram i thought something had happened to hum and when i opened the telegram it had nuthin but a sheet o blank paper inside that was too bad there was an awkward pause now that the farmer had found nat he hardly knew what to say he had expected to upbraid his nephew for running away but the pocketbook episode rather flustered him so you come to new york didnt you he said slowly yes are you working yes and ive got a pretty good job too what at im in an office downtown how much do you git what do you think uncle abner about two or three dollars a week i get seven dollars a week seven dollars a week fer a boy you have been very lucky put in mrs balberry i wish fred could strike a job like that im to have a raise later on added nat it wasnt right fer you to run away nat continued his uncle there are two ways of looking at it an you had no right to set fire to the barn i never did that uncle abner i wouldnt be so mean and you sold thet cow she was my cow no she wasnt i say she was and i can prove it well we wont quarrel about the cow what i want to know is are you behavin yourself here in the city i am i work every day and i board with some very nice people aint squanderin your earnins on theaters an sech no i have never seen the inside of a theater maybe you aint seen the inside of a church either came from mrs balberry yes i go to church every sunday then you dont want to go back to the farm came from abner balberry no i am never going back there dont you know that i am your guardeen that may be so uncle abner but i am not going back to the farm youll go if i say so no i wont and nats eyes flashed fire im going to support myself and all i ask is to be let alone oh leave him stay abner broke in mrs balberry you dont want him now you have fred the farmer was on the point of saying that nat as a worker was worth two freds but he thought it best to keep silent on that point id like to make certain you are stopping with decent folks said he after another pause and you wont bother me if i can prove that cried our hero eagerly i guess so nat but you mustnt come down on me fer board an clothes later on i wont the matter was talked over for a few minutes longer and in the end nat led the way to his boarding house and introduced his uncle and mrs balberry to mrs talcott the surroundings rather pleased abner balberry and he ended by arranging to stay with mrs talcott for several days its bettern them hotels said the farmer its more like hum aint it lucy yes but it aint quite so hightoned said the bride who was inclined to cut a dash whenever the opportunity afforded chapter xix nat becomes a private clerk abner balberry and his bride remained in new york four days longer and during that time nat did all in his power to make their visit a pleasant one he received mr garwells permission to remain away from work one day and took his uncle and aunt to central park and to the brooklyn bridge and the statue of liberty they were greatly pleased and were frank enough to tell nat so i guess you are more cut out for the city than for the farm said abner to his nephew i hope you do well you must write to us often an some day you must pay us a visit i certainly will do that uncle abner said nat and then to please the bride he purchased for her a souvenir book containing many illustrations of the metropolis this book mrs balberry prized highly and from that moment she began to like nat he aint half so bad as i was led to expect she said on the way home he seems to know what he is doing he certainly is gettin along responded abner shouldnt wonder but what hell be a regular business man some day do you think it would pay to send fred down to the city no he better stay on the farm fred aint got the way about him thet nats got hes just as smart said the youths mother quickly maybe but he aint got the knack o it he would do just as well if he had the chance continued mrs balberry as was perhaps natural she thought her own son as good as any boy on the day after nats uncle left new york john garwell called the boy into his private office did you arrange matters with mr balberry he asked pleasantly yes sir he is going to leave me alone after this and our hero smiled i am glad to hear it nat then there is nothing in the way of your continuing here no sir in that case i want to ask you a question how would you like to take up stenography and typewriting id like it firstrate if i thought i could do anything with them after i had learned them i would like to have a private secretary who understood stenography and the use of the typewriter oh mr garwell do you think i would do perhaps you are bright and i feel that i can trust you if you want me to ill go at stenography and typewriting at once youll have to have some time for it i can go at night there are several evening schools i know of very well then you may start in at once and i will pay your tuition fees i can pay those out of my savings no bring the bills to me nat and after this week your duties will be wholly as my private clerk added john garwell this made quite a change for our hero but it was an agreeable one and he went at his new duties with vigor a good school was selected which nat attended five nights in the week this kind of knocks me out said dick when our hero told him of the change no it dont said nat quickly ive made arrangements for you dick me how you are to come three nights a week for lessons in arithmetic and penmanship do they give the lessons free no i am going to settle that how much will you pay three dollars a month i ought to pay that no i am going to do it said nat firmly and he kept his word as john garwells private clerk nat received ten dollars per week and as he had no school bills to pay for himself he found it easy to pay for dick the newsboy was making rapid progress and this not only pleased his mother but also the man who had promised to give dick a position in his stationery store im going to have a job in the store next month said the newsboy one day mr andrews clerk is going to leave and i am to take his place and how much will mr andrews give you asked mrs talcott six dollars a week to start on and he says he will give me eight dollars as soon as i can help on the books i am glad to hear it dick i guess ive got nat to thank for the job said the newsboy i had to do some writing for mr andrews and he said the writing was all right yes you can certainly thank nat said mrs talcott the days passed swiftly for nat he made good progress at the evening school and mr garwell was correspondingly pleased every day the real estate broker trusted nat more and more until the lad occupied a truly responsible position one day nat was sent to brooklyn to have a certain document signed by a lady of wealth you must get mrs parloes signature to this nat said his employer and get somebody to witness the signature and sign here he added yes sir the paper is valuable and i dont want you to let it go out of your sight went on john garwell ill take care to keep my eye on it answered nat he was soon on his way and after crossing the brooklyn bridge took a street car to the address given him it was a fine brownstone house with elegant lace curtains at the windows does mrs parloe live here he asked of the girl who came to the door yes sir i would like to see her on business and nat handed out a card on which was printed john wilbur garwell real estate broker represented by nathaniel m nason the girl told nat to take a seat and went off with the card he waited for fully five minutes during which he heard a low murmur of voices in a back room then a tall darkeyed man came forward what do you wish of mrs parloe he questioned abruptly excuse me but my business is with the lady answered nat politely he had been told to transact business with mrs parloe and with nobody else oh i suppose you came about that property went on the darkeyed man surlily if you did let me tell you it wont do any good to this our hero made no reply mrs parloe will see you upstairs said the girl returning and showed nat the way up the darkeyed man started to follow but the girl called him back mrs parloe wished you to remain below mr cameron she said at this the man uttered something under his breath which nat could not catch evidently he was very angry and he went into a side room slamming the door after him nat found mrs parloe sitting in an easy chair by a front window she was something of an invalid and rather old i am glad to see you mr nason said she take a seat thank you returned nat here is a note for you from mr garwell and he passed it over the old lady read the communication carefully nodding to herself as she did so then she turned again to our hero have you the document with you yes maam and nat brought it forth you will have to have somebody as a witness can i call somebody for you the old lady mused for a moment i dont believe rufus will do it she said half aloud do you mean the gentleman i met downstairs yes my nephew rufus cameron he does not wish me to transact business with mr garwell you may call john my hired man he is quite intelligent where will i find him you will but never mind mary can call him mrs parloe touched a bell and soon mary appeared and went off to find the hired man in the meantime nat fixed a reading stand so it could be used as a writing table and brought out a stylographic pen his employer had given him soon the hired man appeared he was fairly well educated and showed it in his face and manner i am going to sign this document john said the old lady i wish you to witness my signature yes maam not without something of an effort mrs parloe affixed her signature to the paper then nat handed the document to john and told him where to place his own name in full and also his address in a minute the matter was concluded and mrs parloe told the hired man to go and he did so i trust mr garwell has no further difficulty in this matter said the old lady as nat stowed the document away in his pocket he told me to say that he is going to put it through just as soon as he can answered nat i dont know anything more about it than that are you one of his clerks yes maam his private clerk you are rather young for such a position i suppose i am but mr garwell seems to like me and i am doing what i can to please him mr garwell is a good man said the old lady and there the interview came to an end and nat left the room he was just going to leave the house when the darkeyed man stepped into the lower hallway and caught him by the arm chapter xx rufus camerons bold move what do you want demanded our hero he did not like the idea of being detained now that his business was concluded i want to talk to you a minute said the man come into the parlor i am in something of a hurry mr my name is rufus cameron mrs parloe is my aunt i must talk to you come in rufus cameron caught a firm hold of our hero and almost forced him into the parlor then he shut the door tightly and stood in front of it what do you want demanded nat he did not like the looks of rufus cameron the fellows face was dissipated you got my aunt to sign a certain document didnt you what if i did i want to see that paper if you do youll have to see my employer about it youve got the paper right here why cant you show it to me because i have no authority for so doing answered our hero firmly humph it wont hurt you to let me look over the paper growled rufus cameron i have my orders did john garwell tell you not to show me the paper he told me to have it signed and to bring it right back well i want to see it and im going to do it before you leave this house are you going to take the paper away from me cried nat in alarm i only want to look at it as soon as ive read it ill give it back to you i cant allow the paper to go out of my possession mr cameron mrs parloe isnt entirely responsible for what she does i must see to it that everything is all right well you had better call on mr garwell no i must see the document while you have it here come hand it over i will not nat had scarcely spoken when rufus cameron caught him roughly by the shoulder look here boy i am not a man to be trifled with he whispered fiercely let me see the paper and it will be all right but if you wont ill make a whole lot of trouble for you let go of me and nat tried to pull himself away you stole this ring while you were upstairs said rufus cameron quickly and putting his hand in nats side pocket he brought it out again with a diamond ring i i never saw that ring before gasped nat you stole it i say and unless you behave yourself ill have you arrested went on rufus cameron coldly nat was dumfounded but like a flash he saw through the trick that the man wanted to play on him you cant fool me mr rufus cameron said he sharply let me go or ill have you hauled up in court for this your dirty trick wont work with me rufus cameron fell back crestfallen he had not anticipated such bravery on our heros part he was a coward at heart and too much liquor had somewhat muddled his brain then you wont show me the document he muttered no as nat uttered the word rufus cameron picked up a sea shell lying on a mantelshelf and swung it behind his head if you dont let me see that he began nat rushed at him and pushed him to one side then our hero made for the door he was just opening it when the seashell was sent whizzing forward it hit nat on the head and the boy dropped unconscious across an easy chair for the instant rufus cameron was startled then rushing to the door he locked it and also locked some folding doors leading to a rear apartment i hope i didnt hurt him much he muttered what a young fool he was not to let me see the paper he propped nat up in the easy chair and placed his hand in the boys inside pocket soon he had the document in his possession and was looking over it rapidly just as i thought im glad i got it now well see if shanley and i cant outwit mr john garwell nat was already coming to his senses and rufus cameron lost no time in hurrying to the library of the house here he obtained an old document of no consequence but which still bore his aunts signature rushing back he placed this in the envelope which had held the other paper of importance nat was just returning to his senses when he found himself being taken out of the house by rufus cameron the man supported him as far as the corner and there placed him on a stone step leading to a church wha what did you hit me for stammered our hero feebly i didnt mean to do that really i didnt said rufus cameron smoothly the shell slipped i am very sorry very sorry indeed it was a mean thing to do it was an accident i give you my word on it nat felt in his pocket to learn if the document was still there did you look at that paper he questioned no i didnt on second thought i have concluded to let my aunt do just as she pleases in this matter nat felt in no condition to argue he took out the document glanced at it and shoved it back into the envelope and then in his pocket im sorry this happened i was excited for the minute come and have a drink with me it will do you good went on rufus cameron i dont drink shall i show you to the car then yes when nat got up the rascal supported him and thus they made their way to the car line running to the bridge here our hero boarded a car and rufus cameron watched him ride out of sight that was easy after all muttered rufus cameron to himself i only hope it dont make too much trouble in the future ill have to let shanley have this document without delay and id better get out of sight until the affair blows over making his way to a neighboring cafй rufus cameron treated himself to a drink of strong liquor and a blacklooking cigar then he returned to his aunts home he lived with her and was doing his best to get certain of her properties away from her aunt jane what did that young man want he asked as he entered her room he came to see me on private business rufus was the quiet answer mrs parloe did not fancy her nephews habits and had often warned him that he must reform was there anything i could do for you no rufus do you know aunt jane ive been thinking of taking a trip to the west he went on after a pause so you said before id go in a minute if i had the money how much do you want two or three hundred dollars at least is the money gone that i let you have last month yes i had to pay some back bills with that you are very extravagant rufus oh a young man must spend something but not as much as you spend i dont spend any more than the rest of the fellows in my set i have got to keep up appearances you know your set is altogether too fast a one to suit me will you let me have the money how long do you expect to be gone that depends upon what you will give me if youll let me have five hundred dollars ill make a trip of two or three months mrs parloe thought for a moment and at last consented to give her nephew the five hundred she had her check book handy and soon the check was passed over to the nephew when shall you start she asked i dont know ive a good notion to start tonight but if you want me to do anything for you before i go there is nothing rufus only if you want to please me dont get into any bad habits while you are gone oh im going to turn over a new leaf when i leave brooklyn said the hypocrite then i can leave tonight yes in that case ill pack my trunk at once said rufus cameron and a little later he did so then he had the trunk taken away bid his aunt goodby and was off that was easy he said to himself when away from the house now to see shanley and to arrange for keeping out of sight in case john garwell kicks up a fuss chapter xxi a missing document of value as soon as nat returned to the office he sought out mr garwell and handed him the document in the envelope did you have any trouble getting mrs parloes signature asked the real estate broker i had no trouble getting the signature but i had trouble getting away from the house answered nat trouble getting away what do you mean i was stopped by her nephew a man named rufus cameron he handled me rather roughly did he try to get the document away from you and now john garwell was all attention he hauled me in the parlor and demanded that i let him look at the paper i refused and then he threatened me and what happened after that he put his hand in my pocket and brought out a diamond ring he said i had stolen it of course you hadnt nat i had never seen the ring before but that wasnt the worst of it he picked up a sea shell and hit me with it and knocked me senseless after that our hero told his story in detail relating also what rufus cameron had said on assisting him to the street car the real estate broker listened with keen interest that man is a scoundrel he exclaimed when nat had concluded his story i pity mrs parloe he is doing his best to get all her money from her it was a mean trick to say i took the ring declared nat he did that thinking to get you in his power my boy are you sure he didnt look at the document i cant say what he did while i was senseless mr garwell ill take a look at the paper and see if he made any alterations in the text john garwell looked at the document and began to read it why this is not the paper i gave you nat he ejaculated not the same no its some old thing that i know nothing about if thats the case mr cameron substituted this paper for the real one exclaimed our hero he could easily have done that during the time i was knocked out ill see about this without delay said john garwell decisively i will show that fellow that he cant carry matters with quite such a high hand what can he do with that paper mr garwell he can cause me a great deal of trouble the paper refers to a piece of property in which mrs parloe held an interest i have been trying to get a free and clear title to the land for a client of mine and another real estate dealer named andrew shanley has been trying to get the land for another party it is a mixedup affair but i hoped the signing of that paper would help to straighten out matters the real estate broker was as good as his word but he was exceedingly busy and it was not until two in the afternoon that he could get away then he went to brooklyn taking nat with him i would like to see mr cameron said he to the girl at mrs parloes home mr cameron has gone away sir was the unexpected answer do you know when he will be back ill ask mrs parloe said the girl she went upstairs leaving them in the parlor below soon she came back he has gone out west mrs parloe says and she doesnt expect him back for two or three months gone west cried nat when did he go he went away about noon did he take any baggage asked john garwell yes sir a dresssuit case and he sent an expressman around for his trunk too then i wont bother you any more said the real estate broker and left the house followed by nat dont you want to ask mrs parloe about this queried our hero it would be useless to do so nat it would only upset the old lady she might be able to tell us just where her nephew had gone to it is not likely he intends to keep out of the way that is certain maybe he didnt go west at all said our hero suddenly such a thing is possible did you say he was in league with this other real estate broker i dont know about that although i know he and this shanley are friends i wonder if it wouldnt be a good idea for me to watch around this shanleys office for him ha that is an idea john garwell smiled broadly nat you are growing clever even if i couldnt get the paper i could prove that he had not gone west as he told his aunt and i could follow him and find out where he was stopping well you can do the watching if you wish i will give you andrew v shanleys address his place of business is between here and the bridge shall i go there at once if you wish the address was written on a slip of paper and a little later nat and his employer separated john garwell gazed after our hero curiously he is improving wonderfully he mused he isnt half as green as when i first met him nat had been told what car to take and ten minutes sufficed to bring him to the block upon which andrew shanleys office was located on the third floor of a large office building he went upstairs and managed to get a peep into the office and found rufus cameron was not there of course he may have been here already he told himself but ive got to take my chances about that ill stay here until the place shuts up going below again he took a station across the street and began to wait patiently for the appearance of rufus cameron as luck would have it he had waited less than half an hour when he saw mrs parloes nephew step from a car at the corner and approach the office building mr cameron i want to see you he exclaimed coming forward and confronting the man rufus cameron had not expected to meet nat again so soon and for the moment he was dumfounded wha what do you want he stammered halting you know well enough what i want answered our hero sharply i want that document you stole from me stole from you that is what i said rufus cameron i i dont know what you are talking about you do know and unless you give up the paper i am going to have you arrested right now at these words rufus cameron turned pale as said before he was a good deal of a coward and being caught so unexpectedly threw him somewhat from his mental balance you you cant have me arrested yes i can how did you come to look for me here mr garwell sent me here he is up to your tricks did he tell you to to have me arrested never mind what he told me i want that paper and i want it right now i i havent got any paper i i dont know what you are talking about yes you have got that paper you took it from me after you knocked me down in your aunts parlor isnt that so as nat finished he nodded as if talking to somebody behind rufus cameron at once the guilty fellow turned his head to learn who was listening to the conversation as he did this nat thrust his hand in the rascals breast pocket and brought forth the document which had caused all the trouble chapter xxii at the elevated station hi stop that roared rufus cameron making a clutch for the document but before he could reach it nat was at a safe distance our hero glanced at the paper to make certain that it was the right one and then put it in his pocket and buttoned up his jacket now mr rufus cameron i guess we are square said nat in something a tone of triumph you young thief give me back that document cried the man savagely not much i am going to give it to mr garwell that isnt his document yes it is i say it isnt if you dont give me the paper ill call a policeman do it and ill have you arrested for knocking me over with the sea shell and robbing me rufus cameron glared at our hero he was baffled and did not know what to do next presently a crafty look came into his eyes see here youre a pretty smart boy he said in a calmer tone thank you for nothing what is john garwell going to give you for getting that paper nothing at least i dont expect anything youre a fool to work for nothing sneered rufus cameron youll never get rich doing that if i dont it will be my own affair do you understand this business at all boy i understand some of it dont you know that john garwell is trying to defraud my aunt out of a lot of money i certainly know nothing of the kind its a fact i am only trying to protect my aunts interests she is rather queer in her head at times and doesnt know what she is doing she wasnt queer when she signed this paper yes she was but we will let that pass give me the paper and ill pay you handsomely for it you can tell garwell that you couldnt locate me how much will you give asked nat although he had no intention of accepting the rascals offer ill give you five dollars that isnt much the paper is worth more no it isnt i wont give it up for five dollars well well make it ten dollars come hand the paper over its easy money for you the paper is worth every bit of a hundred dollars said our hero just to draw the rascal out and learn if possible how valuable rufus cameron really considered the document a hundred dollars nonsense but ill tell you what ill do im sorry i knocked you down at my aunts house ill give you twentyfive dollars when will you pay me now and rufus cameron brought forth a roll of bills you can keep your money rufus cameron eh i wouldnt touch a penny of it do you know what i think i think you are a firstclass scoundrel what this to me stormed the fellow shoving his money back into his pocket yes that to you i am sorry mrs parloe has such a rascal for a relative now i am going to bid you goodday and nat began to move away come back here you young villain cried rufus cameron he made a dash for our hero but nat was too quick for him the boy ran across the street and around a corner and in a moment more was out of sight rufus cameron shook his fist in impotent rage the jigs up he muttered what a mess i thought id get a thousand dollars out of shanley for that paper nat did not slacken his pace until he had reached the river then he ran aboard a ferry boat and journeyed thus to new york thinking that possibly his enemy would watch the cars when our hero reached the office he found that the regular force of clerks had already left but his employer was still at his desk finishing up some business of importance hullo you are back quickly exclaimed john garwell yes sir and theres the document answered nat and placed the paper on the desk john garwell stared in amazement why how did this happen he queried it was blind luck i guess said nat and sitting down he told his tale you certainly were lucky so that rascal wanted to bribe you yes i half felt like knocking him down for it and nats eyes flashed it would have served him right the real estate broker looked the document over yes this is all right he opened the sheet hullo here is a memorandum of some kind the memorandum was on a sheet of plain white paper it contained a name and address and some figures eureka almost shouted the real estate broker this is luck truly what have you found mr garwell an address i have been hunting for for over a year now i can put that real estate deal through without further trouble i knew shanley or this cameron had that address but of course they wouldnt give it to me im glad i got it for you i imagine rufus cameron will be very angry when he learns that he has lost this address its his own fault there was nothing more for nat to do that day so he went home and in the evening attended the night school where he had taken up shorthand and typewriting he was making rapid progress and he applied himself diligently on the following day john garwell was away from the office until the middle of the afternoon and he also went off the next morning on his return his face wore a satisfied look well that thing is settled he said on dropping into his chair and what a row i did have with mr andrew v shanley you mean about that property queried nat looking up from his work at a side desk yes i have sold the property and got my commissions amounting to four thousand dollars in all shanley was as mad as a hornet did he mention rufus cameron no but i did and told him just what a dirty sneak the fellow was after that shanley shut up pretty quick do you suppose rufus cameron can do anything more in the matter no but he will have it in for you nat i am afraid oh i guess i can take care of myself answered our hero calmly this shanley has tried to trip me up several times went on john garwell leaning back in his office chair he tries to find out what i am doing and then he does his best to steal the business away from me maybe this will teach him a lesson possibly but i am afraid not nat several days passed and nat kept at work steadily during that time he received a letter from his uncle in which abner balberry stated that he had arrived home once more and found everything on the farm all right uncle abner isnt such a bad sort after all thought nat only he ought to drop some of his miserly habits perhaps now that he is married again he will one day our hero had to go up to one hundred and twentyfifth street on an errand take an elevated train said his employer and handed him the necessary carfare it did not take nat long to reach the elevated station purchasing a ticket he dropped it in the box and walked out on the platform only a few people were present for it was the quiet hour of the morning among the number was a thickset trampishlooking fellow who was smoking a short clay pipe the man was more than half intoxicated and lurched from side to side as he walked along the platform that fellow had better look out for himself thought our hero if he isnt careful he may fall out on the tracks and get hurt as our hero had some time to wait for a train he passed the man several times the face of the fellow looked familiar and nat wondered where he had seen him before ive certainly met him somewhere thought the boy but where i dont think it was in new york presently the elevated train came into sight and those on the platform prepared to get aboard when it should stop for them the man lurched forward as before and of a sudden fell sprawling directly in front of the train chapter xxiii tom nolans confession a cry of horror went up from those who saw the mishap and some women present turned their heads away expecting that the semiintoxicated individual would be killed nats heart leaped into his throat but he did not lose his presence of mind he was but a few feet from the man and as quick as a flash he jumped forward caught the fellow up and dragged him out of harms way wha what yer doin stammered the fellow gazing unsteadily at our hero do you want to be killed asked nat sharply they wont wont dare to kill me said the fellow im a a good citizen he ought to be locked up said a man standing near it was a brave deed said one of the ladies whos goin to lock me up demanded the tramp for he was nothing less and he began to show fight at which the majority of the crowd turned away and hurried to board the train nat hesitated for a second and then concluded to let the train go on and take the next one say you pulled me from the track didnt you said the man after another look at nat i did noble boy i ought to reward you i dont want any reward humph dont worry my dear friend tom nolan aint got no money to reward you with and the semidrunken man indulged in a senseless chuckle see here havent i met you before demanded nat looking at the man more closely than ever maybe yer have an maybe yer havent where do you come from me im an ohio man i am and i aint ashamed to own it ohios best state in the union so you are from ohio were you ever in and around brookville and caswell went on our hero suddenly sure i spent two months in that district not very long ago but i had to git out i did and the tramp chuckled again what made you get out and now nat was all attention folks didnt like me around didnt you treat them fairly sure i did but they thought their barns was too good for tom nolan to sleep in and thats why they chased you away eh thets it my young friend it was this way to tell the plain truth one night i went to sleep in a barn with my pipe in my mouth fust thing i knowed some hay got afire a man came runnin to put the fire out and i had to leg it to git away was that up between caswell and brookville youve struck it but but whats this to you anyway and now tom nolan began to look disturbed its a good deal to me that was my uncles barn and i was accused of setting it on fire gee shoo yer dont say say ive put my foot into it aint i you certainly have but say honest i i didnt mean to set the shebang afire not on my life i didnt you were smoking and fell asleep thets the honest truth o the matter my young friend im a tramp an down on my luck but i aint no barn burner not me well you had better come with me said nat decidedly what are yer goin to do i want a witness to what you just said goin to have me me locked up no its not worth it i only want to prove to my uncle that i am not guilty thats all the tramp followed nat down into the street and then over to john garwells office why what does this mean nat demanded his employer in astonishment for visits from tramps were unusual our hero lost no time in telling his story i want my uncle abner to know that i am innocent thats all he continued it wont do any good to hold this chap for the barn wasnt hurt much anyway ill settle this said mr garwell and called in a stenographer who took down what the tramp had to say then the confession was typewritten and tom nolan signed it and john garwell added his signature as a witness there nat that is all right now said the real estate broker you can send that to your uncle when you please and we can keep a copy this is all i want said our hero to the tramp you may go now dont want no more o me asked tom nolan nothing whatever say aint this confession good fer a quarter ill give you a quarter if youll promise not to spend it for drink ill promise said the tramp and nat handed him twentyfive cents tom nolan thanked him and shuffled off and that was the last our hero saw or heard of him im sorry i lost so much time said nat to his employer but i wanted to square myself with uncle abner if i could i dont blame you nat i have no doubt it is a great worry off your mind it is now uncle abner will know i told him the plain truth that night nat wrote abner balberry a long letter telling of his meeting with the tramp he enclosed the signed confession and he had the letter registered so that it might not get lost in the mails a few days later came a reply in which nats uncle said he remembered seeing the tramp around on the day of the fire and stating that he was very sorry that he had ever thought his nephew guilty nats work frequently took him out of town and on one occasion he had to go to albany a trip which he enjoyed thoroughly as it gave him a chance to visit the state capitol nat said john garwell one day didnt you once tell me that your father and grandfather had come from new york and brooklyn yes sir was your grandfather ever interested in some property around central park i dont know but what he was but he got rid of his belongings so i was told when he moved away did you ever see any of the papers yes sir some years ago they were in a trunk up in my uncle abners garret what was your grandfathers full name chester stout nason his mother was a stout and your fathers full name william henry nason did he have any brothers no sir only a sister who was uncle abners first wife i see are those papers still in the trunk you just mentioned they ought to be they were packed away with some old account books bad debts i once heard father call them father had an idea he could collect some of the debts some day but i guess they are outlawed more than likely id like to see those papers regarding that land near central park why mr garwell do you think there is anything in it for me cried our hero quickly im not prepared to say that until i see the papers i am looking up six parcels of land which a certain company want for the purpose of putting up a big hotel some of the old deeds mention a chester s nason as holding a halfinterest in one of the plots of ground the interest being assigned to him in payment of a claim he had on one maurice leroy did you ever hear of such a man no sir well supposing you get those papers for me and let me examine them shall i send to uncle abner for them i think it might be better for you to go home and sort out the papers yourself ill explain just what i am after besides if the papers are valuable you had better not trust them to the mails ill pay your railroad fares all right ill go home for them whenever you say mr garwell i hope the papers do prove valuable and nat smiled broadly dont raise false hopes nat there may be nothing in it but there is nothing like being sure is the tract of land valuable very it is located in the most fashionable territory around central park when do you want me to go home you can start tomorrow if you wish there is no rush of business on just at present i presume you will be back within four or five days ill come back as soon as possible take your time a couple of days on the farm will do you good it will be like a touch of old times that is true answered nat the opportunity to go back to the farm pleased him he packed his dresssuit case that night and left on the tenoclock train in the morning he was dressed in his best and had quite a city air about him certainly he could no longer be called a greeny nat spent the night at cleveland and took the train to brookville in the morning almost the first person he met in the town was sam price hullo are you back cried the country boy shaking hands back for a few days sam you look fine nat i feel fine how are you getting along pretty good life on the farm is rather slow somebody told me you were tired of the city it isnt true sam fred guff says he wants to go to the city too but his mother wont let him i suppose fred helps my uncle abner yes but your uncle dont get along with him very well freds too slow for him sam had driven to town with his buckboard and he readily agreed to give nat a ride over to abner balberrys farm they were soon on the way and less than an hour brought them in sight of the place some young man is coming ma cried fred who was sitting on the doorstep munching an apple sam price is driving him wonder what he wants here said mrs balberry shading her eyes with her hands mercy sakes its nat nat repeated the boy huh if its him i guess hes sick of the city i thought he wouldnt make a go of it dont you be too sure of that said the mother shortly nat has more ginger in him than you have by this time nat was at the horseblock he leaped off the buckboard and advanced to greet mrs balberry and her son how do you do he cried cheerily arent you surprised to see me i certainly am answered mrs balberry as she shook hands got tired of the city eh came from fred i knew it wouldnt last do you think you could do anything in the city demanded our hero sharply of course i could its hard work to get along in new york i dont care i wouldnt make a failure of it if i went i guess you wasnt smart enough for them new yorkers added fred maliciously what makes you think that fred if it wasnt so you wouldnt be back have you given up your place with mr garwell asked mrs balberry no im home on a vacation of a couple of days thats all oh then you are going back came from fred and his face fell certainly i am i have a firstclass position with a promise of advancement so it would be sheer foolishness for me to give it up ma said you were with a real estate man yes that cant pay much it pays very well how much ten dollars a week at present but i am to get more soon you dont mean to say they pay you ten dollars a week cried fred that is my regular salary then im going to the city tomorrow said fred decidedly chapter xxiv the papers in the trunk nat now asked for his uncle and was told that his relative was at the barn placing his dresssuit case in the house he walked down to the barn in the meantime sam price had driven off uncle abner where are you whos thet acallin me came from the farmer as he looked forth from one of the horse stalls ive come to ask you for a job went on nat lightly nat how be you abner came and shook hands want a job is it all up in new york no uncle i was only fooling i came home for a vacation of a couple of days thats all well youre welcome nat but it must cost money to travel so far for jest two days vacation i came for another purpose too do you remember those old papers in the trunk in the garret those thet belonged to your father an grandfather yes well i am going to look them over and see if they are of any value aint nuthin of any use nat i looked over em myself one rainy day when i didnt have nuthin else to do mr garwell thinks some of them might be valuable does he know about em he only knows what i told him the old debts is all outlawed but there are other papers something about some land grandfather had an interest in i dont know nuthin about that its so long ago i dont believe they are worth a cent well it wont do any harm to look them over and show them to mr garwell returned our hero it was approaching the noon hour and in honor of nats arrival mrs balberry prepared an extra good dinner of which the boy partook freely it was plainly to be seen that the former widow was the ruler of the house and that she compelled abner balberry to be far more liberal than had been his habit in years gone by have another piece of pie nat said the lady of the house graciously thank you but ive had enough answered nat better save whats left for tomorrow suggested abner balberry if nat wants another piece he shall have it was the ladys quick answer oh certainly certainly ma i want another piece came promptly from fred youve had two pieces already fred i want another not today just a little piece not another mouthful and mrs balberry placed the remainder of the pie in the cupboard i cant never have nothing cried fred kicking the leg of the table youll have a box on the ears fred guff if you dont behave yourself answered his mother and then there was silence after dinner nat talked with his uncle for a while and then putting on an old coat went up into the dusty garret and hauled out the old trunk it was strapped but not locked so he had no trouble in opening it what are you going to do asked fred who had followed him look over some papers answered our hero briefly want me to help you no what are you going to do with the papers take some of them to the city with me are they yours yes say dont you think it would be a good plan for me to go to the city and git a job at ten dollars a week went on fred sitting down on the top garret step yes if you could get the tendollar job why cant i git it you got it i was lucky thats all fred before i got it i might have starved to death huh couldnt you git me a job with your boss i dont think so im just as smart as you are nat nason to this our hero made no reply he had brought out some of the papers and was looking them over with much interest if you dont want to help me git a job ill git one on my own hook continued fred who was as dull as he considered himself bright well you have a right to do as you please said nat but please leave me alone now fred i want to read these very carefully huh im going to stay in the garret as long as i please nat said no more and fred began to kick the step upon which he was sitting then he began to thump on the rafters of the garret bringing down some dirt on nats head stop that fred cried our hero sharply stop it i say i aint goin to stop if you dont stop ill put you downstairs first thing you know you cant do it yes i can do you want to fight demanded fred rising and squaring off no but i want you to leave me alone i aint touched you no but you were knocking the dirt down on me why cant you leave me alone ive got as much right in this garret as you have thats why you are mean dont you call me mean blustered fred and coming closer he hit nat on the shoulder at once our hero hit back and fred received a thump in the mouth that caused him to topple backwards dont he screamed dont dont hit me again now are you going to leave me alone demanded nat ill tell my ma on you if you do i shall tell her how you annoyed me answered nat come down in the barnyard and ill fight with you said fred but as he spoke he retreated down the stairs dont be a fool fred behave yourself and well get along all right said nat and then fred passed to the lower floor banging the stairway door after him there was a hook on the door and this he fastened after him now nat can stay in the garret till i let him out he muttered to himself when left to himself nat dragged the old trunk to one of the windows of the garret and then began a systematic investigation of all the papers the box contained he soon learned that the majority of the documents were of no importance but there were half a dozen which looked of possible value and these he placed in his pocket two of the sheets referred directly to the land in new york city i hope these are what mr garwell is looking for he said to himself having put the trunk back where it belonged nat started to go below only to find the door hooked fast from the other side fred he called out loudly fred open the door ha ha nat nason how do you like being a prisoner came from fred who had been resting on a bed in a nearby room i want you to open the door what will you give me if i do ill tell you what ill give you if you dont cried nat angrily what a good thrashing you cant do it are you going to open the door no fred had scarcely spoken when nat pressed on the door and the hook flew from its fastening as the door burst open nat leaped from the stairway and caught the other boy by the collar now then that for locking me in he cried and boxed freds ears soundly stop roared fred stop nat nason will you behave yourself after this and leave me alone yes yes then see that you do went on nat and flung the other boy from him fred picked himself up in a hurry and ran below he vowed he would get square but during nats stay at the farm he could not muster up courage to do so chapter xxv back to the city on the following day nat arose at five oclock and put on an old suit of clothes slipping downstairs he hurried to the barn where he fed the horses and then milked the cows he was just finishing up when his uncle appeared well i never ejaculated abner balberry right back into harness agin eh yes uncle abner i thought id like a little taste of old times youve done putty good to get through so quick nat i wish fred was such good help doesnt he help at all not unless you drive him all the time his mother gits after him an so do i but it dont appear to do no good he wants to go to the city and try his luck humph hed starve to death perhaps it might teach him a lesson well hes got to do somethin putty soon i aint goin to support him if he wont work for the balance of the day nat helped his uncle around the farm it was rather hard work but he did not complain and abner was greatly pleased nat if you git tired o the city you come back here said his uncle on parting remember ill make it right with you ill remember uncle abner responded nat somehow i guess i didnt use to understand you youre a putty good boy after all its kind to say so an it wasnt right fer me to say you sot the barn afire added abner earnestly well let bygones be bygones answered nat and then he shook hands with his uncle when nat started back for new york his uncle abner drove him to the railroad station at brookville fred wanted to go for the ride but his mother told him he must stay at the farm you go and cut the wood said she sharply if you dont youll get no supper tonight i aint goin to cut no wood growled fred yes you are and do it right now too hang the wood muttered fred savagely i aint going to stay on the farm im going to new york same as nat at the depot nat and his uncle parted on the best of terms if you kin git off at christmas come an see us said abner balberry well have a good fat turkey for dinner with all the fixins thank you very much said nat perhaps ill come if i can get away the run to cleveland was quickly made and here our hero found that he would have an hour to wait before the arrival of the train for new york as his dresssuit case had been checked he felt at liberty to walk around to see the sights how different matters are from when i first struck this city he thought as he walked along one of the streets then i was a real greeny but i didnt know it nat was returning to the railroad station when he suddenly heard his name called and turning found himself confronted by paul hampton oh how do you do mr hampton he cried and shook hands i am real glad to see you and i am glad to see you answered the young man but how comes it you are in cleveland i thought you were in new york ive been back to the farm for a couple of days on business and pleasure combined arent you in buffalo and niagara falls any more oh yes a law case brought me here how are you doing very well indeed i am glad to hear it you were awfully good to give me that hundred dollars continued nat earnestly i never expected it i hope it did you lots of good nat it did and it didnt what do you mean the money was stolen from me or rather i was swindled out of it that opened my eyes to the fact that i was not as smart as i had imagined myself to be and then our hero related the experience he had had with nick smithers alias hamilton dart that was too bad said paul hampton i trust you locate this smithers some day so do i what are you doing i am with a real estate broker i am learning shorthand and typewriting and i am to become his private secretary then you are on the right road and i congratulate you the real estate business is an excellent one especially in a large city like new york paul hampton walked to the depot with nat and saw him on the cars soon our hero was off the trip back to the metropolis was made without anything out of the ordinary happening so you are back said john garwell when our hero presented himself at the office i hope you enjoyed the trip i did very much mr garwell how did your uncle treat you finely sir did you find any papers of value went on the real estate broker i found half a dozen which i wish you would look over and nat brought forth the documents i am anxious to close that real estate deal went on john garwell others are getting wind of it including that fellow shanley from brooklyn he is doing his best to make me lose on the deal is rufus cameron in with him i believe he is both of them are very bitter i suppose they are bitter against me too observed nat soberly it is more than likely but that cant be helped nat in business a man is bound to make more or less of enemies john garwell was very busy and said he would look over the documents the next day but on the following morning he was called out of town so the documents were not examined until some days later as soon as he returned to the office nat went to work with vigor for over a week to make up for the lost time he had a great deal of writing on hand and one evening he remained at the place until after nine oclock as nat had been indoors nearly all day he resolved to walk home just for the physical exercise and to get the fresh air he started up broadway and was soon as far as tenth street here he attempted to cross the thoroughfare but was stopped by a jam of cars and other vehicles let me alone he heard a boy not far off say let me alone i wont give you my money youve got to pay for the papers country cried another boy come fork over the fifteen cents its all ive got i dont care fork over or ill ill mash you the voice of one of the boys sounded familiar and stepping to a dark doorway from whence the voices proceeded nat was amazed to find fred guff and a new york newsboy who was a stranger fred why if it aint nat cried the farm boy where did you spring from i think i had better ask you that question i want me money came from the newsboy help me nat he wants to get my money from me its the last fifteen cents ive got pleaded fred what do you want of the money demanded nat of the newsboy oh it aint none o your business i tried to help him sell papers said fred but i couldnt sell those he gave me and now he wants me to pay for them anyway did you agree to pay for them i said id pay for them if i sold them then you dont get any money said nat sharply to the newsboy now let this boy alone do you hear ah wait till i catch him alone muttered the newsboy and ran off around the corner chapter xxvi fred gives up city life now then fred tell me how it is that you are in new york said nat when the newsboy had departed i i ran away from home did you have the carfare to this city no i stole a ride to cleveland on a freight train and then i stole another ride on two trains to new york i was kicked off of one train and what have you been doing since you landed here selling papers and doing odd jobs i couldnt get anything steady did you try to find me no and the gawk of a boy hung his head why not because i i wanted to make my own way same as you are doing but oh nat its awfully hard where have you been staying nights one night i slept in a doorway and last night i slept in a park until a policeman came and chased me away fred looked so forlorn and hungry that nat could not help but pity him coming to the city to earn his living had evidently hit fred hard had any supper he asked kindly i had a a bun is that all yes how much money have you fifteen cents and i wanted to make that last just as long as i could come with me and ill get you something to eat said our hero fred was willing enough and seated at a table in a restaurant he fairly devoured the beef and beans bread and coffee set before him have a piece of lemon pie asked nat can you afford it nat i guess so and our hero ordered the pie and also ate a piece and drank a glass of milk to keep fred company it costs a terrible pile to live in the city sighed fred youve got to pay for everything when i landed a man made me pay ten cents for crossing a tornup street he swindled you fred maybe he did i know he ran off as soon as he got the money where were you going to stop tonight i i dont know you had better come with me i i cant pay for regular lodging and again the boy from the farm hung his head well ill do the paying will you freds face brightened say nat youre real good im sorry i treated you so meanly when you paid us a visit well let that pass now you are here the question is what are you going to do cant i find a job im willing to do anything well see about that they walked to mrs talcotts place and here nat explained the situation and fred was placed in a room that chanced to be vacant he was exceedingly tired and dropped to sleep almost instantly im going to telegraph to brookville that you are here and safe said nat the next morning i dont want your mother to worry about you and the telegram was sent off before our hero went to the office nat gave fred a dollar and told him to try his best that day to find something to do ill get something said fred but that night he came back greatly disheartened i couldnt get a thing he declared i tried about fifty places in one place a man kicked me out and in another place a lot of boys called me hayseed and threw lumps of dirt at me i i guess ill go back to the farm dont you want to try it for another day asked nat ill pay your way he knew the experience would do fred good the boy from the country consented but at night he returned more discouraged than ever i was a big fool to leave the farm he sighed the city is no place for me the noise makes my head ache and i get lost every time i turn a corner i wish i was back to brookville very well you shall start back tomorrow answered nat but i aint got the carfare and i hate to try riding on the freight cars again ill get you a railroad ticket answered nat and he did so and also gave fred some change for his meals fred was more than thankful and actually cried on parting youre the best boy in the world nat he sobbed the very best just wait till you come back to the farm ill show you how i can treat you and then he was off for home a sadder but a wiser youth to go back to the farm was the best thing that fellow could do was dicks comment why he wouldnt amount to shucks here even if he stayed a year we cant all be city folks said mrs talcott some men must remain farmers the trouble with fred is he doesnt like to work said nat but this may teach him a lesson on the day that fred left nat was called to the office by john garwell nat i want you to go to springfield massachusetts immediately said the real estate broker see when you can catch a train a train leaves the grand central depot at eleventhirty was our heros answer after consulting a timetable then you have plenty of time take this document and turn it over to mr perry robertson yes sir dont give it to anybody else shall i wait for mr robertson if he isnt in when i call yes all right sir no more was said and nat prepared for the trip without further delay he wished to ask his employer about the documents found in the trunk but saw that mr garwell was too busy to be interrupted nat was getting used to taking short trips to various cities so the ride to springfield was no great novelty he put in part of his time at reading a newspaper and the balance at studying shorthand from a book which he carried with him arriving at springfield nat found he would have to wait until evening before he could see mr perry robertson this made him stay in the city overnight and he did not arrange to go back to new york until ten oclock the next morning he had just paid his bill at the hotel and was passing the smoking room when he saw a man who looked familiar get up from reading a newspaper and walk toward him hamilton dart gasped our hero and rushing forward he caught the swindler by the arm chapter xxvii a scene at the hotel the fellow who had posed as a broker and commission merchant was taken completely by surprise when confronted by nat and for the moment did not know what to say i guess you didnt expect to see me again said our hero after a pause during which nick smithers to use his real name glared fiercely at the youth excuse me boy but i dont know you said the swindler at last you have made a strange mistake oh no i havent answered nat you are hamilton dart alias nick smithers my dear young friend you are in error my name is josiah garfield and i am from concord massachusetts i am not mistaken you are nick smithers and you are the rascal who swindled me in new york city boy you must be mad burst out nick smithers in assumed indignation i a swindler preposterous its the plain truth and there is no use of your denying it by this time a small crowd was gathering around soon a clerk of the hotel came up hastily whats the trouble here he questioned anxiously this boy is crazy said nick smithers no i am not this man is a swindler and i want him arrested came from nat he made up his mind come what might he would stand up for his rights i am an honest man wellknown in concord where i keep a jewelry establishment puffed nick smithers this is an insult to me he turned to the hotel clerk i shall hold your hotel responsible for this i this looks as if you were making a mistake said the clerk to nat this gentleman has been stopping here for over a week he is registered on our book as josiah garfield he has half a dozen names said nat i tell you he is a swindler and i say the boy is crazy boy if you say another word ill have you locked up nick smithers thought nat was so green that he would back down but for once he made a mistake call a policeman please he said to the clerk we can talk this over when we get to the police headquarters are you sure of what you are doing asked the clerk yes i am sure of it i can prove beyond any doubt whatever that this fellow is a confidence man and a swindler he swindled me out of a hundred dollars in new york and he swindled several others out of the same amount just help me to lock him up and ill get all the witnesses necessary thats straight talk came from a commercial traveler standing nearby if the boy can prove what he says this man ought to be arrested by all means he cant prove a thing answered nick smithers but he began to grow hot and cold for he realized that nat meant business and was not to be overawed as easily as he had imagined ill call a cop piped in a newsboy who had drifted into the room i see one on de corner a minit ago and away he ran to execute his errand the police will have to settle this said the hotel clerk if you are making a mistake it will cost you dear he added to nat i am making no mistake answered our hero firmly this reply set nick smithers to thinking to try to bluff nat was one thing to prove his innocence at the police station might be quite another i cant bother to go to the station ive got to get a train for boston he cried and ran from the room with all of his speed stop him yelled nat and began to give chase stop him the cry was taken up by several others and all began to run after nick smithers keep my valise ill catch him if i can said nat to the hotel clerk and off he sped and was soon ahead of the others who had joined in the chase if there was one thing that nick smithers could do well it was to run and now he made the best possible use of his rather long legs he darted out of a side door of the hotel down the square and around a corner leading into a back street lined with small shops and dwellings the young fool he muttered as he sped along who would have dreamed of his turning up in such a place as this at last the swindler turned into another street a car was passing and he hopped aboard this not to be seen he dropped into a seat and crouched down he rode on the car a distance of a dozen squares and then left and hurried to a small house setting far back in a rather neglected garden the house was to let and he pretended to be looking it over and thus passed to a back porch and out of sight nat continued the hunt for the swindler for a good hour and then gave it up well how did you make out asked the hotel clerk upon his return he got away from me he put on a pretty good front if he was a swindler yes thats how he came to swindle me and several others answered our hero did you report the case to the police there is no use of doing that why not theyll help you all they can that may be true but by the time my report is in that rascal will be miles and miles away nevertheless nat was persuaded to report to the city authorities before he went to the railroad station he had missed his train and so had to lay over until three hours later this was fortunate for him for a little later came a telegram from john garwell which ran as follows go to albany at once and get papers from caswick sampson this made nat change his plans and he at once found out when a train could be had for albany half an hour later he was aboard of the cars little dreaming of the surprise in store for him chapter xxviii a sudden proposal after the excitement of the chase was at an end nick smithers had a chance to think matters over and he concluded to get out of springfield without delay he was much upset because of nats unexpected appearance and the fact that his satchel and belongings were still at the hotel did not tend to add to his good humor i cant go for those things or send for them he reasoned confound that boy who would ever have dreamed that he would make such trouble for me i took him for a regular country greeny but hes as sharp as a razor for a long time matters had been going illy with nicholas smithers alias hamilton dart alias half a dozen other names he had tried to work one of his swindling schemes in springfield but nobody had taken his bait and his ready funds were consequently running low when he had money he lived extravagantly so that his illgotten gains never lasted him any great length of time something must be done and that pretty soon he reasoned wonder where i had best go next before going to springfield he had had in mind to try albany and now he resolved to go to the latternamed city by the first train this train was the very one upon which nat was riding but the swindler did not immediately discover this some miles out of springfield the train stopped at a small station the only person in waiting was a young lady handsomely dressed who did not appear to have any baggage she got in and as chance would have it took a seat close to the swindler nick smithers had always interested himself in those around him and he looked the young lady over carefully she was certainly beautiful and she appeared to be rich traveling all alone eh mused the swindler and no doubt she has money wonder if i could get anything out of her he watched his chance and when she happened to drop her handkerchief he promptly picked it up charming day said he with a smile it is indeed beautiful said the young lady turning her dark brilliant eyes full upon the rascal do you enjoy riding in the cars he went on with another smile i well i i what will you say to me when i tell you that now for the first time i find myself in the cars for the first time repeated nick smithers in astonishment it is even so said the young lady i do not wonder that you are surprised i i presume there are few cases like mine and she heaved a long sigh here is certainly a mystery thought the confidence man can she have lived all her life in the backwoods or what i must investigate this you are surprised she said softly i must confess that i am madam perhaps you have a dislike to cars no not in the least then and nick smithers paused questioningly i i perhaps i had better tell my story faltered the young lady i need a confidant and i need advice can i trust you sir you assuredly can said the swindler instantly if i can be of any service whatever to you command me the young lady glanced around shyly to see that no other passengers were near i presume i shall have to tell my whole story went on the young lady it is rather long never mind we have plenty of time answered nick smithers my father died when i his only child was very young my mother was already dead my father left a large fortune estimated at that time at about a hundred thousand dollars thats some money thought the swindler i hope she has some of it with her of course it was necessary to leave me in charge of someone for this trust my fathers brother was selected he was poor never having met with the worldly success that crowned my fathers efforts the allowance he received for caring for me and my inheritance was liberal shortly after my father died my uncle moved to the town where i boarded the train living in a house which was a part of my fathers estate i understand said the swindler nodding go on according to the terms of my fathers will my uncle was to have sole charge of my property until i was twentyfive unless i should before that time get get married the young lady blushed it was a stupid provision in one way for it made my uncle take me to that outoftheway place and practically keep me buried alive for fear i would get married before i was twentyfive he wanted to hang on to a good thing said nick smithers with a laugh but please proceed at first i did not understand my uncles motive but as i grew older my eyes were opened and at last i resolved to to well to get out of his power and so you ran away is that it yes this morning i succeeded in eluding my uncles vigil and here i am i came away in such a hurry that i brought with me no extra baggage no doubt you were surprised to see me enter without so much as an extra wrap i thought you might be going only a short distance i scarcely know where i am going then you have formed no plans none whatever i have not had time and i know so little of the world all i care for now is not to fall into the hands of my uncle until until you are twentyfive or married finished the swindler exactly may i presume to ask you your present age yesterday i was twentyone then legally you ought to be your own mistress so i thought that is one thing which gave me the courage to run away there was a short spell of silence during which nick smithers did some rapid thinking he felt that here was a chance to make a round sum of money if this young lady was rich it would be a stroke of luck to get her in his power so far the swindler had never married he had once proposed to a fine girl but she had read him thoroughly and rejected him it might not be a bad scheme to propose to the girl before him he could see that she was very romantic and he was willing to do almost anything for money i feel honored that you have taken me into your confidence said he permit me to introduce myself lancelot powers from boston i am traveling for my health i am pleased to know you mr powers my name is clara rosemead and my father was colonel rosemead of the international cable company i shall consider it my duty to do all i can for you went on nick smithers you you well to tell the strict truth you interest me mightily in fact miss rosemead i cant help but love you oh i trust that you are not offended said the swindler hastily oh no mr powers but i didnt quite expect this but i i well i like you too and again the girl bent her dark brilliant eyes on him if youd marry me youd make me the happiest man in america went on nick smithers it would be so romantic he whispered think of how we met on the cars and fell in love at sight it would be romantic she clasped her hands together ill do it good it will be a fine thing to outwit this uncle of yours yes yes we must outwit him by all means if he should learn of what i am doing he can learn the truth after we are married clara and then nick smithers gave the girls hand a tight squeeze had they been in a more secluded place he would have kissed her i i am happy she said softly what do you say to getting married when we reach albany went on the swindler then we can return to your home and demand that your uncle make a settlement i shall do as you think best lancelot i know i can trust you she answered this is the safest snap yet thought nick smithers once i get hold of her money i can hold her right under my thumb she has been kept in such seclusion that she knows absolutely nothing of the world at large and such a beauty too nick for once you have certainly struck it rich chapter xxix the capture of nick smithers during the next halfhour nick smithers and the young lady became very confidential she stated that she had just fifty dollars with her but did not show the money my uncle is a strange man in some things she said he keeps not less than ten thousand dollars of my money in the house and all in dollar bills he certainly must be strange said nick smithers well it will be an easy matter for him to turn over the bills to you yes lancelot but you will have to take care of the money for me ill certainly do that was the swindlers quick reply and then he smiled to himself over the glorious prospect ahead there was a diningcar attached to the train and not long after the conversation recorded above the swindler asked his bridetobe if she would not take lunch with him why yes she answered i am very hungry for i have not eaten anything since yesterday then come at once was the answer and nick smithers led the way into the dining car he passed nat who was busy devouring a sandwich and a piece of pie but strange to say neither saw the other nick smithers and the young lady had just ordered an elaborate lunch when of a sudden the damsel gave a cry oh what is the trouble questioned the swindler do you see that man and the young lady pointed to a small individual who had just entered the dining car yes what of him he is my my uncle is it possible then he must be following you he is well i shall protect you so do not fear whispered nick smithers remember we are to be married today he shall not stop you he cant do it for you are twentyone oh lancelot i i am so afraid by this time the small man had reached the table at which the couple were seated he stared in amazement hullo miss jacobotson what are you doing here he cried dont touch me screamed the young lady wildly dont touch me this young lady is under my protection came loftily from nick smithers really said the small man since when never mind since when she is under my protection and i do not want you to molest her say do you know who she is asked the little man curiously i do well she has got to go back to the asylum and that is all there is to it asylum gasped nick smithers that is what i said ill not go back screamed the young lady lancelot protect me and she clutched the swindler around the neck do you mean to tell me she belongs in an asylum came faintly from nick smithers she does she escaped from the lunatic asylum at sarville yesterday wha what is her name mary jacobotson her mind was turned years ago by reading romantic novels and she imagines she has an uncle who is keeping her money away from her is she under the charge of an uncle no her father had her placed in the asylum for he couldnt keep her at home her father is a welltodo builder of hartford all this time the young lady who was indeed insane was clinging tightly to nick smithers neck dont leave me she implored i love you dont leave me and you shall have a million dollars and a rubber doll dont leave me augustus i implore thee by the light of yonder stars and now she began to rave i i reckon i made a mistake said the swindler much crestfallen let go of me and now he pushed the raving girl from him the train had stopped at a station and in another moment the asylum keeper had the patient on the platform where she continued to rave then the train moved on sinking back in his seat at the diningcar table the swindler mopped the beads of perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief he was utterly disgusted that is where i certainly put my foot in it he muttered but i can be thankful i didnt marry the girl sorry sar but youll have to settle for this lunch said the waiter if so i reckon ill eat it answered nick smithers and proceeded to do so nat had watched the whole scene with interest at first he was inclined to confront the swindler without delay but then reconsidered the matter i must go slow he mused if im not careful hell get away again when nick smithers left the dining car nat followed him to the smoker and saw the swindler settle down for a comfortable smoke he isnt going to leave the train just yet thought our hero i shouldnt be surprised if he is bound for albany if thats so i had better wait until we arrive there then well be in new york state where the offense was committed the train rattled on and at the proper time rolled into the big station at albany nat kept close behind nick smithers and at the same time looked around anxiously to see if he could find a policeman it was not long before our hero sighted an officer of the law gazing curiously at the crowd leaving the train at once he beckoned the policeman to come to him whats wanted asked the officer anxiously do you see that man yes he is a swindler who is wanted in new york city for swindling several men and myself i want him arrested be careful how you handle him for he ran away from me in springfield you are sure of this i am positive but be careful or he will get away he wont get away from me said the policeman nick smithers was hurrying for the street when nat and the officer of the law came up to him stop nick smithers cried our hero and caught him by the arm the swindler swung around stared at nat and his face fell this is the time you dont get away so easily went on nat officer do your duty youll have to consider yourself under arrest said the policeman this young man makes a charge against you why that young man is a lunatic cried nick smithers thinking of his experience on the train they let him out of the asylum only day before yesterday dont you believe a word of it said nat this rascal is one of the slickest swindlers in the world take him to headquarters and ill go along and prove every word i say youll have to come along said the officer all right ill go answered nick smithers but an instant later he started to run away through the crowd nat however was on guard and putting out a foot he sent the rascal pitching headlong on the depot platform hi what did you do that for demanded nick smithers on arising and he glared at our hero as if to eat him up youll come along with me came angrily from the policeman and without more ceremony he marched the swindler to the police station with our hero following chapter xxx nat comes into his own once at the police station nat made a charge against nick smithers and then the swindler was asked what he had to say for himself this is all a mistake he said i am not the person he is wanted in chicago as well as in new york city went on our hero in the meantime another officer had been looking up nick smithers picture in the rogues gallery i dont think the young man is mistaken he said wait till i telephone to new york for more particulars this was done and inside of an hour the rascals identity was fully established then nick smithers broke down its all up with me and i may as well confess he said scowling at nat but i must say i never thought a country boy would run me down well you see i am not quite as green as i used to be answered nat with a faint smile but you missed it by not coming to me on the quiet went on nick smithers had you done so you might have gotten your hundred dollars back as it is youll not get a cent that remains to be seen answered our hero when nat could get away from the police station he hurried at once to the law offices of messrs caswick sampson as directed by mr garwell so you are the young man john garwell telegraphed about said mr sampson shaking hands i am glad to meet you the business on hand concerns you personally as well as it concerns your employer concerns me ejaculated nat in wonder how is that i am interested in a piece of property located in new york city near central park by some papers which you turned over to mr garwell it would seem that you are likewise interested in the land through my grandfather yes then he really owned a share of the land he did and so far as mr garwell and i can ascertain he never sold out his claim what is the claim worth you will have to ask mr garwell about that he wanted me to sign certain documents and let you take them to new york tonight can you do that i think i can but the police may wish to detain me and then our hero told of the arrest of nick smithers mr sampson became interested and in the end went to the station with nat he knew some of the officials so our hero had no more trouble we shall send the rascal to new york as soon as the officers down there want him said one of the police officials and later on this was done not to lose time our hero took the night train for the metropolis he had a berth in the sleeper but it was a long while before he could get to sleep there were many things to think about and the question of property near central park was an absorbing one arriving in new york he went to his boarding house for breakfast and then hurried down to the office it was not until ten oclock that john garwell appeared did you get the papers from mr sampson was his employers first question yes sir and fix up those matters at springfield too yes mr garwell and i did some other things too added nat i had that rascal hamilton dart alias nick smithers arrested is it possible tell me the particulars and nat did so we must do what we can to get your money back this chap may have some property somewhere well even if i dont get the money back its a satisfaction to put him where he belongs said our hero perhaps youll not be so anxious to get that hundred dollars after youve heard what i have to tell nat went on john garwell with a quiet smile what have you to tell mr garwell its about that property in which your grandfather and your father were interested is there a share coming to me yes what is it worth that remains to be learned the hotel folks want all that tract of land as i told you i shall advise you to hold out for sixty thousand dollars sixty thousand dollars gasped nat thinking he had not heard aright yes do you mean to say that you think my share in that property is worth sixty thousand dollars either that or pretty close to it i would not take a cent less than fiftyfive thousand dollars its a a fortune it certainly is a neat sum of money for any lad to fall heir to i trust if you do get it that you invest it wisely ill do my best to do that mr garwell but this stumps me sixty thousand dollars what will uncle abner say when he hears of it im afraid he will be a bit jealous im jealous myself added the real estate broker with a twinkle in his eye i know you are not answered nat honestly just the same sir if i get that money you are going to have your full share for helping me get it well i shant object to my regular commission and you are going to have more added nat firmly the way matters have turned out will make that shanley of brooklyn sick continued john garwell and it will make rufus cameron sick too the business will be transacted entirely through me and they will not get a cent in commissions well im glad to get back at rufus cameron answered nat i havent forgotten how he treated me his aunt will have nothing more to do with him he has got to support himself i hope it makes a man of him said our hero the next three weeks were busy ones for nat he had to appear against nick smithers who was brought to new york tried and sentenced to several years in prison it was found that there was money coming to the swindler and through this our hero and the others who had put up their money for positions with hamilton dart received what was coming to them it was great of you to run him down said the sick man to nat this return of money will please my sister and i am thankful too added harry bray the day after nick smithers was convicted the deal concerning the property near central park was closed it was shown that a part of the property really belonged to nat and the sum of sixty thousand dollars was eventually turned over to the youth for this but this was not until he was of age nats a rich man now said abner balberry when the youth became twentyone hes got a reglar fortune you shall have something of this uncle abner said our hero and he gave his uncle five thousand dollars in cash he also gave the same amount to john garwell in the meantime our hero had stuck close to the realestate business and learned it thoroughly he was still john garwells private clerk are you going to leave me now you have your fortune questioned the real estate broker anxiously do you want me to leave no indeed how would you like to take me in as a partner mr garwell id like it firstrate nat in fact i was going to mention that myself then let us form a partnership and this was done without delay the new firm prospered from the very start much to the satisfaction of all concerned in the meantime nat did not forget his old friends the talcotts although he no longer lived with them he visited them often he learned through the widow that her son was anxious to buy out the store in which he worked the price was twelve hundred dollars and one day nat bought it and had the transfer made out in dicks name you deserve this dick said he when i was a stranger and mighty green you did your best by me well youve paid me back said dick with a grin youre a gentleman nat you are and how about being green youre not green any more youre as smart as they make em since then the years have rolled on nat is still in
