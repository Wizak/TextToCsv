 the raven once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visiter i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing more ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost lenore for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore nameless here for evermore and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door this it is and nothing more presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door darkness there and nothing more deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore tis the wind and nothing more open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door perched and sat and nothing more then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as nevermore but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only that one word as if its soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before then the bird said nevermore startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of never nevermore but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermore this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer she shall press ah nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted on this home by horror haunted tell me truly i implore is there is there balm in gilead tell me tell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above us by that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermore be that our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermore and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadows on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted nevermore the masque of the red death by edgar allan poe october etext the masque of the red death the red death had long devastated the country no pestilence had ever been so fatal or so hideous blood was its avatar and its seal the redness and the horror of blood there were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution the scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellowmen and the whole seizure progress and termination of the disease were the incidents of half an hour but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious when his dominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys this was an extensive and magnificent structure the creation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste a strong and lofty wall girdled it in this wall had gates of iron the courtiers having entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within the abbey was amply provisioned with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion the external world could take care of itself in the meantime it was folly to grieve or to think the prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure there were buffoons there were improvisatori there were balletdancers there were musicians there was beauty there was wine all these and security were within without was the red death it was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the prince prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held these were seven an imperial suite in many palaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded here the case was very different as might have been expected from the dukes love of the bizarre the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect to the right and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite these windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened that at the eastern extremity was hung for example in blue and vividly blue were its windows the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes were purple the third was green throughout and so were the casements the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange the fifth with white the sixth with violet the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue but in this chamber only the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations the panes here were scarlet a deep blood colour now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof there was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers but in the corridors that followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavy tripod bearing a brazier of fire that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances but in the western or black chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the dark hangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all it was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuit of the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that at each lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause momentarily in their performance to harken to the sound and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of the clock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation but when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel the tastes of the duke were peculiar he had a fine eye for colours and effects he disregarded the decora of mere fashion his plans were bold and fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre there are some who would have thought him mad his followers felt that he was not it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not he had directed in great part the movable embellishments of the seven chambers upon occasion of this great fete and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders be sure they were grotesque there were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm much of what has been since seen in hernani there were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions there were much of the beautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of the terrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude of dreams and these the dreams writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet and then for a moment all is still and all is silent save the voice of the clock the dreams are stifffrozen as they stand but the echoes of the chime die away they have endured but an instant and a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as they depart and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods but to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows a ruddier light through the bloodcoloured panes and the blackness of the sable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life and the revel went whirlingly on until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock and then the music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled and thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before and the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprise then finally of terror of horror and of disgust in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation in truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited but the figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the bounds of even the princes indefinite decorum there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion even with the utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there are matters of which no jest can be made the whole company indeed seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed the figure was tall and gaunt and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat and yet all this might have been endured if not approved by the mad revellers around but the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death his vesture was dabbled in blood and his broad brow with all the features of the face was besprinkled with the scarlet horror when the eyes of the prince prospero fell upon this spectral image which with a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its role stalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste but in the next his brow reddened with rage who dares he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery seize him and unmask him that we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from the battlements it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prospero as he uttered these words they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly for the prince was a bold and robust man and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of pale courtiers by his side at first as he spoke there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at the moment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately step made closer approach to the speaker but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so that unimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and while the vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first through the blue chamber to the purple through the purple to the green through the green to the orange through this again to the white and even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him it was then however that the prince prospero maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushed hurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all he bore aloft a drawn dagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three or four feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer there was a sharp cry and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in death the prince prospero then summoning the wild courage of despair a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpselike mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death he had come like a thief in the night and one by one dropped the revellers in the bloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairing posture of his fall and the life of the ebony clock went out with that of the last of the gay and the flames of the tripods expired and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all the cask of amontillado by edgar allan poe october etext the cask of amontillado the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge you who so well know the nature of my soul will not suppose however that i gave utterance to a threat at length i would be avenged this was a point definitely settled but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk i must not only punish but punish with impunity a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will i continued as was my wont to smile in his face and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation he had a weak point this fortunato although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine few italians have the true virtuoso spirit for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires in painting and gemmary fortunato like his countrymen was a quack but in the matter of old wines he was sincere in this respect i did not differ from him materially i was skillful in the italian vintages myself and bought largely whenever i could it was about dusk one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season that i encountered my friend he accosted me with excessive warmth for he had been drinking much the man wore motley he had on a tightfitting partistriped dress and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand i said to him my dear fortunato you are luckily met how remarkably well you are looking today but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado and i have my doubts how said he amontillado a pipe impossible and in the middle of the carnival i have my doubts i replied and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter you were not to be found and i was fearful of losing a bargain amontillado i have my doubts amontillado and i must satisfy them amontillado as you are engaged i am on my way to luchesi if any one has a critical turn it is he he will tell me luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own come let us go whither to your vaults my friend no i will not impose upon your good nature i perceive you have an engagement luchesi i have no engagement come my friend no it is not the engagement but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted the vaults are insufferably damp they are encrusted with nitre let us go nevertheless the cold is merely nothing amontillado you have been imposed upon and as for luchesi he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado thus speaking fortunato possessed himself of my arm putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo there were no attendants at home they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time i had told them that i should not return until the morning and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house these orders were sufficient i well knew to insure their immediate disappearance one and all as soon as my back was turned i took from their sconces two flambeaux and giving one to fortunato bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults i passed down a long and winding staircase requesting him to be cautious as he followed we came at length to the foot of the descent and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors the gait of my friend was unsteady and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode the pipe said he it is farther on said i but observe the white webwork which gleams from these cavern walls he turned towards me and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication nitre he asked at length nitre i replied how long have you had that cough ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh ugh my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes it is nothing he said at last come i said with decision we will go back your health is precious you are rich respected admired beloved you are happy as once i was you are a man to be missed for me it is no matter we will go back you will be ill and i cannot be responsible besides there is luchesi enough he said the cough is a mere nothing it will not kill me i shall not die of a cough true true i replied and indeed i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily but you should use all proper caution a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould drink i said presenting him the wine he raised it to his lips with a leer he paused and nodded to me familiarly while his bells jingled i drink he said to the buried that repose around us and i to your long life he again took my arm and we proceeded these vaults he said are extensive the montresors i replied were a great and numerous family i forget your arms a huge human foot dor in a field azure the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel and the motto nemo me impune lacessit good he said the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled my own fancy grew warm with the medoc we had passed through walls of piled bones with casks and puncheons intermingling into the inmost recesses of catacombs i paused again and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow the nitre i said see it increases it hangs like moss upon the vaults we are below the rivers bed the drops of moisture trickle among the bones come we will go back ere it is too late your cough it is nothing he said let us go on but first another draught of the medoc i broke and reached him a flagon of de grave he emptied it at a breath his eyes flashed with a fierce light he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand i looked at him in surprise he repeated the movement a grotesque one you do not comprehend he said not i i replied then you are not of the brotherhood how you are not of the masons yes yes i said yes yes you impossible a mason a mason i replied a sign he said a sign it is this i answered producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire you jest he exclaimed recoiling a few paces but let us proceed to the amontillado be it so i said replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm he leaned upon it heavily we continued our route in search of the amontillado we passed through a range of low arches descended passed on and descending again arrived at a deep crypt in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious its walls had been lined with human remains piled to the vault overhead in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner from the fourth side the bones had been thrown down and lay promiscuously upon the earth forming at one point a mound of some size within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones we perceived a still interior recess in depth about four feet in width three in height six or seven it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite it was in vain that fortunato uplifting his dull torch endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see proceed i said herein is the amontillado as for luchesi he is an ignoramus interrupted my friend as he stepped unsteadily forward while i followed immediately at his heels in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche and finding his progress arrested by the rock stood stupidly bewildered a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite in its surface were two iron staples distant from each other about two feet horizontally from one of these depended a short chain from the other a padlock throwing the links about his waist it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it he was too much astounded to resist withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess pass your hand i said over the wall you cannot help feeling the nitre indeed it is very damp once more let me implore you to return no then i must positively leave you but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power the amontillado ejaculated my friend not yet recovered from his astonishment true i replied the amontillado as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken throwing them aside i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar with these materials and with the aid of my trowel i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche i had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess it was not the cry of a drunken man there was then a long and obstinate silence i laid the second tier and the third and the fourth and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain the noise lasted for several minutes during which that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction i ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones when at last the clanking subsided i resumed the trowel and finished without interruption the fifth the sixth and the seventh tier the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast i again paused and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within a succession of loud and shrill screams bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form seemed to thrust me violently back for a brief moment i hesitated i trembled unsheathing my rapier i began to grope with it about the recess but the thought of an instant reassured me i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs and felt satisfied i reapproached the wall i replied to the yells of him who clamoured i reechoed i aided i surpassed them in volume and in strength i did this and the clamourer grew still it was now midnight and my task was drawing to a close i had completed the eighth the ninth and the tenth tier i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in i struggled with its weight i placed it partially in its destined position but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head it was succeeded by a sad voice which i had difficulty in recognizing as that of the noble fortunato the voice said ha ha ha he he he a very good joke indeed an excellent jest we shall have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo he he he over our wine he he he the amontillado i said he he he he he he yes the amontillado but is it not getting late will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo the lady fortunato and the rest let us be gone yes i said let us be gone for the love of god montresor yes i said for the love of god but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply i grew impatient i called aloud fortunato no answer i called again fortunato no answer still i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within there came forth in reply only a jingling of the bells my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs i hastened to make an end of my labour i forced the last stone into its position i plastered it up against the new masonry i reerected the old rampart of bones for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them in pace requiescat
