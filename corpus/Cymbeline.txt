youll go with us first lord ill attend your lordship cloten nay come lets go together second lord well my lord exeunt scene iii britain cymbelines palace enter imogen and pisanio imogen i would thou grewst unto the shores o th haven and questionedst every sail if he should write and i not have it twere a paper lost as offerd mercy is what was the last that he spake to thee pisanio it was his queen his queen imogen then wavd his handkerchief pisanio and kissd it madam imogen senseless linen happier therein than i and that was all pisanio no madam for so long as he could make me with his eye or care distinguish him from others he did keep the deck with glove or hat or handkerchief still waving as the fits and stirs ofs mind could best express how slow his soul saild on how swift his ship imogen thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow or less ere left to aftereye him pisanio madam so i did imogen i would have broke mine eyestrings crackd them but to look upon him till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle nay followed him till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air and then have turnd mine eye and wept but good pisanio when shall we hear from him pisanio be assurd madam with his next vantage imogen i did not take my leave of him but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour or have chargd him at the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight t encounter me with orisons for then i am in heaven for him or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing enter a lady lady the queen madam desires your highness company imogen those things i bid you do get them dispatchd i will attend the queen pisanio madam i shall exeunt scene iv rome philarios house enter philario iachimo a frenchman a dutchman and a spaniard iachimo believe it sir i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of but i could then have lookd on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items philario you speak of him when he was less furnishd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within frenchman i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he iachimo this matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him i doubt not a great deal from the matter frenchman and then his banishment iachimo ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality but how comes it he is to sojourn with you how creeps acquaintance philario his father and i were soldiers together to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life enter posthumus here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his quality i beseech you all be better known to this gentleman whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his own hearing frenchman sir we have known together in orleans posthumus since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still frenchman sir you oerrate my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature posthumus by your pardon sir i was then a young traveller rather shunnd to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgment if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight frenchman faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have falln both iachimo can we with manners ask what was the difference frenchman safely i think twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report it was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france iachimo that lady is not now living or this gentlemans opinion by this worn out posthumus she holds her virtue still and i my mind iachimo you must not so far prefer her fore ours of italy posthumus being so far provokd as i was in france i would abate her nothing though i profess myself her adorer not her friend iachimo as fair and as good a kind of handinhand comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain if she went before others i have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady posthumus i praisd her as i rated her so do i my stone iachimo what do you esteem it at posthumus more than the world enjoys iachimo either your unparagond mistress is dead or shes outprizd by a trifle posthumus you are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods iachimo which the gods have given you posthumus which by their graces i will keep iachimo you may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds your ring may be stoln too so your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a thatwayaccomplishd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last posthumus your italy contains none so accomplishd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding i fear not my ring philario let us leave here gentlemen posthumus sir with all my heart this worthy signior i thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first iachimo with five times so much conversation i should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had i admittance and opportunity to friend posthumus no no iachimo i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion oervalues it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too i durst attempt it against any lady in the world posthumus you are a great deal abusd in too bold a persuasion and i doubt not you sustain what yare worthy of by your attempt iachimo whats that posthumus a repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more a punishment too philario gentlemen enough of this it came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and i pray you be better acquainted iachimo would i had put my estate and my neighbours on th approbation of what i have spoke posthumus what lady would you choose to assail iachimo yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reservd posthumus i will wage against your gold gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger tis part of it iachimo you are a friend and therein the wiser if you buy ladies flesh at a million a dram you cannot preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you that you fear posthumus this is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose i hope iachimo i am the master of my speeches and would undergo whats spoken i swear posthumus will you i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn betweens my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match heres my ring philario i will have it no lay iachimo by the gods it is one if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too if i come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment posthumus i embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevaild i am no further your enemy she is not worth our debate if she remain unseducd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword iachimo your hand a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded posthumus agreed exeunt posthumus and iachimo frenchman will this hold think you philario signior iachimo will not from it pray let us follow em exeunt scene v britain cymbelines palace enter queen

judgment in other conclusions i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging but none human to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act and by them gather their several virtues and effects cornelius your highness shall from this practice but make hard your heart besides the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious

know her spirit and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damnd nature those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile which first perchance shell prove on cats and dogs then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes more than the locking up the spirits a time to be more fresh reviving she is foold with a most false effect and i the truer so to be false with her queen no further service doctor until i send for thee cornelius i humbly take my leave exit queen weeps she still sayst thou dost thou think in time she will not quench and let

philario your very goodness and your company oerpays all i can do by this your king hath heard of great augustus caius lucius will dos commission throughly and i think hell grant the tribute send th arrearages or look upon our romans whose remembrance is yet fresh in their grief posthumus i do believe statist though i am none nor like to be that this will prove a war and you shall hear the legions now in gallia sooner landed in our notfearing britain than have tidings of any penny tribute paid our countrymen are men more orderd than when julius caesar smild at their lack of skill but found their courage worthy his frowning at their discipline now mingled with their courages will make known to their approvers they are people such that mend upon the world enter iachimo philario see iachimo posthumus the swiftest harts have posted you by land and winds of all the comers kissd your sails to make your vessel nimble philario welcome sir posthumus i hope the briefness of your answer made the speediness of your return iachimo your lady is one of the fairest that i have lookd upon posthumus and therewithal the best or let her beauty look through a casement to allure false hearts and be false with them iachimo here are letters for you posthumus their tenour good i trust iachimo tis very like philario was caius lucius in the britain court when you were there iachimo he was expected then but not approachd posthumus all is well yet sparkles this stone as it was wont or ist not too dull for your good wearing iachimo if i have lost it i should have lost the worth of it in gold ill make a journey twice as far t enjoy a second night of such sweet shortness which was mine in britain for the ring is won posthumus the stones too hard to come by iachimo not a whit your lady being so easy posthumus make not sir your loss your sport i hope you know that we must not continue friends iachimo good sir we must if you keep covenant had i not brought the knowledge of your mistress home i grant we were to question farther but i now profess myself the winner of her honour together with your ring and not the wronger of her or you having proceeded but by both your wills posthumus if you can maket apparent that you have tasted her in bed my hand and ring is yours if not the foul opinion you had of her pure honour gains or loses your sword or mine or masterless leaves both to who shall find them iachimo sir my circumstances being so near the truth as i will make them must first induce you to believe whose strength i will confirm with oath which i doubt not youll give me leave to spare when you shall find you need it not posthumus proceed iachimo first her bedchamber where i confess i slept not but profess had that was well worth watchingit was hangd with tapestry of silk and silver the story proud cleopatra when she met her roman and cydnus swelld above the banks or for the press of boats or pride a piece of work so bravely done so rich that it did strive in workmanship and value which i wonderd could be so rarely and exactly wrought since the true life ont was posthumus this is true and this you might have heard of here by me or by some other iachimo more particulars must justify my knowledge posthumus so they must or do your honour injury iachimo the chimney is south the chamber and the chimneypiece chaste dian bathing never saw i figures so likely to report themselves the cutter was as another nature dumb outwent her motion and breath left out posthumus this is a thing which you might from relation likewise reap being as it is much spoke of iachimo the roof o th chamber with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons i had forgot them were two winking cupids of silver each on one foot standing nicely depending on their brands posthumus this is her honour let it be granted you have seen all this and praise be given to your remembrance the description of what is in her chamber nothing saves the wager you have laid iachimo then if you can shows the bracelet be pale i beg but leave to air this jewel see and now tis up again it must be married to that your diamond ill keep them posthumus jove once more let me behold it is it that which i left with her iachimo sir i thank her that she strippd it from her arm i see her yet her pretty action did outsell her gift and yet enrichd it too she gave it me and said she prizd it once posthumus may be she pluckd it of to send it me iachimo she writes so to you doth she posthumus o no no no tis true here take this too gives the ring it is a basilisk unto mine eye kills me to look ont let there be no honour where there is beauty truth where semblance love where theres another man the vows of women of no more bondage be to where they are made than they are to their virtues which is nothing o above measure false philario have patience sir and take your ring again tis not yet won it may be probable she lost it or who knows if one her women being corrupted hath stoln it from her posthumus very true and so i hope he came byt back my ring render to me some corporal sign about her more evident than this for this was stoln iachimo by jupiter i had it from her arm posthumus hark you he swears by jupiter he swears tis true nay keep the ring tis true i am sure she would not lose it her attendants are all sworn and honourable they inducd to steal it and by a stranger no he hath enjoyd her the cognizance of her incontinency is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly there take thy hire and all the fiends of hell divide themselves between you philario sir be patient this is not strong enough to be believd of one persuaded well of posthumus never talk ont she hath been colted by him iachimo if you seek for further satisfying under her breast worthy the pressing lies a mole right proud of that most delicate lodging by my life i kissd it and it gave me present hunger to feed again though full you do remember this stain upon her posthumus ay and it doth confirm another stain as big as hell can hold were there no more but it iachimo will you hear more posthumus spare your arithmetic never count the turns once and a million iachimo ill be sworn posthumus no swearing if you will swear you have not donet you lie and i will kill thee if thou dost deny thoust made me cuckold iachimo ill deny nothing posthumus o that i had her here to tear her limbmeal i will go there and dot i th court before her father ill do something exit philario quite besides the government of patience you have won lets follow him and pervert the present wrath he hath against himself iachimo with all my heart exeunt scene v rome another room in philarios house enter posthumus posthumus is there no way for men to be but women must be halfworkers we are all bastards and that most venerable man which i did call my father was i know not where when i was stampd some coiner with his tools made me a counterfeit yet my mother seemd the

yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately is left untenderd queen and to kill the marvel shall be so ever cloten there be many caesars ere such another julius britain is a world by itself and we will nothing pay for wearing our own noses queen that opportunity which then they had to take from s to resume we have again remember sir my liege the kings your ancestors together with the natural bravery of your isle which stands as neptunes park ribbd and pald in with rocks unscalable and roaring waters with sands that will not bear your enemies boats but suck them up to th topmast a kind of

ignorant baubles on our terrible seas like eggshells movd upon their surges crackd as easily gainst our rocks for joy whereof the famd cassibelan who was once at point o giglot fortune to master caesars sword made luds town with rejoicing fires bright and britons strut with courage cloten come theres no more tribute to be paid our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as i said

do not say i am one but i have a hand why tribute why should we pay tribute if caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now cymbeline you must know till the injurious romans did extort this tribute from us we were free caesars ambition which swelld so much that it did almost stretch the sides o th world against all colour here did put the yoke upons which to shake of becomes a warlike people whom we reckon ourselves to be cloten we do cymbeline say then to caesar our ancestor was that mulmutius which ordaind our laws whose use the sword of caesar hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise shall by the power we hold be our good deed though rome be therefore angry mulmutius made our laws who was the first of britain which did put his brows within a golden crown and calld himself a king lucius i am sorry cymbeline that i am to pronounce augustus caesar caesar that hath moe kings his servants than thyself domestic officers thine enemy receive it from me then war and confusion in caesars name pronounce i gainst thee look for fury not to be resisted thus defied i thank thee for myself cymbeline thou art welcome caius thy caesar knighted me my youth i spent much under him of him i gatherd honour which he to seek of me again perforce behoves me keep at utterance i am perfect that the pannonians and dalmatians for their liberties are now in arms a precedent which not to read would show the britons cold so caesar shall not find them lucius let proof speak cloten his
