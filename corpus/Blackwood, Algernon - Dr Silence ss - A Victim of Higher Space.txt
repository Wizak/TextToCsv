a victim of higher space from day and night stories by algernon blackwood theres a hextraordinary gentleman to see you sir said the new man why extraordinary asked dr silence drawing the tips of his thin fingers through his brown beard his eyes twinkled pleasantly why extraordinary barker he repeated encouragingly noticing the perplexed expression in the mans eyes hes soso thin sir i could hardly see im at allat first he was inside the house before i could ask the name he added remembering strict orders and who brought him here he come alone sir in a closed cab he pushed by me before i could say a wordmaking no noise not what i could hear he seemed to move very soft the man stopped short with obvious embarrassment as though he had already said enough to jeopardise his new situation but trying hard to show that he remembered the instructions and warnings he had received with regard to the admission of strangers not properly accredited and where is the gentleman now asked dr silence turning away to conceal his amusement i really couldnt exactly say sir i left him standing in the all the doctor looked up sharply but why in the hall barker why not in the waitingroom he fixed his piercing though kindly eyes on the mans face did he frighten you he asked quickly i think he did sir if i may say so i seemed to lose sight of him as it were the man stammered evidently convinced by now that he had earned his dismissal he come in so funny just like a cold wind he added boldly setting his heels at attention and looking his master full in the face the doctor made an internal note of the mans halting description he was pleased that the slight evidence of intuition which had induced him to engage barker had not entirely failed at the first trial dr silence sought for this qualification in all his assistants from secretary to servingman and if it surrounded him with a somewhat singular crew the drawbacks were more than compensated for on the whole by their occasional flashes of insight so the gentleman made you feel queer did he that was it i think sir repeated the man stolidly and he brings no kind of introduction to meno letter or anything asked the doctor with feigned surprise as though he knew what was coming the man fumbled both in mind and pockets and finally produced an envelope i beg pardon sir he said greatly flustered the gentleman handed me this for you it was a note from a discerning friend who had never yet sent him a case that was not vitally interesting from one point or another please see the bearer of this note the brief message ran though i doubt if even you can do much to help him john silence paused a moment so as to gather from the mind of the writer all that lay behind the brief words of the letter then he looked up at his servant with a graver expression than he had yet worn go back and find this gentleman he said and show him into the green study do not reply to his question or speak more than actually necessary but think kind helpful sympathetic thoughts as strongly as you can barker you remember what i told you about the importance of thinking when i engaged you put curiosity out of your mind and think gently sympathetically affectionately if you can he smiled and barker who had recovered his composure in the doctors presence bowed silently and went out there were two different reception rooms in dr silences house one intended for persons who imagined they needed spiritual assistance when really they were only candidates for the asylum had padded walls and was well supplied with various concealed contrivances by means of which sudden violence could be instantly met and overcome it was however rarely used the other intended for the reception of genuine cases of spiritual distress and outoftheway afflictions of a psychic nature was entirely draped and furnished in a soothing deep green calculated to induce calmness and repose of mind and this room was the one in which dr silence interviewed the majority of his queer cases and the one into which he had directed barker to show his present caller to begin with the armchair in which the patient was always directed to sit was nailed to the floor since its immovability tended to impart this same excellent characteristic to the occupant patients invariably grew excited when talking about themselves and their excitement tended to confuse their thoughts and to exaggerate their language the immobility of the chair helped to counteract this after repeated endeavours to drag it forward or push it back they ended by resigning themselves to sitting quietly and with the futility of fidgeting there followed a calmer state of mind upon the floor and at intervals in the wall immediately behind were certain tiny green buttons practically unnoticeable which on being pressed permitted a soothing and persuasive narcotic to rise invisibly about the occupant of the chair the effect upon the excitable patient was rapid admirable and harmless the green study was further provided with a secret spyhole for john silence liked when possible to observe his patients face before it had assumed that mask the features of the human countenance invariably wear in the presence of another person a man sitting alone wears a psychic expression and this expression is the man himself it disappears the moment another person joins him and dr silence often learned more from a few moments secret observation of a face than from hours of conversation with its owner afterwards a very light almost a dancing step followed barkers heavy tread towards the green room and a moment afterwards the man came in and announced that the gentleman was waiting he was still pale and his manner nervous never mind barker the doctor said kindly if you were not intuitive the man would have had no effect upon you at all you only need training and development and when you have learned to interpret these feelings and sensations better you will feel no fear but only a great sympathy yes sir thank you sir and barker bowed and made his escape while dr silence an amused smile lurking about the corners of his mouth made his way noiselessly down the passage and put his eye to the spyhole in the door of the green study this spyhole was so placed that it commanded a view of almost the entire room and looking through it the doctor saw a hat gloves and umbrella lying on a chair by the table but searched at first in vain for their owner the windows were both closed and a brisk fire burned in the grate there were various signssigns intelligible at least to a keenly intuitive soulthat the room was occupied yet so far as human beings were concerned it seemed undeniably empty no one sat in the chairs no one stood on the mat before the fire there was no sign even that a patient was anywhere close against the wall examining the bцcklin reproductionas patients so often did when they thought they were aloneand therefore rather difficult to see from the spyhole ordinarily speaking there was no one in the room it was unoccupied yet dr silence was quite well aware that a human being was in the room his sensitive system never failed to let him know the proximity of an incarnate or discarnate being even in the dark he could tall that and he now knew positively that his patient the patient who had alarmed barker and had then tripped down the corridor with that dancing footstepwas somewhere concealed within the four walls commanded by his spyhole he also realisedand this was most unusualthat this individual whom he desired to watch knew that he was being watched and further that the stranger himself was also watching in his turn in fact that it was he the doctor who was being observedand by an observer as keen and trained as himself an inkling of the true state of the case began to dawn upon him and he was on the verge of enteringindeed his hand already touched the doorknobwhen his eye still glued to the spyhole detected a slight movement directly opposite between him and the fireplace something stirred he watched very attentively and made certain that he was not mistaken an object on the mantelpieceit was a blue vasedisappeared from view it passed out of sight together with the portion of the marble mantelpiece on which it rested next that part of the fire and grate and brass fender immediately below it vanished entirely as though a slice had been taken clean out of them dr silence then understood that something between him and these objects was slowly coming into being something that concealed them and obstructed his vision by inserting itself in the line of sight between them and himself he quietly awaited further results before going in first he saw a thin perpendicular line tracing itself from just above the height of the clock and continuing downwards till it reached the woolly firemat this line grew wider broadened grew solid it was no shadow it was something substantial it defined itself more and more then suddenly at the top of the line and about on a level with the face of the clock he saw a small luminous disc gazing steadily at him it was a human eye looking straight into his own pressed there against the spyhole and it was bright with intelligence dr silence held his breath for a momentand stared back at it then like someone moving out of deep shadow into light he saw the figure of a man come sliding sideways into view a whitish face following the eye and the perpendicular line he had first observed broadening out and developing into the complete figure of a human being it was the patient he had apparently been standing there in front of the fire all the time a second eye had followed the first and both of them stared steadily at the spyhole sharply concentrated yet with a sly twinkle of humour and amusement that made it impossible for the doctor to maintain his position any longer he opened the door and went in quickly as he did so he noticed for the first time the sound of a german band coming in noisily through the open ventilators in some intuitive unaccountable fashion the music connected itself with the patient he was about to interview this sort of prevision was not unfamiliar to him it always explained itself later the man he saw was of middle age and of very ordinary appearance so ordinary in fact that he was difficult to describehis only peculiarity being his extreme thinness pleasantthat is goodvibrations issued from his atmosphere and met dr silence as he advanced to greet him yet vibrations alive with currents and discharges betraying the perturbed and disordered condition of his mind and brain there was evidently something wholly out of the usual in the state of his thoughts yet though strange it was not altogether distressing it was not the impression that the broken and violent atmosphere of the insane produces upon the mind dr silence realised in a flash that here was a case of absorbing interest that might require all his powers to handle properly i was watching you through my little peepholeas you saw he began with a pleasant smile advancing to shake hands i find it of the greatest assistance sometimes but the patient interrupted him at once his voice was hurried and had odd shrill changes in it breaking from high to low in unexpected fashion one moment it thundered the next it almost squeaked i understand without explanation he broke in rapidly you get the true note of a man in that waywhen he thinks himself unobserved i quite agree only in my case i fear you saw very little my case as you of course grasp dr silence is extremely peculiar uncomfortably peculiar indeed unless sir william had positively assured me my friend has sent you to me the doctor interrupted gravely with a gentle note of authority and that is quite sufficient pray be seated mr mudgeracine mudge returned the other take this comfortable one mr mudge leading him to the fixed chair and tell me your condition in your own way and at your own pace my whole day is at your service if you require it mr mudge moved towards the chair in question and then hesitated you will promise me not to use the narcotic buttons he said before sitting down i do not need them also i ought to mention that anything you think of vividly will reach my mind that is apparently part of my peculiar case he sat down with a sigh and arranged his thin legs and body into a position of comfort evidently he was very sensitive to the thoughts of others for the picture of the green buttons had only entered the doctors mind for a second yet the other had instantly snapped it up dr silence noticed too that mr mudge held on tightly with both hands to the arms of the chair im rather glad the chair is nailed to the floor he remarked as he settled himself more comfortably it suits me admirably the fact is and this is my case in a nutshellwhich is all that a doctor of your marvellous development requiresthe fact is dr silence i am a victim of higher space thats whats the matter with mehigher space the two looked at each other for a space in silence the little patient holding tightly to the arms of the chair which suited him admirably and looking up with staring eyes his atmosphere positively trembling with the waves of some unknown activity while the doctor smiled kindly and sympathetically and put his whole person as far as possible into the mental condition of the other higher space repeated mr mudge thats what it is now do you think you can help me with that there was a pause during which the mens eyes steadily searched down below the surface of their respective personalities then dr silence spoke i am quite sure i can help he answered quietly sympathy must always help and suffering always claims my sympathy i see you have suffered cruelly you must tell me all about your case and when i hear the gradual steps by which you reached this strange condition i have no doubt i can be of assistance to you he drew a chair up beside his interlocutor and laid a hand on his shoulder for a moment his whole being radiated kindness intelligence desire to help for instance he went on i feel sure it was the result of no mere chance that you became familiar with the terrors of what you term higher space for higher space is no mere external measurement it is of course a spiritual state a spiritual condition an inner development and one that we must recognise as abnormal since it is beyond the reach of the senses at the present stage of evolution higher space is a mystical state oh cried the other rubbing his birdlike hands with pleasure the relief it is to me to talk to someone who can understand of course what you say is the utter truth and you are right that no mere chance led me to my present condition but on the other hand prolonged and deliberate study yet chance in a sense now governs it i mean my entering the condition of higher space seems to depend upon the chance of this and that circumstance he sighed and paused a moment for instance he continued starting the mere sound of that german band sent me off not that all music will do so but certain sounds certain vibrations at once key me up to the requisite pitch and off i go wagners music always does it and that band must have been playing a stray bit of wagner but ill come to all that later only firsthe smiled deprecatingyi must ask you to send away your man from the spyhole john silence looked up with a start for mr mudges back was to the door and there was no mirror he saw the brown eye of barker glued to the little circle of glass and he crossed the room without a word and snapped down the black shutter provided for the purpose and then heard barker shuffle away along the passage now continued the little man in the chair i can go on you have managed to put me completely at my ease and i feel i may tell you my whole case without shame or reserve you will understand but you must be patient with me if i go into details that are already familiar to youdetails of higher space i meanand if i seem stupid when i have to describe things that transcend the power of language and are really therefore indescribable my dear friend put in the other calmly that goes without saying to know higher space is an experience that defies description and one is obliged to make use of more or less intelligible symbols but pray proceed your vivid thoughts will tell me more than your halting words an immense sigh of relief proceeded from the little figure half lost in the depths of the chair such intelligent sympathy meeting him halfway was a new experience and it touched his heart at once he leaned back relaxing his tight hold of the arms and began in his thin scalelike voice my mother was a frenchwoman and my father an essex bargeman he said abruptly hence my nameracine and mudge my father died before i ever saw him my mother inherited money from her bordeaux relations and when she died soon after i was left alone with wealth and a strange freedom i had no guardian trustees sisters brothers or any connection in the world to look after me i grew up therefore utterly without education this much was to my advantage i learned none of that deceitful rubbish taught in schools and so had nothing to unlearn when i awakened to my true lovemathematics higher mathematics and higher geometry these however i seemed to know instinctively it was like the memory of what i had deeply studied before the principles were in my blood and i simply raced through the ordinary stages and beyond and then did the same with geometry afterwards when i read the books on these subjects i understood how swift and undeviating the knowledge had come back to me it was simply memory it was simply recollecting the memories of what i had known before in a previous existence and required no books to teach me in his growing excitement mr mudge attempted to drag the chair forward a little nearer to his listener and then smiled faintly as he resigned himself instantly again to its immobility and plunged anew into the recital of his singular disease the audacious speculations of bolyai the amazing theories of gaussthat through a point more than one line could be drawn parallel to a given line the possibility that the angles of a triangle are together greater than two right angles if drawn upon immense curvaturesthe breathless intuitions of beltrami and lobatchewskyall these i hurried through and emerged panting but unsatisfied upon the verge of mymy world my higher space possibilitiesin a word my disease how i got there he resumed after a brief pause during which he appeared to be listening nervously for an approaching sound is more than i can put intelligibly into words i can only hope to leave your mind with an intuitive comprehension of the possibility of what i say here however came a change at this point i was no longer absorbing the fruits of studies i had made before it was the beginning of new efforts to learn for the first time and i had to go slowly and laboriously through terrible work here i sought for the theories and speculations of others but books were few and far between and with the exception of one mana dreamer the world called himwhose audacity and piercing intuition amazed and delighted me beyond description i found no one to guide or help you of course dr silence understand something of what i am driving at with these stammering words though you cannot perhaps yet guess what depths of pain my new knowledge brought me to nor why an acquaintance with a new dimension of space should prove a source of misery and terror mr racine mudge remembering that the chair would not move did the next best thing he could in his desire to draw nearer to the attentive man facing him and sat forward upon the very edge of the cushions crossing his legs and gesticulating with both hands as though he saw into this region of new space he was attempting to describe and might any moment tumble into it bodily from the edge of the chair and disappear from view john silence separated from him by three aces sat with his eyes fixed upon the thin white face opposite noting every word and every gesture with deep attention this room we now sit in dr silence has one side open to spaceto higher space a closed box only seems closed there is a way in and out of a soap bubble without breaking the skin you tell me no new thing the doctor interposed gently hence if higher space exists and our world borders upon it and lies partially in it if follows necessarily that we see only portions of all objects we never see their true and complete shape we see three measurements but not their fourth the new direction is concealed from us and when i hold this book and move my hand all round it i have not really made a complete circuit we only perceive those portions of any object which exist in our three dimensions the rest escapes us but once learn to see in higher space and objects will appear as they actually are only they will thus be hardly recognisable now you may begin to grasp something of what i am coming to i am beginning to understand something of what you must have suffered observed the doctor soothingly for i have made similar experiments myself and only stopped just in time you are the one man in all the world who can understand and sympathise exclaimed mr mudge grasping his hand and holding it tightly while he spoke the nailed chair prevented further excitability well he resumed after a moments pause i procured the implements and the coloured blocks for practical experiment and i followed the instructions carefully till i had arrived at an imaginative conception of four dimensional space the tessaract the figure whose boundaries are cubes i knew by heart that is to say i knew it and saw it mentally for my eye of course could never take in a new measurement nor my hands and feet handle it so at least i thought he added making a wry face i had reached the stage you see when i could imagine in a new dimension i was able to conceive the shape of that new figure which is intrinsically different to all we knowthe shape of the tessaract i could perceive in four dimensions when therefore i looked at a cube i could see all its sides at once its top was not foreshortened nor its farther side and base invisible i saw the whole thing out flat so to speak moreover i also saw its contentits insides you were not yourself able to enter this new world interrupted dr silence not then i was only able to conceive intuitively what it was like and how exactly it must look later when i slipped in there and saw objects in their entirety unlimited by the paucity of our poor three measurements i very nearly lost my life for you see space does not stop at a single new dimension a fourth it extends in all possible new ones and we must conceive it as containing any number of new dimensions in other words there is no space at all but only a condition but meanwhile i had come to grasp the strange fact that the objects in our normal world appear to us only partially mr mudge moved farther forward till he was balanced dangerously on the very edge of the chair from this starting point he resumed i began my studies and experiments and continued them for years i had money and i was without friends i lived in solitude and experimented my intellect of course had little part in the work for intellectually it was all unthinkable never was the limitation of mere reason more plainly demonstrated it was mystically intuitively spiritually that i began to advance and what i learnt and knew and did is all impossible to put into language since it describes experiences transcending the experiences of men it is only some of the resultswhat you would call the symptoms of my diseasethat i can give you and even these must often appear absurd contradictions and impossible paradoxes i can only tell you dr silencehis manner became grave suddenlythat i reached sometimes a point of view whence all the great puzzles of the world became plain to me and i understood what they call in the yoga books the great heresy of separateness why all great teachers have urged the necessity of man loving his neighbour as himself how men are all really one and why the utter loss of self is necessary to salvation and the discovery of the true life of the soul he paused a moment and drew breath your speculations have been my own long ago the doctor said quietly i fully realise the force of your words men are doubtless not separate at allin the sense they imagine all this about the very much higher space i only dimly very dimly conceived of course the other went on raising his voice again by jerks but what did happen to me was the humbler accident ofthe simpler disasteroh dear how shall i put it he stammered and showed visible signs of distress it was simply this he resumed with a sudden rush of words that accidentally as the result of my years of experiment i one day slipped bodily into the next world the world of four dimensions yet without knowing precisely how i got there or how i could get back again i discovered that is that my ordinary threedimensional body was but an expressiona partial projectionof my higher fourdimensional body now you understand what i meant much earlier in our talk when i spoke of chance i cannot control my entrance or exit certain people certain human atmospheres certain wandering forces thoughts desires eventhe radiations of certain combinations of colour and above all the vibrations of certain kinds of music will suddenly throw me into a state of what i can only describe as an intense and terrific inner vibrationand behold i am off off in the direction at right angles to all our known directions off in the direction the cube takes when it begins to trace the outlines of the new figure the tessaract off into my breathless and semidivine higher space off inside myself into the world of four dimensions he gasped and dropped back into the depths of the immovable chair and there he whispered his voice issuing from among the cushions there i have to stay until these vibrations subside or until they do something which i cannot find words to describe properly or intelligibly to youand then behold i am back again first that is i disappear then i reappear only he sighedi cannot control my entrance nor my exit just so exclaimed dr silence and that is why a few why a few moments ago interrupted mr mudge taking the words out of his mouth you found me gone and then saw me return the music of that wretched german band sent me off your intense thinking about me brought me backwhen the band had stopped its wagner i saw you approach the peephole and i saw barkers intention of doing so later for me no interiors are hidden i see inside when in that state the content of your mind as of your body is open to me as the day oh dear oh dear oh dear mr mudge stopped and mopped his brow a light trembling ran over the surface of his small body like wind over grass he still held tightly to the arms of the chair at first he presently resumed my new experiences were so vividly interesting that i felt no alarm there was no room for it the alarm came a little later then you actually penetrated far enough into that state to experience yourself as a normal portion of it asked the doctor leaning forward deeply interested mr mudge nodded a perspiring face in reply i did he whispered undoubtedly i did i am coming to all that it began first at night when i realised that sleep brought no loss of consciousness the spirit of course can never sleep only the body becomes unconscious interposed john silence yes we know thattheoretically at night of course the spirit is active elsewhere and we have no memory of where and how simply because the brain stays behind and receives no record but i found the while remaining conscious i also retained memory i had attained to the state of continuous consciousness for at night regularly with the first approaches of drowsiness i entered nolens volens the four dimensional world for a time this happened frequently and i could not control it though later i found a way to regulate it better apparently sleep is unnecessary in the higherthe four dimensionalbody yes perhaps but i should infinitely have preferred dull sleep to the knowledge for unable to control my movements i wandered to and fro attracted owing to my partial development and premature arrival to parts of this new world that alarmed me more and more it was the awful waste and drift of a monstrous world so utterly different to all we know and see that i cannot even hint at the nature of the sights and objects and beings in it more than that i cannot even remember them i cannot now picture them to myself even but can recall only the memory of the impression they made upon me the horror and devastating terror of it all to be in several places at once for instance perfectly interrupted john silence noticing the increase of the others excitement i understand exactly but now please tell me a little more of this alarm you experienced and how it affected you its not the disappearing and reappearing per se that i mind continued mr mudge so much as certain other things its seeing people and objects in their weird entirety in their true and complete shapes that is so distressing it introduced me to a world of monsters horses dogs cats all of which i loved people trees children all that i have considered beautiful in lifeeverything from a human face to a cathedralappear to me in a different shape and aspect to all i have known before instead of seeing their partial expression in three dimensions i saw them completein four i cannot perhaps convince you why this should be terrible but i assure you that it is so to hear the human voice proceeding from this novel appearance which i scarcely recognise as a human body is ghastly simply ghastly to see inside everything and everybody is a form of insight peculiarly distressing to be so confused in geography as to find myself one moment at the north pole and the next at clapham junctionor possibly at both places simultaneouslyis absurdly terrifying your imagination will readily furnish other details without my multiplying my experiences now but you have no idea what it all means and how i suffer mr mudge paused in his panting account and lay back in his chair he still held tightly to the arms as though they could keep him in the world of sanity and three measurements and only now and again released his left hand in order to mop his face he looked very thin and white and oddly unsubstantial and he stared about him as though he saw into this other space he had been talking about john silence too felt warm he had listened to every word and had made many notes the presence of this man had an exhilarating effect upon him it seemed as if mr racine mudge still carried about with him something of that breathless higherspace condition he had been describing at any rate dr silence had himself advanced sufficiently far to realise that the visions of this extraordinary little person had a basis of truth for their origin after a pause that prolonged itself into minutes he crossed the room and unlocked a drawer in a bookcase taking out a small book with a red cover it had a lock to it and he produced a key out of his pocket and proceeded to open the covers the bright eyes of mr mudge never left him for a single second it almost seems a pity he said at length to cure you mr mudge you are on the way to discovery of great things though you may lose your life in the processthat is your life here in the world of three dimensionsyou would lose thereby nothing of great valueyou will pardon my apparent rudeness i knowand you might gain what is infinitely greater your suffering of course lies in the fact that you alternate between the two worlds and are never wholly in one or the other also i rather imagine though i cannot be certain of this from any personal experiments that you have here and there penetrated even into space of more than four dimensions and have hence experienced the terror you speak of the perspiring son of the essex bargeman and the woman of normandy bent his head several times in assent but uttered no word in reply some strange psychic predisposition dating no doubt from one of your former lives has favoured the development of your disease and the fact that you had no normal training at school or college no leading by the poor intellect into the culsdesac falsely called knowledge has further caused your exceedingly rapid movement along the lines of direct inner experience none of the knowledge you have foreshadowed has come to you through the senses of course mr mudge sitting in his immovable chair began to tremble slightly a wind again seemed to pass over his surface and again to set it curiously in motion like a field of grass you are merely talking to gain time he said hurriedly in a shaking voice this thinking aloud delays us i see ahead what you are coming to only please be quick for something is going to happen a band is again corning down the street and if it playsif it plays wagneri shall be off in a twinkling precisely i will be quick i was leading up to the point of how to effect your cure the way is this you must simply learn to block the entrancesprevent the centres acting true true utterly true exclaimed the little man dodging about nervously in the depths of the chair but how in the name of space can that be done by concentration they are all within you these centres although outer causes such as colour music and other things lead you towards them these external things you cannot hope to destroy but once the entrances are blocked they will lead you only to bricked walls and closed channels you will no longer be able to find the way quick quick cried the bobbing figure in the chair how is this concentration to be effected this little book continued dr silence calmly will explain to you the way he tapped the cover let me now read out to you certain simple instructions composed as i see you divine entirely from my own personal experiences in the same direction follow these instructions and you will no longer enter the state of higher space the entrances will be blocked effectively mr mudge sat bolt upright in his chair to listen and john silence cleared his throat and began to read slowly in a very distinct voice but before he had uttered a dozen words something happened a sound of street music entered the room through the open ventilators for a band had begun to play in the stable mews at the back of the housethe march from tannhдuser odd as it may seem that a german band should twice within the space of an hour enter the same mews and play wagner it was nevertheless the fact mr racine mudge heard it he uttered a sharp squeaking cry and twisted his arms with nervous energy round the chair a piteous look that was not far from tears spread over his white face grey shadows followed itthe grey of fear he began to struggle convulsively hold me fast catch me for gods sake keep me here im on the rush already oh its frightful he cried in tones of anguish his voice as thin as a reed dr silence made a plunge forward to seize him but in a flash before he could cover the space between them mr racine mudge screaming and struggling seemed to shoot past him into invisibility he disappeared like an arrow from a bow propelled at infinite speed and his voice no longer sounded in the external air but seemed in some curious way to make itself heard somewhere within the depths of the doctors own being it was almost like a faint singing cry in his head like a voice of dream a voice of vision and unreality alcohol alcohol it cried faintly with distance in it give me alcohol its the quickest way alcohol before im out of reach the doctor accustomed to rapid decisions and even more rapid action remembered that a brandy flask stood upon the mantelpiece and in less than a second he had seized it and was holding it out towards the space above the chair recently occupied by the visible mudge but before his very eyes and long ere he could unscrew the metal stopper he saw the contents of the closed glass phial sink and lessen as though someone were drinking violently and greedily of the liquor within thanks enough it deadens the vibrations cried the faint voice in his interior as he withdrew the flask and set it back upon the mantelpiece he understood that in mudges present condition one side of the flask was open to space and he could drink without removing the stopper he could hardly have had a more interesting proof of what he had been hearing described at such length but the next momentthe very same moment it almost seemedthe german band stopped midway in its tuneand there was mr mudge back in his chair again gasping and panting quick he shrieked stop that band send it away catch hold of me block the entrances block the entrances give me the red book oh oh ohhhh the music had begun again it was merely a temporary interruption the tannhдuser march started again this time at a tremendous pace that made it sound like a rapid twostep as though the instruments played against time but the brief interruption gave dr silence a moment in which to collect his scattering thoughts and before the band had got through half a bar he had flung forward upon the chair and held mr racine mudge the struggling little victim of higher space in a grip of iron his arms went all round his diminutive person taking in a good part of the chair at the same time he was not a big man yet he seemed to smother mudge completely yet even as he did so and felt the wriggling form underneath him it began to melt and slip away like air or water the wood of the armchair somehow disentangled itself from between his own arms and those of mudge the phenomenon known as the passage of matter through matter took place the little man seemed actually to be interfused with the others being dr silence could just see his face beneath him it puckered and grew dark as though from some great internal effort he heard the thin reedy voice crying his ear to block the entrances block the entrances and thenbut how in the world describe what is indescribable john silence half rose up to watch racine mudge his face distorted beyond all recognition was making a marvellous inward movement as though doubling back upon himself he turned funnelwise like water in a whirling vortex and then appeared to break up somewhat as a reflection breaks up and divides in a distorting convex mirror he went neither forward nor backward neither to the right nor the left neither up nor down but he went he went utterly he simply flashed away out of sight like a vanishing projectile all but one leg dr silence just had the time and the presence of mind to seize upon the left ankle and boot as it disappeared and to this he held on for several seconds like grim death yet all the time he knew it was a foolish and useless thing to do the foot was in his grasp one moment and the next it seemedthis was the only way he could describe itinside his own skin and bones and at the same time outside his hand and all round it it seemed mingled in some amazing way with his own flesh and blood then it was gone and he was tightly grasping a mere draught of heated air gone gone gone cried a faint whispering voice somewhere deep within his own consciousness lost lost lost it repeated growing fainter and fainter till at length it vanished into nothing and the last signs of mr racine mudge vanished with it john silence locked his red book and replaced it in the cabinet which he fastened with a click and when barker answered the bell he inquired if mr mudge had left a card upon the table it appeared that he had and when the servant returned with it dr silence read the address and made a note of it it was in north london mr mudge has gone he said quietly to barker noticing his expression of alarm hes not taken his at with him sir mr mudge requires no hat where he is now continued the doctor stooping to poke the fire but he may return for it and the humbrella sir and the umbrella he didnt go out my way sir if you please stuttered the amazed servant his curiosity overcoming his nervousness mr mudge has his own way of coming and going and prefers it if he returns by the door at any time remember to bring him instantly to me and be kind and gentle with him and ask no questions also remember barker to think pleasantly sympathetically affectionately of him while he is away mr mudge is a very suffering gentleman barker bowed and went out of the room backwards gasping and feeling round the inside of his collar with three very hot fingers of one hand it was two days later when he brought in a telegram to the study dr silence opened it and read as follows bombay just slipped out again all safe have blocked entrances thousand thanks address cooks londonmudge dr silence looked up and saw
