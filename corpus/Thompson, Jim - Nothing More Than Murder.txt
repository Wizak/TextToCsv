nothing more than murder by jim thompson copyright wanted unencumbered woman for general work in outoftown home forty to fortyfive able to wear size uniform excellent wages hours box no ill let you write in the box number i told the girl behind the counter have to let you do something to earn your money she smiled kind of like an elevator boy smiles when you ask him if he has lots of ups and downs yes sir what is your name please well i said im going to pay for the ad now yes sir she said just as much as to say youre damned right youre going to pay now we have to have your name and address sir i told her i was placing the ad for a friend mrs jj williamson room fournineteen crystal arms hotel and she wrote it down on a printed slip of paper and stabbed it over a spike with a lot of others that runs one word over three lines if you like i think i can eliminate a i want it printed like it stands i said how much for three days it will be two dollars and fortyfour cents i had a dollar and ninetysix cents in my overcoat pocket exactly enough if elizabeth had figured things right i pulled it out and laid it on the counter and fumbled around in my pants pocket for some change i found a quarter two nickels and a few pennies i dropped them into my coat as soon as i saw they werent enough and reached again the girl stared at my hands the gloves her eyebrows up a little i came out with a half dollar and slid it across to her there i said that makes it just a minute sir you have two cents change coming i waved my hand at her to keep it i didnt want to try to pick up those pennies with my gloves on and something told me shed make me pick them up i wanted to get out of there she hollered something just as the door closed but i didnt turn around i hit the street and i kept right on walking without looking back i guess i must have gone a dozen blocks just walking along blind before i realized i was being a chump i stopped and lighted a cigarette and saw no one was following me it began to drift in on me that there really wasnt any reason why anyone should i felt like kicking myself for letting elizabeth plan the thing shed insisted on my wearing gloves which i could see now was a hell of a phony touch shed had me print out the ad in advance on a piece of dimestore paper and that looked funny too when you put it with the other and then shed figured out the exact price of the ad only it wasnt the exact price i went on down the street toward film row wondering why since she always fouled me up i ever bothered to listen to elizabeth wondering whether i was actually as big a chump as she always said i was i wish now that id kept on wondering instead of plowing on ahead but i didnt and i dont think it proves i wasnt smart because i didnt when elizabeth and i were married there was another show in stoneville it wasnt much of a house five hundred chairs and a couple of powers projectors that should have been in a museum and a wildcat sound system but it was a show and it pulled a lot of business from us particularly on friday and saturday the horseopera nights not only that it almost doubled the price of the product we bought in a town of seventyfive hundred people you hadnt ought to pay more than thirty or thirtyfive bucks for the best feature out and you dont have to if youve got the only house where theres more than one well brother theres a situation the boys on film row love if you dont want to buy from them theyll just take their product across the street and the guy across the street will snap it up in the hopes of freezing you out and buying at his own price the next year the fellow that owned the other house was named bower hes not around any more dont know what ever did become of him about the time his lease came up for renewal i went to his landlord and offered to take over paying all operatingexpenses and giving him fifty per cent of the net of course he took me up bower couldnt afford to make a proposition like that neither could i i gave bower a hundred and fifty dollars for his equipment which was a good price even if he didnt think so motion picture equipment is worth just about as much as the spot you have it in its tricky stuff to move its made to be put in a place and left there well bower had about the same amount of stinker product under contract that i had part of it hed bought because he couldnt help himself we had blockbooking in those days and part because it would squeeze me ordinarily if he played it at all hed have balanced it up with good strong shorts but there was a lot of it he couldnt have played on a triple bill with two strong supporting features what i did was to take his stinkers and mine and shoot em into the house one after another and i picked out shorts that were companion pieces if you know what i mean inside of two months the house wasnt grossing five dollars a day the landlord was he still is for that matter old andy taylor andy got his start writing insurance around our neck of the woods almost fifty years ago and now he owns about half the county in fee and has the rest under mortgage you could hear him crying in the next county when he saw what he was up against but there wasnt a thing he could do he had the choice of taking twentyfive a month or fifty per cent of nothing so you know what he took i left the house standing dark just like it is now no one but a sucker would think of trying to open a third house under the circumstances and he wouldnt have anything to play in it if he did i buy all the major studio product and everything thats playable from the indies our house is on seven changes a week and we actually change four or five times the rest of the stuff we pay for and send back our film bill only runs about thirty per cent more on the week than it used to and our gross is about ninety per cent more of course weve got to pay rent on the other house and the extra express and insurance charges plus paper advertising matter runs into dough but weve done all right plenty all right weve got the most modern most completely equipped smallcity house in the state and theres just one guy responsible me i only book a month at a time but booking with me for a month is equal to booking with the average exhibitor for three months and the boys on the row dont exactly throw rocks at me i like to never have got away from the playgrand exchange the minute i stepped in the door they rushed me back to the managers office and he just pushed his work aside and reached for the drinks they had some shorts in that he wanted my opinion on so after a while we went back into the screeningroom which is just like a little theater and checked them over they were good stuff some of the brightest snappiest shorts id seen in a longtime even with all i had on my mind i enjoyed them ive known the manager of utopian since the days when he was on the road and it was pretty hard to get away from there too and we got to talking baseball over at colfax and at wolf i had to sit in on another screening and have another couple drinks i almost didnt book anything at superior they had a complete new setup from booker to manager and none of them knew straight up they didnt even know who i was i gave the booker three feature dates and five shorts and i explained about six times that that was all i had open for the month but he wouldnt give up he reached over and took my date book right out of my hands why here he said weve made a mistake havent we weve got an open date next sunday ive got something planned for that i said now lets see he said what can we give you there what do you say to that dates taken i said well fix that get the other pic set out for you you dont want an inferior picture in a sunday spot when we can give you well i dont mind seeing a man try to do his job and all the row guys are pretty fast talkers im a shade fast myself ive never poked my tongue in my eyes yet though and its not because i close them when i talk i was about to tell him off in a nice way when the manager came out he came up behind me and kind of worked his hand over my back like he was giving me a massage getting along all right he said everything going to suit you mr barclay i could feel myself turning red my names not barclay i said oh he said stepping back a little i thought you were from barclay operating company at im joe wilmot i said ive operated barclay for the past ten years the propertys in my wifes name okay he let out with a silly laugh trying to pass it over and made a grab for my hand mighty glad you came in joe anything we can do here for you just say the word you cant do a goddam thing for me i said i wont pull out the dates ive given you because im in a hurry but itll be a hell of a long time before i give you any more now joe lets go back in the office and go to hell i said he and the booker both followed me to the door i slammed it in their faces every film row ive been around theres at least one place like chance independent releases and one guy like happy chance not exactly but you know what i mean they get ahold of maybe three or four features a year that you can throw in a middleoftheweek spot and a sex picture or two and a few serials and some stagparty shorts they own the prints on the sex and stag stuff and handle the other on commission for studios that dont have their own exchanges hap seemed to get by better than some of them but hap would ive known him for more than twelve years since he was working the booth in a grindhouse and i was driving film truck and if he ever missed skinning anyone i dont know when it was hed even skinned the panzpalace chain and when you skin a guy like sol panzer whos run a ninetythreehouse string up from a nickelodeon youve got to be good i dont know why i liked hap maybe it was the attraction of opposites as they say in books glad you dropped in laddie he said after wed sat down and the drinks were poured been thinking about popping out to see you how are things with the barclay whats the use of kicking i said you wouldnt believe me no seriously you must be coining it how many changes are you on anyway i grinned at him over my glass all i need hap some chap was telling me the other day you were on more changes than any house in the state i could be ive got the product i dont often make more than four a week though playing shutout with the rest that wouldnt be legal i said they call that acting in restraint of trade uhhah he drawled certainly i should know you wouldnt be involved in anything like that the towns wide open to anyone that wants to come in i said ill run all the good pix in the barclay and all the stinkers in the bower and split the rest with the competition uh hah hap let out a chuckle whats your house worth there laddie if you dont mind my asking well lets see ten times the annual return between seventyfive and a hundred grand it wouldnt possibly be worth a million would it not without a sundaynight audience weve got some goodlooking gals out there just so just so he said whats on your mind got a buyer for me weell he hesitated frowning plucking at the sleeve of his tweed suit hap goes for the english stuff right on down the line and it doesnt suit him so bad or so good he sat there all diked out and talking like a duke and he turned his head a little and spit and rubbed it into the carpet with one of his saddlesoaped shoes i wanted to laugh but i knew i hadnt better hap isnt a good guy to have sore at you well how about it i said i guess not laddie he sighed and shook his head the proposition isnt quite big enough he looked at me a minute or two longer and i thought he was going to say something more but he didnt and i didnt prod him it wouldnt have done any good and i thought icould see his angle anyway by the way i said whatd you ever do with that sixteenreeler what do you call it jeopardy of the jungle hap shrugged oh that goddam thing why it hasnt been out of the can in months laddie it he broke off and gave me a sharp look oh you mean jeopardy of the jungle he said its going like wildfire its booked practically solid for the next three months i did laugh then this was business and i could there arent that many penitentiaries in the country i said word of honor joe the way its been pulling em in even surprises me you know i didnt care for it myself even if it did have gable and bergman yeah a tenframe shot of them sitting in the stork club and what it has to do with the picture nobody knows but you cant argue with the bo joe the box office doesnt lie did you see last months grosses in the herald the empire grossed seven grand on jep the first i saw it i said the only other attraction was tommy dorseys orchestra let me show you something joe let me get out the herald i can show you smallcity grosses for two days during the fall what two thanksgiving and labor day okay he said so it stinks you know it does but you want it well i said and then i swallowed and it was just like id forgotten how to talk a puzzled grin spread over happys face yeah he said you want it but why youve already got more stuff than you can use tell hap why you want it laddie hell i said use your head hap this is the end of the season we always get down toward the bottom of the pot at this time of year uhhah mmm ordinarily i do have more product than i can play but ive already let it go back i dont have to have jep i just thought i saw a nice spot for it next sunday jep on sunday okay i said im dumb i was holding the spot for superior but they got me sore and i walked out he looked disappointed but not as much as id like to have seen him there were still traces of that puzzled grin we settled on a price and i got up to leave and i stepped into it again right up to my neck arent you forgetting something old man you mean you want your rental now i said i dont play that way i pay on delivery you know that hap he shook his head well what do you mean paper he said as though he were talking to someone else first he books a stinker for sunday and then he starts to leave without so much as a onesheet why would joe wilmot forget to buy paper ill be damned i said i guess that superior crowd did get me upset uhhah he said mmm i was so rattled that i let him sell me twice as much paper as i usually use a dozen threesheets eighteen ones and two twentyfours that and fifty window cards and the stuff for my lobby display i was shivering as i walked back to the hotel even thinking about carol couldnt warm me up it was a saturday morning a little over a year ago when i first saw carol we had a kids matinee coming up at eleven oclock and i was in the projection booth screening some stuff id just made a changeover and was putting a roll of film on the rewind elizabeth waited for me to look around but she finally saw i wasnt going to this is carol farmer joe she said shes going to stay with us thats fine i said keeping my eye on the film our ladies aid group is helping carol attend business college elizabeth went on and she needed some place to cut down on expenses i think we can use her very handily around the house dont you i still didnt look around why not thank you dear said elizabeth opening the door come along carol mr wilmot has given you his approval i knew that she was laughing shed only brought carol there to show me up she didnt need my approval for anything well though i passed old doc barrow who runs the business college on the street that afternoon and he thanked me for being so generous in taking carol in i began to feel a little better and kind of ashamed of the way id acted not on elizabeths account but carols she was about twentyfive and shed spent most of her life on a twobyfour farm down in the sand flats raising a bunch of brothers and sisters that ran off as soon as they got big enough to be any help her father was serving a fiveyear stretch for stealing hogs her mother was dead now she was starting out to try to make something of herself we were changing programs the next day and it was after midnight when i got home but carol was still up she was sitting out at the kitchen table with a lot of books spread in front of her and you could tell they didnt mean a thing to her not as much even as they would have to me she jumped up all scared and trembling like id caught her stealing her face got red then white and she snatched up a dish towel and began scrubbing at the table take it easy kid i said youre not on twentyfourhour duty around here she didnt say anything i dont guess she could she stood watching me a minute then she snatched up her books and sort of scuttled over to a corner and sat down on a stool she pretended to be studying but i knew she wasnt i knew it because i knew how she felt because id felt the same way i knew what it meant to be nothing and to want to be something and to be scared out of your pants that someone is going to knock you down not because of what youve done but because you cant strike back because they want to see you squirm or they have a headache or they dont like the way your hair is parted i opened the refrigerator door and took a look inside it was full as usual with the lef tover junk that passes for food with elizabeth little plates of salad bowls of consomme sauce dishes of fruit and nonfattening desserts but way back in the rear i spotted a baked ham and a chocolate cake i took them over to the table along with some bread and butter and a bottle of milk you aint youre not supposed to eat that mr wilmot huh i almost dropped the carvingknife huhuh i mean no sir mrs wilmot said that was for tomorrow well i said aint that just dandy yes sir theres some soup on the stove thats what iwe what were supposed to have tonight i didnt argue about it i just went over to the cupboard and got two plates and i filled one of them so full it needed sideboards now come over here i said and eat this eat every damned bit of it if theres any holler ill say i did it christ i wish you could have seen her she must have been empty all the way down she didnt hog the food she just sat and ate steadily like she was going at a big job that needed doing and she didnt mind my watching her she seemed to know that id been the same way myself when shed finished i told her to take her books and go to bed and she said yes sir and took off it made me a little uncomfortable for anyone to be so obedient and yet i cant say i didnt like it either and it wasnt because lever thought about telling her to do anything well anything bad i just couldnt see the gal that way i couldnt see her at all if you know what i mean if there was ever a woman that you wouldnt look at twice she was it probably she still is because the more i think about it the more im convinced that im seeing something that no one else can and it took me three months before i could see it it was a sunday afternoon elizabeth had taken her car and gone visiting and i was lying down we dont operate the house on sunday afternoon local sentiments against it there was a knock on my door and i said come in carol and she came in i just wanted to show you the new suit mrs wilmot gave me she said i sat up it looks very nice carol i dont know which i wanted to do most laugh or cry she was a little bit cockeyed maybe i didnt tell you well and she was more than a little pigeontoed the suit wasnt new it was a wornout rag elizabeth had given her to make over and shed botched it from top to bottom and she had on a pair of elizabeths old shoes that didnt fit her half as well as mine would the blouse was too tight for her breasts or her breasts were too big for the blouse however you want to put it they were too big for anything but an outsize a good deep breath and shed have had to start dodging i felt the tears coming into my eyes and yet i wanted to laugh too she looked like hell she looked like a sack of bran that couldnt decide which way it was going to fall and then the curtain rose or however you want to put it and everything was changed and what i began to think about wasnt laughing or crying that tiny bit of cockeyedness gave her a cute mad look and the way she toed in sort of spread her buttocks and made a little valley under her skirt and and it dont doesnt make sense but there was something about it that made me think of the twentythird psalm id thought she looked awkward and topheavy and hell i could see now that she didnt at all her breasts werent too big jesus her breasts she looked cutemad and funnysweet she looked like shed started somewhere and been mussed up along the way she was a honey she was sugar and pie she was a bitch i said come here carol and she came there and then i was kissing her like id been waiting all my life to do just that and she was the same way with me i dont know how long it was before i looked up and saw elizabeth in the doorway i always stop at the crystal arms when im in the city they know i pay for what i get and no questions and whenever they can do me a favor they dont hold back there wasnt anything in my room box but a few complimentary theater tickets i gave them to the bell captain and took the elevator upstairs the heat was just being turned on full and the room was a little chilly i dragged a chair up to the radiator and sat down with my coat and hat on i wasnt worried not too much i guess i just had a touch of the blues i had everything in the world to look forward to and i had the blues i got out part of a pint i had in my gladstone and sat down again the lights were coming on blobbing through the misty night haze that hung over the city over in the yards a freight gave out with a highball i took a drink and closed my eyes i tried to imagine it was fifteen years ago and i was on the freight and i was looking at the city for the first time and i thought hell if you had to be blue why not then instead of now when i saw it was getting really dark i pulled myself together and changed my socks and shirt i took the stairs down a couple of floors and knocked on carols door the ventilator was open and i could hear her splashing around in the tub house dick i said open up she came to the door holding a big bath towel in front of her when she saw it was really me i she dropped the towel and stood back for me to come in she locked the door and walked over to the bed and lay down thats all right i said sitting down by her you can put something on if you want to do you want me to i dont want you to catch cold i said she said she wouldnt i gave her a drink out of the part of a pint and lighted a cigarette for both of us she sat up on one elbow and coughed and choked until i had to slap her on the back i remembered then that id never seen her smoke before and that that was the first drink id ever given her is that the first time you smoked a cigarette i asked yes joe and thats your first drink of liquor whatd you take it for you gave it to me hell i said you didnt have to take it there was a little finger of hair hanging down the middle of her forehead she looked at it turning her eyes in to be more cockeyed and blew upward over her nose the wisp of hair rose and settled down on her forehead again i laughed and patted her on the bottom i put my head down against her breast and squeezed she freed one of her hands we had supper in her room club sandwiches waffle potatoes apple pie with cheese and coffee i stood in the closet when the waiter delivered it shed never seen waffle potatoes before she kept turning them around in her fingers and nibbling the squares off a little at a time did everything go all right today she said finally pretty good why are you worried then did something happen at the newspaper office nothing much i said and i told her about it its a good joke on elizabeth shes always acted like we didnt have good sense and maybe we dont have huh i said what do you mean carol shed never spoken up much before and it surprised me and i guess i sounded pretty abrupt she dropped her eyes im afraid joe im afraid elizabeths trying to get us into trouble why thats crazy i said were all in this together she couldnt make trouble for us without making it for herself yes she i mean i think she could said carol you and me have to do everything we run all the risks well but look i said i admit i got pretty much up in the air at the time but whats actually the worst that could have happened there at the newspaper office all they could have done was to refuse to take the ad isnt that right she shook her head as though she hadnt heard me anyway shes trying to get me in trouble why did she have to have me register here as mrs jj williamson why not we had to agree on some name so we could reach you in case of emergency you had to have some name to receive answers to the ad but not that one joe i got to thinking about it today its the same initials as yours it kind of sounds like yours well well i said i laughed not very hard its just a coincidence what harm could it do anyhow she didnt answer me she just shook her head again if anyone made any boners it was me i said and i started telling her about hap chance it looked suspicious see with all the product ive got why should i want sixteen reels of junk from him carol shrugged you explained it to him yeah but it didnt look so good particularly with me forgetting to buy paper well it made it look like i didnt intend to play the picture i almost might as well have told him i wanted that sixteenreeler because of its length because it would make twice as hot a fire as it wasnt true the slip couldnt have meant anything like that to hap and carol knew it she saw i was just trying to divert her from elizabeth wed turned off all the lights except the one in the bathroom and i was holding her on my lap in a big chair in front of the window she began to breathe very deeply i turned her face away from my chest and i saw that she was crying dont do that i said please carol yyoure in love with her she said she treats you like a dog an and you go right on loving her the hell i do yyou do and its not fair id do anything in the world for you anything joe and she hates you and aand it doesnt make any difference yyou kkeep right on but damnit i dont you do too it would have gone on all night but i didnt let it as the guy said on his wedding night it was no time for talking it was the next afternoon and i was feeling pretty low coming out of the city id passed a guy walking a tired shabbylooking guy that looked like he needed a good nights sleep and a square meal and i started to stop for him and then just when he was about to catch up with me i stepped on the gas and drove off it was a mean thing to do and i hadnt intended doing it what i meant to do was carry him down the road as far as he was going and give him some food and change instead of that id torn off when he almost had his hand on the door all of a sudden it came over me why id had so many blue spells lately it was because i felt like i didnt amount to much any more it was because i didnt feel that i was as good as other people that i shouldnt put myself with people who wouldnt do what i was doing subconsciously id been afraid that hitchhiker might sense something like maybe hed pass up the car or ask to be let out after he got in subconsciously id felt like he ought to i wondered again like i had a thousand times how the hell it all started one time years ago i sat in on one of elizabeths literary club meetings when they were discussing some ladypoet this poetry this stuff this lady wrote wasnt like real poetry it wasnt like anything in fact it was just a lot of words strung together about god knows what all and theyd say the same things over and over well though it seemed like the stuff did make sense once you understood what this lady was trying to do she was writing about everything all at one time she was writing about one thing of course more than the others but she was throwing in everything that was connected with it and she didnt pretend to know what was most important she just laid it out for you and you took your choice ill have to do the same thing offhand youd say it began with elizabeth catching carol and me together that sunday afternoon but if there was a murder every time a husband or wife got caught like that there wouldnt be any people left so it might have begun with the time i closed up bowers house and moved part of his equipment up to our garage or the time right after we were married when elizabeth and i each took out twelve thousand five hundred dollars insurance on the other or the time when i was delivering film for the exchanges and it was raining and i drove her up to her house in the company truck it may have started with carols old man being pinched for stealing hogs or the pushing around i took in reform school or at the orphanage although it wasnt so bad there the head matron was an old irishwoman weighing about three hundred pounds and so crosseyed she scared me stiff the first time i saw her but an angel couldnt have been any better but well ill tell things the best way i can one night i lost my key ring and couldnt lock up the show elizabeth wasnt in the house and she carried her keys with her so i went out to the garage upstairs where she was checking some film you dont need to do that i said i can look that over in the morning before we open up im quite capable of doing it i didnt say you werent thank you she said im glad you feel im still of some value okay be stubborn i said i took the keys and started to leave wheres the new cord for that motor she looked blank i told her id bought a new cord and laid it by her breakfast plate that morning i thought youd have sense enough to know what it was for that cords got a short in it why how gallant of you joe she said but she was scared i got the new cord and changed it and threw the old one in the trash bucket but the next time i was out there i saw that shed dug it out and put it on one of the metal shelves and now that i think of it it might have begun with her mother the old lady never threw anything away for months after she died elizabeth and i were throwing out balls of string and packages of wrappingpaper and other junk i dont know its hard to know what to put down and what to leave out there was a lot of stuff on the radio and in the newsreels and newspapers people getting run over blown up drowned smothered starved lynched mercy killings hangings electrocutions suicides people who didnt want to live people who deserved killing people who were better off dead i dont suppose it was any different from usual any different from what it always has been and always will be but coming then right at that time it kind of tied in day after day and night after night there was a row with one breath elizabeth would tell us to get out with the next she was threatening what shed do if we tried what the hell do you want id yell do you want a divorce be publicly displaced by a frump like that i think not then ill clear out carol and i what with and how would i run the show well sell the show we cant we couldnt get a fraction of its value from an outsider im willing to give you credit joe youre at least half the business that was true a showman would know that anyone that was a showman wouldnt want to buy i think i get you i said you want me to give up any claim ive got on the business then you could peddle out at any old price and still have a nice wad she raised her eyebrows such language joe what would your parents think goddam you how much joe what will you give me to leave you in undisputed possession of the field you know damned well i havent any money so you havent mmm there was more talk carol and me talking by ourselves elizabeth and me talking the three of us talking together nagging and lashing out and getting madder and edgier and the stuff in the newspapers and the newsreels and on the radio there were some canadian travel folders and a farmers wife over in the next county who stumbled into a tubful of hot lard and was burned unrecognizably there were the premiums on those insurance policies falling due twelve thousand five hundred dollars double indemnity then there was elizabeth saying well joe ive finally hit upon a nice round sum and me kind of shaking inside because i knew what the sum was and trying to sound like i was kidding yeah i suppose you want about twentyfive thousand bucks there must have been something else but i cant think of it now our house the show i mean is just four doors off of main street on the corner on our side and fronting on main is a dime store on the opposite corner catercornered from us is the farmers bank down the street a block is the city hotel and next door to it is the bus station and a garage im not taking credit for picking the location but i couldnt have picked a better one if id done it any time you can get close to a bank a hotel a garage a bus station and a dime store above all a dime store youve got something the average person might think a main street location would be better but it wouldnt its too hard to park on main i sat in the car a minute after i parked feeling kind of good and proud like i always do when i look at the house its not as big as some city houses but theres nothing to come up to it in a town of our size and its my baby i built it all out of nothing weve got a copperandglass marquee that you couldnt duplicate for five grand although naturally i didnt pay that i had the job done by an outoftown firm and it just so happened that they couldnt get the work okayed by our local building inspectors you know what i mean so i settled for five hundred and that plus a few bucks for the inspectors was all the marquee cost me the lobby is fifteen feet deep spreading out fan shape from the double doors with a marbleandglass box office in the center theres a onesheet board on each side of the box office glassed in with gold frame the lobby walls have a fourfoot marble base the upper half is glass panels for display matter with mirrors spotted in every three feet theres a carpet running from each door to the street that carpet would cost fifteen dollars a yard but i got it for nothing i was the first showman in this territory to lay a carpet through his lobby i sold the equipment house on the idea showed them how it would be opening up a big new market so they put it in for me of course i let them take a picture of me in front of the house and i gave them a testimonial and an estimate on the number of miles that had been walked on the carpet without it showing any wear the house doesnt have a balcony the ceilings too low i dont mean were cramped were twenty feet at the entrance which is four feet higher than the average show ceiling but its not high enough for a balcony weve only got a ninetyfivefoot shot from the projection booth to the screen and the floor cant drop much more than an inch to the foot id have to double the pitch for a balcony and even now it hurts peoples necks tosit in the front row we get along pretty well without a balcony anyway ive got four rows of seats on tiers at the back of the house extending up to the projection booth not full rows of course on account of the entrance and exit and the aisle down the middle from the booth door its more like loges when i put them in my customer liability insurance jumped a hundred dollars a year because you cant tell when some boob might fall and break his neck but the extra seatingspace is worth it jimmie nedry my projectionist was just making a changeover when i went into the booth he started the idle projector and put a hand on the sound control at just the right instant he jerked the string that opens one port and closes the other he pulled the switch on the first projector lifted out the reel of film and put it on the rewind there wasnt a break of even a fraction of an instant youd have thought the picture all came in one reel well jimmie i said hows it going he didnt say anything for a minute but i knew he was nerving himself up to it i feel sorry for jimmie any way i can i try to help him out ive got his oldest girl ushering for me and i use his boys as much as possible in putting out paper look mr wilmot he blurted out suddenly grace and me were talking last night and we was wondering if you couldnt put her on selling tickets she could sit down that way and people wouldnt see that she was couldnt see much of her and id like to have grace i said but you know how im tied up i just about have to use women from the legion auxiliary if it wasnt for that id jump at the chance to take grace we got to have a little more money mr wilmot if you could use the boys some on the door or taking care of the ive got to spread that work around for the high school team im doing all i can for you jimmie i said well he said and he hesitated again i got to have some more money theres no way i can give it to you i pointed out youre classified as a relief operator the union only allows me to work you twentyfour hours a week you mean thats what you pay me for he snapped im actually workin about sixty thats all i can pay you for i said and it was true the unions really keep an eye on social security records if you dont want the job perhaps youd better quit yeah he grunted where the hell would i get another one as a projectionist thats my line its the only thing ive ever done well that makes it tough i said if you had a couple grand for transfer and initiation fees you might get into another local but the chances are all against it he gave me a sore look started to say something then turned back to the machines i went back downstairs and outside i was standing out near the curb just lighting a cigarette when a big black roadster pulled up and mike blair got out he was the last man in the world i wanted to see hes a business agent for the projectionists union and id seen more than enough of him six years before when this town was in his territory we shook hands neither of us putting much pressure into it and i asked him where he was headed he pushed his hat back on his head taking his time about answering and giving me a mean grin he took the cigar out of his mouth looked at it and put it back in again im already there joe this towns back in my district yeah i said i mean it is nice huh he waggled the cigar in the corner of his mouth in fact its been back in my district for three days i was over here last night looking the old burg over and the night before well i said its funny i didnt see you itd been a hell of a lot funnier if you had dont kid me joe i like you in a nasty sort of way but i dont like to be kidded you were out of town i couldnt help it i i dont give a damn about that you remember what i told you at the time i left here what i told you a dozen other times well ill tell you again for the last time youre an indie you can run your own projectors and use a card man for reliefs and well carry you on the fair list you do that or else you do it or put two men in the booth full time now look blair i said lets be reasonable about this you we aint got time to reason joe jimmie nedrys already run over his twentyfour hours but how can i run the projectors and the house too just show me how blair and ill maybe you cant ill send you down another operator and you keep out of the booth hows that he knew how it was without asking two fulltime operators would cost me a hundred and eighty bucks a week look i said where did you get that two men to the booth and ninetydollar scale to begin with ill tell you panzpalace framed it for you to freeze out city competition they could carry four men at a hundred and fifty if they had to but the indies couldnt so you guys threw in with them i look whos talking he said well i cant pay it i said goddamit you know i cant get up in the booth then and stay there all but twentyfour hours of the week i cant do that either he grinned nodded and walked off i had to follow him out to his car youre going to pull the house you know i am joe after all ive done for union labor in this town youre going to going to i couldnt goon the look on his face stopped me why you chiseling son of a bitch he said softly you got the nerve to talk about what youve done for union labor you get them to practically put you up a new house for nothing and i paid scale all the way through the job sure you did with coupon books and the coupons werent even good for full admissions just a tencent discount the boys put in an eighthour day for you and got out and sold tickets at night thats what it amounted to they built you a new house and then kept it packed for you they all got their money i didnt hear any of them kicking about it okay joe he said its none of my business anyway but this other is youre off the fair list starting tomorrow maybe you dont know what it means to have a house struck in a town like ours it means you settle fast or go broke thered be spotters from every local watching out front any time a union man or a member of his family bought a ticket it would mean a twentyfive buck fine for him consequently in a place where everyone knows everyone else there wouldnt be any bought all right i said but id like to ask you a couple of questions blair as many as you like joe when did your men take out cards in the bricklayers union huh he blinked what do you mean im talking about the job your boys did in the house over at fairfield last week oh that he forced a laugh why that wasnt a bricklayers job all it amounted to was putting a few bricks under the projectors leveling them up they had to make a longer shot see and it was brick work wasnt it but the bricklayers couldnt have done it the operators had to then you should have had bystanders in from the bricklayers i said you know what i think blair i think the bricklayers are going to file a complaint against you with the state federation i think that brick work at fairfield is going to have to be torn out and done over by the proper local he stopped grinning and his face fell a little you get around dont you joe more than youd think i said more than you do apparently did you know that the projectionists at view point installed over fifty seats in the house there sure i know about it he snapped there wasnt enough carpenters to do the job so the projectionists finished it up why didnt the carpenters work overtime because the chairs had to be in for the night show i get you i said rules are rules until they start pinching you then you throw them out the window he stood at the side of his car thinking bobbling the cigar around in his mouth the bricklayers and carpenters are our two biggest locals theyre usually the biggest locals in any district if they took a notion to and blair knew they would after i got through needling em they could make him wish hed never been born okay joe he said finally maybe i was a little hasty i thought youd see it my way i said no hard feelings all kinds of em he looked down at my hand and shook his head im not through with you joe some day im going to hang one on you that you cant squirm out of our house our residence sits out on the edge of town almost a hundred yards from the highway its all thats left of the old barclay homestead just the house and a couple acres of ground and the outbuildings it was a little after midnight when i got there i parked the car in the yard in back of elizabeths locked it up and went in the kitchen door the coffee percolator was going and there was some cheese and pickles and other stuff sitting out on the table i went through the door to the diningroom and started up the stairs oh there you are darling called elizabeth she was sitting in the livingroom with a book in her lap and the light turned low wasnt it nice of me to wait up for you she said ive even fixed a lunch i know you must be famished she had on a little gingham house dress and she was smiling and for a minute i was crazy enough to think she wasnt giving me a rib then i thought of all the times in the past shed picked me up just to slap me down and i went on upstairs without speaking i washed combed my hair and went back down again all right i said spit it out whats up dont you want something to eat joe ive ate eaten i said did you ate eat with carol pour it on me i said im used to it hell how could i eat with carol i left the city this morning i hope you werent foolish enough to register in together joe no we didnt i dont know just when carol registered just after the bus got there i guess she sat staring at me not speaking her head thrown back her eyes half closed i told her about the bonehead shed pulled on the price of the ad and she only shook her head a little as if nothing i could say would be of any importance after a long time she said kind of talking to herself no its true it is true whats true she held out her hand let me see your date book joe i tossed it to her it fell on the floor and she picked it up she turned the pages to the months bookings i see playgrand has been consulting you again she said i hope you received a suitable fee those are good shorts i said after all weve got to buy from someone dont we now what did we do at utopian she said did we give him a third of our feature bookings because hes an old friend of ours or were we just a teenyweeny bit ah intoxicated all right i said i do give my friends the breaks whats the difference as long as it dont lose us any money you never saw me lose money helping a friend did you no joe i never did and you never lost any in striking back at any enemy but tell me what did they say to you at superior didnt they know you were the great joe wilmot sole proprietor of his wifes property they didnt say anything that was all the dates i had open really yeah rahlly i said and i wouldnt push that wifesproperty business too far all you had when i met you was a rundown store building and a couple of hundred seats that werent worth the chewinggum that was stuck on them she shook her head smiling that set funny smile its weird isnt it positively fantastic goddamit i said if theres something there you dont like say so we can change it easy enough but i do like it joe i like i wasnt criticizing i was only evaluating weighing things i suppose youd say i dont know what youre talking about i said and thats only half the story stupid she said yes actually stupid that with everything else vain vindictive lying dishonest a philanderer and stupid and yet youve left out a couple i said repulsive and nauseating she nodded yes joe i left them out she seemed to be waiting for me to say something sitting there smiling at me her hands caressing the arms of the chair youre slipping i said im going to eat something and go to bed joe i turned in the doorway she was standing it looked like she had started to follow me well what i said nothing joe i guess nothing i went on into the kitchen i fixed a sandwich and a cup of coffee when id got away with about half of it the lights blinked went dim and came on full again it didnt register on me for a second then it was as if something was holding me back when i tried to move it seemed like i was about to see something i mean i could almost see what it was and it scared me so badly my stomach rolled and my scalp crawled i came alive and stumbled to the door i half fell down the back steps and ran for the garage i raced up the outside stairs and threw myself against the door the room was lined with sheet metal floors ceiling walls the projectors and sound tables id got from bower were stashed in a corner in the center of the room was the metal film table with a reel at each end and a quarterhorse motor at one there was a metal stool in front of the table and elizabeth was seated on it bent over her face wasnt six inches from the film that was traveling in front of her two full reels were lying on the table next to the motor they were partly unwound and their ends dangled down into the open film can there were seven more reels in it it was a fulllength feature seven in the can two on the table and one in the rewind a can with a tworeel travelogue and one with a onereel cartoon were under the table close to elizabeths feet they were standing open too the film was wet as it passed through the reel it sent a fine spray over the motor the spray formed a trickle that ran down the pearshaped back of the motor the cord sparked the trickle of water seemed to catch fire there was a flash as if someone had tossed a barrel of yellow paint into the room i struck out with my hand and something seemed to grab it and push my arm back into my shoulder a streak of lightning shot across the table there were a couple of pinwheels of fire at each end then a loud pop and darkness and the sound of the broken film whipping against the table and elizabeth crying i found the cord and jerked it loose i fumbled along the wall until i found the circuit breaker and the lights came on again i turned them off and opened the door i picked up elizabeth and carried her back to the house and into the kitchen i put my foot up on a chair and pulled her over my knee and whaled the tar out of her she stopped crying and laughing and really began to cry some way she got turned around and put her arms around my neck you wouldnt think wed have been hungry but we were we ate some sandwiches and coffee and afterward she made me go upstairs to the bathroom with her to get my hand fixed up it wasnt a bad burn it just looked bad but she insisted on doping it all up so i let her whatd you want to do a crazy thing like that for i asked id asked her about umpteen times already you know why she said no i dont either well you do she said like a little girl and she did look like one then her skin was always so clear you could almost see through it and now it was rosy and flushed she acted like she was afraid to look at me bashful you know shed duck her head and look the other way her hair was like silk as she bent over my hand black silk with a fingerwide streak of white through the center youre awfully pretty i said all of a sudden ill bet im black and blue lets see if you are now joe dont but she didnt pull away i put a kiss on my hand and patted her feel better now uhhuh and now youre going to bed weve got some talking to do first i said all right she said but just a little i know youre worn out i didnt know why she blushed why she didnt want to talk not right then i didnt i should have sure but you know how it is you dont think about water when youre not thirsty she sat on the edge of the bed while i undressed and lay down now whats it all about i said i dont know joe it just seemed at the moment that it was the only thing to do we dont have togo through with this business i said maybe we can think of something else do we have to think of something else joe what how do you mean she was leaning back on one elbow her legs drawn up under her she lifted her eyes and gave me a long slow look she didnt answer well well maybe we dont have to i said gosh elizabeth i dont know i dont know what to do or what not to do i never have known i know im terribly difficult she said no i mean it but i do hope you understand my intentions were good oh sure i said i understand im afraid you dont she said and laughed but well not argue about it its no longer important now i hope it will never become important again tell me something i said about what we were going to do did you feel like i did like you wouldnt want to have other people around you any more like youd be ashamed not for yourself but for them well i guess im not sure of what i mean myself i said it wasnt the idea of breaking the law or not going to heaven i didnt really see how we were doing anything very wrong if it was someone you knew it would be different if it was someone that was well respectable and a valued citizen and all that it would be different but when its not well if you can sacrifice if three people can have happiness and go ahead and amount to something just by someone someone that doesnt stand a show of being anyone or doing anything getting out of the way why ill tell you why you felt as you did said elizabeth it was too simple no that wasnt i hesitated i dont think i get you elizabeth were strong people joe stronger at least than many without being too flattering we can say that we have good minds good bodies a good financial position not good enough theres room for improvement said elizabeth there usually is and there comes a time when the improvement seems imperative so what do we superior people do how do we exercise our fine talents in the emergency we dont we dont use them at all we do something that the first man could have done much better something that anyone could do we we push over someone who is more trusting or less strong than we are well i said it was the only thing we could think of yes joe it was the only thing we could think of i frowned and i suppose she thought i was getting mad you go to sleep now dear she said well talk more later she got up and pulled down the shades and turned off the light she came back and bent over me her face flushed looking more like a little girl than ever think you can sleep joe she said and before i could answer she lay down by my side and pulled my head against her breast we lay there for a longtime long enough to give me every chance in the world and i could feel her growing stiffer and older by the minute she didnt get mad she just acted sorry and sort of resigned she moved away from me and stood up when was it joe i dont know what youre talking about i said was it before you came here to me hell i said you knew how it was all along youve known about it for months i didnt know until now joe but that isnt the point id have sworn this would be one time when as youd put it youd pass up a bet if it wasnt well then therell never be such a time youve got nothing to share with me theres nothing i can do for you as she started for the door i said well what do you want to do do you still want to go through with it by all means she said ive changed my mind about its being too simple for us i let her go id gone a little goofy when i thought she was in danger but i should have known we couldnt patch things up i still wasnt hot for the killing who would be but if that was the only way to lead a happy decent life why if youre like i am youve probably spotted a thousand couples during your lifetime that made you wonder why and how the hell they ever got together and if youre like i used to be you probably lay it to liquor or shotguns not that i can tell you why i married elizabeth or she married me not exactly but i can tell you this we both knew exactly what we were getting barring a few points and we went right ahead and made the grab anyway and looking back it all seems perfectly natural that first rainy night when i drove her home in the film truck she got out fumbled in her purse and handed me fifty cents no i want you to take that joe she said when i sort of began to stutter it would have cost me much more than that to take a cab but but look here miss barclay good night joe be careful of the flower beds when you drive out i told her what she could do with her flower beds and fourbit pieces i told her she could walk in mud up to her ears before i gave her another ride i but i was ten miles down the road when i did it at the time i couldnt think of any more to say than i can now when she ties me into knots not as much maybe because i hadnt had any practice my next runin with her was a sunday about two weeks later i was still sore or thought i was but when she motioned me over to the box office i went running like a dog running for a bone come around to the door she said youre in the way of the patrons there and i went around then she said i want you to do an errand for me joe and i said well well thank you a whole row of seats has broken down she went on i want you to go over to the methodist church and pick up thirty of their folding chairs ive already called about them i gulped and got started so fast i didnt really understand what shed told me i heard it you know but i didnt understand it and when i did or thought i did i still couldnt believe it i got the chairs after some pretty chilly looks from the parson and took them back and set them up by that time i was so late on the route that a couple of hours more wouldnt make any difference so i found a little engine trouble and id just got it fixed when the show closed for the night so i drove her home again she didnt hand me fifty cents that night she said something about not having any change i knew she had a fivepound sack full and that shed pay me some other time ill settle cheap i said bracing myself tell me i mean can i ask you a question certainly you may were those chairs you got tonight were they some youd loaned to the church no i thought i mentioned they were theirs you mean i said you borrowed thirty chairs from a church for a picture show on sunday night she frowned a little then her face cleared you mean they might have been using them oh but i knew they wouldnt be that church never has anything approaching a crowd on sunday night well i said well that makes everything just dandy i found out later that her old man her grandfather rather had donated the sites for most of the churches in town so i guess she felt like they owed her a few favors and they apparently felt the same way jesus what a hell of a way to collect it was like asking to sleep with a mans wife because he owed you five dollars after that after i really began to notice things to do something besides set the film cans in the lobby and beat it i saw her head for one jam after another and instead of pointing my nose the other way id jump in and try to give her a straight steer she had trouble spelled all over her shed always have it and i knew it and i didnt want it any different then you dont buy a twentythreejewel watch and hope to turn it into an alarm clock i didnt have any idea of ever changing her the funniest deal came up one night over some color film she was using simplex projectors with nine hundredwatt mazdas and the way the stuff came out on the screen was pretty godawful most of the time you could tell the men from the women characters but they all looked like theyd been brawling in a jelly closet im going to make them give me a rebate on this she told me ive never seen such a thing in my life you wont get any rebate i said this print is brand new thats the trouble with it what little color stuff youve played in the past has been old and those mazdas would shoot through it but theres more and more color coming in and youll probably be getting a lot of new prints oh she began to look a little sick what should i do joe get rid of the lamps and put in carbon arcs theyll cut through anything are they pretty expensive well its going to cost you something to convert sure i said but you should be able to squeeze around that talk it over with your powerandlight man here show him how the arcs will burn more juice and its to his advantage for you to have them if you handle it right you might be able to get him to put them in for you she brightened up and said shed try it two weeks later she was still using lamps and from what little i could get out of her i knew shed keep right on using them as far as the manager of the powerandlight company was concerned well i picked a light night on the route drove to beat hell for sixteen hours straight and got back into stoneville early the next morning i brushed up a little bit and paid a call on the power company not that id expected him to be but the manager wasnt an imbecile or a boor or a grafter he was just a pretty pleasant citizen whod spent a lot of time learning his business and he wasnt going to let anyone tell him where to get off even if he had been trotting around town with his tail sticking out at a time when she had six dresses for every day in the week i dont know what i said to him nothing in particular i guess we sat around and talked for thirty minutes or so and went out and had coffee together and that was all there was to it two days later the arcs went in i could tell you some more things along the same line but there wouldnt be too much point to it the times better used probably in mentioning that shed found out plenty about me about all there was to find out her mother was pretty feeble and i used to inquire about her so sooner or later of course she had to inquire about mine about my folks and that brought up the orphanage and one thing led to another at first i told her id picked up the projectionist trade when i was in the orphanage but then i remembered telling her id skipped out of the joint when i was fourteen and rather than look like a liar i told her the truth was the reform the industrial school very bad joe i thought it was at the time i said but after i saw a few i told her about the jails i told her how it was when you really got down to the bottom of the pot how youd get seventytwo hours on vagrancy as soon as you hit a town how theyd float you back on the road again before you could get a job or even a good meal in your belly im never going to go back to stuff like that i said theyll have to kill me first or she said yeah i said itll be or before they get me down again i didnt have to tell her why i was sticking to what looked like a pretty cheap job because i knew she knew maybe she didnt know any more about business and public relations than a twoyearold but she could see an angle a mile off particularly where it concerned me most of the time it was like we were looking out the same window there were around fifty customers on my route they bought product on everything from a twoday to a weeks option i mean it was their right to keep it for a week if they wanted to which didnt mean that they always would they just bought a long option to play safe well suppose they decided to keep it four days or less then turned it back to me for pickup i take it on down the road a ways and give another house a run on it for half price the house is able to make one more change on the week than its been making and i pick up a ten spot or so i had to be careful bicycling film is a penitentiary offense but a guy thats actually hauling the product a guy that knows just who is buying from where can get away with it the exchanges cant afford to check the small towns theyve maybe got a damned good idea theyre being roped but unless it gets too bad they let it go i never let it get too bad well theres not a lot more to tell stoneville wasnt important enough as a show town then for the union to bother with and elizabeth had a punk boy working in the booth one of those sharp lads who has to think ten or fifteen minutes before he can decide which end of the match to strike his best trick was to get the reel in backward or out of sequence but he had a lot of others missing changeovers forgetting to turn the sound on hitting the arcs before the film was rolling it was the last one that finally got me by this time id rearranged my route so that stoneville was my last stop instead of the first one and id stay there overnight before going back to the city sure at a hotel where do you think anyway i was sitting in the house that night when i finally got just as much of that punk as i could take hed already run one reel backward hed missed two changeovers and hed turned the sound on full and forgot about it thats more boners than a good projectionist will pull in a lifetime but the punk wasnt through yet right after the second miss he caught the film on fire if youve gone to many picture shows particularly back in the early days of the business youve seen it happen once or twice the film will hit the screen like a still then it looks like someone is punching a live cigar butt through it from the back thats caused by not having the film rolling while the arcs are on because those arcs are just like a blast furnace and nothing burns as easily or faster than film projectors are fixed so that nothing but the film in the frame can burn but not everyone knows that and even if they did what the hell no ones going to thank you for not roasting them no ones going to pay dough to sit in a dark house while some boob splices film i climbed up into the booth without saying a word and the punk didnt ask me anything i just took the splicingknife and the glue pot away from him tied the film back together and started the projector rolling again then i walked over to him and stood up close he wasnt home talent any trouble that was made would have to come from him which way do you want to go out of here i said walking or sliding before he could say what he was getting ready to that i couldnt fire him and that if elizabeth paid him better dough hed do a better job i slapped him i gave him the old cop trick a slap for taking up my time a slap for not answering questions a slap because he couldnt answer em a slap because it hurt my hand a slap because he was such a sickeninglooking son of a bitch with the blood running out of him and a dozen good hard ones on general principles i shoved fifteen bucks at him his weeks pay told him to go out the exit and keep going and tossed his coat and hat after him thats the last i saw of him from that day to this when the box office closed and elizabeth came up i was still sore enough to tell her what id done the details do you think that was necessary joe her eyebrows went up what the hell can he do i said hes too scared to sue and he doesnt have any friends or family here joe she said ah joe i drove her home and sat in the kitchen while she made coffee and sandwiches shed hardly spoken a word since wed left the show and she didnt say much more until the food was ready then she sat down across from me studying her chin in her hand how much money have you joe she said at last i told her i had a little over two grand around twentyone fifty well i havent any she said no more than my operating capital on top of that i cant go on much longer without at least a little new equipment and on top of that theres a fifteenhundreddollar pastdue mortgage on this house ill lend you the money i said you can have anything ive got ill get you a decent projectionist too for fifteen a week joe she shook her head and i couldnt take a loan from you id never be able to pay it back well i hesitated im a good ten years older than you are joe so what i said look are we talking about the same thing well then put it this way ill run your machines until we can train some local kid to do a halfway decent job ill get a couple weeks vacation and do it and you can have the money as a gift or you can take it as a loan hell you cant ever tell when your luck will change but as far as joe i dont but im not buying any women i said not you anyhow she looked at me and her eyes kept getting bigger and blacker and there were tears in them and yet there was a smile too a smile that was like nothing id ever seen before or ever got again from her or anyone else youre good joe she said i hope youll always hold on to that thought you are good aw hell i said youve got me mixed up with someone else im just a bum she shook her head ever so little and her eyes got deeper and blacker and she took a deep breath like a swimmer going under water isnt it a pity joe that you wont buy me when youre the only person i could possibly sell to ive only got a little more to say about us our marriage and probably it isnt necessary what smells good in the store may stink in the stew pot you cant blame a train for running on tracks ten years is a hell of a long time so to get back to the present when i went downstairs around ten the next morning elizabeth was in the livingroom and old andy taylor was with her i shook hands and asked elizabeth why she hadnt called me i wouldnt let her said andy just stopped by for a little visit nothing important have a good trip to the city soso i said howd you hurt your hand i cut it on a bottle i was opening i said its nothing serious hes a sharp old buzzard a buzzard is just what he looks like now that i come to think of it hes got reddishgray hair thats always hanging out from under his hat because hes too stingy to get it cut and his nose is like a beak ive never really seen his eyes theyre so far back in his head and ive never seen him in anything but an old broadcloth suit that you could beat from now until doomsday and not get the dust out of hes somewhere past sixty he lives in back of one of his buildings wheres that hired girl of yours he shot out suddenly what i said you mean carol why i guess shes i let her have a few days off said elizabeth the childs not been anywhere or got to do anything since shes been here saw her down to the bus station wondered where she was goin i laughed and lit a cigarette dont tell me you didnt find out meanin to but it kind of slipped my mind he grinned he knows that everyone knows how he is and he doesnt care hes rich enough that he doesnt have to believe ill take one of your cigarettes he said i gave him one elizabeth excused herself and went out andy sat puffing on his cigarette puffing on it until i thought he was going to suck it down his throat he didnt talk while he smoked just kept puffing until there wasnt anything left to puff well whats on your mind andy i said when he had dropped the butt on an ash tray want some passes to the show ill leave them for you at the box office thank you joe he said i guess my customer liability falls due this month i said i can give you a check now if you want it aint no hurry joe no hurry at all i started getting fidgety waiting isnt my long suit and anyway i knew what he had on his mind hed never given up prodding me about it since it had happened dont want to rent me another show for a percentage of the gross do you i asked well no cant say as i do okay i said im here listening you can talk when youre ready you did give me a raw deal joe now youll admit that wont you oh sure i said just the kind youd like to give me no i wouldnt joe im pretty tight maybe but i never crooked anyone out of a penny yet i didnt crook you i outsmarted you i wouldnt brag about it joe it dont take much brains to outsmart a man who trusts you theres another name for that hell i said you brought it up what do you want to do about it anyway ill leave it to you joe twentyfive dollars a month dont even pay taxes on that building what do you think you ought to do well i told you before andy ill let you out of the lease if you want to remodel the building change it into something besides a show house huh he grunted an what would that cost plenty i said enough so you couldnt ever afford to convert back into a show again no matter what kind of deal was put up to you thats your last word joe youve made up your mind not to do anything not a goddam thing i nodded you ought to know that by this time you dont need money so i dont feel sorry for you and theres no way i can be forced to pay you more than twentyfive a month how about yourself joe how do you mean dont you think you ought to do the right thing for your own sake you mean so my conscience wont hurt i laughed dont kid me andy no that aint what i mean he scowled and got up but i dont reckon theres any use talking to you you mark my word joe wilmot you better change your ways or or he turned and stamped out without finishing i went into the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee elizabeth was having some coffee too and i tried to strike up a conversation with her because after all we had been married for ten years and we didnt have much time left to spend together but she wasnt having any and i didnt care much there wasnt anything girlish about her this morning she looked plain damned old i drove into town yawning wishing that the whole business was over so i could relax and get some rest i fished my mail out of the box office and read it in my car it was the usual stuff confirmation of bookings advertisements a copy of the motion picture herald i put the other stuff in my pocket and opened the herald there was a story in it i was following some exhibitor out in the western part of the state had filed suit against the major exchanges to compel them to supply him with pictures that was two years ago and they were still hearing evidence in the case my personal opinion was that hed better turn his house into a shootinggallery you just cant win against the exchanges theyve got too many loopholes on their side take substitutions for example every once in a while ill get a picture i didnt book in place of the one i did it has to be that way in a business where a highly perishable product has maybe a hundred other buyers it happens pretty seldom with me because i stand in well and im an important exhibitor but if i didnt and wasnt well see what i mean i could get substitutes five times out of five my advertising money would be wasted my customers would never know for sure what i was showing in any smallcity house a large part of the patronage comes from the farmers and surrounding villages i can stand out in front of my house and count people from half a dozen smaller towns and its because i get the pictures ahead of the smaller places its no more than fair because ive got a bigger and better house and i can pay more than the small town and the exchanges are willing to give me preferred booking if they werent id probably have to close up id hate to try to operate with every wide place in the road around me getting pictures before i did almost as bad as id hate to show in court why i was entitled to pull trade away from another showman jimmie nedry showed up around eleven and we went inside it was thursday and our fridays product should have been in for screening but it wasnt i called home and it hadnt been dropped off there either i put in a call to the city and got jiggs larrimore on the wire jiggs is manager of one of the little exchanges i dont particularly need him and he needs me bad i guess theres been a little mixup joe he said ill tell you what youd better do you just hold over the picture youve been playing and well take care of anything extra you have to pay on the option yeah i said now ill tell you what youd better do youd better get that picture here to me and get it here pronto now look joe its for my fridaysaturday show you know ive got to have a western on friday and saturday the yokels wont go for anything else but its too late to huhuh no it isnt jiggs i said craig citys got that picture advertised for today theyve been advertising it here in my hometown paper you pull their print over to me jiggs it doesnt make any difference in a town that big whether they play horse opera on the weekend or not well now i could hear him gulp i dont believe we can do that joe why not because its one of sol panzers houses well after all look i said how many of those panzpalace houses are you in sol gives you a spot whenever he feels like it and that aint often i buy the block you pull that pic over here jiggs you get it here quick if you dont ill set out every one of your dates and sell you a roll of tickets besides jiggs sighed i hear you talking joe here it comes i hung up and turned to jimmie nedry i guess thatll show mr big time panzer something i said hell do a little thinking before he runs any more ads in this town yeah said jimmie so what i let it pass and went on outside i knewjimmie was feeling low about his money troubles and id thought it would cheer him up to hear jiggs larrimore catch hell thats one reason id cracked down onjiggs but jimmie didnt react like he should have he couldnt think about anything but his own worries the thought flashed through my mind for a second that maybe there was something more to that picture mixup than solly panzers trying to pull a fast one on me and crazy as the idea was it made me shiver to think about it it was just one of those things that happen it couldnt be anything else i had the barclay in a spot that no one could touch and everyone knew it just the same though i couldnt help thinking wouldnt that be hell wouldnt it just be sweet to mix yourself in a murder and then find out that it hadnt got you anything i worked my way around the square shaking hands and slapping backs and talking about crops and kids until i got to sims pool hall then i went inside and drank a bottle of beer and bought one for sim there were a lot of young bucks in there and it wasnt long before most of them were around me id picked up some new stories on film row after wed all had a few laughs and theyd bought me a beer or two i moved on again well i did buy a package of mints first about a block down the street i ran into reverend connors the christian church minister i bought a couple of tickets he was selling to a pie sociable and wrote him out a pass to the show i knew he wouldnt use it and no one else could since id put his name on it ill tell you what reverend i said if the church ladies would like to set up a table for their stuff in the lobby of the show id be glad to have them bless you brother wilmot he said theyll be delighted to hear that he went away real pleased i was sort of pleased myself it would help to draw a crowd and wherever theres a crowd theres business a half hour or so later i ran into jeffery higginbotham the high school principal he and i dont ever get familiar but we understand each other he was kind of worried on my account the junior class was giving a play next month theyd picked a saturday night date to give it what did i think naturally i thought it was a hell of a note but i didnt say so why thats swell i said ill let you have the show to put it on in but we couldnt do that he said you couldnt lose your nights business for us mr wilmot i couldnt afford to but i would i said if it wasnt for sentiment among the town businessmen you know a picture show draws a lot of business to a town im afraid they wouldnt like it if i didnt run on a saturday night no i dont suppose they would he said but now heres my idea i said ill turn the show over to you after midnight the kids will love that you know having a regular midnight show bigcity style and youll catch a lot of customers youd miss otherwise a lot of people that come for the picture will stay to see the play thats good reasoning he said and his eyes twinkled and a lot of people who intend to see the play will come early to see the picture or had you thought of that it never entered my mind i said we both laughed and i moved on again igot back to the show at two oclock when the matinee was starting mrs artie fletcher my cashier yes and president of the legion auxiliary was talking over the telephone with her back half turned to the window ive got a sign on that phone saying no personal calls please and ive given her more than one hint about using it but it dont bother her any i guess she thinks the rules dont apply to auxiliary women i guess they dont either several people had to wait around for tickets my doorman is harry clinkscales the captain of the high school football team if i could buy him for what hes worth and sell him for what he thinks he is id retire tomorrow hes not even honest like youd ordinarily expect a big overgrown piefaced dumbbell to be i know he knocks down on the popcorn machine and if i didnt keep close watch on him hed pass in a dozen females a day i wouldnt mind if it was just a few the day went fast it was five oclock before i knew it late supper at the palace restaurant had some pie and coffee at mikes barbecue and bought some cigarettes at the city drug i suppose that sounds pretty narrow and scheming that tradespreading stunt and some of the others ive told you about but when everyone else is the same what choice have you got bower the guy that used to own the other house couldnt be bothered about stuff like that but look what happened to him elizabeth couldnt be bothered either and look at the shape she was in when i first met her i didnt tell you i guess but elizabeth went into the show business in the first place because she knew she wasnt a mixer and she thought it was one business where she wouldnt have to be people would just lay their money down quietly and pass inside and that would finish the transaction she thought at six oclock i gave jimmie nedry a twohour relief after that i went back outside sheriff rufe waters and his deputy randy cobb sauntered up and stood beside me at the curb good show joe rufe said fair i said aint got an empty seat or two you aint using said randy sure i have i said and i gave the doorman the nod you boys go on in it wasnt more than fifteen minutes before web clay our county attorney showed up with his wife and i had to pass them in too and before the evening was over i must have walked in a dozen hell i dont know how people get that way i dont know what theyre thinking about sure ive got empty seats thats the only kind i can sell what if i walked into a bank and asked em if they had some fourbit pieces they werent using its the same proposition the literary club brought an author here once and i was sold a ticket so i went to hear him he was a big gawky guy named thomas or thompson or something like that and i guess hed put a few under his belt because he sure pulled all the stops he spent most of his time talking about people who asked him for free books and seemed to think he ought to be tickled to death to give em away he said that sarcasm was wasted on such people and that the homicide laws ought to be amended to take care of them well there wasnt a person in the house that hadnt hit me for an annie oakley at one time or another but do you know what instead of getting mad or ashamed they sat there and clapped their hands off they didnt seem to realize that they were the kind of people this author was talking about well at tenthirty mrs artie fletcher closed her window so fast she almost took off a customers fingers and harry clinkscales tore off without even pulling the switch on the popcorn machine i took a look inside jimmie nedry was just making one of his perfect changeovers and his daughter lottie my usher was brushing up the aisles i went back outside again i didnt need to worry about those two theyd be on the job as long as there was a customer in the house and everything would be in good shape when they left i went into the box office checked the receipts and locked them in the floor safe just before midnight while i was taking a last turn through the house jimmies two boys came in with what was left of the display matter theyd been on the run all day and they were shaking and so out of breath they could hardly talk they hurried right on home with lottie to get supper ready before jimmie got there all of a sudden it hit me that the only people who were dependable and hard working were those that didnt amount to anything it wasnt fair but it was that way and i wondered why it was i wondered why when there was so damned many of em they didnt get together and run things themselves and i made up my mind if they ever did get an organization a going organization that is they could count me in elizabeth woke me up early saturday morning the film truck just came joe she said its here jeopardy of the jungle yes youd better get upright away weve got a lot to do i said okay and she left the room i didnt want to get up i wanted to stay right there and leave everything that was going to happen a good long way in the future and i couldnt i couldnt because while i didnt want to go through with it i didnt want not to either that sounds crazy but its the only way i know to put it just a few days before any little thing was enough to make me throw the brakes on like for instance passing up that hitchhiker but now i knew nothing could stop me i hadnt liked the scheme but neither had i fought it id just rocked along with it getting a little more used to it every minute and now it was doing the rocking i couldnt back out i didnt want to back out coming out of the bathroom i glanced into elizabeths room a hat with a heavy veil was laying lying on a chair near the bed next to it was a little overnight bag the hat was an old one and would never be missed in case anyone should get funny ideas and start checking up the few odds and ends she was taking in the bag would never be missed either i went downstairs swallowed some coffee and went out to the garage id got a travelogue a newsreel and a cartoon along with jeopardy in all there were twentythree reels of film i was just thinking i said carol may not be able to get anyone perhaps we ought to wait until how are you going to wait elizabeth asked youve got to go into the city i dont have to i said yes you do joe the farther youre away from things the better off itll be if carol shouldnt get anyone theres no harm done ill straighten things up and well try again in a few weeks but someone might look in and dont be silly ill keep the door locked we ran the reels through the rewind to shake the water off of them it was turned on full speed since we werent checking the film and it didnt take long i unreeled fifteen or twenty feet of the cartoon and elizabeth knitted it back and forth through the other film we shoved the pile underneath the rewind table i pulled the good cord loose from its connections and hooked the motor up with the old one i threw a few loops around it with the cartoon and pulled the rest of the reel under the table i stood back and looked things over the film was touching the bare copper of the cord in a couple of places i shifted it back and forth until it was just right carol wouldnt need more than a minute but shed sure as hell need that elizabeth was sitting on the stool she looked even paler than usual you didnt need to help with this i said i could have done it she got up youre all through now youre not going to leave that other cord on the floor are you why not its the best way of getting rid of it yes she said and i wasnt just imagining that she was paler then she went out the door ahead of me i put the padlock on it and gave her the key thats the way it was wed done it so often in our minds that i guess it would have seemed stranger not doing it than doing it i went up to my room threw a few things into my grip and came back downstairs elizabeth got up from a chair in the livingroom and took a step toward me i took one toward her well joe she said well i said i guess this is it i guess we wont be seeing each other any more that is if carol gets the her party shell get her all right said elizabeth ive never had any doubt about that well goodby i said ill always remember you elizabeth youd better joe ill what do you mean twentyfive thousand dollars thats what we agreed on i said wheres the argument i hoped she wouldnt say anything more its hell to want to sock your wife the last time youre seeing her i want to make myself clear joe if your memory should fail you there will be exceedingly unpleasant consequences hell i said what do you think i am anyway exactly what i always did i walked out ordinarily if id wanted to go into the city i wouldnt have bothered to make excuses to anyone id have just gone but now it was different i had to have a good reason for going and there was only one i could think of i beat jimmie nedry to the show by about thirty minutes and went up to the projection booth by the time he got there id taken the parts cabinet off the wall and had everything in it spread out on the rewind table he didnt say anything at first just gave me that sullen hopeless look hed been pulling lately and stripped out of his coat shirt and undershirt those carbon arcs really heat up the booth i went on pawing though and finally he asked me what i was looking for im looking for the spare photoelectric cells for our sound heads i said it doesnt look like we have any weve got em he grunted well i dont believe we have jimmie i said i thought id make a check on our parts last night when you were on your relief and i couldnt find them then and ive taken everything out this morning and they got to be there he said let me look he began sorting through the stuff impatiently half sore he wound up by picking up each part separately and putting it back in the cabinet his face had fallen about a foot i i just cant believe it mr wilmpt we had some spares up there well i know it couldnt have been more than two or three days ago you havent used any since of course i aint if i had id have told you so you could reorder hmmm i said did you actually see the cells or just the little carton they come in well thats it i said at one time or another weve replaced the cells in the machines and put the empty cartons back in the cabinet im not saying you did it i may have myself but what became of the cartons they must have dropped down and got swept out no one would pay any attention to them as long as they were empty yeah but im not blaming you jimmie the thing is to get some more we dont want to be playing silent over sunday no he nodded that would be bad youll bring some cells back when you go into the city i wasnt planning on going into the city i said but ill have to now its too late for the express to reach us and the stores will be closed tomorrow yeah i see he rubbed his chin giving me a puzzled funny look whenll you be back just as soon as i get the cells probably early tomorrow morning you you wont have to stay over for anything else why should i nothin he mumbled turning around to the projectors i was just wondering a hundred miles up the road i stopped at a restaurant for a bite to eat and called carol from a booth phone she must have been waiting right by the phone because she answered right away im coming in i said will i get to see you she said no im leaving right away that was right it was what she was supposed to say get your baggage taken care of not all of it she said ill send for the rest later that was right too did you get in touch with that party you spoke about yes and shes going to be very helpful well have a good trip i said and be careful i will be you be careful she said we said goodby and hung up the car was running pretty hot by the time i got to the city and i had good reason to take it to a garage i told them i wanted the radiator backflushed a grease job and an oil change they were rushed since it was saturday and they wouldnt promise to get the work done before nine that night i groused a little about it but i left the car of course if id started back home right away i couldnt have got there ahead of carol but i didnt want to be on the road when things popped i wanted to be able to prove where i was i bought two photoelectric cells at the theatrical equipment house and dropped them into the first trash can i passed it was just like throwing twelve bucks away but it couldnt be helped id left the two id lifted from the show in the car and there was no way i could explain the extras and anyway what was twelve bucks i could prove that id had to come into the city and that id actually bought the cells twelve dollars was pretty cheap for that i ate dinner at a restaurant on film row and walked around awhile restless not knowing what to do with myself all the exchanges except hap chances had been closed since noon and i wasnt sure that i wanted to kill any time with him on the other hand a sharpie like that might be just the kind to use for an alibi i stopped across the street from his place trying to decide whether to drop in on him and he looked out and saw me he got up dimmed the lights and drew the shades i was thinking what the hell when he opened the door and motioned i crossed the street whats up hap i said pop in laddie he said ill tell you in a sec he closed the door and locked it and we went back to his desk he brought out the whisky and a couple of glasses and we both had a drink he poured a second for himself well hap i said ive got some information for you old man i wouldnt care to have anyone know it came from me all right i said under the hat you recall our conversation of a few days ago yes what did you make of it why i said i hadnt thought much about it i supposed maybe you had a buyer for a house and you thought you might make a deal for mine nothing else no he frowned slightly shaking his head i suppose not i didnt give you a great deal to go on still there at the last when you forgot to buy paper on jep i dont claim a perfect memory whats on your mind hap youre broke laddie what i said i say youre stony id have told you the other night but i wasnt too sure about my facts at any rate i dont know that theres anything you could have done about it you havent told me anything yet i said what do you mean im broke sol panzers moving in on you i laughed nuts hap all right laddie the towns too small for panzpalace it isnt a fourth big enough its big enough said hap its big enough if so says it is think it over in ten years youve built a fine house with a fine business out of nothing sol can point to that if he needs to justify himself which he wont panzer owns control of panzpalace hes always made money for the stockholders now i dont give a damn about that i said panzpalace doesnt build anything less than a milliondollar house and a milliondollar house just wont pay off there you mean you cant sell enough admissions certainly thats what i mean how else could you make it pay oh laddie hap made a clicking noise with his tongue what hour yesterday were you born you can make it pay by cutting your overhead rather by shifting the costs you cant do it because you dont have any place to shift them to but sol has ninetythree other houses he can make a house earn just as much or just as little as he wants it to yeah but but why does he want to do it i dropped you a hint about that the other night i asked you if there was a chance that your house would be worth a million meaning of course would anyone be jailed for paying you that much for it i thought we might peddle it to him did you try no use merely wishful thinking on my part theres a lot of loose change when you start breaking up a million dollars but you have to break it to get it sol has to build i saw that as soon as id taken time to study the matter i began to tremble inside i mopped my face youre not lying to me hap really old man but i cant blame you for being disturbed if youre looking for confirmation drop around to the exchanges and try to buy for next season i think youll find that theyll stall you jesus i said or have they already i see it was a stall now i said i didnt think anything of it at the time its such a relief not to have them trying to load you that i hap clicked his tongue again trying to look sympathetic i saw his angle sol hadnt needed his stuff to shut me out the other exchanges were enough now since it wasnt costing him anything hap was palling up to me hoping that it would hurt panzer in some way i cant tell you how sorry lam old man i was just wondering yeah i said perhaps you could force sol to drive a deal with you you can probably pick up a dozen pix or so from the little fellows and of course you can count on my lineup every last picture ive got why what the hell are you talking about i said if there was any way i could run on your stuff it wouldnt be open and you wouldnt be sitting there offering it to me please laddie not so loud nuts i said panzer tried to play without you and you found out about it you dont care whether he finds out you told me you hope he will itll teach him to call you in the next time he cuts a pie hap sighed we should have been partners great minds et cetera you know what i thought when i first saw you tonight i dont particularly give a damn dont be rude joseph i might slap the unholy god out of you all right i said what did you think well i thought you had caught my hint after all that that was why you were in town i dont get you i said i had to come in to buy some photoelectric cells perfect he beamed but lets not be coy with one another you know my attitude toward insurance companies feel its more or less a civic duty to rook em now wait a minute i said i i i thought heres old joe virtually on the point of losing his shirt and heres this unwholesome insurance policy just lying around and collecting dust and doing no one the slightest good and i put myself in your place laddie i thought now what would a keen chap like old joseph do bbut you do have insurance on the show certainly i have but goddamit dont be vehement laddie im on your side yeah i said yeah but but my voice rose and he frowned and started to call me down and then his eyes narrowed and he just sat there watching me it wasnt necessary to tell me to shut up i couldnt say anything i couldnt move you see he had the whole thing wrong and yet he was in the right he was right enough to pin my ears back and keep them pinned if he wanted to and he would want to hed play it for all it was worth but bad as that was it wasnt what really got me what got me what made me feel like i was going crazy was the realization that the woman was going to die for nothing her death wasnt going to mean a thing it was just murder nothing more than murder with none of us better off than if she had lived and now there wasnt any way i could stop it i knew those bus schedules backward and forward and i knew it was too late theres nothing quite so silent as film row on saturday night the playgrand exchange was half a dozen doors up the street but when their phones began ringing they sounded like they were in the next room they stopped ringing in playgrand and began in utopian and then they rang in colfax and wolfe and finally hap was watching me like a hawk he spit on the carpet without ever taking his eyes off me and picked up his phone yes he said righto operator put em on mr wilmot why yes i believe i can reach him was there some message you give me that phone i said and grabbed for it he planted his foot in my stomach and i doubled up with the wind knocked out of me what he said why thats terrible i cant tell you how sorry i certainly i will certainly as a matter of fact hes just stepped into the office ill break the news to him gently he hung up the receiver poured a glassful of whisky and handed it to me brace yourself old man theres been a terrible accident your wife there was a grin on his face a foot wide all stoneville is grieving over the death of elizabeth barclay wilmot wife of josephj wilmot local theater magnate who passed away in afire at the wilmot estate saturday night cause ofthefire has not been determined but it is suspected that rats gnawing at the wiring may have been responsible the fire broke out about nine oclock shortly after mrs wilmot had returned from wheat city where she had gone to pick up miss carol farmer a household employee miss farmer who was on her way back to stoneville from a vacation had missed her bus while dining in wheat city and had called mrs wilmot to come after her upon reach ing the wilmot residence here miss farmer went into the house and mrs wilmot repaired to the upstairs of the ga rage which was equipped as afilminspecting room when the fire burst into being a few minutes later miss farmer notified the stoneville fire department which promptly and efficiently answered the call but little if anything could be done to defeat the holocaust while the inspection room itself wasfirep roof the heat was so intense that the supports and exterior walls of the building ignited and crumbled mrs wilmot was pinned beneath a work bench mr wilmot who was out of town on business was not ified of the tragedy by telephone suffering from shock and grief he was accompanied home by mr harbert a chance film company executive mr chance an old friend of mr wilmots will remain in stoneville temporarily to assist in the conduct of the latters affairs mr wilmot has been convalescing in the stoneville sanitarium suffering from shock and grief but is expected to i read a story one time about a fellow that was accidentally slipped into a big job president of a company or something like that he looked like the guy that actually was president see and when this guy ran off or fell in a mudhole or something and wasnt ever seen again why this one hooked his place he didnt know beans about the business and all he planned on doing was to stick around long enough to snap a few rubber checks and maybe get the other guys gal alone in the parlor for a while but once he got inside the graft looked so good that he decided to stay for a real milking he was scared out of his pants naturally because he didnt know any more about the setup than a hog does about ice skates but he ran a bluff and damned if he didnt make good on it his work was just cut out for him see what i mean the stenographers would bring him letters to sign and hed just sign em and when he got any letters his vicepresidents or some of his secretaries would take charge of them and when people showed up for conferences all he had to do was keep his eyes and ears open and he could see what he had to do he didnt have to move he got moved as i remember the yarn he wound up by getting made president of a lot of other companies and marrying the other guys gal and no one ever knew the difference well when i read that i thought it was strictly off the cob and i knew itd be just my luck to have the thing made into a movie and id have to see it but if you asked me now id say it wasnt corn if i hadnt been worried about hap chance and being broke i wouldnt have done much worrying up to a certain point i didnt have to explain the accident if you want to call it that there were several stories going around that were better than any i could dream up i didnt have to pretend i was suffering from shock and grief they told me i was a delegation brought me some mourning clothes tuesday afternoon and sheriff rufe waters and county attorney web clay and a couple of fellows from the chamber of commerce drove me over to the mortuary in a limousine rufe and webb took me into the chapel to look at the casket but not inside it and then they took me right out again i didnt hear much of the services because someone thought i was looking peaked and they took me into the rest room they gave me a couple of drinks to brace me up and made me lie down on the lounge and after the services were over they got me up again i rode out to the cemetery with rufe and web and one of the legion boys and a fellow from the farmers union rufe is the wheel horse for the democratic party and web is the same for the republicans if id been picking a foursome to ride with from the standpoint of keeping all sides happy i couldnt have done better and i hadnt had to do it it was done for me it started to rain a little on the edge of town just a few drops but by the time we passed our my place it was misting pretty hard i looked up the lane toward the garage and of course there wasnt any just part of the framework and a pile of timber and metal and ashes but there was a guy chasing around trying to cover things up with pieces of canvas i asked who he was thats the investigator from the insurance company said rule looks like hed have enough decency to lay off during the ceremony ive got my eye on him said web im just hoping he gets out of line a little he cant come into my county and tell me how to run things i wanted to ask him what the trouble was but i decided it wouldnt be appropriate or smart the longer i could stay in the background and let my friends do my arguing the better off i was i guess almost the whole county was at the cemetery there wasnt room for half the people inside and they were parked along the grade for almost a mile on either side of the gates they all stood up when we passed stood along the side of the road or on their runningboards or wagon beds with their heads bowed it gave you an awfully funny feeling it made you feel almost like it was judgment day like theyd all been pulled up out of everywhere for the trumpets blast before they could move it was kind of scary i remember one woman in particular she was standing up in a wagon box with a big fat squawling baby in each arm they looked damned near as big as she was and shed started to feed them i guess because she had her blouse open and what babies go for was hanging out on each side it wasnt hanging right though and the kids were as mad as all hell twisting and screaming and grabbing at it and trying to raise their heads up but she just stood there with her head bowed like everyone else we drove through the cemetery gates and got out web and rufe stood by me at the grave the minister began his oratory a lot of mumbo jumbo about being washed in the blood of the lamb and people being better off dead than they were alive and all the time by god acting like it was deep stuff and the different bands began to play nearer my god to thee and they couldnt play with themselves let alone with each other and the church choirs kept racing ahead and falling behind and but it wasnt funny ive never felt more like bawling in my life there are some things so bad and so careless that you wish to god they didnt pretend to be goodintentioned so you could put in a holler without making a heel of yourself ive felt pretty much the same way looking at newsreels of ceremonies at the tomb of the unknown soldier the bands playing and the people singing all in their own way the right way and the generals the statesmen and the club ladies all speaking a little piece for themselves and they all mean so goddam well i guess and no one is responsible any more than i was responsible for her i bawled there beside the grave with the rain coming down harder and harder i felt just as bad as if id known the woman i could hardly see a thing i was crying so hard i saw carol for a second on the other side of the grave and then everything got blurry again web and rufe led me away we went back to the car and they put me inside while they waited outside one at each door it came over me all of a sudden that i was a prisoner that the reason they were with me was to watch me i leaned forward to get out of the car and web clay eased me back i tried it again i knocked his hand out of the way you let me out of here i yelled i cant stand any more take me away from here maybe wed better web said rule joes been under an awful strain web said yes i had and went and got the other two fellows we drove away web rode with his arm around me almost with my head pulled down against his chest and rule made me take a new silk handkerchief to blow my nose on they took me into the house what you need joe is a good stiff drink said web rufe you got anything in the car ive got something i said straightening up a little i guess we all need a little something we went up to my room and had a few good stiff drinks and swapped a little talk rule and web got friendlier than id ever seen them while we were up there carol and some of the town ladies were busy downstairs fixing coffee and laying out sandwiches and cake when the crowd began to come in from the funeral the boys took me downstairs again i was sat down and stood up and made to eat cake and sandwiches and coffee and when the people began to file past me in a line on the way out they the ones that were taking care of me even did my talking yes yes thats very kind of you neighbor joe appreciates that very much joe thanks you very much i guess they would have even shook shaken hands for me if they could have by this time it was dark practically everyone was gone except the ladies who were staying to help carol i went upstairs and had a few more drinks and tried not to think it was raining to beat hell now and the wind was coming up i heard rufe and web pulling out for town and pretty soon another car left behind theirs the insurance mans there seemed to be a draft coming from somewhere i thought maybe someone had left a window open i took another stiff drink and looked through the upstairs room by room there wasnt any window open i went downstairs again all the ladies had left except mrs reverend whitcomb she was staying that night to keep the proprieties she fussed around me for almost an hour trying to do things for me that i didnt want done when shed worn us both out she hobbled into the downstairs bedroom and closed the door id think she weighed around twoeighty and she wasnt much taller than a quart of beer shed been going through doors sideways for so long that she kind of waltzed when she walked when she got into bed one of the slats popped like a gun going off then there was a rasping grating sound like a bale of wire being dragged across a tin roof and the whole house shook are you all right mrs whitcomb i called she was silent or not exactly silent either i could hear her panting for breath quite all right brother wilmot she said finally i hesitated are you sure theres nothing i can do for you i knew damned well the bed had broken down oh no brother wilmot im just dandy now you run along carol was still busy in the kitchen i went upstairs took another drink and went to bed i didnt hear her when she came up the stairs she opened the door and came in without turning the light on and in one of the dim flashes of lightning from the storm i saw her pulling her dress off over her head you shouldnt do that carol i whispered its all right she whispered back i peeked in at mrs reverend whitcomb shes sleeping down inside the bedstead the mattress and springs fell through with her i grinned i even laughed a little quietly its funny how you still laugh youd better go on anyway carol i said ive got a chill a pretty bad cold youre liable to catch it i wont face you she said i was lying with my knees drawn up my hands under the pillow taking up most of the bed she got in with her back to me pushed back gently until my knees came down she pulled one of my arms under her and the other over her and folded them over her breasts and she held them there with her own arms now youll be warm she said and pretty soon you were just afraid thats what made you cold you dont need to be afraid joe i didnt say anything thinking and she spoke again do you love me sure i love you youve got to joe you just got to maybe you dont want to now but its too late to change you got to love me hell i said what are you talking about i love you or i wouldnt have done it would i she didnt answer right away but i could feel her getting ready i knew almost to a word what she was going to say because we werent the same people any more if you wont stop at murder you wont stop at lying or cheating or anything else i dont know joe maybe maybe you were afraid of me of what i might do you and elizabeth maybe your business wasnt so good and you thought well carol for gods sake im not saying it was that way im dont be mad at me joe ive had to most everything ive had to do and ive got to talk i want to talk so you can tell me im wrong well youre wrong i said and i thought jesus what a break what if id told her about hap and panzer and the show being washed up and i thought ill have to get things straightened out shes just dumb enough to you mustnt try to see elizabeth joe you wont will you of course i wont why should i you mustnt youre mine now youre all ive got all right i said you wont try to see her or write to her or anything promise me joe please joe for petes sake all right i promise youll let me send the insurance money to her to the general delivery address like we agreed yes when i get it we went on talking whispering in the darkness with the lightning staggering dully through the windows and the rain scratching against the shingles and splashing into the gutter everything had gone all right she said the woman didnt have any friends or relatives theyd had separate seats on the bus she was practically the same size and coloring as elizabeth carol had told her that they were going on from wheat city by car that theyd have to wait until a friend from out in the country brought it in to them and the woman may have thought it was funny but she didnt say anything they met elizabeth on a side street and elizabeth got out and kept right on going and carol and the woman drove home and carol took her up to the garage to show her her quarters dont tell me any more i said i dont want to hear about it all right said carol im sorry i said i meant i dont want you to talk about it i know how hard it was on you there wasnt much said after that after a while carol got up and locked the door and set the alarm clock appleton the man from the insurance company was already outside the next morning when i went downstairs i walked over by the place where the garage had been and introduced myself he was a big fellow not much over thirty and he had a rather joking manner of speaking when i came up he was bending over a sort of suitcase he had on the runningboard of his coupe one that opened at the top with a lot of vials and bottles and envelopes and little racks and clips to hold them im afraid theres not much to work on i said looking around oh ivegot everything i need already he said i cleaned up the last of it yesterday evening just making a final check this morning did you find anything to help you i asked dont know yet he grinned ive got it all though up at the hotel ive signed enough receipts for your county attorney to fill a bushel basket im glad youve had cooperation i said if theres anything i can do let me know swell he said just pass the word along to the ca and the sheriff and their cohorts that the quicker im satisifed the quicker youll get your dough im not in any particular hurry to get the money i said oh hell he said were all in a hurry to get the money whats your opinion on the origin of the fire i dont know i said according to the paper rats he threw back his head and laughed ill bet that tied you in knots didnt it would rats be in a metallined room wouldnt your wife have known if there were rats and would she have put herself within a hundred yards of them ive not had any experiences with fires i said whats your idea ive got a couple one is that it was incendiary he grinned watching my face the other that it was an accident well pretty good huh all ive got to do is get rid of one of em and i can hand you a check or have you slapped in the jug and before i could say anything he laughed and clapped me on the back to show that he was joking im sorry mr wilmot he said i know how you must feel at a time like this and i dont mean to be flippant i see so much tragedy that im a little hardened to it dont pay any attention to me thats all right i said ill be frank with you joe mr wilmot joes okay im kind of puzzled joe now you didnt have any knobandtube wiring in here it was all in conduit right sure just like it is in my show what about the cord on the rewind motor it was all right so far as i know he shook his head reproachfully you mean to say youre not sure well of course im sure i said mrs wilmot would have been sure anyway shed been doing this for almost ten years if there was anything wrong with the cord shed have known it it looks like she would have joe he nodded she didnt smoke i understand no she didnt well there you are said appleton apparently there wasnt any cause for the fire and yet there was a fire you see why im puzzled joe yeah i said i see how long did you say mrs wilmot had been doing this sort of work ten years or so almost ever since we were married why did she do it dont get me wrong were not denying liability i suppose she did it because she wanted to just like that huh he laughed yes you screen your stuff before you play it dont you running it through the rewind here didnt save any time or money i wouldnt say that every once in a while shed run across a reel that was wound backward or needed splicing and but not very often not often enough to justify so much time and expense it strikes me that this setup would have been more of a nuisance than anything else well it was i couldnt deny it tell me did she do any other work connected with the show yes she did quite a bit worked on the books now and then made out the deposit slips things like that why why i said but i knew what he meant sure from what ive learned of you joe you didnt need that kind of help youre a firstrate businessman i happen to know that mrs wilmot was anything but an expert businesswoman i dont see what that has to do with the fire maybe it hasnt got anything to do with it he was still grinning but his eyes were hard for twentyfive thousand bucks i could even ask foolish questions i think i see what youre driving at i said slowly youre implying that my wife was butting in where she wasnt wanted and that i resented it well joe i nodded something seemed to nod my head and when i spoke it was as though someone were whispering the words to me the right words its probably pretty hard for you to understand i said you see mrs wilmot was quite a bit older than i was we didnt have any children i think she felt from the beginning that she wasnt pulling her weight in the partnership he cleared his throat sort of embarrassed like i went on her work didnt help me i said i heard myself saying it was a nuisance ive spent hours undoing some of the things she did and i used to get impatient and bawl her out but i guess i was always ashamed afterward she was trying to make up for things for the things she couldnt give me and felt that she should i wish she was back here now she could turn the show into a bathhouse and id never say a word anyway well thats the way it was she did butt in and i resented it but we understood each other in spite of everything thats all ive got to say appleton blew his nose i think i i understand the situation joe im sorry if i put the wrong interpretation on it youve got your job to do i said ill be frank with you we dont like the looks of these fires where everything is so completely destroyed now this farmer girl he lowered his voice she was the last person to see mrs wilmot alive how did they get along together why all right i believe i said i can tell you this much if elizabeth hadnt wanted her here she wouldnt have stayed one minute he nodded again that jibes with my information if i had the slightest idea that carol now dont let me put ideas into your head he said quickly im just groping in the dark i glanced at my watch ive got to be getting into town pretty quick i said i suppose youll be around for a while oh sure youll be seeing a lot of me before we get this thing settled i knew he meant just what he said nothing more id sold myself to him as much as i could be sold under the circumstances hed swallowed everything id said about elizabeth carol was fixing some breakfast when i went into the house i sat down at the kitchen table and waited and i think i said something about the coffee smelling good she didnt answer me or turn around pretty soon i saw her hand go up to her face i swore under my breath and got up the back door was closed and the shades were drawn i went over and stood beside her now what i said nnothing come on spit it out i guess i sounded pretty harsh but i was nervous i had things to make me nervous she whirled her eyes flashing i heard what you said to him what i said to him yes about elizabeth i couldnt figure out what she meant for a minute then i said well for gods sake what did you think i should say to him that i hated her guts and was damned glad she was gone that would have sounded good wouldnt it nno you didnt really mean it did you of course i didnt mean it she wiped her eyes and tried to smile i sat down on a chair and pulled her onto my lap look carol i said youre going to have to get over this suspiciousness and jealousy if you dont itll crop up at the wrong time and thatll be just too bad dont you see if people thought there was anything between you and me it would give you a motive for elizabeths for this womans death i know she said ill behave joe youve got to carol i said if they ever get the idea that you or i wanted elizabeth out of the way theyll do an autopsy on that on the remains theyll do one to end all autopsies they wont know what to look for so theyll look for everything and theyll find out it wasnt elizabeth but well there wasnt anything left oh yes there was the teeth were left and thats all theyd need the teeth would show that it wasnt elizabeth she didnt know about things like that she sat looking at me making sure i wasnt kidding maybe you dont suppose theyve already not a chance i said if they had we wouldnt be sitting here oh sure theyve had an inquest decided she died by reason of fire and so on but thats all theyve done and we mustnt give them any reason to do any more than that youd better clear out of here tomorrow at the latest no she threw her arms around my neck please dont make me joe but youve got to carol we planned it that way it dont look right for us to be staying here together no i dont care how we planned its different now youll be all right you can get you a little job of some kind here in town and go ahead to school in six or seven months when all this blows over we can start seeing each other and but what if something should happen that i ought to know about you wouldnt be able to let me know until until it was too late itd be too late from the start i said this isnt something we can run out on if things get hot anyway if anything went wrong youd know it as soon as i would no i wouldnt joe why the hell wouldnt you elizabeth was your wife and i was the last one to be seen with her and you were out of town when it happened theyd talk to you before they did anything well i said what of it youre not going to be at the north pole if talking to you would do any good after things had gone that far i could reach you easily enough she sat not looking at me they cant prove anything against you joe she said in a funny voice not what they can with me if if i took the blame oh i said slowly i see please joe why dont you say what you mean i said you think if i got the chance id throw everything on you is that it i shoved her to her feet and got up but before i could move away she had her arms around me she began crying again and her breasts shivered against me and i patted her and finally held her close you shouldnt feel that way carol i said weve got to trust each other i ddo joe she said i trust you and love you so much that and that wasnt the reason i wanted to stay i i just want to be near you it doesnt seem like im living when im not with you well hell i was pretty sure she meant it but even if she didnt it sounded good a woman cant make a man sore talking like that well i said well talk about it again i guess it will be all right if you stay around a few days maybe something will turn up by that time that mr chance how long is he going to be in town i dont know i said wishing to god that i did ive got a lot of stuff to catch up on he may be around helping me for quite a while if he stayed here too itd be all right for me to stay wouldnt it i didnt know how to get around that one if id had my way hap would be staying at the bottom of some good deep well well see i said i told carol i wasnt hungry yet and left the house without eating breakfast if there was ever a time in my life that i needed to keep my mind clear this was it so i got away before i could be caught up in another argument i stopped at the elite cafe and ordered ham an and while i was eating web clay came in for a cigar he saw me and came back to my booth hed already eaten but i got him to take a cup of coffee web i said after wed talked for a while what do you think about the fire about elizabeths death i dont think you need to ask me that joe he said she was an irreplaceable loss to the entire community i grieved with you i appreciate that web i said what im asking is do you think elizabeth could have been murdered and that the fire was used to cover up the crime a slow flush spread over his face he lit his cigar and dropped the match into his coffee cup you dont think my investigation of the case was sufficiently thorough now web youre a friend joe i knew i believed that you trusted me and i wanted to spare you all the pain that i could now ill tell you something something that only rufe and i have known up to now before that fire was cold before that whippersnapper appleton got here i had a man here from the state bureau of criminal investigation he went over the ground thoroughly and found nothing of an incendiary character it was his theory that the fire must have been started by rats but i know we dont see how it could have been but if it wasnt for the impossible and improbable we wouldnt have any accidents do you recall reading a few years back about the hardware clerk who was killed while unpacking a shipment of rifles the gun had never been out of the packingcase but it was loaded it couldnt have happened at the factory the chief inspector had examined it and sealed the breach with his tag it couldnt have happened at the store because it had never been out of the box but it did happen joe i remember the case i said well suppose then that the fire was an accident and ive felt like you that it must have been but the two things go together joe elizabeths death was undoubtedly caused by the fire its true that the post mortem such as it was was not very revealing the body excuse me joe was pinned beneath the remains of that metal table and other wreckage but we were able to ascertain that the fire and nothing but the fire caused her death thats all we need to know i see i said she actually died of the fire joe therefore in the absence of any incendiary materials or mechanism we know that her death was an accident yeah yes i said he spread his hands well you see joe i didnt take the case as lightly as you seemed to think i did i didnt go around with a lot of fuss and bluster now web i said i wasnt criticizing thats all right i know this man appleton has got you all stirred up we may as well talk the thing out now that weve started when i say that the fire caused elizabeths death im not overlooking the possibility that she could have been stunned and left to die in the fire you were going to ask me about that werent you well i said it did occur to me that but where is your motive joe youve got to have a motive havent you now you excuse me profited by the death but you werent there and as ive said there was no trace of a delayedmechanism device tallow or anything of that kind and there always is some trace where anything of the kind has been used could she have been the victim of robbery or assault by some person unknown we know that she couldnt there wasnt time for it the fire broke out almost as soon as she got home then theres whats her name carol farmer she was the last to see elizabeth alive and she was on the grounds but what do we find there why she and elizabeth were on the best of terms elizabeth had taken her in and given her work shed just treated her to a holiday shed driven all the way to wheat city to bring her home were friends joe but ive always put duty ahead of friendship i even considered the possibility ha ha the impossibility i should say that you were attracted to miss farmer ha ha id hate to go before a jury with a theory of that kind one look at her and theyd lock me up theyd send for a straitjacket ha ha ha i laughed right along with him i think ive already said that no one saw in carol what i saw it suited me fine if they never did he went on talking while late working himself into a good humor as we were leaving the place we ran into rufe waters appleton had been in to needle him about something or other and he was hopping mad he was threatening to punch him in the nose if he came near him again i told web and rufe solong and drove over to the show i parked in front of bowers old house feeling fairly good appleton was getting nowhere fast in a few days hed probably decide to pay off and clear out i got out of the car and started across the street then something nailed to the box office of bowers old place caught my eye and i turned around and went up on the sidewalk it was one of andy taylor signs it said for rent taylor inv ins co i was standing there staring at it not knowing whether to laugh or get sore when andy came up i guess he must have been standing a few doors down the street waiting for me whats the idea andy i said you know you cant rent this building ive got it under lease but not the right kind of lease joe he waggled his head that twentyfive a month dont hardly pay my taxes i cant help that i hows your hand what i said why its all right looks like a pretty bad burn howd you get it oh hell i said without thinking when youre working around motionpicture equipment youre liable to got it over to the show huh where else would i get it now dammit andy get that sign you could have got it up to your house out there in the garage there could have been something wrong with the machinery out there somethin that you let go without fixing an that started the fire and wouldnt that tickle you pink i said but my heart began to beat faster you didnt get that burn at the show joe the hell i didnt huhuh i saw you that night when you were hangin out around the front of the barclay and you didnt have nothing wrong with your hand but you did the next morning when i talked with you up at your house reckon you remember all right you told me then that youd cut it on a bottle well i said maybe i but what was the use lying about it with my hand unwrapped anyone could see that it was a burn still want to take the sign down joe i hesitated and shook my head to tell the truth i dont care either way if anyone wants to try to compete with the barclay in this rattrap they can hop to it ill take it down suit yourself i said ill take it down i just wanted to see how you felt about things he pulled the sign loose from its tacks and crumpled it grinning i reckon you and me had better have a good long talk joe private im busy i said ive got a lot of business to catch up with it aint as important as mine think it over joe he let out a mean cackle and shuffled off down the street and i let him go i didnt give him the horse laugh or tell him to go to hell as i should have i couldnt if youre a poker player you know what i mean youre holding say kings full in a big pot and everyone has laid down but you and one other guy a guy with a big stack and he gives your chips the onceover counting em and antes for exactly that amount well youd bet your right arm he couldnt beat your full house but theyre not taking right arms just chips and if youre wrong youre out of the game so you lay down and the other guy wins with a pair of deuces i crossed over to the show and went up to the projection booth jimmie nedry wasnt there and neither was hap and the booth was messy as hell there was even a reel of film left in the right projector iran it out rewound it and put it in the film cabinet then i went back downstairs and looked up and down the street for jimmie show business gets you that way no matter what else you got on your mind you cant forget the show jimmie lived in a little dump over across the tracks and he didnt have a telephone i was wondering whether i should drive over and see what was up when he and blair came around the corner in blairs car blair pulled in a little toward the curb and i went out to them my deepest sympathy joe he said i hope you received our floral offering yes i did i said thanks very much blair i was planning on bringing jimmie and his wife to the obsequies but they didnt feel that they should attend why why didnt you jimmie i said the show was closed you didnt need an invitation we didnt because we didnt have any decent clothes to wear thats why jimmie snarled well i said i know you wanted to anyway its the spirit that counts in these things blair threw back his head and laughed good old joe he said always right in there pitching arent you somebodys got to i said are you coming in pretty soon jimmie its only about an hour until show time he shook his head without looking at me im takin a couple weeks off huh i said thats right joe blair leaned around him grinning mr chance is giving jimmie a vacation at full pay dont tell me you didnt know about it i didnt but its all right mr chance a partner of yours now whatever he does is all right i said hes been kind enough to take care of things for me hell probably have to stay on for a while longer well blair stroked his chin technically he doesnt have the owners right to operate the projectors but well play along with you under the circumstances thanks i said dont mention it joe you dont owe me a thing he laughed again and jimmie kind of smirked and they drove off i headed for haps hotel boiling he was in his room dressing when i went up he had on his pants and shoes and he came to the door taking the pins out of one of those fancy twentydollar shirts goddam you hap i said whats the idea of giving jimmie two weeks off what do you think youve got on me anyway i suppose you think im going to pay him entirely unnecessary old man i paid him myself out of the receipts i asked you what the idea was just a sec he said ill open the windows they can hear us in the next block then as well as this one i sat down and lowered my voice all right spill it why its quite simple laddie i intend to stay around for a time and staying requires some justification ergo young james gets a rest a rest which even from my conservative viewpoint seems long overdue generous arent you i said oh now but why shouldnt i be with your money he raised his eyebrows as a matter of fact however im quite taken with jamie boy hes the sort ive often found it profitable to cultivate you know the humble downtrodden worm with big ears if you intend to pump him about me i said you wont get much probably not probably not he said you always were frightfully clever and it isnt really necessary is it still what do you want hap ah now thats being sensible he sat down on the edge of the bed and poked an arm into his shirt shall we say about five thousand dollars what for why should i give you five grand well to put it euphemistically well say its for the replacement of sixteen reels of priceless film priceless that crap or we can say its to keep me from doing my unpleasant duty unpleasant that is from the standpoint of losing five thousand aside from that i really dont care whether you swing or not he lit a cigarette and held the match watching a fly crawl across the scarf of the readingtable suddenly his hand went out and he stabbed it through with a pin he held it into the flame turning it while it sputtered and frizzled he dropped it onto the floor and smeared it with his foot dashed funny thing fire isnt it hap i said hap suppose i had known that sol panzer was moving in on me that i was broke if i was trying to if i was taking a quick way out id have fired the show i carry sixty thousand straight on it plus onefifty a week operation loss uh hah he nodded exactly the thought that occurred to me until id inspected your house a splendid piece of construction laddie utterly fireproof but but i didnt but me not buts old man simply earmark five of the twentyfive thousand now due you as indemnity for your late spouse for yours truly and please hurry it along im purchasing a new car i cant theres no way i can hurry it i said no i suppose not well it shouldnt be long at any rate yeah but he looked at me sharply you havent bungled things have you no i didnt mean that everythings jake if i thought you were going to be turned up anyway he paused frowning you know i have a very large conscience im not at all sure that five thousand will be sufficient to salve it yeah i said i know id been bluffed again if id told him to go to hell in the beginning but i couldnt tell him not any more than i could have told andy taylor to take his sign down now as long as i had anything to get theyd never let up on me and if either one of them got the idea that i might get the murder pinned on me theyd step right in and give me a shove a person would be nuts to hold back evidence in a murder case unless he stood to clean up by it theres such a thing as being an accessory besides the insurance company would probably come through pretty heavy for information that would save twentyfive grand hap finished dressing and we went downstairs together i told him that i was running into the city oh he said you wouldnt be taking a powder on me would you do i look stupid i said why should i no he said i suppose you wouldnt you want to check on my news about panzer is that it i want to see if i can do something about it such as i dont know i said but ive got to make an effort ive got a hundredthousanddollar property here i cant just sit back and let it slide without lifting a hand he stood studying me a moment then nodded and opened the door of the car he even took me by the elbow and made as if to help me in well the best of luck to you laddie and godspeed and all that rot so long i said i have tremendous faith in you old man as well as a certain mercenary interest you know i drove off without answering i knew all right hed want a good heavy cut on anything i was able to pull the more i had the more he and andy would demand i eased up on the gas just outside of town and started looking for a crossroads to turn around on there wasnt a damned bit of use driving into the city there wasnt any way i could stop panzer and even if there was what would it get me it would all go for blackmail as i say i almost stopped and turned around and then i stepped on the gas and went on toward the city but fast carol well sure she wasnt to be overlooked and i hadnt but as long as i could keep her from knowing i was skinned clean until afterward it would be all right as long as she was sure i wasnt going to run out on her she really wouldnt give a whoop about the money believe it or not it was elizabeth who had slipped my mind with hap and andy both tackling me in the space of an hour elizabeth had slipped into the background and anyway it wouldnt have made much difference if she hadnt elizabeth was supposed to be deadicouldnt tell hap or andy that the twentyfive grand had to go to her it would have to though what was it shed said there will be exceedingly unpleasant consequences if your memory should fail you shed have to get it all right up to the last penny keeping hap and andy quiet wouldnt mean a thing otherwise i had to go on i had to keep the barclay valuable so that id have something to trade for haps and andys silence with the best luck in the world i couldnt wind up with anything with a little bad luck just a little well it wasnt right it was crazy all this trouble over a woman i didnt know hadnt ever even seen a woman who when you got right down to cases didnt amount to a damn i woke up the next morning about six oclock and just lay in bed not knowing what to do until after nine in the back of my mind i guess i was trying to kid myself that hap had been stringing me about panzer or that maybe hed had the wrong dope and i hated to get up and find out the truth finally a little after nine i got up caught some breakfast and a barbershop shave and headed for the row i hadnt brought any toilet articles with me id been afraid to bring any luggage on account of carol i was wondering now what kind of story id hand her when i got back everyone on the row had heard about the fire and i wasted about an hour shaking hands and receiving sympathy before i could get to the utopian exchange of course there was more of the same stuff there but the manager saw it was bothering me and he cut it short by taking me back into his office maybe i told you he was an old friend of mine id known him since the days when he was peddling film and i was hauling it we had a couple of drinks and talked a little after a few minutes he took out his watch and glanced at it well joe he said what brings you into town whats on your mind not much of anything al i said i just wanted to get away from things for a day or two i see i understand he shuffled some papers on his desk well im glad you dropped in i was just wondering i said if you had anything on next seasons product yet of course i know youve always got a good lineup but if you had anything unusual id kind of like to know ive been figuring on enlarging the house a little he sat there smiling and nodding i believe i have got a few press sheets joe yeah heres something take at look at those something huh im not going to run down our competitors but you can see for yourself that that his eyes met mine and the sheets slid out of his hand he cleared his throat and looked away youve got a nice house joe it always struck me as being just about the right size thanks i said id known it was coming but it didnt make it any easier to take i knew it was kid stuff foolish to argue but i couldnt help myself it always seemed to me al i said that i was a white man to deal with i dont give nothing away but i dont ask for noth anything if im not profitable to deal with thats a different matter but it always seemed to me like i was oh hell joe he said im in the business so ive got to talk price but i dont think youve actually skinned us six times in ten years i wouldnt say that to everyone but ill say it to you youre a hundredpercenter in my books well thats the way i feel i said youve maybe skinned me a few times on superspecials and youve got a damned bad habit of accidentally shipping me stuff i dont want on the same invoice with stuff that i do so that i have to take all or nothing but when i look back upon our whole friendship its been pretty pleasant its something i hate to see broken up i mean if it was going to be broken up im glad you said that joe i like to keep things on a friendly basis after all what are we arguing about its just a hypothetical case sure i said oh sure but take even a hypothetical case al its kind of hard for me to understand i mean i think iget it but im not sure the town isnt going to get a whole lot bigger if any and film rentals are based on population a can of film is a can of film if you push it too far back on the shelf it begins to stink twentyfive per cent more and i could reach it fifty and im still not crazy theyll let me go around if i wear a muzzle but higher than that well they call in the health department theyve called it in before joe you know what i mean i said its hard to understand all right he said personally i dont try to i just sit back and take orders by the way have you seen light o dawn yet we booked it into the panzpalace here in town last week i played it i said dont you remember how you jacked me from twentyfive to thirty bucks for it he didnt seem to hear me we booked it into panzpalace at fifty per cent of the gross it pulled seventeen grand the first five days i got up and held out my hand well goodby i said ive got to go buy a bottle of liniment goddamit joe he said i like you if theres ever anything i can do for you personally that is you know where to come i dont think theres anything you can do al well he let me get to the door come back a minute joe i went back and sat down joe i feel like a heel about this what for i said its just a hypothetical case oh can that crap the cats out of the bag i feel terrible about it joe its a hell of a note to hit a man with a thing like this right after hes lost his wife i wont argue with you there i said it looks like if sol had to build another house he could have picked some spot besides stoneville no he couldnt joe al shook his head youve got the best show town in the state youve got a draw there of a town three times its size its the only place where he could possibly justify the building of another panzpalace its going to be one then one of his regular articles it has to be joe youve got a pretty nice house there yourself sol couldnt build enough house for three or four hundred grand even a half million to freeze you out i dont know that i get you i said sure you do you mentioned it yourself a few minutes ago if you had to you could pay three or four times as much for product as you are now and keep running but you couldnt pay six or seven times as much neither could sol with less than a millionbuck house i mean he couldnt justify rentals like that i see i said but actually he wont pay you any more than i do if he pays that much hell shave you down somewhere else in the chain al shrugged i showed you the answer to that joe panzpalace controls every important house in the state the big city houses that play product on percentage instead of at a flat rate as long as he doesnt ask us to do anything outandout illegal weve got to play with him ill make you a little bet i said ill bet inside of tenfifteen years panzer has shaved you enough you and the other exchanges to pay for that house maybe i just work here youre cutting your own throats al better worry about yourself joe what are your plans i i havent thought too far ahead i said why dont you go and see sol maybe you could work out something i happen to know he likes you yeah i said he must he does joe al leaned forward look those big boys dont look on things like you and i do the way sol sees it it dont make no difference if theres a barclay in stoneville or not relatively you know its unimportant but if he dont put in this panzpalace and like i say hes got to put it in stoneville he sees himself as losing several million dollars i let that sink in and if thered been a laugh left in me it would have come out i see i said its easy for a man to figure that way you lose track of the fact that something that doesnt mean a thing to you may mean a hell of a lot to the guy that has it thats it exactly but how does he figure several million dollars well sol has a reputation as a moneymaker doesnt he when he puts up a new house the public looks on it as another mint theyre not far wrong at that i said i see panzpalace stock will take a jump it will but dont get any ideas joe this is sols surprise and only he knows exactly when hes going to pull it hell drive the stock down first if you got in anywhere besides the basement youd lose your shirt not bad i said but thats only part of the picture joe al held up a finger a panzpalace house will use around ten thousand dollars worth of paper and display matter a year if you and i bought it itd mean a flat outlay of ten grand but sol uses the same paper over and over and he owns his own paper company its not a big outfit has a capitalization of about a quarter of a million but but that was all to the good dumping ten thousand bucks profit into a company that size meant a fourpercent increase in dividends then theres his filmexpress company itll take a jump in profits with practically no increase in overhead and his equipment companies joe you know what showhouse equipment is highprofit slowmoving stuff a big order suddenly dumped in on those companies my head began to swim id thought i was halfway smart but beside panzer i wasnt anything hed mop up in a dozen different ways and the mopping up would be legitimate his companies would be worth more hed have an actual operating loss in stoneville but it wouldnt ever show and the house wouldnt cost him anything in the long run he could show that he was increasing panzpalace assets by a million bucks that would stop any squawks of course someone was going to lose the money had to come from somewhere suckers would be shaken out the film companies would have to pinch a little and thered be wage cuts and layoffs the but what the hell of it sol would mop up and hed be in the clear thats business al leaned back in his chair by the way joe who tipped you off no one i said i just had a premonition i read the papers joe hap chance seems to be your bosom friend all of a sudden well all igot to say is i wouldnt want to be in his shoes this is one time hes got out beyond his depth i suppose he thought this was just a little petty chiseling that he should be taken in on i didnt answer him i didnt want to talk about hap if he was washed up on the row and sol could wash him up if he wanted to take the trouble hed bear down that much harder on me whens sol moving in al only sol knows that wheres he going to build well he hesitated maybe ive been talking too much but you can figure it out for yourself where would you build if you were in his place thats simple i said you couldnt pick a better show lot than the one ive got and people are accustomed to going in that direction but but i choked up i could feel my face turning purple al looked down at his desk nervously now joe you couldnt expect him to talk it over with you goddamit i said ill make him wish he had maybe i wont sell maybe i got some ideas on making money myself maybe you wont have any income joe how long do you think you can play holdout a hell of a lot longer than sol thinks i dont give a goddam if i starve ill ill i choked up again i wouldnt get a chance to starve i wouldnt even have time to get real hungry before hap or andy or elizabeth or you see joe it wouldnt be smart would it no i said it wouldnt be smart i got up and walked out ive probably given you the idea that elizabeth didnt have much tact or at least that she didnt go out of her way to use it and thats true and it was the cause of a lot of our trouble but now that i think about it it seems like the thing that caused the most hell was that i never knew quite how she was going to react to a given situation i dont mean that id want any woman to be all cut and dried in her actions or that i ever expected anyone to use me as a pattern but i do say youve got to have some well some standard of conduct or you dont have anything at all youve got to know whether what youre going to do will make a person happy or sore youve got to know whether a person is actually happy when they he she looks like and says she is or at least youvegot to know that she isnt and if that sounds mixed up i am and i was right from the day we were married we closed the show up for two weeks for our honeymoon since it wasnt making a damned thing anyway and seeing that it was summer we went to a resort up in the eastern part of the state it was just a small place but nothing cheap by a long shot and everyone had you sized up the minute you walked in everyone knew that elizabeth and i were just married and everyone was doing a little underthebreath kidding about it and i thought that elizabeth was taking it perfectly all right as why the hell shouldnt she have but when the waiter brought our dinner up that night she suddenly blew the lid off of things one minute he was chuckling and just being pleasant as waiters will and the next minute he was out the door so fast his jacket tails were flying i dont exactly remember what it was elizabeth said to him but i knew it was the wrong thing and before i knew what was happening she was telephoning the manager and reporting this boy for insulting us for christs sake i said when i finally got my breath what did you do that for elizabeth im sorry joe she said i should have let you do it do what why should i have done anything oh her mouth tightened then relaxed i know youve been thinking about business matters dear but if youd noticed i tell you what i have noticed i said ive noticed you standing right out in the middle of stoneville gabbing and laughing with some washwoman and her raggedassed pickaninnies until dont use words like that joe all right then they were just ragged but well how can you argue with a person like that someone thats absolutely determined to miss the entire point of a conversation i said well hell lets forget it and go to bed and we went and there wasnt any more argument the rest of that night but i still felt bad about getting this boy in trouble and maybe letting ourselves in for a lot of rotten service and like she always knew elizabeth knew that i was bothered when we went down to breakfast the next morning the waiter captain gave us a funny look and led us over to a table in the middle of the diningroom and then he snapped his fingers and this same boy wed had the night before came running over george wants to apologize for his conduct the captain said im sure youll have no more trouble with him sure why not i said just give us a menu and skip it well get along all right i almost jerked the menus out of the waiters hands and shoved one at elizabeth and i got behind the other one fast but it wasnt any go elizabeth wasnt ready to drop it until i looked like a complete damned fool why sure everythings okay she said letting out with a big laugh george and i are pals arent we george and right in front of everyone she reached out and grabbed his hand and shook it we ate breakfast i guess we got out of there and went for a long fast walk elizabeth didnt say anything and neither did i it wasnt until noon after wed eaten at a little hamburger joint in the town that we got to speaking to each other again and then it wasnt so good i did all i could god knows i admitted shed played me for a chump and tried to laugh it off but right in the middle of my trying to make a joke of it she busted out bawling and then she ran back to the hotel by herself i guess this waiter george must have been a pretty good boy because i had to pay the captain fifty bucks to fire him that made things a little more comfortable and after a day or two a night or two i should say elizabeth and i were beginning to feel that marriage wasnt such a bad deal after all we were a little edgy with each other but generally id say that that feeling lasted on through our honeymoon and for several months afterward it wasnt until i put bower out of business that we had another real blowup but you just couldnt have done it joe she said the bowers are one of the oldest families in town and theyve always been good friends of ours you cant deliberately ruin people like that im not ruining them i said if bower wants to start another show its all right with me you know he cant start another one well thats his fault then i said ive got to protect our investment its up to him to look after his what could be fairer than that she sat and stared at me for a longtime and i began to get nervous there wasnt any reason why i should have but i couldnt help myself well whats wrong i said what do you think joe i dont think anything i said all i know is that i work my can off trying to put us on a good spot and you cant do anything but find fault with me whose side are you on anyhow mine or bowers do i have to take sides against people whove never done me any harm look i said this is business elizabeth you just cant never mind joe i think i understand the smile she gave me wouldnt have fooled me later on but it did at the time and when she said of course she was on my side where else would a wife be i was completely taken in i went ahead and told her about the other things i had planned how i could get the work done on a new house for nothing how i could get the marquee and other stuff for next to nothing how i could use them to get credit to pay the bills that couldnt be ducked how we could run the house union at less expense than it cost to scab i must have shot off my mouth for an hour and then since everything seemed to be going so well and we hadnt been married very long we went up to the bedroom and that it was the craziest goddam thing that ever happened to me action sure as much as youd get on a roller coaster affection the only twentydollar girl i ever had gave me a lot less heat like a furnace it was lovely and wonderful and so goddam phony i felt myself gagging right into her mouth i jumped up and began jerking on my clothes all right i yelled have it your way ill let everything slide and you can have your goddam rattrap back as it stands and ill clear out but i dont want you to clear out joe she got up and stood in front of me i happen to love you damned if you dont i said just leave me alone i wont bother you again and i want you to bother me too perhaps im a little disappointed in in things but youre disappointed i said what the hell do you think i am she didnt answer that one and i went ahead flinging on my clothes trying not to look at her i finished dressing and started for the door and she got in front of me well i said is this better joe she said then craack she slapped me do you like that better and before i could come to my senses before i could get over someone who was supposed to be a lady acting like a fourbit floozy shed shoved me out the door and locked it well i built the show i did the other things ive told you about and every once in a while during those first few years i thought we were going to be able to straighten things out and get along like married people should i thought so the strongest when she got pregnant but then she miscarried and it was worse than ever it was like i mentioned a while back i never knew what she was going to do i was never sure whether her actions and words meant one thing or whether they meant another about all i could ever be sure of was that she hated my guts and that she hated them most right when she claimed to be loving me the loudest the funny part about it all was that with all her hightoned sneering she wasnt too good to profit by the corners i cut she insisted on keeping the show in her name and she made almost as big a job of running it as i did not that anything she ever did was a damned bit of help but she kept her hand in and held in there right on up to the end no i dont think she was ever afraid of my skipping out if i wasnt tied down and i dont think the main idea was to humiliate me although that may have been part of it i think no i dont either if i really thought that then nothing would make sense i dont think i mentioned that she fired carol that afternoon she caught her in my room well she did and i let her it didnt look like i had much grounds for argument and i figured id see carol later and slip her some money and fix it up carol packed up her things or started to before she could finish elizabeth called her down to the livingroom im partly to blame for this she said to us perhaps by bringing carol into this house im entirely to blame at any rate im ready to assume some of the responsibility for it carol exactly what are your feelings toward mr wilmot none of your business said carol and yours toward carol joe theres no use in me saying anything i said youve already got your mind made up i see well in preference to having this affair carried on around the countryside i think carol had best stay here go and unpack your things carol carol looked at me and i nodded after shed left the room elizabeth stood up im going to give you a little time to decide exactly what you want to do joe and when you do reach a decision i expect you to stick by it do you understand maybe ive already decided i said and lets say im about as sick of you as you are of me all right she said now the little matter remains of what to do about it from where i sit now id say she thought she had me that she knew there wasnt anything i could do and that id have to backwater on the deal looking back id say that she wasnt really thinking about the insurance when she agreed to settle for twentyfive grand it was just her way of saying that she wouldnt trade at all i dont mean that she wanted me herself because everything that shed ever done or said pointed to the fact that she didnt but she wasnt going to let carol have me either not carol she didnt hate carol exactly she didnt think enough of her even to do that it was carol who did the hating and she did a good job of it but but thats beside the point the insurance did get mentioned and there was just one way we could cash in on it and when i laid the plan out little by little elizabeth went for it it surprised me but she did she even took full charge of the plans pushing them along faster than i would have myself carol thought it was all a gag that elizabeth was just trying to land her and me in trouble but i didnt and dont think so elizabeth didnt need to pretend anything she was in the saddle and there was no way she could have made trouble for us without involving herself why did she try to burn herself up there toward the last the answer to that is she didnt it just looked that way she knew every trick to that rewind motor she knew just how much she could play around with that shortcircuited cord without being in danger i didnt move as fast as she thought i would and consequently she almost had herself a funeral party but anyway it was a good trick and it almost worked if it hadnt been for carol for what had happened between us and yes i guess carol had been doing a little thinking too which was why things turned out as they did carol could so some pretty straight thinking even if she didnt always come up with the straight answers word for word i can still remember what she said that first night we talked about the murder why do you want to do it she said staring hard at elizabeth thats the part i dont get elizabeth shrugged it seems that some move is indicated by joe and me maybe you dont need to stick your neck out well shall we say im trying to be cooperative dont make me laugh i wish i could elizabeth said almost anything would be an improvement over your normal expression however i need a minimum of twentyfive thousand dollars to leave and youve got a lot more than twentyfive thousand without leaving elizabeth sighed and shrugged as much as to say carol was making a damned fool of herself theres not much more for me to say is there think whatever you like i am said carol real slow and i i dont understand i felt sick driving home from the city after leaving al kind of like i was catching the flu the outside of my body was warm enough maybe a little too warm but inside i was cold shivering but sick or just scared sick however you want to put it i couldnt help but admire the way sol panzer had laid his plans they added up to a knot behind my ear but i still had to admire them by god they were perfect or do you get it a stunt like sol was pulling takes a lot of preparation and a lot of dough he had to have his stocks rigged for the jump he had to be able to show that he wasnt bluffing just an announcement to the newspapers of what he intended doing wouldnt be enough the papers wouldnt go for it and neither would the suckers the architects plans would have to be drawn and the construction contracts signed and money earmarked for the building and of course the film exchanges would have to be lined up up to that point there was almost no chance of a leak of someones taking the edge off his surprise sol was dealing with people he controlled he could make it worth their while to stay mum and make em wish theyd never been born if they didnt the outsiders might think he was up to something but they wouldnt know what it was their one chance of finding out would be when he bought a location so so he hadnt bought any he hadnt risked having an option or a lease or a sale traced back to him he didnt need to i had the location he wanted and when he got ready hed step in and take it off my hands id have about ten minutes to make up my mind i could take a few grand and get out or take nothing or next to it later on i might cause him a little trouble but it wouldnt make me anything id take what he offered whatever it was id have to if i was still around i got into stoneville a little after dark and drove around the square a few times trying to make up my mind what to do i was afraid to go home i didnt know what i was going to say to carol i was afraid to go to the show i didnt know what i could say to hap finally i parked across from the house in front of bowers old place to give myself a little time to think and i hadnt much more than shut my motor off before andy taylor was there poking his head in the window been looking for you joe he said figured it was about time you an me had a little talk what about i said i reckon you know what do you think youve got on me andy i dont know joe i aint got the slightest idea but i know i got somethin all right i said ill see you in a day or two im sick and worn out right now i think im coming down with the flu dont wait too long joe he cackled i might talk to someone else he showed signs of needling me some more so i mumbled something about business and walked across the street to the show mrs artie fletcher was in the box office filing and buffing her fingernails and looking like shed stab anyone that bothered her you know efficient and attractive like a cashier ought to look harry clinkscales my haifwitted doorman was doing his best too to run people off he kept tossing grains of popcorn into the air and catching them in his mouth stumbling around the lobby with his head thrown back and his mouth open about a foot i wished to god a light bug would drop down it when he saw me he stopped and wiped his greasy hands on his uniform my uniform thats a good act harry i said whatll you take to put it on inside he grinned like an ape there was a guy here to see you a little while ago mr wilmot a gentleman harry yessir what was his name dunno he didnt tell me well that was pretty dumb of him wasnt it i said what did he say when you asked him harry got kind of red in the face i think i know who he was mr wilmot i think it was that guy that gentleman from the insurance company oh i said he said hed stop back later on in the evening good i said and i went on in and up to the projection booth hap had just put on a new reel and was leaning back against the rewind table watching the picture through the port the booth speaker was roaring the sound was too loud it gets that way early in the evening when there arent enough people in the house to provide the right kind of acoustics hap turned down the control a little and wiped the sweat from his face and arms with a dirty towel this is a veritable blast furnace laddie why is it you didnt aircondition the booth when you did the rest of the house why should i i said i dont sell any seats up here uh hah he said narrowing his eyes at me right to the mark as usual eh well what luck in the city nothing i said none i didnt get to see panzer ah you had your eyes closed no he was out of town he took a step toward me and i moved out of the way he pulled a reel out of the film cabinet slipped it into the offprojector and flipped the switch on the arc youre a bloody liar old man youre a blasted stinking filthy liar for christs sake hap i said give me a little time this thing hit me out of a clear sky what the hell anyway ive got the insurance money coming have you now i wonder i will if you if maybe it wont be left to me how do you mean your nowvacationing projectionist and i have been having some nice long talks got quite pally young nedry and i have if you dont stop trying to pump him i said he will suspect something leave him alone hap he doesnt know anything i wish i were confident of that hes dropped several sinister hints hes intimated that he isnt going to be around very long that hes got certain information which transmitted to blair whos been after your scalp a long time i understand will get him a transfer to one of the city houses i laughed id been wondering why jimmie and blair were running around together blairs letting his wishbone get in the way of his brain i said and jimmie is just hungry enough to string him along hell be right here as long as i want him oh are you i dont blame jimmie for trying those city locals only have their charters open about an hour out of the year and only the insiders know when that is if some floater does get the word all they have to do is give him an examination no one could pass or put the initiation fee out of his reach i know all that laddie well blair isnt going to go to all the expense and trouble of fixing things up unless jimmie gives him some real dirt and jimmie cant because he doesnt have any hes demanding the transfer before he talks i dont know it looks like jimmie would have to know something suppose blair gives him the transfer whats his story going to be he wont need any he can tell blair togo laugh up a rope hed be in then and out of blairs jurisdiction well i hope youre right laddie i sincerely hope so for my sake im right i said by the way dont you want me to give you a relief oh no nedryll be along in a few minutes he gives me a relief twice a day oh i said well thats pretty nice of him isnt it though well good night i said cheerio and remember on your toes im not waiting around here forever he started the offprojector slid the port on the other one and began unthreading the runreel of film i took a good long look at the back of his head and went downstairs again it wasnt much different from three thousand other nights people strolling by walking up to the box office or stopping to look at the lobby cards asking how i was and being asked how they were now and then a car would pass by slow and thered be a light tap on the horn and id turn around and wave and be waved at a couple of bobby soxers stood up near the popcorn machine giggling and talking to harry and watching me out of the corner of their eyes overhead up above the marquee the thirtyfoot sign went on and off spelled and flashed painting the street and the cars green and red without looking without even noticing i knew when it went barclay then barclay then barclay i remembered all the arguments elizabeth and i had had about that sign how id hated it at first yeah how id hated her not because i wanted my own name up there but because she didnt because she wasnt as proud of wilmot as she was of barclay and what did it matter what did it really matter anyway everyone knew whod built the house people always know those things and elizabeth was the last of the barclays and it was the oldest family in the county when people havent got anything but a name you cant blame them for leaning on it and maybe just maybe that wasnt her reason maybe it was her way as shed put it of being responsible of backing me up before the whole damned world oh hell id got hot up in the booth and now i was beginning to chill i passed a word or two with mrs fletcher and crossed the street to my car i got in and rolled up the windows and lighted a cigarette i let my head lie back against the seat and tried to rest maybe i dozed a little but i dont think so i think i was just so wrapped up in worrying about carol and elizabeth and hap chance and andy and sol panzer and wondering what i was going to do that i was deaf and blind to everyone else i dont know how long appleton stood outside the car looking in at me but finally i rolled my head and there he was i kind of jumped and then i opened the door and let him in gloating over the scene of your victory he said i didnt get what he meant the show here he said i understand you put your competitor out of business oh yeah i said no i was just sitting here figuring on whether i wanted to eat a bite before i went home by the way i went to your show yesterday i meant to give you some passes i said i dont think i have any with me but forget it joe it all goes on the expense account but i wanted to ask you about those loges do you think theyre safe i pay extra coverage for them i said well he laughed that makes everything all right then as long as youre covered i knew id made a dumb remark and that he was digging me but i didnt particularly give a damn my nerves were on edge i was too sick and worried to think i took a look at your exits too joe you know our state fire laws require two rear exits in a picture show ive got two i said youve got a double door closing on the same jamb its good enough for the fire commissioner oh well if its good enough for him who are we to quibble he laughed again and nudged me and i wanted to sock him a guy cant be on his toes all the time how are you getting along with your investigation i said about wound up well hardly he said those things take a lot of time you know i guess i dont know i said the thing seems simple enough to me the legal authorities are satisfied ive been paying in premiums for ten years and youve had plenty of time to find out if there was anything wrong it looks to me like im entitled to a settlement or a damned good explanation he didnt get a bit sore at least he didnt show it well thats the way it looks to you he said now ill tell you how it looks to us we dont have anything more to gain from you you wont be carrying insurance on your wife naturally and the chances are that youll drop your own we dont want to pay you we wont if we can get out of it thanks i said im glad to know what kind of an outfit im dealing with dont quote me joe dont mind my calling you joe do you id hate to have to call you a liar you may have a chance i said i dont want anything im not entitled to but oh sure you do we all do thats like saying you dont want anything more out of a thing than what you put into it wheres the percentage in a deal like that but you were threatening to sue us no i wasnt threatening i said i wouldnt want to sue unless and i dont think you will joe youre too smart there isnt a court in the land that wouldnt allow us from three months toa year to make our investigation the chances are ill have my report ready long before that we havent refused to pay the claim we wont unless we have reason to i began to get hold of myself skip it i said theres no hurry i guess i was just sore because you knocked the house i know those loges and exits arent right but i cant do everything at once i havent had a lot to work with sure thats all right joe but im kind of curious would you mind telling me something my life story if you want it maybe im stepping out of line and if i am just say so but well just what is there to investigate i mean it all looks pretty much cut and dried to me the fire wiped out everything and not everything joe well you know what i mean but you dont know what i mean the most important clue to any disaster is the man who profits by it dont take that the wrong way im not implying anything how do you work on a clue like me well i dont slip around dropping sly hints and giving people the wink nothing so crude as that joe its more a matter of moving around observing and listening gathering impressions figuring out whether youre the kind of guy that would i suppose you try to put yourself in the the other fellows place too no no i dont joe rolling down the window he threw out the butt of his cigarette and lighted another one in the first place that requires a preconceived notion of what the other fellow is im making up my mind about him before i ever go to work on him what kind of an investigation is that ive never thought about it that way i said you hear the expression used so often putting yourself in the other fellows place its bad business all the way around joe if you put yourself in the other mans place often enough youre very likely to get stuck there some of your worst criminals began their careers as officers of the law theres probably a higher incidence of insanity among psychiatrists than any other group i remember a case i worked on several years ago he paused and gave me a glance as much as to ask if he was boring me i told him to go on he was an easy guy to listen to and i didnt want to go home it was a murder joe just about the messiest job ive ever seen a woman was literally clawed clawed and chewed to death obviously the murderer was a degenerate or a lunatic we needed an expert on morbid psychology to get to the bottom of the crime one of the best men in the country lived right there in the neighborhood so with the permission of the authorities we called him in well the police threw out the wellknown dragnet pulled in all the twistbrains they could lay hands on and this guy went to work and joe by god it was enough to make your flesh crawl to watch him hed sit there in a cell with some bird that you and i wouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole the sort of bird that does things a lot of newspapers wont print and hed pal right up to him hed talk to him like a long lost brother hed find out what special sort of craziness this guy went in for and for the time being hed be the same way if you closed your eyes and listened you wouldnt know which one was doing the talking and yet he was one of the most likable guys ive ever known he talked my language too we seemed to click we got to where we saw quite a bit of each other outside the line of business hed drop in on me a night or two a week or id run in on him wed have a few drinks and a bite to eat and bat the breeze around and gradually without knowing i was doing it i began to get his guard down he started tipping his hand appleton shook his head started fumbling for another cigarette i gave him one and held a match for gods sake i said lets hear the rest of it he had a big german shepherd joe a big brute that was a hell of a lot more wolf than it was dog and i began to notice he and that dog were a lot alike sometimes hed snap at a sandwich or a piece of food just like the dog sometimes thered be a trace of growl in his voice or hed scratch the back of his head with that stiff rapid stroke a dog uses sometimes they even looked alike the payoff came one night when he started to play with the dog it started off as a romp but before it was over they were down on the floor together snapping and slashing and clawing yeah and barking both of em and when i got the cops in they turned on us the two dogs wolves i dont need to tell you who our murderer was i shivered he gave a short laugh not nice huh joe i think im coming down with a cold i said ive been having chills all evening well ill shove off and let you go how about dinner some night this week sure i said but dont rush off tell me some more about this guy what about him well why did he choose to be a dog it doesnt seem to make sense i can understand how a guy who worked with crooks all the time might turn out to be a crook but he was a man of innate and extraordinarily fine sensibilities joe and a man has to identify himself with something he has to be able to picture himself as being some certain thing if he cant hes helpless theres no motivation no guide for his acting and thinking yeah i said thats right isnt it this man couldnt identify himself with the human race he appeared to be able to do it with extreme ease but actually he was losing a little of his character and personality with every contact in the end there wasnt anything left nothing but the idea that humanity was pretty rotten so i see i said i shivered again and he reached for the door you ought to be in bed joe ive got to be going anyway ive got another case to handle going to be on the jump for the next few days wheres the fire this time he shook his head its not in my line but as long as im here im taking a crack at it its a disappearance case some dame is supposed to have come out here from the city a few days ago and she hasnt been heard of since the hell i said what do you know about that and he gave me a funny look you dont need to be polite joe im not interested in it either we get a hundred like it every year but but where could she disappear to in a town this size she couldnt ill turn her up in a few days shes a houseworker came out here to take a job that narrows it down a lot there arent many people here who hire household help no i said uh how did you know she disappeared anyway who reported it her former landlady she didnt have any relatives it seems and she owed this landlady a hell of a big bill so as a gesture of good faith she switched a little paidup policy she had actually it would just about take care of her burial expenses when she died to her landlady that is she named her as beneficiary until such time as she could clear up her debt well she left the city in a hurry and was supposed to send for her baggage and she hasnt done it naturally the landlady is sure she hopes that something has happened to herand she comes down on us yyyoure pretty sure yyou can fffind how can i help it say you have got a chill havent you my teeth were clattering too hard to answer i nodded and he said good night and got out up on the curb he hollered at me not to forget our dinner date and i nodded again i backed the car out into the street made a uturn and headed for home as i started to angle around the square i glanced into the rearview mirror he was still standing where i had left him up on the curb with his hat thrust back and his hands on his hips watching me i must have been off my nut by the time i got home i had to be to do what i did i ran up the steps almost before the car had stopped rolling i pushed the door open half fell inside and stood leaning against it elizabeth i panted elizabeth and of course it wasnt elizabeth but even when i realized that i couldnt come to my senses it only made me worse i started to say that i was sorry that elizabeths name had just slipped out but i felt so ugly and scared i guess that it acted on her and when it did she wasnt something i cared about hurting she got me in the same way elizabeth had used to it was all i could do to keep from slugging her you you muddleheaded bitch goddam damn you didnt know where she was going huh everything was all right huh now they got us they got us they got us they i dont know what i said the words were coming so fast and so mixed up but somehow carol got the sense of it she didnt joe she didnt know i swear that she didnt huh how she was too anxious for the job to ask questions and i slid over it i told her i was hiring her for a friend i told her id give her the exact address after we got here i slid over it that way she didnt know a thing until we got on the bus she called from somewhere or maybe she wrote her landlady i tell you she didnt joe she did not i was with her every minute but appleton dont you see joe its someone else its another woman it must be oh i said oh my knees were about to give way under me i wobbled over to the lounge and sat down youre sure about everything carol elizabeth got away all right yes and the woman no one saw you heard you when no said carol we were all alone we she knew what was coming right at the last but there wasnt anything she could do no one would hear her i was stronger than she was she didnt even try to fight she carol i said for gods sake you dont need to draw me a picture i was just trying to tell you joe everythings all right theres nothing to be afraid of the funny intent look went out of her eyes she turned them in toward the bridge of her nose and pursed out her lower lip and then she blew upward at the little wisp of hair that had fallen over her forehead that got me just like it always had all at once we were right back where wed been that sunday afternoon when shed come into my room in her madeover clothes and id felt so damned sorry for her i didnt know whether to laugh or cry come here carol i said and she came there over to the lounge i gave her a grin and squeezed her hand and after a minute she slid close to me im sorry i said that appleton guy got me rattled you know how youd feel if you had a piece of news like that thrown at you yes she said id know i meant to tell you i was going into the city but i didnt have a chance i had to leave in a hurry did you yes i did why business i could tell you but you wouldnt understand oh all right oh then i said its the truth god carol im out in front in this deal i cant stop and explain every time i turn around ive got to do what i thinks best i know well then she hesitated then turned and looked squarely at me or as squarely as she could with those eyes of hers will you answer me one question joe certainly i will and tell the truth wait a minute joe i didnt mean to insult you but ive just got to know all right shoot i said is there something wrong at the show i shook my head i couldnt find my voice right then youre not thats the truth joe of course its the truth what are you driving at what could be wrong i dont know she said but there is something wrong theres something wrong somewhere and youre afraid to tell me about it thats what wwhat i ccant stand your being afraid of me aw hell i said trying to put my arm around her why would i be afraid of you its no good asking each other questions joe she brushed at her eyes what we need is answers were in this together but were pulling different ways you dont trust me it dont doesnt look like you trusted me a hell of a lot either i love you joe sometimes you love a person so much you cant trust them its for their own good that you dont well i said i dont know what you want me to say i i guess there isnt much to say i jumped to my feet and headed for the kitchen and i didnt stop or look around when she called me things had been coming at me too fast i didnt have anything left to fight with i had to do something quick or i knew id be yelling the truth at her youre goddam right im afraid you d think i pulled you into this to get elizabeth and me out of a hole you think id sell anyone out you i got the cupboard door open and reached down the whisky bottle i raised it turning around and she was standing in the doorway watching me the whisky never reached my mouth i couldnt get it that high it trickled out on my shirt front and then the bottle dropped from my hand to the floor and i followed it instantly she was at my side lifting me and sick and dizzy as i was the one thought that filled my mind was how much strength she had i weigh around two hundred but she hoisted me up and got me over to the table as easily as if id been a child joe darling what do you want me to do joe im sick i kept repeating it im sick carol do you want me to get a doctor no no i didnt want a doctor he might give me something to knock me out and id start raving im just awfully tired and weak i said running around too much not eating got a chill she put a hand to my forehead youve got a fever too id better go to bed i said i get in bed and ill be all right all right joe she started to lift me again but i held back we cant go on staying here alone carol well have to have someone come in do you want me to call mr chance jesus no i mean i may be in bed several days we want someone who can be around all the time get mrs reverend whitcomb take the car and go after her shell do anything to get a few square meals she got up slowly kind of hanging back couldnt i just call her joe how would she get over here the whitcombs dont have a car now go on and go after her before it gets any later but but i dont drive very well i dont like to drive after dark you drive good enough you drove all the way home from wheat city after dark didnt you all right she said ill go right away after shed gone i went on sitting at the table for a few minutes thinking or trying to something tickling my mind something important but the idea wouldnt come i was too tired i dont know what time it was when she and mrs whitcomb got back i was already in bed and asleep back in reform school once some bigshot lawyer talked to us at chapel and he made the statement that nature hated a crime nature abhors a crime was the way he put it at the time it struck me as being just some more of the grapefruit they were always squeezing out to us it seemed to me that for a guy that had nature against him he was doing pretty well but now twentyfive years later almost i was beginning to see what he meant wed planned everything perfectly by all the laws of logic nothing could go wrong and yet well why say it on top of everything else i was afraid i was losing my nut i woke up early the next morning and tiptoed into the bathroom i got a drink of water at the sink and stood staring out the window and there was the garage just as big as day yeah it was there the old barn with the cupola that had been made over into a garage i saw it just as i had seen it for ten years i dont know maybe the eye holds images that dont go away that dont ever really go away maybe the average guy is so stuck on himself that everything he sees becomes important and he wont give it up not to himself until hes past seeing and past remembering i dont know all i know is that i almost let out a yell that they could have heard over in the next county i had to put my hand over my mouth to hold it back i got back into bed shivering and finally dozed off again but it wasnt good sleep not sound i mean i kept dreaming that elizabeth was in the room with me and it was like i was looking back or ahead on something that had happened she was climbing up on a chair to get something down from the ceiling i dont know the hell what and anyone could see that the chair was made out of straw and wasnt going to hold her up but she kept climbing up on it and id run and catch her and then shed throw herself back in my arms and kiss me then there was a little guy that kept coming to the door and trying to get in and there wasnt a damned bit of sense in her being af raid of him because he was so damned little and funnylooking but anyway he kept coming and id go to the door and tell him to get the hell out and hed beat it for a minute or two and then id go back over to the bed and pull the covers off of elizabeth but instead of doing what i should have done id stand there and laugh because dammit i know its crazy but shed turned into a statue she had and she hadnt we had to do it first or she would be but if we didnt she was and and then it was our wedding anniversary it seemed like and she was reminding me how wherever we were wed promised that wed always get together on our anniversary and even dreaming i knew it really was our anniversary and i kind of remembered that wed said that that wed promised like i suppose every couple does when theyre first married she kneeled down at my side and put her hand on my forehead she leaned forward and kissed me on the mouth and i woke up and it was carol how are you feeling she whispered i blinked my eyes all right i said your fever seems to have broken yeah i said im all right just weak what would you like for breakfast i told her just a little toast and coffee would do better bring up some whisky too im chilling she was back in ten minutes or so with a tray i sat up and made out like i was going to eat youd better run along carol it wont look good for you to spend too much time up here i theres something i want to say to you joe well but ive got to know something first ive got to know the truth do do you really love me oh jesus christ i slammed down my coffee cup if youve got anything to tell me spit it out if you havent leave me alone for a while were not supposed to be together and im sick and ive got a thousand and one things to think about im sorry but thats all right joe im going i do love you carol i said you know that but she was already gone i took a bite or two from the toast and put the rest in a bureau drawer under some shirts i drank the coffee down halfway and filled up the cup with whisky after a second cup of the stuff i felt pretty fair i could have got up as well as not but i stayed where i was i wasnt ready to face people yet andy taylor and appleton and happy chance maybe id never be but i sure wasnt now around noon of the third day right after id got through taking a bath i heard a car coming up the lane from the road i looked out the window to see who it was but it was already up and in front of the house by then a minute or so later carol tapped on the door and i told her to come in theres a man here to see you joe he said to tell you it was sol oh i said tell him to come up who is he joe is there tell him to come up i repeated she got that hard stubborn look on her face like she used to get around elizabeth but finally she turned and went back downstairs taking her time about it sol panzer looked more like a jockey than the owner of a ninetyhouse chain he was maybe five feet tall and he might have weighed a hundred and ten with his clothes wet i guess he had something wrong with his vocal cords because his voice matched up with the rest of him it was thin and soft not much more than a whisper if carol tried to listen and i figured she would she wouldnt hear much he stood by the door a moment looking at me out of the big hornrimmed glasses he wore then he moved over to the bed like greased lightning grabbed my hand and shook it and dropped into a chair right in front of me joe he said speaking in his fast halfwhisper im sorry to see you sick i was sorry about mrs wilmot i hope you got our flowers this is a nice place you have here thanks i said stick around and maybe you can buy it cheap im sorry joe he began to slow down its nothing personal thats all right have a drink no no i never drink during business hours if this is business i said maybe wed better get down to it cold turkey without the stuffing well a dollar and other valuable considerations remember me i said i own the place how many valuable considerations say about five thousand i let out a grunt five thousand wouldnt pay for my projectors and sound heads probably not joe then theres my chairs i said fifteen hundred of em with a factory list of eighteen seventyfive you bought cheap theyll run you twentytwo fifty now ive got a thousand yards of sixbucksayard carpeting ive got four grand in air conditioning ive got joe oh all right i said you dont want the stuff i couldnt buy it if i did want it joe i got friends in the theatrical supply line close friends yknow what would they think if i didnt patronize em theyd be hurt joe you know they would yeah i said i guess they would id known how it was going to be but i couldnt fight and when a man cant fight the best thing he can do is stall well joe well i said twentyfive grand isnt a bad price for the location ill take it i dont speak very loud joe maybe you didnt hear me say five twenty five but dont be afraid to beg joe my way of refusing is very polite i took another drink and lighted a cigarette i looked down at the floor pretending to study stalling i dont know sol i said doesnt it strike you that this is a pretty hard thing to do to a friend a friend joe he looked puzzled i hardly know you when i see you make it an enemy then i said youre obligated to come into this town i dont know how much youre already in on the deal but it must be plenty youve got to come in and im sitting on the spot you want yes joe well maybe youd better take it from there he nodded and leaned back in his chair you got bills outstanding joe you got insurance to pay you got taxes to pay you got a little bank loan maybe two of em not much none of it amounts to much if youre running but let your house go dark and see how big all them little things are see how fast people start coming down on you then oh hell i said im im not through joe i could wait you out twothree months but i wont have to im going to crack down if you even look like you want to be stubborn im going to get you for that marquee you swindled me on you i said me i was interested in that company i still am i started watching you when you beat me on that deal i figured you were a man worth watching i figured i could make a lot more by letting the five grand ride than cracking down on you funny aint it if youd played square with me i never would have started looking into stoneville i wouldnt have noticed the kind of business you were building up hell sol i said you shouldnt hold a grudge over that i didnt know it was your company his eyes closed for a second behind the big horn rims joe he said then he shook his head and sighed i dont hold any grudge joe im just showing you whats going to happen if you try to hold me up ill sue you for that marquee the actual price of it plus interest plus general losses due to having my product unjustly condemned do i make myself clear im moving in ill either buy your lot or ill take it but five grand sol i said thats no dough at all you can do better than that you know damned well youll give the lot a book value of thirty or forty thousand but it was my idea joe he shrugged you cant expect to cash in on my ideas can you whatll i do with my equipment its no good without a house to put it in so ive heard you gave your former competitor a hundred and fifty dollars for his stuff didnt you he shrugged again smiling out of the corner of his mouth dont cry on me joe on you tears dont look good and dont stall me that marquee deal aint the only thing ive got on you i can pile up stuff to the doors of the barclay if i take a notion you got the most remarkable record of chiseling i ever laid eyes on im not trying to stall i said im just trying to think it seems like everything has come down on me at once being sick and losing my wife and now i know joe his face softened a little but im not moving in tomorrow you can run until the end of the season you want an agreement to buy at the end of that time thats it all right i said and i took the biggest almost the biggest gamble ive ever taken in my life give me your check for five thousand and well close the deal if hed taken me up on it id have been washed up but i had a pretty good idea he wouldnt and he didnt you see why should he have made a special trip out from the city to bully me into selling something he could take if you want it that way joe he said slowly but for your own good id advise you to hold off youve got to run until the end of the season selling now would ruin your credit it wouldnt help it any i agreed but i supposed i just wanted to reach an understanding with you im not afraid of your trying to sell to someone else no ones going to buy a big show property without a lot of investigation i can muff any deal you try to make i know i said thats the deal then five grand at the end of the season for the lot i keep everything else providing you move it thats understood he stood up and held out his hand well let the option slide then as long as we understand each other youre the doctor sol i said i walked him to the door closed it and poured myself another drink i swallowed it just as i started to laugh and for a minute or two i thought i was going to strangle when carol came in i was staggering around sputtering and laughing like a hyena with the whooping cough she slapped me on the back and got a drink of water down me finally i began to get my breath back youre drunk joe she frowned you shouldnt get drunk at a time like this baby i said i was never more sober in my life who was that man what did he want that was sol panzer i said sol is the ssmartest i had to stop for a second showman in the business he wanted to buy the barclay oh she stiffened a little how much will he give you for it nothing baby nothing and do you know why because he doesnt want it but you just said i didnt say anything for a minute i just put my arms around her and squeezed until her breasts flattened against me until the veins in them swelled and began to throb then i said leave it to me kid just a little longer leave it to me and well pull out of this town with two hundred grand will you do that i felt her nod slow unwilling eager yes joe yes she said and mrs whitcomb shes taking a nap joe once right at the last like you will you know i looked into her face then i closed my eyes and kept them closed hap chance called during the afternoon i had carol tell him i was sleeping andy taylor called too and i had her tell him id see him that night she called appleton for me and made a date for dinner she was curious of course but she didnt ask questions id taken care of that for a while at least i drove down to the hotel about six appleton was waiting for me in the lobby we shook hands and found a table in the diningroom well joe he said looking me up and down your rest seems to have done you a lot of good i needed one i said i guess ive been going around in a daze ever since the accident i got to the point where i couldnt go on any longer thats the way it goes he nodded glancing at the menu by the way whats this talk about you having a competitor in here the glass of water i was holding almost slipped out of my hands where did you hear anything like that oh it wasnt anything definite just a rumor theres a rumor for every inch of film in show business i said your statement was that there was talk going around i want to know where its coming from i could see that he didnt really know anything theres always gossip in any good spot where one man has control someone will start talking about how much the showman must be making and how there ought to be another show there and before you know it the story gets twisted to where there is another house coming in ive got a hundredthousanddollar investment here i said if theres a rumor going around i want to know what there is to it and whos spreading it it wasnt anything joe just some wishful thinking i guess lets forget it i cant afford that kind of talk i said for once he was on the defensive lets forget it he mumbled if i hear anything more ill put the damper on it he didnt have much to say during the meal as soon as we had finished we went up to his room well here we are joe he said grinning again the secret lair of operator it was one of the sample rooms that salesmen use two of the big sample tables were fixed up for kind of a laboratory he even had a little weight scale and a centrifuge like theyve got down to the creamery only smaller one of the tables was covered with stuff from the fire little envelopes of ashes pieces of wood wire and metal i looked away there was a picture of a woman and a little boy on the dresser the boy was about four i imagine is that your boy i asked he looks a lot like you thats him he nodded think he looks like me huh not everyone can see the resemblance why hes the spit and image i said how old is he about six four he wasnt quite four when that picture was taken well hes certainly big for his age i said id have taken him to be six anyway appleton nodded his smile a mile wide yes sir hes a real boy you ought to see him out playing ball with me when im at home hes the craziest kid about baseball lever saw and he can really play too i mean joe hes got baseball sense he he kind of shook himself and gave me a wink damn you joe whats the matter let it go what do you know thats new since i saw you last nothing much i dont know whether i told you last time that id talked with the county attorney hes still confident that the fire was an accident appleton wagged his head im inclined to agree with him joe at any rate id probably say the same thing if i were a public servant now what do you mean by that i said its a public servants job to serve the public joe the living public i guess thats a dirty crack i said not at all im not hinting that mr clay is dishonest hes in office mrs wilmot is dead youre one of the citys most prominent citizens why should he go out of his way to prove something which in all probability didnt happen well i said im glad to hear you say that you dont owe me a nickel joe i got to thinking while i was sick i said it seems like i must have made a chump of myself the first time i talked to you maybe the next time too but that time particularly youre referring to what i said about the fire being incendiary thats it i dont know why ill tell you why i didnt intend for it to register on you i thought it was better for it to come over you gradually frankly if you had gone around offering rewards for the murderer and evidence of your own innocence id have been exceedingly suspicious of you now what am i supposed to say to that i said anything you like joe the bars are down tonight thats why i had you come up here okay what do you think about things as ive said before that it was an accident in all likelihood of course you and mrs wilmot didnt get along but who says we didnt you do everything about you says so everything ive learned about her says the same thing but the fact that you were opposites doesnt mean that you would kill her in fact im confident that you loved her very much well thanks i said its none of my business but would you mind telling me something how did two people like you ever happen to get married i laughed in spite of myself it was such a hell of a crude thing to ask that instead of getting sore i felt sorry for him for doing it ill tell you why i said looking straight at him every time she opened her mouth she put her foot in it she was about to go on the rocks i got sort of used to helping her out and finally well mmm he nodded that one eh what do you mean not a thing joe just thinking out loud mind if i ask another question go right ahead well this farmer girl mrs wilmot strikes me as having been a welleducated extremely fastidious person how did she happen to take anyone like la farmer into her home it was something id always wondered about myself and i didnt need to fake looking puzzled there you got me i said elizabeth was pretty tight about money and i thought at first that she might be trying to get a little cheap household help but she wasnt tight that way you know she wouldnt have done something that went against her grain to save dough i see anyway we didnt need any help there was just the two of us and i always ate out most of the time on top of that elizabeth had her own way of doing things and nothing else would suit it was more trouble showing carol how to do things than it would have been to do em herself perhaps she just felt sorry for the gal she didnt show it much if i hadnt well if i hadnt prodded her now and then carol would have been pretty hard up for spending money and clothes and everything else oh werent you a little out of practice at that sort of thing charitable enterprise i mean i dont think i like that i said im in a tough business i dont think ive been any tougher than ive had to be want to call it an evening joe not unless you do go ahead i can take it well i was going to say if this farmer girl was a baby doll the thing would be a lot more complicated or simple a little thing like murder doesnt stop a woman from getting a man she really wants particularly if she thinks shes going to get to help him spend a sum like twentyfive thousand but farmer has nothing minus in my catalogue i just cant picture you making a play for her thanks i said so the girl is out and youre out on that angle of course you get your wifes property in addition to the twentyfive grand but for all practical purposes you already had the property and you didnt need the money not bad enough to kill for it you have a good income a good business you loved your wife you werent chasing a dame if it wasnt for certain events in your early life so youve found out about that i said thats a hell of a thing to do drag up something a man did when he was a kid and smear him he shook his head keep your shirt on were not smearing anyone and we didnt drag it up you did the company doesnt issue policies of this size without some investigation hell i said i was fourteen years old i didnt know my tail from straight up id never been away from the orphanage before i didnt know what a seal on a freight car meant i just wanted to get out of the snow tampering with interstate commerce hell did they think i was going to walk off with a sack of cement thats all there was in the car it was a bum rap all right bum rap i laughed youre telling me seven years of sappings and kickings and doing work that would break a mans back seven years from fourteen until i was twentyone until i learned a proper regard for the property of others its things like that that i broke off remembering go ahead and say it joe said appleton its things like that that makes criminals okay i said youre doing the talking do i look like a criminal he leaned back grinning his hands clasped behind his head whats that got to do with it i was in too exactly the same number of years that you were the hell i said thats right borrowed a car for a joy ride and the cops caught me my old man wasnt very fond of me anyhow so i went right on over the road no things like that dont need to mean any more than we let em but you said your company its a fact they have to consider certainly its tough but thats the way it is he sat brushing at his knee looking down im sorry joe i know pretty well how you feel cant you think of some logical explanation some explanation that would be acceptable to the company for the fire no i cant the motor was in good condition there wasnt any possibility of a short not a chance if there had been any id have had it repaired sure naturally it isnt the money so much i said id just like to get things settled sure you would he nodded sympathetically studying me ill tell you something joe if youll keep your mouth shut ive been stringing you along a little ive recommended payment on this case im just waiting to mail my report waiting orders he smiled out of the corner of his mouth youre running in hard luck joe you remember that missing dame i told you about yes well theres the rub ive got to turn her up and as long as im here and it isnt costing them anything extra the companys having me keep your case open at least they think they are as far as im concerned its already closed as soon as i find this woman ill put a date on the report and shoot it in well i said thats something i wished i had been outside so that i could have taken a deep breath or let out a yell just of pure relief i didnt care if i never got the money i was going to have plenty without it we talked until midnight about show business and the war and things in general finally i figured it was time for me to go we shook hands got any leads on the woman yet i said oh one or two joe im expecting a break in the case any minute well luck to you i said and to you joe and joe yeah i said hed opened the door and i was standing halfway out in the hall do yourself a favor do a little deep thinking about some of the stuff weve discussed here tonight it may make you feel bad for a time but youll profit by it in the long run itll make it a hell of a lot easier for you to get along with yourself youre not telling me much i said its something youll have to see joe good night and take it easy ill do that i said the front of the building was dark but i could see a faint light in the back i tapped on the window and rattled the doorknob and in a couple of minutes andy taylor came shuffling around from behind the screen that separates his socalled office from his livingquarters i dont know whether hed been in bed or not he still had his clothes on but id always had the idea he slept with them on most of the time kinda took your time about gettin here didnt you he said come on in i followed him back to the rear of the building and he put the coaloil lamp hed been carrying down on a packingbox he didnt have any real furniture just a cot and some boxes and a little monkey stove i sat down on the cot so you decided to take me up he said well well he moved a dirty pie plate and a coffee cup off of one of the boxes and sat down across from me the light from the lamp made his beard seem redder than usual he looked like the devil with a hat on not so fast i said take you up on what i dont know joe i dont know i got a burn on my hand i said thats all anyone that works around electricity as much as i do is bound to get burned sure they are well i said you were willing to cancel the lease on the bower i was willing to do that anyway ive been thinking for a long time that i hadnt treated you right on that lease yeah i bet you did he rubbed his chin looking straight into the flame from the lamp for a minute i was afraid that id been too independent that he wasnt going to walk into the trap then he laughed just with his mouth and i knew everything was all right all he needed was a little steering all right joe he said i aint got a thing on you not a thing why dont you just get up and walk out of here okay i said i will i got up slow brushing at my clothes and turned toward the door he watched me the grin on his wrinkled old face getting wider and wider o course he said you know im going to tell appleton about that burn what for i said why do you want to do that andy what do you care as long as it dont mean nothing i shrugged and took a step toward the door then i let my face fall and i sank back down on the cot i heaved a sigh okay andy you win he nodded his eyes puzzled thought i would he said wonder why though i didnt say anything that motor was in good condition elizabeth wouldnt have been foolin around with it if it wasnt not elizabeth no i said and we know the fire wasnt set theres proof positive of that no i said it wasnt set and you were in the city when it happened thats right i was in the city but there was something wrong mighty wrong so wrong that youre willin to give me how much are you willin to give me joe what do you want make me an offer well im short of cash right now but i could give you part of the money from the insurance not part joe all but jesus i said all right goddamit all he cackled and shook his head huhuh joe i wouldnt touch that money how would it look for me to plunk twentyfive thousand in the bank after a deal like this huhuh i just wanted to get some idea of what it was worth to you for me to keep quiet some basis for tradin well now youve got it yeah now ive got it and you know what im goin to do with it joe somethin ive been wanting to do for years spit it out i said for gods sake you know ive got to come across what is it you want nothing more than what you owe me joe i had a good thing once and you ruined it for me now im handin you back the ruins and takin your good thing i looked blank what the hell are you driving at im makin you a swap joe im going to give you the bower for the barclay you know it was a funny thing it was what id expected and wanted it was what id been edging him toward from the start but now that hed fallen for it i didnt have to pretend to be sore or surprised it burned me up just as much as when id heard about panzer moving in its funny maybe i cant explain but that show that show no i cant explain i came to my senses after a minute but i kept on cursing and arguing awhile to make it look good thats not reasonable andy i said the barclays a firstclass house the bowers just a rattrap it wasnt always a rattrap maybe you can build it back up again like hell i see myself building the bower up with the barclay as competition oh i aint no hog joe i wont shut you out probly wouldnt know how even if i wanted to why not do this andy i said well be partners ill run the business and well he let out another cackle oh no we wont joe ive had a little experience running things on shares with you the first thing i knowed id be out in the cold but hows it going to look i said to make a trade like that i aint got any reputation for being crazy people will know theres something screwy about the deal now youre smartern that joe he shook his head they wont know a thing moren we tell em and i reckon neither you or i is going to talk well make it a trade plus other valuable considerations just like ninetynine per cent of all real estate deals is made but appleton appletonll be gone from here when i take over like i said joe i aint operatin no kind of business with you you go ahead and operate the barclay until the end of the season ill take it then andy cant we yes or no joe oh hell i said yes he went up to the front and brought back some legal forms and his rickety old typewriter and we finished the business then and there we drew up a contract agreement to a transfer of deeds at the end of the season and he gave me a check for a dollar and i gave him one each carrying a notation as to what it was for that made the deal airtight even without witnesses there was no way either of us could back out i offered to shake hands as i was leaving but he didnt seem to notice i let it pass hed feel a lot less like shaking hands when the end of the season came it was about one in the morning now i debated going home and decided against it it would save arguing and explaining and anyway there wasnt much time for sleep i wanted to be in the city when the business offices opened in the morning i went over to the show got the clock out of the projection booth and set the alarm for two hours away i sat down in one of the loges put the clock under the seat and leaned back the next thing i knew i was back as far as my memory went with my mother or the woman i guess was my mother i was living it all over again the big hand of the clock was pointing to twelve and the little one to six and she was coming up the stairs slow slowly like she always came like she wasnt sure where the top was then a key scratched against the lock and finally it turned and the door opened and she tottered over to the bed and lay down and began to snore shed brought something in a sack with her and she was half lying on it and i had to squeeze and tug to get it it was a piece of jelly roll and a hamburger all squashed together and i hogged it down after that i felt through her pockets until i found the crisp green pieces of paper she always brought me and i hid them in the bureau drawer with the others then it was morning and she was gone again i filled my tin cup with cornflakes and canned milk and ate it and i played with the green pieces of paper and looked out the window and i ate a little more of the cornflakes and milk the big hand of the clock pointed to twelve and the little one to six it pointed to them and passed them i laughed about it holding my hand over my mouth so no one would hear me i was still laughing when i went to sleep she was gone in the morning but she was always gone in the morning i ate some of the cornf lakes and milk and played with the green pieces of paper and looked out the window and the big hand of the clock pointed to twelve and the little one to six and and it was like a dream inside of a dream i was chewing the wrapper inside the cornf lakes box and the tip of my tongue was cut where id tried to stick it through the little hole in the milk can and the water pitcher was red from my licking i wasnt looking out the window any more i was on the bed i had been on the bed for a very long time and the green pieces of paper were scattered all around me then and then it was another room and a big fat woman with crossed eyes was holding me in her arms and rocking me mommy sure now an well get you a whole raft of em ill be your mommy meself my money i got to have my money an am t i the one to know it now bring his bundle in mike that mess of whisky labels the alarm clock went off and i woke up i went into the mens lavatory and washed and headed for the city sol panzer didnt make nearly as much fuss as you might have thought he would he was on the spot and we both knew it and he wasnt the kind to cry i was in his office at nine by eleven it was all over and i was on my way home i got into stoneville about dusk stopped at the show and ran up to the booth hap wasnt there jimmie nedry was running the machines hows it going jimmie i said giving mr chance a relief i guess so he said not looking at me how soon will he be back do you know he aint coming back jimmie said hes taking the night off oh i said well i appreciate your working for him jimmie dont mention it he got kind of red in the face and moved over between the projectors i could understand his being embarrassed unless he was a lot dumber than i thought he was he probably knew that i knew what hed been up to i told him good night just like we were the best pals in the world and drove over to haps hotel he wasnt there either i went on home there was a big new black coupe standing in the yard haps of course i was plenty glad id swung that deal with panzer hap had finished waiting he was flopped down on the livingroom lounge a glass and a bottle of whisky at his side and he had his shoes up on one of elizabeths crocheted pillows the ash tray was full and running over there was a big circle of ashes and butts on the carpet i looked at the mess and then looked at him he sat up slowly grinning well laddie he said i get the impression that youve pulled a plum from the pudding or shall we say a phoenix from the fire have a drink and tell me about it i forced a smile sure hap wheres carol in her chambers i believe she doesnt seem to be frightfully keen for my company i wonder why i said i went into the kitchen and brought back a glass and an old newspaper i spread the paper under the ash tray and set the bottle on it after id poured our drinks clever hap nodded too bad youre not married but give me the news laddie im all ears you want it right from the beginning oh absolutely well right from the start i said i heard that sol wanted my lot as soon as i learned that he was moving in i heard that he was going to take me over at the exchanges from you everywhere i went then yesterday just to clinch matters he drove out here to see me and offered five grand for the lot he told me hed give me five to clear out at the end of the season or i could be stubborn and hed run me out i paused to sip my drink hap began to frown he can do it laddie little sol can take your shirt and charge you interest for wearing it sure he could so this is the old buildup eh the easy letdown all youve got is a measly five grand nothing like it i said i didnt sell sol doesnt want my lot you said he offered you five yards for it thats right but he doesnt want it of course he doesnt chance leaned back on the lounge again he tapped his forehead feeble laddie humor me what would panzer want with my lot what would he want with it well fantastic as the idea seems i suppose hed erect a house on it theres nothing like the site of an old show for a new one people are used to the location and and i said its one hundred and three feet from the sidewalk to the alley no matter how you work it you cant get much more than a ninetyfoot shot from the projection booth to the screen hap blinked lord lummie he whispered comes the dawn but wait a minute maybe he intends to pitch his floor in reverse and put the projectors below the screen that still wouldnt give him enough room not for a million bucks worth of house a million thats got to look like two million but laddie hap waved his hands its fantastic call it anything you want thats the way it is theres width and to spare but not depth you see how it was hap sol was using the old magicians trick of misdirection when i was told that he wanted my lot over and over i and everyone else assumed that he did it never occurred to me to question the fact or if i had any idea that it was a little screwy i brushed it aside sol knew what he was doing he had to know but he got a little too anxious too anxious in one way and not enough in another when he thought that i was convinced when he believed i was ready to take the five grand he agreed to let the deal hang fire i knew then that he didnt want my lot he was misdirecting me he was doing it because he didnt have the lot sewed up that he did want careless i cant believe it of sol careless nothing where would he be most likely to tip his hand that he was coming into stoneville why when he bought his lot so he was saving that until the last until he was ready to jump i still say it was careless suppose someone jumped in ahead of him like i gather youve done no one could what he wanted was the bower lot and i had the place leased i was playing shutout with it as soon as i went broke of course id give up my lease and sol could buy hap shook his head marvelous laddie positively brilliant and thats the only place in town that sol could move in on the only one thats the only block without an alley the lots run straight on through the bower lot is kind of bottleshaped it squares off and spreads out after a few feet and theres no other lot in that block two but the bank and the hotel are sitting on them terrific one more question old bean how did you happen to acquire this juicy bit of real estate you know hap i traded something for it thats going to be worthless uhhah your show thats what i supposed but theres one little point im not quite clear on our friend taylor doesnt know that your house is going to be worthless he regards it as a little gold mine why wasnt he suspicious when you swapped it for his prize white elephant id stepped into one again he knew now that i was walking a pretty ragged rope he laughed softly this is much better than i thought laddie or worse yknow i think ill raise my sights on you i really think i shall whats the taylor deal got to do with you i said you dont know anything hap havent i said so all along i know enough to sound the alarm the firemen speaking metaphorically will do the rest he tapped a yawn back with his hand odd how this subject of fires keeps cropping up isnt it what do you want well what kind of holdup are you pulling on little solly honor bright now id be very hurt to catch you in a falsehood ive got a check for fifty grand in my pocket uhhah a very neat evasion perhaps id better ask sol about it and explain my interest in the matter i get a hundred and fifty more i said when he moves in you see hap shrugged you can tell the truth when you have to he sat up and reached for the whisky bottle shall we drink on it partner yeah i said partner partner i said he poured us a drink and we touched glasses and i couldnt help thinking how nice it would be to drop a little arsenic in his then i saw a shadow in the hall and i knew carol was listening and i thought well never mind sometimes you get an idea in your head and its pretty hard to get it out hap swished the liquor around in his glass studying me yknow he said youre really a very lucky man joe sure i said sure i am oh but you are if i hadnt become interested in the success of your little plan which necessarily involves your own safety i probably would have stood aside and let fate take her course with you a very unpleasant course now what i said what are you trying to pull now take yourself back to the morn of the tragedy old man you stop by the show and visit the projection booth and lo and behold you discover that your supply of photoelectric cells is exhausted it comes as a complete surprise to you you hadnt planned on going to the city but now you must ergo you provide yourself with an alibi for being out of town well but you had your suitcase in your car jimmie nedry saw it when he passed by on his way to work so you must have planned on going to the city before you ever noticed the alleged absence of those cells so what i said maybe i was taking some clothes to the cleaners not good enough laddie that could be checked on and that isnt the clincher at any rate it wasnt the first time youd hopped jimmie about missing equipment and hed taken certain precautions hes ready to swear that the cells you supposedly bought in town bore the same serial numbers as those that were missing from the show in other words old chap your alibi is a phony he he told you all this mmm got quite fond of me did nedry and in the morning when blair swings his transfer hes going to tell him he grinned at me over his glass and i began to see red what the hell this was my deal id taken the risk and done all the thinking and here was another guy with his hand out let the little bastard talk i said let him go to hell hes lying he got the numbers of those cells wrong he huhah but even if he had it wouldnt make any difference you still couldnt afford to have him tell that story he can tell anything he pleases by god im haps hand shot out he caught his fingers in my collar and jerked and twisted for a minute i thought my neck was broken thats how a rope feels laddie just a little like that but dont fret if you crumb this deal ill settle with you myself my throat felt like id swallowed a cantaloupe how hhow much do you think nothing not a red nothing no money it wouldnt do any good your projectionist has one of the most alarming cases of honesty ive ever seen hes even consciencestricken at having used his information to pry a better job out of blair but he hasnt told him yet he hasnt and he wont i see i said and he nodded and looked at his wrist watch well i really must be shoving along i told them at the hotel that id be checking out tonight told several people in fact must be getting back to the city i hate to see you leave i said its trying isnt it but the best of friends you know and all that rot oh yes yeah its terribly lonely when friend nedry gets off work been thinking it might be awfully awkward for you if he should be slugged by footpads or some such thing perhaps youd best be at home here around eleventhirty miss farmer can alibi for you okay hap i said on second thought i incline to the belief that some doubt might be cast on the farmer veracity call your telephone operator at eleventhirty ask her the time they still give it here dont they yes cheerio then cheer so long i said there was a chocolate cake in the refrigerator and part of a baked ham but i passed them up and opened a can of soup i wasnt particularly hungry and id been eating too much recently just this morning id noticed that i was getting a little paunchy i heard carol come through the door and i could feel her standing behind me i went on eating and pretty soon she walked around into my line of vision and it was all i could do not to burst out laughing she had a new kind of hairdo and a plain black dress and she was trying to stick her nose in the air and hold her chin down at the same time sure elizabeth or carols idea of elizabeth i ducked my head over my soup you look mighty pretty carol i said as soon as i could say anything do you like me better this way i wasnt sure of the answer to that one you always look good to me how about some soup ive already ate eaten coffee no you go ahead i went ahead taking my time about it doing some thinking this was the second or third time shed listened in on my conversations she was nervous and scared of course but hell i was a little uneasy myself and i didnt pop out at her every time she opened a door i wondered if it was always going to be like this i wondered if i could never go any place or do anything without having her breathing down my neck without worrying about her getting worried i shoved my plate back and lighted a cigarette i guess you know i said that theres been some trouble she nodded yes i know now im glad you heard i said i intended to tell you as soon as i could see my way out didnt want to worry you unless i had to you you werent afraid to tell me joe now why do you say a thing like that i i couldnt stand it if you were afraid of me joe i know how you feel how you got to feel im different now when you kill someone it changes you but i was afraid i said but not that way youd stuck your neck out it looked like it might not get you anything you might have thought that we i had known it wouldnt get you anything that id put you on a spot and was going to walk off and leave you and try to go to elizabeth she snapped you see i said now get that idea out of your head carol i had elizabeth and i didnt want her she had me and she didnt want me i figure she brought you here with the idea that id fall for you oh no she didnt she had some reason for doing it and it sure wasnt charity she wanted me around to make herself look good im a woman myself and i know thats why i hated her so much dont you suppose if shed wanted to get rid of you shed have got someone that didnt look like like carol i said and igot up and put my arm around her and gave her a hug the dame was nuts if she thought that about elizabeth elizabeth didnt need anyone around to make her look good well its the truth carol said no its not i said leading her into the livingroom and youre getting yourself all upset over nothing all that matters is that well be in the clear after tonight and well have plenty of money lets not spoil it promise you wont try to see her joe of course i wont i said do you think id run a risk like that youll give me her the money and let me send it to her i told you i would now forget it she wiped her eyes and smiled sort of trembly and i fixed us a drink i thought for a minute the arguments and explanations were over but of course they werent i was beginning to see that they werent ever going to be over i wondered how elizabeth felt about it all now how long will it be before everything is settled joe two or three months anyway can i stay here until no i said you know you cant carol just until that insurance man leaves joe just let me stay that long he he scares me i dont want to be away from you as long as hes around well i said well see i meant to get her out of the house in the next day or two if i had to pitch her out a window rain began to patter on the roof it started in easy and got harder and harder inside of a half hour it was a regular downpour there was a hell of a crash of lightning somewhere near by and carol shuddered and snuggled close to me i reached back to the wall and turned on the furnace joe yeah i said its kind of nice being this way aint isnt it being able to do just what we please around the house ill say elizabeth would say it was too early for the furnace yeah she sure would it sounded pretty halfhearted so i had to say something else if you wanted to see someone that was really tight you should have seen her old lady we cleaned out her room after she died and she had darned near a whole closet full of dry bread just scraps you know carol snickered she must have been crazy i guess she was along toward the last you could hardly blame her though with a husband that spent all his life writing a history of the county whatd he do that for god knows i said carol snuggled closer the room began to get warm the wind rose and fell throwing the rain against the roof in long steady swishes and she seemed to breathe in time with it my knees began to ache from her weight but i didnt move i didnt want to talk any more about elizabeth or her folks or anything everything was all right now id told her about a hundred times that i loved her and didnt love elizabeth a man cant spend his life hashing over the past i dozed for a few minutes what seemed like a few minutes when i woke up the clock had just finished striking i jerked out my watch eleventhirty i shoved carol off of me waking her up and stumbled out to the hall my legs had gone to sleep and i could hardly walk the phone rang just as i was gripping the receiver i answered it automatically joe yes ive got to talk with you joe how soon can you come down why i said whats wrong im at my office youll be right down well its kind of a bad night no answer well sure i said ill be right down i hung up carol was still sitting on the lounge her face whiter than anything i ever hope or want to see her lips moved but no sound came out of them web clay i said and as if she didnt know our county attorney she swallowed a couple of times and finally found her voice wwhat does he want i dont know mr chance goddamit i said i told you i didnt know hap wasnt supposed to call he was going right on into the city but i didnt think it could be about him hap was too smooth an operator to be taken in by any of the stoneville clowns if thered been a chance of being caught he wouldnt have taken it but even if they had got him what could he say what could jimmie nedry say for that matter enough to start the ball rolling sure but the ball hadnt had time to roll yet even web clay wasnt dumb enough to tip his hand to me until he had a lot more to go on than he would have i went over to the hall tree and took down my hat and coat and and she didnt say anything and i didnt hear her move but her hand went past mine and grabbed her coat i jumped startled before i knew what i was doing i whirled and slammed her against the wall it hurt her it hurt and i was damned glad of it she bounced forward trying to dodge around me and i caught her by the wrists and we struggled and then we stopped posed like a couple of wrestlers in a picture ashamed scared stiff sorry if i hurt you baby i said you kind of startled me its all right joe she tried to smile back at me i just want togo with you you know you cant how would it look carol ive got to joe you cant no one knows theres anything between youre damned right they dont i said and theyre not going to either what would you be doing up at this time of night why would you be traipsing along with me you dont understand joe i i i understand all right i said youre afraid ill spill something you want to get in on the ground floor when the talking starts it was a bad break but i couldnt hold it back id held myself in as long as i could anyway she might as well know that i was onto her we knew where we stood now do do you really think that joe what do you expect me to think youre certainly not worried about me chasing off after elizabeth no im not worried about that spit it out then if youve got anything to say youd better go on joe youll stay here where else would i go yes ill stay here i shrugged on my coat and pushed past her she spoke again just as i was opening the door joe now what i just wanted to tell you joe everythings going to be all right you dont have anything to be afraid of not any more than you have i said not as much dont forget it i got the car started and went slipping and skidding down the lane to the highway at the intersection i jerked the wheel toward the right toward town i had to jerk it something had almost made me turn the other way people in stoneville go to bed pretty early even when there isnt a storm to keep them off the streets i toured around a dozen blocks without passing anyone or without seeing any lights except those in the courthouse there were a few cars parked out but none of them was haps i began to breathe easier he must have done the job and got away there was just one way to make sure of course that was to drive by jimmie nedrys house and see if he was there but i didnt have any reason for doing that any excuse i mean and there wasnt time it was almost a half hour now since web had called me regardless of what had happened hed start wondering if i didnt show up soon i drove back to the courthouse parked and ran up the walk to the building i went up the stairs and down the hall not hurrying but not taking my time either just businesslike i put the right kind of expression on my face puzzled and a little put out and then i opened webs door and went in web was sitting behind his desk looking about as uncomfortable as i felt sheriff rufe waters was standing leaning against the wall he acted like he didnt want any part of what was going on i sat down in front of web slapped the rain from my hat and waited he made a job of clearing his throat well joe he said at last i suppose youre wondering why i asked you to come down here you cant blame me for that i said rufe laughed and muttered something under his breath and web gave him an angry look rufe thinks im playing the fool he said but im running this office and ive got to do what i think is best i wouldnt have had you come down here joe if i hadnt figured i had to so i said well i just wanted to know joe i wondered if you thought perhaps rufe waters laughed again ill tell you joe he thinks it wasnt mrs wilmot that got killed in the fire i tried to keep from jumping then i remembered that i should that anyone would be startled by a statement of that kind and i gave a good healthy start i leaned forward frowning interested web must have some reason for thinking that i said what is it web he wiped his face relieved that i wasnt sore has appleton said anything to you about a woman he was looking for a woman that came out here on the day of the fire and disappeared why yes i said i believe he did make some mention of it well thats it he prowled the town from one end to the other looking for her and then he called us in and we checked with everyone that hires household help everyone but you and of course elizabeth yes i said go on web well joe we figure appleton and i figure that that woman must have gone to your place she didnt i said elizabeth didnt say anything about hiring anyone but that doesnt mean she didnt do it web laughed apologetically no offense i just mean she wouldnt have been a barclay if she hadnt been a wee bit highhanded all the barclays were youre right about that i said but you were in the city joe you didnt go home after you left in the morning so the woman could have been there and you wouldnt have known a thing about it i shook my head stalling waiting to be convinced i could see where the conversation was leading but there wasnt anything to do but follow it it was a crazy way for things to turn out to be tripped up by a dame that didnt belong in the plot at all but there it was and i couldnt help carol all i could do was save myself i dont think elizabeth would have done that i said but give me the rest of it heres the way we see it said web mrs wilmot put an ad in one of the city papers and hired this woman she hired her and the farmer girl didnt know about it until mrs wilmot picked her up that night in wheat city probably elizabeth was a little bit curt and carol got sore you couldnt blame her much here she was coming back from a vacation with all her money spent moren likely and she finds herself out of a job its thirty miles from here to wheat city we figure that somewhere between here and there elizabeth was killed and her body hid we figure that carol drove on home by herself killed the other woman to keep from giving her play away and then put her in the garage and set it on fire i i cant believe that carol would do anything like that web oh she could have rufe waters spoke up all them farmers are a deadhard lot i wouldnt put a killin or two past any member of that family but the rest of its all bunk i mean about this other woman and all web glared at him whats bunk about it it all fits in dont it i aint going to argue said rule ill go along with you so far as to say that the girl might have had an argument with mrs wilmot and killed her but thats as far as i will go i cant believe itisaid again carol and elizabeth got along fine at least while i was around well drawled web what gettingalong is to a man isnt the same as it is to a woman a man doesnt really know when womenfolks are at outs and when theyre not but if elizabeth hadnt wanted her around shed have fired her said web and im claiming thats just what she did do she went right ahead without asking or telling anyone and canned her rufe scratched his head thoughtfully web had made a point with him its a little too pat i said carol had been with us for almost a year if elizabeth had wanted to fire her it looks like shed have done it long ago maybe the trouble just came up lately maybe elizabeth couldnt find anyone to take her place maybe she was waiting until carol was out of town thats common sense isnt it well i hesitated it sounds reasonable i tell you joe it just had to be something like that the more you think about the more you see im right im not saying that the girl just hauled off and deliberately started killing probably it was kind of an accident to begin with she was mad she flung out at elizabeth and killed her before she knew what she was doing then she had to go on and do the rest to protect herself he stared at me waiting and i nodded my head a couple of times i dont know web the way you put it its a cinch that fire didnt start itself said rufe waters no it didnt said web the girl had to do it joe she was the only one that could have i could have said how can you be so damned sure that the woman stayed here how do you know shes not in some other burg right now throwing herself a whingding but what i said was maybe youre right its not just my idea web went on this insurance fellow appleton really thought of it didnt he ask you anything about how things stood between carol and mrs wilmot yes he did well he we hadnt really started putting two and two together then we thought it was just a matter of a little work to turn this missing woman up when we couldnt find her he started putting two and two together and we figured it like i just told you he heard from his company tonight and they think hes on the right track theyre willing to back him up in anything he does thats why i got you down here i see i said appletons going to ask that the bod that the remains be exhumed and examined in the morning hes going to demand a real post mortem if it dont show it was elizabeth that was killed in the fire hes going to put a murder charge against carol farmer i dont like to have him running things on me like that i figure if theres any murders to be solved we people here in the county ought to solve em ourselves especially with election coming up nodded rufe thats got nothing to do with it web glared at him now heres what i thought wed better do joe theres no use in rufe or me trying to talk to that girl shed just freeze up on us like the rest of that ornery farmer gang so i want you to talk to her tell her me talk to her i said yes you joe well gosh i said i you know how to gentle people along get on the best side of em you can get her to talk when no one else could get to first base you know sympathize with her but show her she hasnt got a chance to beat the case i know its asking a lot but i dont think it is i looked from web to rufe jutting my jaw out if things are like you think they are its my duty to help to get to the bottom of em i knew youd see it that way joe the only reason id hesitate at all is because of the possibility that i might gum things up if the girl is guilty i want to be sure she pays the penalty whatll i do if she tries to skip out or just a minute said rufe he crossed the room opened the connecting door to his offices and went inside he came back with a colt automatic in his hand he twirled it caught it by the barrel and handed it to me butt first you take that joe well i said shying away i dont know as thats necessary take it joe said web that girl may have a gun herself for all you or we know she might come at you with a knife she might try to knock you out with a club and make a run for it you cant take any chances you take the gun and if you have to use it dont hesitate i held back a few minutes longer but finally they talked me into taking it driving home in the rain with my guts kind of knotting and unknotting i thought about elizabeth and how goddam unfair it was that i had to do all the dirty work on a deal shed really started i hadnt hired carol i never would have brought her into the house maybe i wasnt too satisfied with married life but it never occurred to me to do anything about it it was elizabeth who had brought her in it was just one more stupid thing shed done that i had to be the fall guy for about a year after shed had her miscarriage i went home one afternoon and some dame was in the livingroom with elizabeth i stuck my head in the door to say hello and she and this woman both looked kind of embarrassed and then elizabeth laughed and told me to come in this is mrs fahrney joe she said mrs fahrney is connected with the childrens protective society oh i said wondering if she had a kick on some of the shows id been playing that must be very interesting work well it is said the dame glancing at elizabeth and elizabeth laughed again we may as well tell him she said hell have to sign the papers anyway the papers i said i was keeping it for a surprise dear were going to have a son the sweetest little boy baby you ever wait a minute i said you mean you want to adopt someone elses kid not someone elses joe ours perhaps i should have told you sooner but i guess you should have too i said i guess you might have saved this lady a trip out here if you had any time i have any kids of my own i guarantee ill feed em and take care of em and do everything else im supposed to but im not spending my dough and my time on other peoples brats i dont want any part of em elizabeth sat biting her lip looking down at the floor this woman got up and walked over to her im sorry mrs wilmot she said ill run along now oh wait a minute i said i didnt mean all that if she wants to adopt this boy its all right with me but it isnt all right with me she said looking straight through me goodby mrs wilmot and she sailed out the door without giving me a chance to reason with her i tried to explain to elizabeth how i felt a kid is always a hell of a big expense and we just couldnt spare the dough from the show and anyway how could you tell what you were getting into when you take a kid out of an orphans home all elizabeth would say was i understand and she didnt understand at all well no one can say im not human and i was kind of ashamed of the way id acted i suppose she did get lonesome around the place by herself and when she got a cat i didnt say a word i dont like cats they demand too much attention if youre trying to read or eat or no matter what youre trying to do a cat will butt right in on you short of killing them theres no way of keeping them from rubbing against your legs or jumping into your lap or just bothering you in general i didnt say a word though when it got to where it bothered me too much id just go to my room and lock the door i guess it finally got on elizabeths nerves too because she gave it away to someone i never asked who and she didnt say iwas just satisfied that it was gone about six months later she bought a dog a tanandwhite collie pup and i didnt say anything about that either but i never knew a minutes comfort at home until she got rid of it i cant stand dogs i meani cant and if youd been on the bum as much as i have youd know why well so that brings us up to carol and i know what youre thinking its what i thought at first but its not the case she didnt take carol as a substitute for the cat or dog she didnt treat her half as good as shed treated either one of them ive already told you how she didnt even give her a decent feed the first night she was there thats just a sample of the way she acted toward her and it didnt get me anywhere when i jumped her about it really joe you amaze me she said sort of smiling down her nose how can you possibly be interested in the welfare of a girl like that im already willing to admit it was a mistake to bring her here well shes here i said and shes going to stay and were going to treat her decent too are we all right dont then i said but if you wont do anything for her yourself dont stand in my way i wont she said still smiling thats a promise i wont stand in your way at all and that was the way it ended all that was ever done for carol was done by me i hadnt lied to appleton about that but it was elizabeth that brought her into the house in the first place i dont know why unless it was just another one of her ways of getting my goat and i dont know that it matters all i know is that carol coming there is what started all the trouble and that it was left to me to clean it up there was one thing that still puzzled me and always had the money the way elizabeth had argued about a split the way shed kept telling me id be sorry if i tried to get out of sending her the insurance dough the people who really care about money are those who lack something without it and elizabeth had always felt just as complete and respectable and important without a dollar as she had with a pocketful shed been saving and thrifty sure but that was more habit than anything else shed proved a hundred times over that money didnt mean a thing to her when shed first begun to make an issue of it i thought she was just trying to put a spoke in my wheel to make it harder to settle the problem between her and carol and me and right up until the last i guess i was expecting her to say all right have your carol and everything else id scrub floors before id take a penny from you that would have been elizabeths way of doing things and maybe i would have taken her up on it and maybe i wouldnt have the point is that she did just the opposite something that just didnt fit in with her character and now when it mattered least of all i couldnt get it out of my mind i remembered how insistent carol had been on sending elizabeth the money herself and the answer to that one popped into my head and made me shiver she hadnt intended sending it shed have burned it up first she hated her enough to do that to risk getting us all in trouble just to take one final punch at elizabeth it had to be the answer because i never wrote even a business letter if i could get out of it and i sure wouldnt have written elizabeth after we were all washed up it was a standing joke around the house my not writing to anyone at least it had been a joke back in the beginning back during the first year that elizabeth and i were married we were awfully cramped for dough that year we had good prospects and i knew wed pull out in the long run but i was trying to do too many things at once and we ran short it got so bad that i even considered closing down for a while and going back to driving film truck but right at the time when things looked darkest this old uncle of elizabeths died back east and everything was jake he left her twentyfive hundred dollars enough to clear up the mortgage on the barclay home with a thousand left over well i took her down to the train when she started back to collect and while we were waiting on the platform she asked me to send her a dollar send you a dollar i laughed whats the idea here ill give you no i want you to send it to me joe i know thats the only way ill hear from you oh now i said i dont think im that bad ill drop you a card oh but you are that bad she said send me the dollar or youll be sorry when i come back she was kidding you know like newly married people will but i thought if it meant that much to her id play along and that was the cause of two of the worst weeks ive ever spent in my life i am careful about money a businessman has got to be id doublechecked the hotel address where elizabeth was supposed to be staying and i put a fiveday return on the envelope when i mailed it and then through some kind of mixup it came back to me and the envelope was stamped not known here scared worried brother i didnt know where else to write i knew she was supposed to be at the address i had and of course she thought id broken my promise so she didnt write me either she finally broke down and sent me a wire and i sent her one and and that was the end of it but until i heard from her i was imagining all sorts of things id about halfway decided that she must be dead i used to know a drunk years ago a booker at one of the film exchanges in the city he was one of those godawful noisy messy drunks the worst of the worst kind and do you know something that guy couldnt stand the sight of another drunk it wasnt any pretense he actually hated em hed walk six blocks to keep from passing one on the street i was thinking about him and wondering why i was thinking about him as i turned into the lane toward home then as i drove into the yard another funny thing popped into my mind the tag line on an old joke its not the original cost but the upkeep there it is make anything you want to out of it after id shut off the motor i sat in the car for a moment pulling myself together thinking trying to think what a hell of a mess carol had got me into by going to work for us then i rubbed the gun in my pocket wiped the sweat off my hand and got out i went up the steps i crossed the porch and opened the door as far as i could see there from the hall everything was just like i had left it the shades were drawn the furnace was still ticking away throwing out warm waves of heat the lights were carol i called carol and every light in the place went out i stood where i was paralyzed too shocked to move and the air from the furnace didnt seem warm any more it got colder and colder it brushed against my face like the draft from an icebox somehow i got my foot behind me and kicked the door shut as an afterthought i turned the key in the lock and put it in my pocket i called her one more time carol there wasnt any answer it wasnt the storm then shed pulled the switch shed done it without even waiting to see what web had wanted or what i was going to do about it and shed been nagging me about not trusting her i was sore and relieved at the same time it made things easier i started to strike a match but caught myself shed see me first and she hadnt turned out those lights for the fun of it she was sure id put her on the spot or maybe shed guessed that i could never feel safe as long as she was alive anyway she was playing for keeps i dont know whether ive described the layout of our house or not theres a hall extending from the front door to the kitchen on the left as you go in is the livingroom the diningroom is across from it on the right i went down the hall on tiptoe to the livingroom and eased the drapes apart my eyes were getting used to the dark and i could see a little not much but a little the outlines of the furniture shadowy blotches on the wall where pictures hung the livingroom looked empty and i decided it must be the master light switch was in the kitchen she hadnt had time to move far from it i tried to figure out which way shed go up the hall toward me or through the door into the diningroom or would she still be there in the kitchen i started down the hall and stopped a door had creaked the door connecting the diningroom and kitchen she was coming around that way getting behind me i pivoted and crept back to the diningroom i slid through the portiers holding my breath the door creaked again as it was opened wider now i could see a black oblong as it was opened all the way i could see a shadow a crouched blur upon the black i touched the trigger of the automatic the explosion was almost deafening but i heard her scamper back into the kitchen i heard one of the chairs go over i eased forward again not seeing too well because of the flash of light from the shot at the door into the kitchen i dropped down on my hands and knees and started to crawl across the threshold it was a minute or two before i saw her her shadow against the far wall i waited until i was sure until i saw it edging toward the spot where the hall door would be then slowly i began rising to my feet i was too slow for her in a split second the door banged open crashed shut i stood up panting sweat pouring from my face i felt my way along the wall to the switch box the cover was open as id known it would be and the switch was pulled i pushed it back into place blinking my eyes as the lights went on i locked the back door and put the key in my pocket i waited looking upward listening at last i heard it the squeak of a bedspring i started to tiptoe out of the kitchen then stopped again shed have to come out of her room it wouldnt look right to break the door down i began to whistle to myself as i thought it over and then i started to whistle louder loud enough for her to hear me and just as if i didnt have a care in the world i tramped up the stairs and knocked on the door of her bedroom carol i called are you asleep there was no answer but the bed creaked again in my mind i could see her sitting there huddled as far back as she could get staring at the door i let out an embarrassed laugh did you hear all that racket i was making the light switch dropped down and shut off the current i thought there was a prowler in the house i laughed again guess id be shooting yet if my gun hadnt jammed i could own a gun she couldnt be sure that i didnt i heard i thought i heard a faint sigh of relief a scared doubtful sigh get dressed carol weve got to get out of here right away tonight there wasnt any kind of sound this time nothing i could identify but she seemed to be asking a question do you hear me carol i knocked again weve got to beat it theyve found out about the woman you hired they havent got the straight of things but they know enough theyre going to open the grave in the morning as soon as they find out it wasnt elizabeth well be sunk theyll run elizabeth down and shell squawk to save her own neck the whole thing will be pinned on us i banged harder on the door come on we can be a long ways from here by daylight open the door and ill help you pack she didnt answer it dawned on me that she probably couldnt she was too frightened too scared of what her voice might tell me but she had got up she was standing and now she was coming to the door afraid yes scared as hell but more scared not to i raised and leveled the gun my hand was shaking and i gripped my wrist with my other hand and steadied it the key grated and clicked in the lock the doorknob turned then the door flew open and just as it did i squeezed the trigger there was one long stuttering explosion and then it was all over and through the smoke i saw appleton grinning at me thanks a lot i think that establishes an intention to kill even though you were shooting blanks his grin broadened seeming to contract his eyes not that we needed it after your interesting revelations youre a hard man joe we thought youd give the gal some kind of explanation before you started shooting i i i said the sheriff gave me that gun i i thought she was going to kill me and oh come now joe he shook his head who do you think was playing that game of tag with you trying to get you to open up why do you think waters gave you a gun loaded with blanks what do you think happened to your buddy chance i swallowed hard you got hap uhhuh caught him right in the act of slugging jimmie nedry he was quite cooperative but his information wasnt very helpful he put the finger on you but it didnt mean anything to us not any more than what andy taylor had to tell cut it out ilaughed in his face i was caught but that didnt mean i was a sucker if andy had told you anything of course he did joe think a minute what could you possibly offer a man in taylors position that would reimburse him for the risk of a long prison sentence dont put yourself in his place it doesnt work taylor told us when you offered to cancel the lease on the bower nedry told us about the stunt with the photoelectric cells nedry and blair but that still didnt give us enough you could have had a change of heart with taylor nedry and blair were sore at you he paused one eyebrow raised and i nodded go on give it all to me you already know it joe most of it anyway i was sure that youd loved your wife i knew that if the fire had been set you couldnt have done it since you were out of town that gave us one or rather two possibilities to work on if a crime had been committed carol was involved in it and if you were really covering up for her and we couldnt be sure that you were then you were in on it too and his voice trailed off and he paused again and it seemed as if he was trying not to look at me maybe youd better sit down joe what the hell for i said i can take it i can hand it out and i can ttake it you figured that we must have must have brought in another woman you made up that story about looking for one to see how id take it thats it aint isnt it there wasnt any other woman was there no joe there wasnt when i first gave you the yarn i thought it had struck home but later on that night in my hotel room i wasnt sure in fact id have been willing to bet that you were on the level if you hadnt made that onesided swap with andy taylor jesus i laughed jesus christ i gave you the cards myself if id just sat tight youd never have known about that it wasnt elizabeth he shook his head you dont understand joe waters and clay were your friends they didnt want to tell you something that might hurt your feelings that was in the beginning later on when this nedry and taylor business developed they agreed to keep quiet they were safe enough regardless of how the thing turned out you couldnt blame them for not mentioning a routine measure particularly since id instigated it youre talking a lot i said youre talking a lot and youre not ssaying youre not saying better accept it joe face it and get it over with i i dont know what you must know otherwise wed have arrested you right in the beginning i dont know why she did it i dont know why she came back here and walked into the trap shed helped to set thats something for you to figure out if you havent already got it figured all i can tell you is this joe we identified the body days ago and his voice dropped carol came back from the city alone his hand shot out as i staggered i threw it off carol where is she look on the bed joe he stood aside i looked the haft of the scissors stood out from her breast like an unclasped pin that was all i could see of her the scissors and her breast arched up to meet it she left a note joe a confession she was going to take all the blame on herself i put the screws on her and she told me shed talk to the county attorney i let her come up here to get ready and he broke off watching me if shed told me i said if shed told me yes joe if shed told you shed killed the woman you loved i looked from the bed to him i looked back at the bed i took a step forward would it joe would it have been all right i didnt answer him i couldnt i didnt know the answer until i reached the bed and then i knew but there werent any words left in me it wasnt the way she looked but the way i did because all id ever seen in her was myself the little of myself that was pitying and compassionate and unselfish or whatever you want to call it and now in the ending even that little was gone and all that was left was what i could see here in her eyes dead eyes turning in slightly i shivered and tried to look away i thought they cant hang me im already dead ive been dead a long long time glossary of exhibitor terms bo box office dark not in operation a dark house grindhouse a
