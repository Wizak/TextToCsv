the criminal by jim thompson copyright there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls doing more murders in this loathsome world than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none romeo and juliet act v sc allen talbert it had been a pretty good day in many ways so i might have known it would turn out bad if youve read any papers lately i guess you know that it did its always that way with me it seems like ive never known it to fail ill wake up feeling rested and be able to eat breakfast for a change and maybe ill even get a seat on the into the city and itll go on like that all day no trouble everything rocking along fine my kidneys wont bother me i wont get those crazy headaches up over my eyes then ill come home and somehow or another between the time i get there and the time i go to bed something will happen to spoil it all always anyway it seems like always therell be a dun from the kenton hills sewer district or a gopher will have eaten up what blamed little lawn we have left or martha will break her glasses or something take the night before last for example id had a pretty good day that day as good as any day can be now then after dinner i sit down to read the paper and bingo i hop right back up again marthas glasses were in the chair or rather what was left of em both lenses were broken oh my goodness she said fluttering around and picking up the pieces now how in the world did that happen how did it happen i said how did it happen you leave your glasses in my chair and then you wonder how it happens when they get broken i must have left them on the arm of the chair she said you must have brushed them into the seat when you sat down oh well i needed some new ones anyway i looked at her taking it all so calm and casual and something seemed to snap inside my head i wanted to hurt her to hurt someone and she was the nearest thing at hand so you needed some new ones i said thats all youve got to say you throw fifteen dollars down the drain and it doesnt make any difference to you does it youll never change will you if you werent so scatterbrained if youd kept an eye on bob instead of letting him run wild and do as he pleased he wouldnt have her face went white then red and what about you what kind of a father are you to to her hand went up to her mouth pushing back the words ddont she whispered i i ddont need any glasses i cant read any more anyway i cant all i can think about is oh al al i put my arms around her and she tried to pull away but not very hard and then she buried her face against my shirtfront and she cried and cried i didnt try to stop her i wished i could have cried myself i stood holding her patting her on the head now and then noticing how gray she had gotten it was funny strange i mean you hear about someone turning gray almost overnight and you think oh thats a lot of nonsense it couldnt really happen not to normal people anyway and then it does happen right to your own wife and i dont imagine they come more normal than martha its like it is with bob with bobs trouble you hear about some fifteenyearold boy killing a neighbors girl raping and strangling her and you think well im pretty well off after all my boy may be a little wild but but bob was never really wild he was just all boy i guess just about average but my boy would never do a thing like that that could never happen in our family he your wife couldnt turn gray overnight and your fifteenyearold couldnt do what that other fifteenyearold did the idea is so crazy that well you just laugh when you think about it and then al martha whispered lets move away from here you bet i said well go to work on it tomorrow well move way off somewhere clear to the other side of the country i was just talking of course and she knew it i couldnt start in all over at my age get a job that would support us we dont have any money to move on i had to borrow against the house to pay that lawyer all the equity weve got in it now you could stuff in your ear anyway moving wouldnt do much good because it isnt the other people so much the way they talk and act and the way we imagine they talk and act its not them so much as it is ourselves wondering about it and not being sure sure like youve got to be about a thing like that al martha whispered hhe he didnt do it did he of course he didnt i said its too ridiculous to think about i know he didnt do it al i do too we both know it why he just couldnt i mean why why how could he al i dont know i said i it doesnt matter he didnt so theres no sense wondering about it weve got to stop it martha weve got to stop wondering and talking and and of course dear she said we wont say another word we both know he didnt that he couldnt have why my goodness al how could our bob shut up i said stop it it ended as it usually ends we kept telling each other that he hadnt done it and it was crazy even to think he had finally we went to bed and all night long whenever i woke up i heard her mumbling and tossing and in the morning i caught her looking at me worriedly and she asked me if id slept well so i guess i must have been doing some mumbling and tossing myself well i guess theres no right place to begin this a thing like this it probably starts a long way back before you were ever married probably and ever had a son named bob and maybe you didnt have too much to do with it yourself you didnt have too much control over it you just rock along doing the things you have to and you get kind of startled sometimes when you stand off and look at yourself you think my god that isnt me how did i ever get like that but you go right ahead startled or not hating it or not because you dont actually have much to say about it youre not moving so much as you are being moved maybe im making excuses but what im trying to say is that it might have begun with another person or other people my parents say or their parents or people id never met in my life it i dont know i couldnt say theres no way of telling and one beginning place is probably as good as another so maybe id better lead off with the start i had maybe id better go back to the day it happened the day that had been a pretty good one until it did happen if i start right in with the beginning of the day and follow it on through maybe maybe ill spot something i do that down at the office sometimes down at the henley terrazzo tile company i mean the books will be off a few cents when i try to strike a balance so ill take a new set of transcript sheets and recopy my figures checking them off item by item and sooner or later ill find the error itll pop up at me providing of course that its in that days work well ive told you id had a good nights sleep and a pretty good breakfast bob and i ate together that day and i kind of joked with him a little like i dont often have the time nor the inclination for and afterwards he walked part of the way to the station with me on his way to school it had been a long time since hed done that in fact i couldnt remember when the last time was hed done it it used to be back when he was in the grades wed walk together almost every morning it put him to school earlier than he had to be but he insisted on doing it hed actually get upset if martha let him sleep and id go off without him well though as i say that had been a couple years ago or even longer i guess back in those days up until the time say he was about in the sixth grade he not only walked with me in the morning but hed be at the train to meet me in the evening it seemed hed rather be with me than he would kids his own age quite a few people commented on it i remember marthas mother was visiting us one spring and she couldnt get over it she said shed never seen anyone that was such a daddys boy a very fine woman marthas mother she passed on lets see sixteen months ago next june no fifteen months ago the way i remember the date is that i had the undertaker spread his bill through twelve equal installments and but we dont need to go into that she was a very fine old lady and i was glad to do what i could well as i was saying that was the way bob had used to be back during the war when there was more terrazzo and tile work than you could shake a stick at and your only problem was priorities ill tell you things were a lot different in those days i didnt draw any more salary than i do now but the bonuses almost doubled it i didnt work half so hard and i made almost twice as much as i do these days if wanted to take an afternoon off i took it not very often but henley never let out a peep when i did one time i took a whole day off a friday i had martha and bob meet me in town thursday night and we stayed the whole weekend friday saturday and sunday three days and four nights i got us a couple of connecting rooms at a pretty good hotel but we werent in em much except to sleep at least bob and i werent martha would say you men i just cant keep up with you so wed leave her at the hotel to catch up on her rest and wed go out on the town by ourselves saturday morning we went out by ourselves we went out for breakfast together i bet bob that i could eat more hotcakes than he could and we had three stacks apiece a tie before we called it quits nine hotcakes apiece mind you not to mention the butter and syrup if i did that now it would kill me after breakfast we went to a penny arcade and i bought five dollars worth of change it was noon before wed spent it all so we had a big feed at an italian restaurant and then we strolled around and finally wound up in a shooting gallery i kind of went hog wild in there bob and i were shooting a contest with each other and the first thing i knew id spent twenty dollars it was quite a bit of money even for good times and bob was a little scared when i told him about it gosh he said sort of shakily ill bet mom will be mad ill bet she wont i said not unless shes a mind reader he looked up at me a trifle puzzled and i nodded and gave him the wink then i grinned and after a minute he grinned and that was the end of the matter i didnt need to tell him to keep quiet about the money he caught on right away i maybe shouldnt say it but they didnt make kids sharper than bob well we had a fine time that weekend monday morning i took bob and martha to the station and we had breakfast there before they caught their train martha asked me if i wasnt afraid id be late for work so ill be late i said what of it but wont mr henley say something i hope he does i said he gives me a little trouble and ill tell him where to head in bobs eyes got as big as saucers he looked at me like i was john l sullivan or someone like that i cant put my finger on the exact time when he began to change but it was some time after the war it wasnt much of a change at first hed just kind of avoid me and not have much to say when i was around and when i said something to him he acted like i was picking on him i couldnt say the smallest word to him about why he wasnt doing better in school for petes sake or why he couldnt comb his hair without being told sixteen times without him getting sullen anything i said it was that way he went on like that getting a little more stubborn and mulish it seemed for every inch he grew and then one day a couple years ago just about the time he was thirteen and starting into high school well he changed completely he really didnt seem like bob after that on that day that bob seemed to change id had a pretty rough time of it you probably think theres been plenty of building since the war ended and there has been but its mostly residential stuff and the money just isnt to be made in that kind of work oh you make money sure but its nothing like it was during the war even the commercial stuff you get now is a darned far cry from the governmentcontract jobs you go to a man now and say sure ill do such and such a job for you cost plus ten per cent you say that to him and then youd better start running because hes liable to throw something at you well so business hadnt been anything like it was during the war and it still isnt believe me not in tile and terrazzo anyway and getting along with henley was like trying to get along with a bear with a toothache he was after me every day about something if he wasnt riding me he was watching me looking for something to hop on me about im not exaggerating it was like that and it still is id prepare the bid on a job and possibly wed be low by as little as four cents a square foot just barely low enough to get the job but that wouldnt be good enough for henley id lost the company three and ninetenth cents per to hear him tell it if id been on the beam id have made our bid only a tenth of a cent low well the next job of course id shave it too fine and maybe wed be a nickel high and i guess you know how hed take that id lost him a nice contract if id had any sense id have made the bid low enough to cinch the job so id been getting pretty jumpy and nervous not eating or sleeping much and living mostly on coffee i was about fit to be tied when he wasnt riding me he was watching me staring out into the outer office at the back of my neck and i could just put up with it so long and then my kidneys would start cutting up and id have to go back to the restroom thats the way it always affects me when i get jumpy and nervous i know its just the opposite with some people they get bound up but me it gets my kidneys every time this day im telling you about id been to the restroom three times in less than three hours the third time i came back to my desk henley jerked his head at me i went into his office and maybe my knees werent knocking together but they sure felt like it whats the matter with you he said just like that what do you mean whats the matter i said honestly i didnt know what to say i was too rattled to think what are you chasing all over the office for cant you stay out of that restroom for five minutes how can you ever get any work done if youre never at your desk i manage to get my work done i said i asked you a question he scowled at me you must have been back to the toilet six times in the last half hour i knew there was no use correcting or arguing with him i knew id better think of something fast or id be in big trouble and it was just about the worst time possible for that kind of trouble mother marthas mother that is had been having some pretty hefty doctor bills and it looked like martha was going to need a new upper plate any day it hadnt been much good since shed got it mixed up with the garbage and put it in the incinerator and bob was just getting started in high school bob had gone right from the kenton hills grammar school to kenton hills high school hed gone from grade to grade with the same kids ever since hed started to school and i hated to think of how hed feel if i lost my job and we had to move and he had to start into some strange school with a strange bunch of kids he hadnt been doing too well in school lately as it was it might set him back seriously if he had to make a change now henley was waiting for me to say something he was hoping id tangle myself up give him an excuse to fire me i think he was anyway well he said how about it for gods sake are you deaf and dumb and all of a sudden i had an inspiration no im not deaf and dumb i said looking him straight in the eye and im not blind either huh he grunted what do you mean i mean that restroom was getting to be a kind of play room i said people have been hanging around back there smoking and swapping jokes when they should be out here working im putting a stop to it well say now he leaned back in his chair thats all right al been giving em hell huh they get out fast i said when they see me coming who were they al some of the worst offenders give me their names well i hesitated and i thought about jeff winter and harry ainslee and some of the others that had tried to knife me every time i turned my back one of their favorite tricks was to loaf along until they saw i was tied up on something then spring some deal that had to be settled right away you know trying to make it look like i was slowing down like i was a bottleneck and they couldnt get their jobs done on account of me but i wasnt going to be lowdown just because they were i wouldnt be like them for any amount of money i think ones been about as bad as another i said i wouldnt want to name anyone in particular mmmm uhhuh he nodded well ill tell you what youd better do al you lock the place up and keep the key at your desk make em come to you for it whenever they want to go so thats what i did thats how i squeezed out of one of the tightest places id ever been in and there wasnt anything wrong with it was there after all i was supposed to be in charge of the outer office the men should get permission from me before leaving their work henley didnt ride me about a thing for the rest of the day and he stopped watching me then that night as i was getting ready to leave he called me into his office again been thinking about you al he said looks like youre more on the ball than i thought you were you keep it up and maybe we can boost you to threefifty why thats thats fine i said my salary was three twentysevenfifty a month ill certainly do all i can to deserve it threefifty he said his eyes veiled smiling in a way i didnt understand thats pretty good money for a man your age isnt it well i laughed im not exactly a methuselah mr henley i wont be fortynine until next yeah you dont think it is good money yes sir i mean i was just going to say that yes sir i said you agree youd be damned lucky to get it a man your age id be be darned lucky to get it i said a man my age i went on home not feeling too good although there wasnt any reason why i shouldnt have id done the right thing the only thing i could have done i hadnt hurt anyone and it looked like i might have got myself a raise so everything was all right but i guess i kind of wanted someone to tell me it was we had pickled beets peas and sweet potatoes for dinner that night it seemed that martha had taken the labels off the cans to make some candlestick shades and she didnt know what was in them until she opened them up i said it was a dandy dinner the very things i liked sometimes i forget myself and scold her but i try not to she cant help it you see according to the doctors shes been a little giddy ever since she started going through the change of life maybe even before well so we all started eating and i brought up the matter of the raise in an offhand way i mentioned that first and then i just sort of dragged in the other things the restroom and so on martha said it was wonderful she carried on for a minute or two about how smart i was i guess you showed them she said they have to get up pretty early in the morning to get ahead of my al bob looked down at his plate he didnt eat anything didnt you hear your father martha frowned at him all those people have been picking on him and now hes got them in hot water and maybe hell get a raise besides ill bet he dont said bob well now i said i really didnt get the boys in any trouble nothing like it i simply what makes you think i wont bob nothing he mumbled im not hungry you see i laughed you cant tell me can you if you dont have a reason for a statement you shouldnt make it scuse me he said i dont want anything more to eat he pushed back his chair and started to get up i told him to stay right where he was al said martha nervously if he doesnt want to eat im handling this i said im still head of this family he acts like id he made a certain statement now he can explain himself or hell sit there and eat bob hesitated his head bowed over his plate he picked up his fork and began to eat i dont think im unreasonable i said why my god if id been willing to do the things that some people do i wouldnt have to to worry about a job id be sitting on easy street ill tell you something young man if you had just a few of my problems things i never even mention maybe youd i went on talking to him trying to show him where he was wrong and he was wrong like i say im not unreasonable im not like henley i wasnt just being ornery trying to make him say something he didnt want to just because i was worried and sore at myself im not like that i hadnt done anything to be ashamed of you see bob i said answer me he didnt answer he poked a bite of sweet potato into his mouth and then suddenly he choked and his face went white and he started vomiting thats when he really changed he was never quite the same boy after that allen talbert well here we go again and this time ill try not to ramble all over the reservation i started out to tell you about that day the day it happened ill pick up where i left off with bob walking me part way to the station we were about six blocks from the house almost to the corner where bob had to turn off toward school when a car pulled in at the curb jack eddleman leaned out the window grinning at us what do you say there talberts he called what do you think of the new buggy it looks all right i said bearing down a little on the looks real estate business must be good these days all business is good it just depends on the men that are it is that a fact i said got you that time huh he let out a laugh that jackass bray of his hop in and ill drive you to the station no thanks i said im walking with my son keepin an eye on him huh he laughed again how you getting along with the girls these days bob been under any washing machines lately bob tried to smile he ducked his head and started to turn away i told him to wait i said i had something to say to mt eddleman and i wanted him to hear it then i stepped out to the curb and im telling you maybe that big redfaced loudmouth had never been told off before but he was then i i wonder if youre like i am i mean sometimes i can speak up and lay down the law to people and at others im just as mild as milk ill let them walk all over me it seems like i just cant find the words or the nerve to say anything i remember when martha and i were on our honeymoon wed taken a room american plan at this niagara falls hotel and id had to pay in advance so of course we couldnt move and well this head waiter in the dining room hed treated us like dirt right from the beginning i dont know why wed tipped well and we hadnt demanded any extra service or anything like that i guess he just picked on us because he thought he could get away with it well he did get away with it for a while three no four days it was dinner of the fourth night when i jumped him hed set us down at a little table back near the kitchen and the table cloth may have been white at one time but youd never have known it there was enough catsup and gravy on it to paint a barn door id like another table i said or at least a clean cloth no kidding he said real sarcastically youre pretty hard to please arent you i kicked back my chair and jumped up i shoved my face right up against his youre doggone right im hard to please i said and im pretty hard to get along with when im not pleased so maybe youd better not give me any more trouble just a little more nonsense like youve been pulling i said and im liable to mop up the floor with you now you give us a good table and make it fast and from now on you watch your ps and qs when youre around us well he folded up like an accordion didnt give me a word of back talk he took us to the best table in the dining room and for the next three days youd have thought we were royalty the service we got martha couldnt get over the way id acted she was as proud as punch of me but it startled the daylights out of her my goodness she kept saying i never knew you could be like that al well sometimes i can and sometimes i cant i said i guess i take just so much and then i blow up well as i was saying any other time i might have let jack eddleman get away with it id let him get away with a lot of stuff before this but this time he was picking on the wrong party now ill tell you something jack i said i dont think wed better have any more talk about that washing machine business neither to me or bob or anyone else your daughter came over to our house uninvited she walked right in while mrs talbert and i were away and wandered out into the kitchen where bob was working if shed minded her own business like he was minding his there oh yeah he tried to look tough but his eyes shifted its a darned good thing i looked in your back door if i hadntve come over to borrow a hoe that overgrown youngun of yours would have well i wont say it i think youd better i said i want to hear you say it aw hell he forced a laugh what are we arguing about you know how i am i just like to kid yes i know how you are i said ive had you sized up for a long time you keep riding people making em uncomfortable and the longer they take it the rougher you get then when they call you on it you say youre kidding huh he said look whos talking i dont care whether you look or not i said but youd better remember what i told you he slammed his car into gear and drove off i turned around to bob his shoulders werent sagging now and he was really smiling instead of just trying to he was looking at me like hed used to like he had that monday morning in new york when martha had been afraid id be late for work and id said henley could go jump if he didnt like it gosh he said gollee dad thanks a lot it wasnt anything i said i should have called the big bluffer a long time ago i didnt mean that not just that i mean the way you stuck up for me i see i said i its this way bob im probably overly concerned about you anxious to keep you out of trouble and maybe it appears sometimes that i think you did something that im accusing you when im just trying to protect you i never thought for a minute that there was anything wrong going on between you and josie under that washing machine well gosh he said scuffing the toe of his shoe against the sidewalk darn that old girl anyway you dont have anything more to do with her do you i said huhuh not much of anything anyway i see her at school of course and sometimes a bunch of us will be over to the soda fountain together or something like that but id be pretty careful around her i said its not that i dont trust you but ive seen girls like josie eddleman before they can get a boy into an awful lot of trouble sure dad he said kind of embarrassed i know he went on toward school running to catch up with some other kids i went on to the railroad station and caught the into town wed been neighbors with the eddlemans for almost eleven years they live at canyon drive the far southeast corner overlooking the canyon and we live at which is four doors down the street at the time we moved here there werent any houses between theirs and ours and we got to be pretty good friends bob was less than a year older than josie so naturally they played together and fay eddleman was always trotting across the vacant lots to see martha or vice versa and jack and i saw quite a bit of each other it went on like that for a couple of years and then a house went up between us and we werent quite so thick any more we couldnt be you know and frankly i was just as glad that we couldnt i was glad when the other two vacant lots were built on and we hardly ever saw fay and jack unless we ran into them on the street they just werent the kind of people who wore well you never felt like you could hardly trust em they were always running someone down joking in a way that could hurt and i figured that if they did that with other people they probably did it to us of course the kids went on seeing each other hardly a day passed that bob wasnt over to josies house or josie wasnt over to our place after all theyd practically grown up together and there werent any other children in our block by the time bob was twelve or thirteen he began to lose interest in josie he went over to her house less and less and when she dropped in on us he was just as likely as not to go off and leave her hed go up to the school grounds and play football or maybe hed wander down to the canyon to play tarzan with some other boys or sometimes hed just go up to his room and stay until she left martha scolded him about it not being polite to a guest and i spoke to him a time or two but it didnt seem to have much effect he went right on being indifferent and acting like she wasnt around and i was pretty pleased that he did the more he steered clear of josie eddleman the better it suited me i dont like to sound dirtyminded or suspicious but that girl worried me ive seen grown women who werent nearly as welldeveloped as she was at twelve well one saturday morning about four months ago martha and i walked up to the shopping center after groceries and bob stayed at the house there was a leak around the drain of the washing machine and he was going to fix it he was lying under the machine fitting a new gasket hed cut out of an old shoe when josie came in it was warm weather she was wearing some kind of short pants called pedalpushers and a floweredy thing they call a halter but which is just a brassiere so far as im concerned and that was all aside from some sandals she hunkered down watching him work pretty soon almost before he knew what was happening shed crawled under the machine with him he hadnt asked her to and he was getting along very well by himself but she was going to give him some help well martha and i came in on the tag end of the deal right after jack had looked in the back door and started raising cain and bob and josie were on their feet by that time but i know it must have looked pretty bad even though im sure there wasnt anything in the way of monkey business you take a big boy like bob and a halfnaked girl like josie and squeeze them together between the legs of a washing machine and it just doesnt look good i was pretty excited i guess and i didnt handle the matter very well i bawled bob out and sent him to his room and i suppose i said things to jack that could be construed as an apology i guess i acted like there really was something wrong and it was all bobs fault no i didnt handle it well what i should have done was to tell jack to take that girl home and wallop her backside and see that she stayed at home at least see that she stayed away from our house he knew what she was like as well as i did he didnt want to admit it but he knew it was a pretty blamed good idea to keep an eye on her thats why hed been over slipping around our back yard and looking in our back door hed just made up that story about wanting to borrow a hoe well anyway id told him off this morning and it wasnt as good doing it now as it would have been at the time but better late than never bob had been pleased as could be i felt pretty good about it it looked like i was going to have a mighty fine day with the start id gotten and i did have a fine one right up until the last of it that is id been at work about an hour when a woman phoned in with a complaint the call went to henley first apparently she was a little too hot for him to handle so he switched her to me but stayed in on the line a lot of the tiles in her bathroom were turning brown since it was our subcontract she wanted us to do the job over in fact she was darned well going to make us do it over or take us into court a brandnew house she kept saying a brandnew bathroom and already it looks like some old privy well naturally we werent going to retile the place there just isnt any profit in residential work as it is people only have so much money to spend but they insist on having all kinds of tile if they were smart theyd take less and get a better job but they just wont do that they just wont understand that you cant get something for nothing a tile contractor comes along say and he says why yes lady i can give you a fivefoot border there on the walls and ill give you a threecolor terrazzo mosaic for the floor and ill keep the job under three hundred then you come along and you say why no i couldnt do that id have to substitute quantity for quality but i can give you a firstclass fourfoot border and a firstclass plain block floor for three hundred and you know who will get the job theyll pick the first man every time so you have to cut corners if you want to stay in business you use cheaper materials and you push the men as hard as theyll be pushed and whenever the union will let you get away with it you sneak in apprentices instead of using journeymen naturally the work wont hold up although some jobs hold up longer than others it just isnt quality i let this woman rave on a while working the mad out of her system and finally i cut in on her i wanted to ask you madam i said were you out around the job any while the house was being built well did you notice whether any of the plasterers were chewing tobacco why well yes she said whats that got to do with it tile is highly absorbent i explained it has a suction action on anything it comes into contact with if you happen to have one left over from the job you can prove it to yourself put the back of it down in some coffee grounds say before long a brown stain will show through the glaze now i imagine one of the plasterers must have spit into his mortar and the majority well at least a lot of plasterers do chew tobacco its hard for them to smoke in their line of work so they chew instead and the way most women feel about chewing tobacco and the men who chew it it was easy for this one to believe that her gripe was against the plastering contractor rather than us she wouldnt get any satisfaction out of him of course no plasterer in his right mind would spit tobacco juice into his mortar and they arent paying crazy men thirty dollars a day but id got her off our backs i hung up the receiver turning around to look at henley as he hung up his he grinned and waved his hand at me early that afternoon as soon as i got the routine stuff out of the way i unlocked the private file and took out the drawings the blueprints on the new city stadium we werent supposed to have detail drawings naturally until the job was put up for bid but one of the draftsmen in the architects office had sneaked us out a set for a hundred and fifty dollars i went over them carefully like id been going over them for the past ten days trying to figure out a way of using the edge they gave us finally along around quitting time i found it i carried the drawings in to henleys office and spread them out in front of him ive been studying these tunnels i said tracing them out with a pencil theyre going to be subjected to unusually heavy wear i think they ought to have something unusually durable in the way of tile yeah he shrugged irritably the architect dont think so wouldnt cut much ice for us if he did unusually durable i repeated giving him a slow wink an extraheavy imported italian yeah but his eyes widened suddenly and he let out a grunt then he leaned back in his chair pursing out his lips uh huh he said were you thinking about a certain tile that a certain contractor named henley got stuck with that hes got almost a warehouse full of stuff that the government cancelled out on because a lighter tile does the job just as good thats it i said i was thinking that outside of our supply there probably isnt a hundred square feet of it in the country by george he slapped his hand down on the desk i doubt like hell that you can get it anywhere they just dont make it any more if we could get that written into the specifications i dont think we can i said wed have to work through the building department get them to write a proviso into the code to fit the situation no one could kick about it its an unusual type of building and the code could logically be amended to take care of it yeah i guess we could get away with it all right but that building department it really costs when you buy something from those boys whats the difference i said if no one else can bid on the job we can set our own price well by god he said we can al this calls for a drink he made me sit down and got a bottle out of his desk we sat there drinking and talking until quitting time you know al he said you know what im going to do if this goes over all right im going to retile the bathroom for that woman who called this morning ill bet shed appreciate it i said heres the way i see it he went on theres no percentage in this penny ante stuff keeping people locked out of the restroom or chiseling someone on a twobyfour residential job youre worried and you figure everyones out to do you so you do them first but it does something to you know what i mean you lose more than you make i guess youre right about that i said unlock that damned restroom tomorrow will you throw the key away why good god al what are we coming to when a man has to get permission to go to the toilet its cheap degrading a man who would put up with it long isnt worth having i dont know why in the world i ever he shook his head pausing to pour us a drink he looked up at me and shook his head again you know what i always liked about you al character a man may not have too much of it himself but he likes to see it in other people yes sir that was it al character the guts to stand up and speak out i liked that well thanks very much i said i guess none of us is everything we should be but i do the best i can by the way i was going to ask if uh about that raise character its something you dont find very often al and when you lose it its gone for good youre just one more animal in the herd raise we were talking about it a while back i said putting me up to threefifty i dont want any credit for doing what im paid to do doing my job but i did think of the angle on this city stadium deal and im giving you credit for it al full credit he said well keep thinking about the raise it was after five and everyone but us had left i let him out of the office and then i locked up and started home all and all it had been a good day pretty good that is martha talbert well actually i honestly thought i was going to fly to pieces the one morning when i simply couldnt let myself get unnerved i was hoping i could get al out of the house before bob came down and i did everything but shove him out the door but no it was no use he had to choose that morning to take his time and bob had to choose that one to hurry so they were both at the breakfast table at the same time and goodness i cant tell you what it did to my nerves its bad enough at other meals but breakfast honestly i thought i was going to go crazy and me in my change of life they seemed to be getting along all right but i knew it couldnt last i knew that sooner or later al would say something sharp to bob and bob would say something back or he wouldnt say anything which always makes al worse than when bob does say something so i waited for it to happen i hovered around them smiling and trying to talk and generally acting like a gonmolian idiot or whatever you call them i wished it would happen so they could just get it over with and i wouldnt have to wait any more i actually think sometimes that the waiting is worse than the other well they finally finished breakfast thank goodness and if theyd taken another five minutes id have been in hysterics al asked me if i was feeling well when he kissed me goodbye and bob said gee mom why dont you lie down a while and i dont remember what i said but it was probably something silly i felt like a balloon all swelled up and getting bigger and bigger every moment i thought i was going to explode they went off down the street together talking just as pleasantly as you please and i could feel the blood rushing into my face and i felt like i was choking i dont think ive ever been so angry in my life ill tell you if i could have got my hands on those two right then idve shook em until their teeth rattled i mean well here theyd put me through all that strain and then they hadnt done anything theyd theyd oh well whats the use talking about it i peeked out through the living room drapes watching them until they were out of sight and then i just fell down on the lounge and started bawling actually youd have thought id been killed the way i was bawling so finally i looked up into the hall mirror and my eyes were all red and my nose looked like a tomato or something and i stopped crying and began to laugh and then i felt a lot better i went out into the kitchen and had a cup of coffee i started to fix myself a bite of breakfast because i was feeling a little hungry now and right away i broke a whole dozen eggs i dont know why al does things like that for a man whos supposed to be smart and of course he is smart he can do some of the foolishest things now he knows that i always put the egg carton right on the edge of the top refrigerator shelf that way you know i know it wont take much for them to fall out so i watch them to see that they wont fall out but what does he do but come along and stick them way back to the rear on the bottom shelf and naturally i cant imagine what in the world i cant see them anywhere so i began pulling shelves out right and left and oops there went the eggs all over the floor i dont know why al does those things fortunately id mopped late the night before so i scraped the eggs up into a bowl and got the shells out of them i felt quite well by the time id finished it always makes me feel better to break something and this solved the dinner problem wed just have a nice dish of scrambled eggs i had a piece of toast and some more coffee and got dressed i took another look at the letter from miss brundage and then i tore it up and flushed it down the toilet miss brundage was bobs homeroom teacher and it seemed to me that if she did her job and minded her own business she wouldnt have so much time to write letters to parents naturally i didnt tell al about the letter he fusses at bob enough as it is and i didnt say anything to bob about it it wasnt necessary if a mother doesnt know her own son who does some teacher a miss someone thats never had a child in her life well of course she may have had some for all i know she probably should have had some these women that go on year after year staying single and dodging their responsibilities and putting almost everything they make on their backs well ive got some ideas about them they may think theyre fooling people but they dont fool me im not saying she is that way mind you i dont believe in making judgments on people until i know all the facts but it certainly seems strange anyway people that are always so anxious to criticize someone else shouldnt complain when people criticize them judge not lest you be judged i always say well i wore my black and green plaid and that yellow short coat and i guess it does make me look like a checkerboard inside of a banana skin but i just couldnt help it i imagine i look quite as well as most women my age as long as youre clean and neat and respectable thats what counts i dont know why in the world i ever bought the darned things so finally i left the house and i dont know yet how i made it after everything that had happened to me but i did though what a morning and of course the first thing i saw was fay eddleman out on the walk in front of their place honestly i dont know why she just doesnt set up a tent out there and live in it i dont know how she ever gets her housework done why ive watched her all morning or all afternoon sometimes just to see if she ever did go in and she never did shed just go in to eat or something and then shed rush right back out again ive watched her and i know first the milkman comes by and he has to stop and talk and then its the bakeryman and the mailman and the garbage man and oh i dont know what all anything that wears pants and they cant get away from her shell stand there and shell talk and shell talk and i wouldnt want to say anything definite but i just wish i could read lips sometimes anyone that acts like she does theres something funny going on if the weather isnt forty below zero or something shell wear some kind of shorts or slacks just as tight as she can get em and those sweaters she wears i think she must have to grease herself to get them on but whatever shes wearing it doesnt make much difference she still doesnt look like she had anything on she knows it too and dont you think she doesnt its deliberate shell stand out there with that reddish brown hair blowing all over her face and shell look up at someone a man of course with those reddish brown eyes and shell say something and then shell wiggle giggle and wiggle all over shell pull her chin down into her bosom and shell roll her eyes up at this man and say something and then hell say something and shell wiggle wiggle and giggle and it actually makes you blush to watch her well she waited until i was almost on top of her and then she acted like shed just then seen me why martha she said of all things darling where in the world have you been keeping yourself i pretended like id just seen her too goodness i said is that really you fay oh ive just been busy around the house you know how it is when you have to take care of a family yeah she said dont i though it doesnt leave you much time for yourself i said i dont think ive been out of the house in weeks you should get out more martha she said i think it ages a woman to stick in the house all the time i suppose it does i said but if a woman is a woman why shouldnt she look like one i think theres nothing more ridiculous than to see some middleaged woman trying to get herself up like a teenager i smiled at her staring right at the front of that overstuffed sweater and then taking a slow look down at those skin tight slacks that reminds me i said ive simply got to get some new washing powder the one im using just shrinks everything i have but darling she said you dont mean youve been washing that perfectly adorable dress and here i thought youd just put on a little weight she smiled at me staring at my dress as though shed never seen one before i could understand that naturally itd been so long since she wore a dress that shed forgotten what they looked like were you going up to the school she said i do hope bob isnt in trouble again trouble i said no thats the advantage of having a boy you never have any trouble with them im just walking up to the shopping center for a while ill bet youre going to get a permanent she said why dont you wait until it gets cold martha perhaps your hair will thicken up then and itll take better no i dont think ill get any more permanents i said you go in those places and you get the same operators whove been dyeing some old bags hair and then they go right to work on you like the last time remember no i guess we didnt go together you were leaving the shop just as i came in anyway theyd just finished dyeing this womans hair whoever she was and i got the same operatot and my goodness fay stink it took me days to get that awful smell out of my hair i suppose its all in what youre used to she said i remember we had an old negro woman working for us years ago so naturally she used a black dye and do you know martha she couldnt stand the smell of red of any other color well i said i guess id better be getting along it was certainly nice to see you again fay you havent seen anything of josie have you she said she had a sore throat so i let her stay home from school today and the minute i turn my back she chases off somewhere oh thats terrible i said shes liable to get pneumonia running around without any clothes on shes got clothes on fay got a little red in the face a kid doesnt need to be bundled up like an eskimo on a nice fall day well id be awfully careful with her i said a person with a large uh chest like that they catch pneumonia very easily why didnt bob go to school today she said i wonder if he could have seen anything of josie bob did go to school today i said and im quite sure he wouldnt have seen anything of josie if he hadnt gone well he didnt pass by here she said im sure i couldnt have missed him he went the other way i said like he used to he wanted to walk part way to the train with his father well i kind of wondered she said i caught a glimpse of someone down in the canyon a while ago in a blue and white jacket theres lots of blue and white jackets i said she shook her head absently peering up and down the street that girl she said now where could she have gone to i started to give her some ideas on the subject but oh well when someones worried about a child you just dont do those things maybe she decided to go on to school after all i said do you suppose shedve done that just gone on without saying anything well now ill bet thats just what she did fay said she must have and here ive been worrying my head off about her why dont you call the school and make sure i said oh i guess i wont she said im sure she went the darned crazy kid shed be mad if i called there and had them check on her shed say why mother you ought tove known and so on and she probably wouldnt speak to me for the next week i know what you mean i said i know exactly what you mean fay you do or say some little thing around bobjust doing what a parent should do you know and he acts like youre public enemy number one or something ill tell you martha she said if id cut up and talked back to my mother like josie does to and my mother i said why fay it just simply never would have occurred to me to behave around my mother like bob martha she said what about some coffee ive got some of those nice fresh pecan rolls you always used to like so much why id love to i said well i went in and we had coffee and rolls and a nice little talk fay can be a very nice person when she wants to and id be the first to admit it it was almost noon before i remembered that i was supposed to have seen miss brundage at eleven i jumped up and said i simply had to go and fay said oh why didnt i let the shopping go until tomorrow but i guess she knew where i was really going so she just argued enough to be polite as i say fay can be nice i hurried on toward the school and even if i was late for my appointment i cant say when ive felt so good you wouldnt have thought i was the same woman that had been all flytopieces a couple of hours ago its like that with me bad beginning good ending foul start fine finish its almost always like that with me martha talbert i reached the school just as the noon bells were ringing and if i didnt look a fright it wasnt my fault id practically galloped every step of the way from fays house because theres just no sense in people being late for appointments and i never am when i can possibly avoid it well as i was saying i know i must have looked a fright what with all that running and then having to climb three flights of stairs and squeezing past eight or nine hundred kids who were trying to beat each other to the cafeteria but that certainly didnt give miss brundage any right to act like i was something the cat dragged in she was coming out of her classroom bobs home room as i started in and she kept right on coming out barely nodding to me kind of pushing me out of her way im very sorry you couldnt keep our appointment mrs talbert she said im afraid that unless you can wait until after three wait until after three i said why of course i cant perhaps wed better make it tomorrow then between eleven and twelve i believe i explained didnt i that it was the only hour of the day i had free well of all things i said youre free now arent you you dont have anything to do now that i can see yes she said i do have something to do now i have to eat my lunch she gave me a cool little nod and started down the hall and honestly it was all i could do not to grab her and shake her right out of her dress really you know youd have thought she was the president of the united states or something and i was idontknowwhat and just what was all the fuss about pray tell it was my lunch hour too wasnt it i hadnt had any lunch yet either and you didnt see me acting like the world was going to come to an end if i didnt eat right that minute now just a minute miss brundage i said and i ran and caught up with her if you please miss brundage you asked me to come here today and i came and now that im here im our appointment was at eleven mrs talbert im sure i explained well i couldnt get here at eleven i said i got here just as fast as i could and i almost broke my neck doing it i thought it was something very very important the way you acted and if id known it wasnt anything that really mattered that you didnt want to bother with until you could take your own sweet time about it well believe me i had plenty of other things i could do im not like some of you young girls with nothing to think about but getting your lunch on time and how you can doll yourselves all up like the president of the united states or something i tell you teachers werent like that in my day they knew how to handle their jobs and they werent always calling parents up every five minutes and writing notes and i laid it into her i told that young lady a few things shed be a long time forgetting she stood staring at me her mouth opening and closing her face getting redder and redder all right she said finally her voice so low i could hardly hear it ill be very happy to talk to you now i have a feeling that in view of your opinion of me there isnt a great deal to be said but go on i said whats bob supposed to have done now its more what he hasnt done mrs talbert hes done almost no work since the term started hes failing in every one of his subjects why i well why do you let him i said hes a smart boy why dont you see that he studies mrs talbert she said the teachers in this school have an average class load of sixty students approximately twice the number they should have we cant spend all our time with one pupil or even a very large part of our time well goodness i said no one asked you to you dont have to if you know your business why when i was in school there was only one teacher for six grades and she no doubt she said im sure she was much more efficient than we teachers are now to get back to the present however robert is failing in his work and we dont seem to be able to help him we wondered whether there wasnt something you and mr talbert could do well i dont know i said well certainly do anything we can ill give bob a good talking to and he seems to be very preoccupied and moody is there uh a situation at home which might tend to disturb him why of course there isnt i said if theres anything wrong anywhere its right here at school and if you ask me you dont have to look very far to see what it is she pressed her lips together mrs talbert she said im only trying to help well dont trouble yourself i said we dont need any advice about how to run our family what else is bob supposed to have done hes supposed she said to attend school five days a week five days mrs talbert not two or three well i said he does doesnt he i mean i know hes been sick a lot but he has been sick then mrs talbert there was a mean funny little grin on her face you did write the excuses he brought us why well naturally i said when hes sick and has to stay at home i write an excuse i see she said that little grin getting meaner and tighter well why dont we do this mrs talbert why dont you and i and bob all get together and see if we cant talk this thing out i said that suited me just fine the sooner the better of course i wouldnt think of asking you to miss your lunch miss brundage but ive already missed it she said im afraid its too late to eat now so if youd like to telephone home and summon robert from his sickbed perhaps we can talk a few minutes before my afternoon classes start i didnt understand what she meant for a moment it simply hadnt occurred to me that bob hadnt gone to school and the way shed led me on tricking me into making a fool of myself well i felt like choking her well she said would you like to do that mrs talbert no i said and believe me if looks could have kified that young woman would have been dead no i would not like to do that miss brundage but theres something i would like to do id like to know why we have to pay big taxes without getting anything for it but some snotty young girl to insult us id like to know why we cant get teachers who think about something besides powdering their noses and putting every nickel they make on their backs and mrs talbert she said mrs talbert well what i said you dont need to yell at me im a teacher mrs talbert not a prison warden i cant compel robert to study and i cant keep him from playing truant but i can and i will if you persist in your present attitude i can and will see that action is taken by the proper authorities well well i said now let me tell you something miss highandmighty my husband and i there are compulsory attendance laws in this state mrs talbert a parent who willfully allows a child to remain out of school is subject to heavy penalties and wouldnt you love that i said yes she nodded slowly i believe i would she turned and walked away then and it was a good thing for her that she did i started after her but then i thought oh well whats the use anyone like that its a waste of breath to talk to em i left the school and walked back to the shopping center i tried on a few pair of shoes and two coats and several hats and got a book from the lending library then i went into the drug store and ordered some pie and a cup of coffee i wasnt at all hungry really even though i hadnt had hardly a bite to eat all day but the lady sitting next to me she was having an olivenut tripledeck with cream cheese and it looked so good i decided to have one too and somehow this lady and i got to talking she was telling me about a perfectly marvelous diet shed been on and we had some more coffee and a chocolate sundae apiece and the first thing we knew it was almost three oclock i started home getting some milk and bread from the grocery first i was almost there when lo and behold who should pop up in front of me suddenly but mr bob talbert we saw each other at the same time and did that young man look sheepish then he put on a grin and tried to act like he was just getting home from school hi mom he said let me carry that stuff for you oh i wouldnt think of it i said after all youve been studying all day bending over your books until youre all worn out you oh bob how could you arent you ever going to straighten up and behave like a boy should im sorry he mumbled i wont do it any more mom well i should hope not i said where on earth did you go anyway where have you been out to the golf links i was going to caddy gget some money to buy dad a present i looked at him honestly you know sometimes youd think that boy didnt have a brain in his head buy him a present i said what in the world for its not his birthday or anything i just wanted to he muttered i dont know why well you certainly put me in a pretty pickle i said i went up to see your teacher and naturally i supposed you were there what in the world would i be supposed to suppose and she and i started going around and around and aw mom he said for gosh sake whatd you do that for shes miss brundages the only one up there thats got any sense or ever acts halfway decent and you have to well for pitys sake i said you make a fool out of me with your hookyplaying and then its my fault im in the wrong well gosh he said gee whiz mom i told him hed better gosh and geewhiz and hed better start studying and stop playing truant or hed wish he had the idea just wandering off wherever you please and whenever you please did you make any money huhuh he shook his head without looking at me too many other caddies around not enough people playing well thats nice isnt it i said you lay out of school all day and walk eight or ten miles just as if shoe leather didnt cost anything and you dont have a nickel to show for it thats certainly smart that is well all right he said all right i said i wouldnt do it any more didnt i you just bet you wont i said now hush up that yelling before mrs eddleman hears you hush up and act like youve got some sense for a change fay was out in front of her house of course when was she ever any other place she said hi martha bob did you see josie at school today bob huh bob stared at her like a big goop like he wanted her to know hed been playing hooky whatd you say miz eddleman i asked you if youd seen jo the cats got his tongue fay i laughed he always gets that way whenever anyone mentions josie he saw her all right i just got through asking him myself arent kids funny fay laughed too well i guess shell be along pretty soon its still early yet bob and i went on home i knew he must be halfstarved so i told him to run up and wash real quick and id fix him a sandwich and a glass of milk im not very hungry he said id just as soon wait until dinner time i i think ill take a bath mom bath i said are my ears deceiving me youre going to take a bath without being bob i said come here a minute whats that what in the world have you got on the front of your pants nothin he mumbled kind of putting his hands in front of himself i just well i was straddling a fence on the way to the golf course and i guess i must have scratched myself a little well i should think you did i said now those pants will have to go to the cleaners and youve probably got blood all over your underwear and it was just too much for one day you know a person can just take so much and thats all they can take i sat down on the lounge and began to bawl please mom he said im sorry and i ppromise i wont oh go on i said go on and get your bath and be sure you soak good and use plenty of hot water well be lucky if you dont get lockjaw he went on up the stairs and pretty soon i heard water running in the tub i closed my eyes and lay back listening to it and it was kind of peaceful and i guess i must have been extremely tired because the first thing i knew id gone to sleep i mean i didnt know it when i went to sleep of course but when i woke up i knew id been asleep it was practically dark id been asleep for more than two hours i could hear bob moving around in the bathroom he was still up there after all this time and that was all wrong of course youd have to know bob to know how crazy it was but there was something else wrong too i could feel it inside of me and it made me all sick and kind of shaky i went to the door it was like something was drawing me to it and stepped out on the porch fay eddleman was out on her walk and jack her husband was there too he had his arms around her and you couldnt see her face just his and it was as white as a sheet he looked as sick as i felt there were a couple of other men standing off a little to one side policemen i guessed though they didnt have on uniforms and there was a police car drawn up at the curb i thought now what in the world but i didnt really wonder somehow i knew what was wrong not exactly you know but close enough i stood and looked at them and finally i made myself look away i turned and looked up the street and i saw al coming he was walking so slow like he hated every step he took so i guess he must have known too one of the policemen said something to jack and he glanced up and nodded then they started down the walk toward al robert talbert i dont know why why does everyone always want to know why anyway gosh if you always stop to wonder why every time you turn around you never get anything done all i know is that i wanted to buy him a present so instead of going on to school i cut back to the canyon and started for the golf course that was all there was to it i went down the side of the canyon and walked up that little creek that runs right through the center of it until i came to the railroad trestle then i reached up and got ahold of a brace and started to swing across well it wasnt my fault because heck i reckon i must have done the same thing a hundred times and i bet i could do it in my sleep if i had to but some way or another well maybe the dew had made it slick my hand slipped and i threw myself back real fast but one foot went into the water clear up to my ankle well i kind of cussed and then i laughed about it because the way i was feeling it would take a lot more than that to make me sore dad had been so nice and everything and i was going to buy him a nice little present and if everything went all right well id kind of have a little talk with him like wed used to have id get all the load off my mind about laying out of school and everything else id been doing and hed say well son its never too late to turn over a new leaf and i know youre going to do better from now on and well thats the way it would be i could get out from under that load and boy it was a load i took my shoe off and shook the water out of it then i wrung my sock out and hung it up on a bush to dry i had plenty of time i could make it to the golf course in an hour easy get in twentyseven or maybe thirtysix holes if i got the breaks i hoped this wouldnt be one of those crummy days when there were maybe eightyfour caddies for every bag and i thought by gosh it better not be not today by golly but i was feeling too good to worry about it i lay back on my back with my eyes closed kind of daydreaming about how i was going to do and how things were going to be from now on and i thought i heard something behind me a kind of rustling and a twig cracking now and then but i didnt pay any attention to it i didnt have any idea she was within a million miles of me until she started running her fingers through my hair i jumped and sat up she laughed her head kind of cocked on one side she was right up against me almost stooped down on her knees i had to move away before i could sit up good what the heck are you doing here i said why arent you in school ive got a cold she said why arent you in school i suppose youre going to tell i said well go ahead and see if i care huhuh she shook her head i wouldnt tell on you bobbie no matter what you did well go ahead i said it dont make any difference to me what you do i reached up and got my sock off the bush it felt pretty dry so i started to put it on she took it out of my hand not snatching or anything but just sort of gentle and natural like and hung it back up again you want to catch cold mmm she said now you just leave that right there until i tell you to put it on aw heck i said what do you care who asked you to come down here tellin me what to do well its a very good thing for you i did she said you certainly need someone to look after you i said she was crazy just about a hundred times craziern any two people in the whole world ill bet your mother doesnt know where you are ill bet you slipped off without telling her anything ill bet she doesnt know i copped her cigarettes either she nodded you want a cigarette bobbie she had on some kind of funny looking shorts not real short you know but the kind girls wear to ride bicydes and stuff like that she had on that them and one of those tight goofylooking blouses like her mothers always wearing and a little buttonup sweater that was kind of like her mothers too she had the sweater hung around her shoulders instead of wearing it like anyone with some sense would and the sleeves kept getting in the way when she tried to get the cigarettes and matches out of her blouse pockets well bobbie she said finally kind of pouting like it was my fault arent you going to help me so i said she was crazy again but i got the stuff out of her pockets and she sort of stuck herself out so i could get to em and gosh i mean well it was the craziest feeling me fumbling around in that goofylooking blouse and her all arched out at me and and everything i took a cigarette and she took one and i held a match for us i threw the cigarettes and matches back in her lap well i said i got to be moving on pretty quick ive got plenty of things to do today mmm she said settling back on one elbow going out to the golf links i said pick myself up a few fast bucks mmm she blew out smoke lazylike so thats where you go when you play hooky so much i dont always i said i get a few bucks ahead i go into town i saved up almost ten bucks once and boy did i have myself a time i ate lunch there in the station restaurant and then i went to the penny arcade and a shooting gallery and another restaurant and all to heck around mmm she said you awful bad boy you well heck i said it doesnt sound like much fun but it was she squeezed her cigarette out and lay back one arm folded under her head she smiled at me and kind of patted the ground at her side so i lay back too it was a lot more comfortable that way and i guess id kind of been wanting to see her i guess id kind of missed her i dont mean i liked her or anything like that but you get used to someone theyre always around and then suddenly they arent and you cant help missing them we just sort of lay there and well somehow or another her hand was in mine but it didnt mean anything i mean it really didnt why gosh shed always been tagging around after me as far back as i could remember and id hold onto her hand to keep her from falling or to help her over something and maybe we hadnt held hands in a long time but it seemed natural enough like it ought to be you know just there by ourselves lying there and talking it was all right bobbie she said yeah i said do you remember how we used to play together all day and then when i had to go home or you had to go home wed wed kiss each other goodbye heck i said yeah i guess so how long ago has it been bobbie since you kissed me how do i know i said for gosh sake josie well she said if youre going to get mad every time i say anything maybe id better go go ahead i said youre the one thats mad all i said was i didnt remember you are too mad she said i can always tell when you are and i guess i dont know when i am i said thats pretty rich that is you cant look me in the eye and say youre not mad she said i could if i wanted to i said for gosh sake josie why do you got to keep jabbering and fussing about you cant do it she said i dare you to well i wasnt taking any dare from her not any crazy old girl like that so i rolled over sort of and looked at her and said i wasnt mad i said it a couple of times looking right at her almost but of course that wasnt good enough for her youre mad all right she said i can tell if you werent well you know what youd do for gosh sake josie i said well you would she said oh bbobbie whats the matter wwith and then i hadnt done a darned thing not a doggone thing but she began to cry she kind of cried but not too much and she sort of held her arms out so well you know i kissed her and she kissed me and she kept her arms around me when i started to move away i could feel her like i had when id got the cigarettes and matches only i felt her more and i thought about dad and what hed said but i couldnt pull away she held onto me with our faces pressed together and she kissed me on the ear a few times and i guess i did too i mean i kissed her on the ear and now and then we kind of whispered things bobbie yeah this is kind of like that day over at your house isnt it when daddy raised all that big fuss over nothing we werent doing anything i said we werent doing a darned thing hes crazy she said anyway well even if we had been what difference would itve made he does it he and mama if its so bad why josie i said for gosh sake are you crazy you know good and well thats well its not the same she said all right if that was the way i felt if i was going to get mad every time she opened her mouth so i said what the heck was wrong with her who was getting mad and i kissed her again to prove that i wasnt bobbie did you ever she said huhuh i said if i promise youll never tell anyone if i tell you something well sure i said she hesitated then she put her mouth real close to my ear and whispered aw i said youre kidding all right she said i dont care if you dont believe me i swallowed my mouth seemed kind of all full of spit all of a sudden wwho when josie last summer when i was going into town one saturday i was almost to the station and this man i dont know who he was but anyway he had a big car and he asked me if i didnt want a ride so gosh i said you hadnt ought tove gone with him josie he why he might have been crazy or somethin and pooh she shrugged people just make those stories up to scare their kids the heck they do i said you read about guys like that in the newspapers all the time they get a girl in their car and then they after theyve done it they get scared and they well youve read about em yourself josie well she shrugged again well anyway i did he did it to me i didnt say anything i couldnt right then because i had to keep swallowing he was sort of playing around she said and after a while he drove off the highway and pulled up behind a big sign board hhe she shivered and pulled me closer it hurt awful bobbie gosh i said for gosh sake josie i i thought i was going to bleed all over everything even the second time when well you know i shouldnt have i swallowed again hard and she ran her hand through my hair then she took her hand away and i could feel her fumbling for something down in her pants pocket she found it finally the thing she was looking for and squeezed it into my hand bbobbie you know what that is yeah i guess so i said i copped it out of mama and daddys bedroom i are they all alike bobbie i mean will they fit anyone i guess so i said gosh how do i know i guess they will would they you w would that one i josie i said josie what ddo you wait she said wait a minute bobbie someone might see us here she pushed me away and stood up and then she looked down at me kind of drowsylike her eyes narrowed and held her hand out to me i stood up and we went back toward the cliff a little ways where some bushes grew out of the base of it and there was a kind of little cave i got down on my knees and spread her sweater on the ground and it was like a dream me with that thing still clenched in my hand and her getting down on the sweater and lying back it didnt seem real at all and my head was pounding like sixty and i was so choked up i could hardly breathe i sort of turned my back so she couldnt see when i put the thing on and my hands kept fumbling and jumping but finally i did it i turned back around and there she was just taking her time like it wasnt anything unzipping the side of those goofylooking shorts and pulling the blouse up out of them unbuttoning it and turning it back and i was down on the ground with her hugging and kissing and bobbie she said kind of madlaughing now wait a minute silly jjosie i said ffor gggosh you hear me bobbie im going to be mad now yyoull please bobbie wwait we ccant you cant do it that bobbie so we did it and she didnt seem mad then but afterwards she was she said just to look at her and how could she go home with blood on her and it was all my fault and she had a good notion to tell her mother id made her im sorry josie i said for gosh sake i didnt mean to how many times i got to tell you that a lot of good that does she said its all your fault well youd better not blame it on me i said youd better not go blabbing to your folks about me ho ho she said well i know i got to do something you certainly cant expect me to take all the blame i began to get scared i thought about dad and the time jack eddleman had raised such a fuss and now well now there was really something to fuss about and if he acted that way then what would he do now i could wash them out for you in the creek i said you want me to do that josie pooh she jerked away from me cold water and no soap a lot of good that would do well i said well uh well maybe well go on and say it she said if youve got anything to say say it im trying to aint i i said what do you think im trying to do anyway shut up a minute for gosh sake and give me a chance well go on she said and dont you dare tell me to shut up mr bobbie talbert maybe well maybe i said you could kind of sneak up behind those bushes at the top of the cliff and when you see your mother talking to someone you could slip around the block and come up the alley to your house and get into some other clothes and what would i do with these she said and then she said well i guess i could i could spill ink on them or something and put them in the dirty clothes and maybe well i guess that would be all right will you josie i said will you do that maybe promise i said maybe i will if i can but why the heck cant you i said i told you just how to do it and you said you could so whats the maybe about she shrugged looking at me out of the corner of her eyes and i knew she would do it she just had to and she knew it as well as i did so why wouldnt she promise i guessed she must have been sore and not entirely because of her clothes she felt like i did now i guessed kind of sore and mean and tired and dirtyfeeling it was funny how you could feel one way a couple minutes before and then just the opposite now i felt just as crummy as she did only i couldnt act like she did i had to go on coaxing and begging her to promise look at me josie i said i got some on my clothes too and im not mad i dont try to make you feel bad about it oh pooh she said its different with a boy anyway its all your fault you dont have any right to be mad you wouldnt youll do it like i said wont you josie i said wont you josie i said i would maybe no maybe darn it youve got to promise maybe i said maybe and i mean maybe she said she gave me another of those looks out of the corner of her eyes and i knew she was just being spitey she just had to do it doggone it but well what if she didnt a crazy old girl like that there was no telling what she might do i began to get scareder scareder and sorer all at once i grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her ill show you i said doggone you you promise or ill ill pooh hoho she said just what will you do anyway youll see you better promise i said promise maybe she said thats what i promise maybe maybe maybe maybe may bobbie ddont donald skysmith that was the morning after the stars quarterly report came out and it had been a honey circulation up thirty thousand over the previous quarter advertising up fortythree thousand lines with a report like that under my belt it was just about the last morning in the world i expected an asseating from the captain but he was already on the phone when i hit the office and it wasnt to hand me a bouquet he kept on talking to the operator after i picked up the receiver and said hello now youre quite sure of that miss he was saying youre positive we still have a managing editor mr skysmith is still with us yes sir she giggled hhes tee hee hes on the wire now sir the stupid silly bitch boy maybe she thought that was an ass in her girdle but shed find out it was pure mud from now on and id make her know it youre positve the captain said it isnt someone posing as mr skysmith he has all the proper credentials no sir i mean yes sir hes hee hee hee the goddamned rotten stinking little bitch laughing at me because i was getting the razz and thinking she could get away with it thinking by god id take it from every goddamned pissant in the plant just because i had to take it from that goddamned driedup bastardly sonofabitching old fascist i made a fast shuffle through the clips on my desk those from the opposition papers and those from ours i couldnt see where wed missed a thing we had everything the opposition had and we had it better and more of it well the captain said as long as youre positive miss don how are you this fine morning how was i how the hell would i be fine sir i said as the operator went off the wire how are you captain wonderful he said i tell you don theres nothing like this mountain air youll have to come up some time thank you sir i said id like that very much and i closed my eyes thinking oh you sonofabitch you dont know just how much id like to i could picture myself up there in that castle creeping into his room with its big twelvebytwelve bed it would be loaded down with teletype ifimsies and probably if you dug deep enough youd turn up every whore west of the mississippi but to hell with them id burn them all up together id say i got something hot for you captain and then out with the good old gasoline and a handful of matches and don he said ive been very much worried about teddy how is she getting along wha i squeezed my eyes open and unclenched my teeth why all right i hope captain the doctors arent very committal but they believe the malignancy was confined to the left breast its largely a matter now of wait and see terrible he clicked his tongue so young so beautiful a terrible terrible thing you bastard oh you sonofabitch yes sir i said shes suffered a great deal terrible he repeated i think those things are always so much harder when one has young children whoremonger filtheater go on and turn the screws tickle that floozie but one of these days powie a fivealarm fire well he went on i suppose the situation could be worse at least you have the satisfaction of knowing youre doing everything possible the very best doctors and surgeons the finest care without stint thats something to be grateful for isnt it don yes sir i said teddy and i are very grateful captain a lovely girl don fine and uncomplaining and courageous the children would be lost without her monster bastard inhuman sonofabitch keep it up ill reach right through the phone and grab you lets see what are you making now don twentyfive thousand isnt it twentytwo fifty not enough he said oh thats not nearly enough don why if i had someone like teddy to work for someone who depended on me and whose very life depended on did you say something don nno sir i said i i just coughed captain you should be making thirtyfive thousand don youre letting teddy down oh i know you think youre doing everything possible but you cant know it you simply havent had the resources to try everything if you were getting thirtyfive thousand now twelve thousand five hundred more it might make a big difference it might mean life for teddy and a mother for those little tots of yours and yes don you said something no sir i said i didnt say anything captain he was silent for a moment i eased my desk drawer open got the cap off a pint of bourbon and took a big slug feel better he said well theres something id like you to do don i want you to walk over to the window and stick your head out yes sir i said it was coming now we were getting into the main stretch i walked over to the window and stuck my head out oh yes yes indeed i did exactly as i was told hed know if i didnt just as hed known when i took that drink the captain always knew part of it was instinct the bestial cunning you find in the very lowest of the animals but he didnt depend entirely on that only a very small fraction of the people in the captains pay were employed on his newspapers the rest were spies his spies and they knew every goddamned thing once years before the captain had told a managing editor to go out and get a cup of coffee he was eating the poor bastard out you see telling him he was asleep at the switch well the guy went down to a restaurant but he wasnt a coffee drinker it seems so he took a glass of milk instead and when he came back to the phone the captain fired him hed had a stool on his tail and when the guy drank milk whiz the old axe the rotten stinking sonofabi i picked up the telephone im back captain i said good he said perhaps you can tell me whether its raining or not no sir i said its not raining very good he said that checks with my information youve taken a great load off my mind don i was beginning to have some doubts as to whether youd know if it was raining or not yes sir i said goddammit why couldnt he get on with it i should have been talking to the news desk the telegraph editor the city editor figuring out the play on the days stories i glanced at the clock and jesus it was only twenty minutes until our earlynoon went to bed if it wasnt ready in twenty minutes thered be overtime in composing overtime in the press room overtime in circulation overtime overtime the lousy filthy union bastards and wed hit the street late and id kill him by god i would kill him id sneak into that castle at night and hed be ass deep in teletype flimsies and whores and id have that good old gasoline and those good old matches big kitchen matches and id burn him alive burn him you had a story in your latefinal yesterday don a paltry eight lines back near the classified pages yes sir yes captain he was crazy if it was a good story wed have played it a rapemurder out in the kenton hills section some fourteenyearold girl very badly handled don should have been right column front page or better still a centerpage spread with banner and lots of art bbut captain i took the receiver away from my ear and stared into the mouthpiece he was crazy by god but sir theres nothing nothing at this stage at any rate to justify you dont think so don well i said of course i could be wrong but there doesnt seem to be anything our courthouse man talked to the district attorney and he doesnt feel perhaps you could change his mind don build a fire under him throw a few matches his way if you get my meaning well i what about this boy theyre holding this talbert theyre letting him go i said for the present at least he admits intimacy with the girl but the rape if any would seem to have been the other way around all the people in that neighborhood her own parents for that matter say she was pretty much of a chaser shed take out after anything that wore pants while this boy on the other hand did everything he could to keep out of her but he was intimate with her this one time yes but he was miles away at the time she was strangled honestly captain i can he prove that he was miles away well well perhaps not he doesnt have any irondad alibi but he went out to the golf course several days a week we know that much we know what kind of a boy he is characterwise and the kind of girl she was under the circumstances the da is reasonably satisfied that hes telling the truth he went on to the golf course she lingered in the canyon waiting for a chance to slip into her house and get her dothes changed someone came along and found her there theyve fixed the time of her death at about noon and and who might that mysterious someone be don does the da have another suspect not at present no i said they think it might have been some hobo someone that dropped off a freight there where they slow down for the trestle i understand that quite a few tramps because of the water and the trees but the da doesnt have anyone in custody aside from talbert there are no other suspects and there is every chance that there will be no other well weve flubbed a good story don moreover weve been remiss in our duty to the public we dont know the facts in this case we havent given the public the facts just what do we know about this boy anyway what do we know about his background his character what he might or might not do how do we know the district attorney has done his job thoroughly how do we know he isnt softheaded or incompetent we dont do we we dont have anything to go on but his word weve failed our trust to our readers i shook my head hell it was a juvenile case wasnt it how could you with no real evidence to go on smear a its a murder case don murder and rape theres been too much hushhush about these juvenile criminals weve got to call a halt and this is an ideal time to begin an ideal story he meant it had just about everything young love and sex and murder and mystery with the opposition still playing ethical well run them off the stands don by the time they wake up itll be too late itll be our story with the readers yes sir i said but but why not kidnap the kid and hang him from the flagpole that would make a good story too and it wouldnt be any worse than this dont misunderstand me don all we want is facts no distortions or exaggerations we find out everything we can about this boy we see that the da and the police do their jobs properly thats all we dont try the case in the newspaper oh we dont huh what the hell did he call it all the facts all the dirt we could dig up and nothing to offset it the facts and the da doing his job doing a job if he wanted to keep his all right sir i said i understand i read your quarterly report don its quite good thank you sir i said i thought youd be pleased with it yes its good for a man getting twentytwo thousand five hundred my very best wishes to teddy don and please do everything you can for her he hung up i hung up i glanced at the clock squeezed my forehead between my hands it was too much by god a man can take just so goddamned much and then hes had it i snatched up the phone called for a conference hookup and gave news and telegraph and city desk the word on the latenoon then i told the city editor mack dudley to drag his ass in and yes those were the words i used he came in carefully dosing the door behind him i waited until he started to sit down and then i brought my fist down on my desk as hard as i could he jumped like he was shot out of a gun what kind of crap is this i yelled what the hell kind of city editor are you you get a prize story dumped in your lap and just because im not around to write it for you you louse it up im through get me you think you can wander around in your goddamned sleep and let me take the asseatings ill now look he said see here don mr skysmith i dont the phone rang excuse me mack i said picking it up yes skysmith speaking don it was the captain again i dont like to make any suggestions concerning your personnel but yes sir i said im always delighted to have your suggestions on anything captain that operator who handled my call a while ago she struck me as being a very intelligent young woman i hope she isnt transferred to the night shift no sir i said she wont be id put her on early swing drag her ass out of bed at three in the morning that girdle full of mud she thought was an ass id like her to stay on her present shift oh yes and you might give her a fivedollar raise if of course thats agreeable with you yes sir i said ill take care of it right away i wouldnt give her five inches if she was the last goddamned woman on earth id cut her pay five bucks and blame it on the business office say that i sent the raise through and they screwed it up she may feel a little shy don about expressing her appreciation you tell her that ill be very glad to get a note from her that ill be looking forward to it yes sir i said the lousy filthy bastardly sonofa william willis it was obvious as i stepped through the door that skysmith had gotten it from the captain and dudley had gotten it from skysmith it was also obvious since i had been summoned that one william willis was about to be handed a package dudley gave me his very best glare developed after long years of practice on freshman copy boys skysmith stared at me with a mixture of sadness and sternness that skysmith slays me always making like a character out of the front page always tossing his weight around and getting nothing but his ass out of joint i never could figure out what the captain saw in him not that hes a bad guy you understand just a fathead who came up too fast i gave him skysmith a pleasant good morning i winked and grinned at dudley he harrumphed getting slobber on his chin in the process he brushed it away quickly adding another fivehundred watts to the glare putting you on a story he barked think you know how to handle one weel i dont know about that i said a story eh isnt that a little unusual to have a reporter do a story now goddam you he said you keep on pulling that smart sarcastic crap and just a moment i held up my hand one moment mr dudley i would like to quote you the guildstar contract as it pertains to the use of obscene and profane language by star supervisory employees when addressing stuff your goddamned contract he turned to skysmith pointing a trembling finger at me don youve got to do something about this character hes destroying morale i cant say anything give an order to anyone without him he choked up slobbering on his chin again and i obligingly continued for him he couldnt raise hell with someone just because he felt like raising hell he couldnt fire anyone except for cause he hadnt been able to since id organized the star chapter of the guild and become its shop steward all right bill skysmith said were all familiar with the contract provisions so lets just drop the subject huh and mack you lay off of bill too goddammit he scrubbed his forehead this is a newspaper not a kindergarten honest to christ i dont know what the hells wrong with some of you birds all you can think about is sniping at each other getting even carrying on some goddamned stupid feud its got to stop get me by god i im im sorry i said and right at the moment i was sorry for him the way he looked i couldnt help it whats the story don sure mack said gruffly bill and i dont mean anything just kidding around well all right said skysmith its that rapemurder out in kenton hills the one that broke late yesterday you may have seen the secondsection squib we carried on it i shook my head i dont recall wait a minute i said you mean that juvenile case the one where i mean a murder case skysmith said firmly rape and murder well i said maybe im dumb now now mack maybe im dumb but wheres the story the girl was fourteen the boy fifteen we cant print a lot of dirt about facts said skysmith facts are what we can print i looked at him and i think my eyebrows must have gone up a couple of inches what are we going to hang those facts on i said whats our justification for tossing our last shred of ethics out the window i could see it when and if they pick up the nut who knocked the girl off but just to go to town on a couple of kids who had a little my voice trailed off after a minute i said oh no youre kidding youre not going to imply the boy killed what the hells wrong with it skysmith wouldnt look at me the kid got in didnt he he was there at the scene of the crime wasnt he he cant prove positively that he wasnt there at the time she was killed he went on to the golf course he says but he didnt go all the way he was about a quarter of a mile away when he saw that there were only a few players out and a hell of a gang of caddies so i know all that i said the guys were kicking it around over at the press club the da knows it too and he doesnt feel theres sufficient grounds for charging the kid goddammit skysmith brought his hand down on his desk i didnt say the kid was guilty but how the hell we going to know unless we get all the facts we dont know a goddamned thing about him bill what his background is what his reputation for uh truth and veracity is what the folks out in that neighborhood his playmates and teachers and so on think of him all weve got to go on is hearsay just what that lardassed da says and you know that stupid sonofabitch bill ill bet he still hangs up his socks on christmas eve i dont know i said ive always thought he was a pretty good man as public officials go of course ill tell you what i think said mack dudley we give this the full treatment get the facts like don says and pour the coal on the da ill bet the kid cracks ill bet he confesses he took it away from that poor girl and then killed her to keep her from telling oh i agree absolutely i said im confident of it mack in fact id go a step further than that ill wager that if the star gave you the treatment and sicced the da on you youd confess to the crime yourself incidentally and nothing personal intended but where were you around noon yesterday now bill said skysmith for christs sake you refusing to handle the story mack snarled go on tell me you wont do it isnt there some alternative i said something clean like scrubbing out the john i havent had much experience but im strong and willing to learn he refuses said mack according to paragraph six clause b the refusal of an editorial employee to shut up skysmith yelled goddammit shut up now look bill this is a perfectly legitimate story it violates orthodox newspaper practice perhaps but theres nothing uh essentially wrong with it all we want is the facts no distortions or exaggerations all we ask of the district attorney is a thorough investigation thats not unreasonable is it theres nothing wrong with that i shrugged nothing i know of i said that you dont he scrubbed his forehead again his eyes squeezed shut he opened them and leaned forward thats the way it stands he said and his voice was steady but there was an undercurrent of trembling in it youre a good reporter and id like to see you handle the story but its going to be done regardless weve got other good reporters and they arent trouble makers theyre too busy with their jobs to fool around with unions now what do you want to do take you before the nlrb i said on charges of penalizing an employee for union activity but i suppose youd call me a liar thats right he nodded evenly im giving you this assignment solely because youre the best man for the job i mean that bill youre a good reporter and id hate to lose you your union activities dont figure in the matter in any way i nodded absently lighting a cigarette to gain time someone would do it if i didnt there was no question about that the captain had hollered frog so jumping was the order of the day and dammit it would make a hell of a good story yes sir a hell of a story young love and sex and murder and mystery and christ the color the human interest that captain you had to hand it to the decadent old buzzard he didnt have any more principles than those maggots in his brain but he knew story he knew what would sell papers well bill it would make a good story i said but practically anything will if you dont give a damn about decency and save it yes or no well it was going to have to be yes naturally a no would get me nothing but my time without severance pay still i hated to say yes if for no other reason than that they felt i had to say it if theres anything i like less than being pushed around its being pushed around a thing like this taking a shove from old fuddy dudley and donald the great could be very bad for my reputation now surely i thought there should be something you have to take it but there must be some way of handing it back no yes think fast mr willis so i thought very fast and a very beautiful idea came to me i heaved an enormous sigh of surrender more apparent than real and said that i would gladly accept the assignment i suppose this is exclusively my story i said there wont be three or four other guys backtracking or anticipating me oh its your story all right mack dudley grinned no ones but yours well have his byline on every page wont we don skysmith gave him a frown and nodded to me its all yours bill of course well be getting some side and feature stuff from the trained seals you get em to work on that mack but the running story will be yours thats fine i said incidentally watch yourself if you run into any of the opposition boys if they knew what we were up to theyd jump in ahead of us well get this thing all set today get it all lined up and tomorrow well hit em with it theyll never know what happened until its too late swell what about the da i said do i goose him today yes no skysmith hesitated no well let the story be the goose let him sleep see so we can point it out heres a public official whos so damned lazy and stupid that the star has to do his job for him we burn his ass so hard hes jumping sideways to put out the fire i get you i said now theres one thing im a little worried about don i dont know whether youve thought about it or not but yes bill he smiled at me relaxed the conqueror magnanimous to the conquered do you suppose theres any danger that this thing will backfire on us its pretty rough you know a big paper landing on a fifteenyearold kid with all four feet the public might not like it well he frowned faintly well he shrugged of course well have to use some judgment we cant go too far overboard but leave that part to me you just get the story everything you think we ought to have and ill check it over myself tone it down if i feel it needs it the hell you will donald its my story i said well that does it i guess now i dont phone anything in right i get the facts and then i come in and write the story right try not to be too late but take as much time as you have to mack and i will be waiting i nodded and got up from my chair he stood up too and stuck out his hand as ive said he wasnt a bad guy even if he was a fathead but he had pushed me around and i do not like to be pushed good boy he said you do us the right kind of job on this bill and maybe i can swing a bonus oh im glad to do it i said i dont expect any bonus don i got some copy paper from my desk and picked up a photographer we drove to the courthouse and i had a private chat with the district attorney i told him about the little surprise the star had planned for him he was pretty damned sore about it and needless to say alarmed he was also very grateful to me for tipping him off william willis they didnt have the boy robert talbert in the jug proper there were a couple of witness rooms with a connecting door adjoining the district attorneys office and he was in one and a jail matron in the other the da told the matron to catch some air about an hours worth then after introducing me and the photog to the boy he went back to his office and left us alone the kid was about on a par with a good many teenagers ive seen they arent watchful exactly they arent exactly sullen there is rather a look of resigned hopefulness about them they look as though no good can possibly come to them albeit they would certainly welcome a little and are rightfully entitled to it i do not recall that kids looked that way in my day i think it must be the times this age we live in when the reasons for existence are lost in the struggle to exist he looked from me to the photographer cautiously trying to smile but not too much the kind of smile that can change quickly into a frown i tthought i was going home he said they told me i was going home you are i said youll get there all right bob you dont mind talking to me a little first do you you dont have to understand but ill sure catch hell from my editor if you dont well he scuffed his foot against the floor what you want to talk about i already told everything there was to tell but you havent told me i pointed out now lets get busy cigarette or theyll have you out of here before i can get my story he took a cigarette and we sat down he started talking moving right along with it without being prodded i took him backwards and forwards through it i took him from the middle back and from the end to the middle he didnt trip up it came out the same way each time he got his foot wet as he started to cross the canyon creek while he was drying out the girl showed up they played around a while and then they had it she got blood on her clothes and blamed him for it he tried to get her to promise she wouldnt tell her mother she was sore wanting to make him sweat so she stalled he got sore and shook her she promised and he went on toward the hold it a minute bob i said show me how you shook her maybe youd better stand up he stood up and thrust his hands out curving them as though he was gripping something i gave the photographer the nod he crouched down in front of the kid and shot up at him a shot like that as you may know distorts the features gives them a grim macabre look with that cigarette tucked in the corner of his mouth and his hands clawing the air the kid would look like horrible bill from killerdill we got a few other nice poses from him while he was still on his feet and then i had him sit down and went back to the story now lets see if ive got this straight bob you cut across country to the golf links up the other side of the canyon and through the woods and on through the fields and another patch of woods and so on about four miles and you didnt see anyone in all that distance either coming or going huhuh i dont think i saw anyone i might have but not to notice then you came to this knoll overlooking the golf links about a quarter of a mile away and you decided it wasnt worthwhile going down so you just sat down there by yourself with nothing to do and you stayed there for more than three hours why bob why didnt you go on home i told you he frowned impatiently i told you about six times already i couldnt go home i was supposed to be in school and i couldnt go home until it was time for it to be out sure you couldnt of course not i said and no one could see you there either could they theres no road nearby no houses i dont know if anyone saw me or not he said what i said was i didnt see anyone i see i nodded youll have to excuse me for having such a lousy memory bob i dont like to keep bothering you but if i dont get this story right i might get fired well he said grudgingly thats all right now this girl josie i suppose you know shed had intercourse several times it was only once with you wasnt it just the one yes how many times i got to tell you did you want to do it again did you ask her i didnt want to do it the first time well i did afterwards you know after she started to to what do you suppose shed have done if youd tried to do it again would she have been sore maybe how do i know whats the difference he said and he brushed at his eyes i i ddont want to talk about her how would you feel if someone youd known all your life ssomeone you saw every day and and maybe you thought they were kinda crazy and always hanging around when you didnt want em bbut he choked and turned his head she was ppretty nice he said mme and josie well we always liked each other naturally i said of course you did now bob what about i took him through the story again it came out a carbon copy of the earlier tellings and was that as it should be or wasnt it just a little bit odd shouldnt it if it was the truth vary a little from time to time it was like a recitation something hed memorized just a few more questions bob as long as you were so near the golf course why didnt you go on after all i been tellin and tellin you mister because it wouldnt have been any use i could see the parking lot from up there and the caddie shack and i knew i wouldnt get no any job you couldnt be positive bob you couldnt have lost anything by it you could ave got yourself a cold drink kidded around with the boys while you were waiting until time to go home he licked his lips hesitantly he talked very straightforwardly upon the main story line what had transpired between him and the girl and so on but these tangential angles things of nominally minor importance seemed to disturb him i told you he said i didnt want a drink i didnt want to kid around and you had some blood on your trousers you thought someone might ask about it yes it was partly that maybe i guess it was you must have noticed the blood before you ever started to the i did notice it i told you i did well as long as you didnt want anyone to see you why go all the way out to i had to go some place didnt i an i didnt say i didnt want anyone to see me i well i didnt maybe i guess i didnt but if thered been any point to it if i couldve got a job or anything i would uhhuh i understand now you were about a quarter of a mile away from the course you could look down and see the caddies and the players isnt that right i could see em but not to recognize i could just see how things looked that there wasnt any use going on then they someone probably saw you too huh not to recognize but no they couldnt i told you that i could see them but they couldnt see me you were trying not to be seen yes but why bob i told you mister for gosh sake i sseen i wasnt going to unless there was some sense to it was i an when i seen ssaw there wasnt any i couldnt get a job wwhy i didnt for gosh sake i keep explainin sure i understand i said and i did it wasnt logical but it was believable reasonable if you put yourself in his place he was explaining the inexplicable a matter of feeling rather than thinking and insofar as it could be done he was doing a pretty fair job of it once when i was a kid i mixed salt in the sugar bowl and at dinner that night and i was the only member of the family who took sugar in tea i spooned a gob of it into my cup dopey sure it was when i look back on it now but at the time i did it it seemed perfectly right and proper i couldnt have told you why i did it but i didnt see how i could have done anything else of course that wasnt the same as this i wasnt the same as this kid he had his story down too pat he was too straightforward in one way upon certain points and not enough in another after all as long as he was practically there at the golf links as long and if can i go home now mister you said i could sure i jerked my head at the photographer and got up ill speak to the district attorney bob no it wasnt the same all right this was different i was rationalizing hoping subconsciously that the kid was guilty i couldnt be impartial i was using him swinging him as the club in my grudge play against the star i was going to knock his brains out in the course of trepanning dudley and skysmith and i needed justification if he was guilty good if he was innocent bad very bad that would make me a supersonic jetpropelled heel instead of the slowflying propellerdriven model which i had become reasonably well adjusted to i had another talk with the da before i left i told him i couldnt make up my mind about talbert he seemed to be leveling but well i just didnt know id rather not say anything after all he was just a kid and even if he was guilty he probably hadnt realized what he was doing hed just got scared and well the da searched my face im by no means satisfied with his story bill i slept on it last night and id already made up my mind before you came in this morning that he had a great deal to explain it was my own decision understand ive never allowed myself to be coerced and im certainly not going to begin now im not going to railroad some youngster just to make a roman holiday for of course not i said i understand clint all you want is to get at the truth absolutely take it easy on him will you clint i know you will but some of these county dicks i imagine youll want to uh divide the responsibility have some assistance in the questioning you dont need to ask that bill if theres one thing i do not and have never tolerated its abuse of a prisoner swell i said ill just run along then and and youll get in touch with me when and if you can depend on it he shook my hand earnestly you did me a very great favor and i never forget a favor the kids teacher a miss brundage was a pretty tough nut to crack one of those fair people you could boot her in the tail and shed probably say you were giving her a spinal adjustment yes robert had been truant a lot but no more so or even as much as a great many other boys yes he did get a little out of hand at times but he was at the restless age most boys went through a stage of unruliness shed seen very few who didnt and she didnt believe robert felt very well she felt that there might be a situation at home that uh yes i said but no shed only talked with mrs talbert one time and shed never met mr talbert she didnt know them well enough to have formed an opinion all she knew was that they were longtime residents of the community and everyone spoke very highly of them they were really she was sure very nice welladjusted people just as robert was really a very nice welladjusted boy shed come out in the corridor to talk to me and she kept having to stick her head back in the classroom and call for order she didnt get it there were just too dammed many kids jammed in too small a space the moment she turned her back the racket started up again catcalls and flying chalk and grabassing i kept on talking to her the kids kept bellowing her smile began to tighten up and a glint came into her eyes there was a rising tremoloish note to her voice like you hear from an offtune key of c fiddle string a tiny vein throbbed in her throat and she almost yanked the door off its hinges when she had to speak to the kids i could see she was cracking up she was just about to explode she was irritated with me and annoyed with the kids she had to cut loose on someone and you know who that someone was the explosion came she clouded up and rained all over one robert talbert who it suddenly appeared was just about the most wilful sullen uncooperative hateful youth shed ever come up against honestly mr willis i do want to be fair and im sure he isnt entirely to blame but she was still raving when the photographer and i left her i was going to stop by the principals office but i remembered suddenly that hed somehow got himself on the stars heel list some speech hed made at a teachers convention one time had rubbed the captain the wrong way no paper in the star chain would have quoted him or printed his name if hed sailed the atlantic in a salad bowl so i passed him by there was a lunch room and soda fountain across the street from the school the guy who ran it was a cranky old bastard who was convinced that the younger generation was hellbound on a handcar no respect for their elders always sneaking candy bars and chewing gum slipping out without paying their checks buying a nickel coke and loafing around slopping it all over everything until theyd read every magazine in the place none of em were any good not a danged one he wouldnt say that that talbert kid was any worse than the rest at least he wouldnt say it at first but he got around to it yes sir that talbert was a real bad one the ringleader of the crowd should have locked him up long ago the photographer and i went over to the talbert neighborhood i went from door to door and while i didnt hit pay dirt at every house i still got plenty the kid had lived there all his life fifteen whole years any kid will pull some outoftheway stunts in that time or if he doesnt he might as well hell still be accused of them so so there were windows that had been broken and trash barrels set on fire and ugly words chalked on sidewalks there were little girls whod been chased and a woman whod seen someone peeking in her bathroom window and an old maid whod been followed home from the station one night and she was positive period there was a lot more evidence in the case of friends and neighbors vs robert talbert but i see no need to set it down here it was about par for the course about what you might dig up on me if you visited around my childhood neighborhood and if i was in jail on suspicion of murder at the time of your inquiry its amazing you know honestly amazing that any crime is ever committed because ive never yet talked to the associates or acquaintances of a miscreant who didnt know all along that he was a thoroughly bad egg he didnt act right you know he couldnt look you straight in the eye he talked too much oh they knew he was a crook all right knew he was about to pull a fast one so why didnt they stop him why didnt they mention their suspicions well you tell me talbert hadnt gone to work naturally and he and the missus were both home theyd been expecting the boys release all day and she blew her top at the news that he was being held indefinitely id been sure she would you could see the subsurface hysteria in her eyes hear it in the highpitched toorapid speech shed probably always been a little flighty and the menopause hits that kind hard mr talbert tried to comfort her he looked like he could stand some comforting himself and she turned on him it was his fault hed driven bobbie to it always nagging and scolding and picking on the boy treating him like a man when he was only a baby you drove him to it yes you did yyou talbert took it as long as he could then he began to unwind she hadnt made a home for the boy she was always chasing around gossiping with the neighbors instead of taking care of the house she hadnt acted like a mother should shed embarrassed and shamed the kid so much with her doggone nuttiness that he was afraid to bring any friends to the house hed had to meet them outside and they were the wrong kind naturally and the photographer started shooting them they clammed up fast shamed and scared realizing i guess that in taking out their peeves on each other theyd as good as admitted the boys guilt talbert told us to get out he seemed to mean it so we did we went a few doors down the street to the eddlemans the parents of the dead girl theyd been assuaging their sorrow with a bottle and theyd had enough to be pretty talkative oddly enough or at least it seemed odd to me they were reluctant to knock the kid they didnt see how bobbie could have done a thing like that of course if he had done it he ought to be but id hate to think he did eddleman said its kind of hard to believe that he did i never cared much for the kid yunderstand one of these closemouthed kind that acted like itd bust his ribs if he laughed but i know what you mean i said i suppose hed just about have to be like that dont you i dont know much about his parents but i imagine they could get a kid down in time his eyes flashed and his big red face turned a shade or two redder you got something there mister he grunted that old man of his old frozenface there aint a soul i know thatll say a good word for him hes just plain damned mean get me and quick tempered why just the other day now i tried to pass a little joke with him remember fay i told you about it and i actually thought he was going to murder me thats right mr willis fay eddleman nodded vigorously thats exactly the way he is and his mother an absolute lunatic if there ever was one you can be going along minding your own business and here shell come and and shell just act awful just say the dirtiest craziest things she can think of oh shes nuts all right eddleman said crazy as a bedbug but she cant hold a candle to the old man a regular maniac and hes a crook too i sold a house to a party one time thatd done some business with him and he said we talked a while longer they did rather and you probably know the conclusion they reached hed done it all right they decided hed tried to assault the girl once before and thered been plenty of other indications that he was a murderer in the making theyd seen it coming on for a long time he was guilty as hell the dirty little skunk but his parents were guiltier they were really responsible and they ought to be punished right along with him the photographer and i took a quick whirl through the shopping center that wrapped it up i told the photog to pull me three extra prints on each of the pictures then i let him go and went home to my apartment i wrote the story there or rather it almost wrote itself making an original and three copies i sorted the various pages out and read back through it it was something believe me there hadnt been any thing like it since the graphic folded i thought of what skysmith was going to say and i laughed out loud i read back through the thing again that kid jesus this was going to be pretty bad for him but well i hadnt invented anything had i i hadnt exaggerated no i hadnt the dirt was there and id dug for it dug pretty hard but i hadnt put a gun to anyones head id simply talked and let them talk spffling out the dirt that was in them i poured myself a drink i gulped it down and had a few more i went back through the story again and this time the doubts the hunch id had that morning began to grow these people thought the kid was guilty the people who knew him best his own parents thought he was guilty there wasnt any real evidence when you tried to pin it down it was the sort of stuff you might dig up on almost any kid still well what if it was it wasnt anything to his credit was it it certainly didnt prove he was innocent did it and so many people felt the same way about him and hed acted pretty damned shifty when id talked to him he had this story down too pat he was too straightforward and not straightforward enough he hadnt seemed very sorry about the girl just sort of dull and defiant and well he could be guilty as easily as not i wouldnt say that he was but i wouldnt say that he was innocent either i fixed myself a bite to eat and had a few more drinks the phone rang repeatedly and i let it it would be the office dudley or skysmith wondering what the hell had happened to me i wasnt ready to go in yet for several reasons a messenger arrived with the extra prints of the pictures i sorted them into stacks and put them with the dupes on the stories the phone rang three times and stopped i picked it up and dialed the da he said the kid was cracking hed sent the detectives out to dinner and theyd work on him some more afterwards i imagine well have to bury him he said im surprised we havent been hit with a writ before this so am i i said where are you taking him clint well you really want to know bill no i said i guess i dont i dont know anything just call me at the office when you have the news it was about ten oclock when i went in a little more than an hour before the presses started to roll on the earlymorning edition only a few dogtrick men were scattered around the big city room dudley had given up and gone home but don skysmith was still in his office he jumped up scowling when i walked in jesus god bill what the hell kept you is that the story well give it to me for christs sake he yanked the pages out of my hand i sat down across the desk from him and pulled the earlymorning dummy in front of me he grunted startled he let out a howl and slapped the desk with his hand for gods sake bill what the hell is this yes i said is there something wrong mr skysmith something wrong why goddammit he thrust the story at me are you out of your goddamned mind get out of here get out there to a typewriter and do this like it should be done you know damned well we cant mr skysmith i said that story will run exactly as it is written exactly understand in fact im going to see it through the composing room and onto the presses huh he stared at me open mouthed are you yes i said it will run as written mr skysmith or it will not run at all push me around will you you phony he said i was crazy again i was out of my goddamned mind he scrubbed at his forehead look bill i i his lips trembled in his taut pale face i know how hard you must have worked on this i kknow how it is when youre a reporter and you knock yourself out on something and tthen some desk man tells you it it just let it go bill and ill take care of it my wifes pretty sick and i was in kind of a hurry to donald i said your majesty the story runs as is it cant it what the hell you mean calling me you wanted dirt i said you got it goddamn you i didnt want anything like this i told you we had to use some judgment we had to be careful this is is its outrageous well get a bad reaction from it were pulling the switch on the kid why goddammit the captain would blow his top if suppose we leave it to the captain i said what you know we call him up i said tell him you tried to push the wrong guy around and hes got you over a barrel tell him i told him what to tell the captain the story would go into the star as it was written otherwise id give it to the three opposition papers theyd print it if they thought we were going to in any event and if they did tone it down our scoop would be shot the captain was looking forward to this surprise party he meant to run the other sheets off the stands now there wouldnt be any surprise and the star would probably do a little running itself oh yes i said you might also tell him ive got the confession on ice ask him if hed like to see it in the star after it comes out in the opposition his mouth moved wordlessly slowly he sank down into his chair yyou you wont get away with this willis ill get you and that lousy da if you mean youre going to admit youre a sap i said i dont think you will donald the captain might forgive a bit of faulty judgment overenthusiasm but he doesnt have much use for chumps its almost a phobia with him you know he hates em like crazy now sonsofbitches he doesnt mind he like you huh like you for example oh well i said i wasnt asking for compliments may i i pulled the story and art across the desk i took a pencil out of my pocket he said bill why bill whats it all about you pushed me around i said i do not like to be pushed around especially by a man who never was a real newspaperman but but i didnt i havent ive never meant to anyway god you dont hold dudley against me do you i have to back up my city editor i didnt answer him i bent over the papers his desk drawer opened there was the scrape of metal against glass and the smell of whiskey he said what are you doing bill and i looked up im writing heads i said evenly im captioning pictures im fixing up the dummy pretty handy huh no need to bother with copy men or picture desk or news editor i can get the stuff and i can write the stuff and then i can carry it right on through the mill and i can do it better than any sonofabitch in the shop i could even set it up on the lino if i had a card and i could lay it out on the stone i dont need to take anyones word for whats right i can tell them because im a newspaper man get me an all around twohanded man its all ive ever done all i ever want to do take me away from newspapers and id die and id want to die and you cant understand that can you skysmith you cant because youre not a newspaper man youre just a punk who got the breaks a college boy who lucked himself into a pulitzer and rode it for all it was worth youre well skip it he took another drink hesitated and pushed the bottle across the desk i pretended not to see it i see bill he said quietly im beginning to understand why i shrugged i felt uncomfortably empty drained dry dont jump to conclusions don i was just popping off i understand he said i know how you must feel about me why don i forced a grin and stood up i had no idea you cared as a matter of fact i love you like a brother come along huh come with me to the composing room i guess not he said you dont need me bill sure i do i said what the hell two heads are better than one any old day id better go home he said my wife my wife is pretty sick richard yeoman the da locked the door on the kid and handed me a five two fifty for me and two fifty for charlie alt he said we should get our supper and not to take all night about it and no gabbing understand he said you dont know a thing about the talbert boy what about him i said you want we should bring him a sandwich or something no he said when hes ready to eat he can say so we could bring him a malt or something i said something cold to drink maybe he can have something to drink he said whenever he wants it well i was just asking i said he can have anything he wants the da said just as soon as he comes to his senses me and charlie figured the chinamans was the best deal being close and pretty reasonable and all so we went downstairs and headed across the street charlie was kind of mumbling to himself and counting on his fingers finally he got it figured out small steak french fries peas pie two cups of coffee he said two fifty exactly dick yeah i said but what about the tip h he said what you want to tip chinamen for they got a lot more money than you have oh i dont know i said i guess maybe i shouldnt but i always feel kind of funny dont you tip em charlie well i aint going to tonight he said we got to the chinamans and i told charlie to go on back and get us a booth i had to give my old lady a ring i guess i ought to call my daughter too he said giving me a kind of funny look you go ahead and ill wait for you no you better go get us a booth i said you hold it until im through and then ill hold it while youre talking well h he said theres plenty of dd booths but he went on back i called kossy at his office but i didnt get any answer and he wasnt to home either finally i got him over at us federal where they was having a night immigration hearing dick yeoman mr kossmeyer i said mr kossmeyer aint you counsel in the talbert case talbert he said tal oh yeah sure dick they let the kid go no they aint let him go i said it dont look like theyre going to either if you know what i mean i was going to call you earlier mr kossmeyer but i didnt have a chance and s of a bh he said i supposed he was home in bed i havent had a peep out of his folks ive been doing everything i can for that boy mr kossmeyer i said but frankly that aint very much it aint something i got a lot of control over if you follow my meaning sure he said quickly i appreciate that dick you stop by my office tomorrow where oh thats not necessary i said what time mr kossmeyer any time any time he said whereve you got him dick at county mr clintons office i said but i kind of got a hunch were moving him js he said you know what the

talberts i ought to sue em for mopery some people is certainly stupid all right i said but i guess in a kind of crisis like this theyre probably kind of out of their minds they aint got any gd dd minds he said hold him there dick stall it some way just give me a couple of hours an hour you do that and ill appreciate it ill appreciate it very much dick ill certainly do my best mr kossmeyer i said i cant make no promises but he banged up the phone i went on back to the booth where charlie alt was he looked at me looking sort of sore an then he kind of laughed halvers he said halvers i said halvers on what charlie halvers on what you get from kossmeyer he said h its only fair dick i was going to call him myself if you hadnt got firsts on the phone idve give you half if id called him well there was two schools of thought on that if you follow my meaning but there wasnt much else i could do soi said well all right if he felt he was entitled to it kossy says we should stall i said we stall an hour or maybe two until he can get hold of some judge for a habeas hell appreciate it very much kossys all right charlie said hes one good jew if you ask me what you got to say a thing like that for i said he cant help it if hes a jew can he whats wrong with being a jew h charlie said what you snapping me up for i say something nice about him and you snap me up well i said youd better watch yourself dick he said you go around acting like that and people will think maybe youre part jew yourself like who maybe will think that i said anyway id a lot rather be a jew than some certain other people i know if you follow my meaning yeah he said yes i said he sat and frowned at me a minute or two and then he picked up the menu h he said looking at the menu i dont know why you got to get sore dick didnt i say kossy was a good friend of mine didnt i say he was a hundred per cent gentleman and the best lawyer in town h thats nothing to get sore about well all right i said i guess maybe i misunderstood you i tell you what i think ill do he said id just as soon skip the peas that makes two thirtyfive instead of twofifty id just as soon too i said we can get some extra bread for nothing if we want we gave our order to the waiter told him to make the steaks extra well done the da telephoned when wed just started eating so the waiter told him we was eating and he said to tell us to get a move on what the h charlie said we aint supposed to eat any more thats what i say i said i guess maybe we cant order our steaks the way we want em what you think kossy will give us dick he said well twenty apiece maybe i said probably fifty if we can stall until he comes up with the habeas charlie kind of whistled fifty bucks what i cant do with that you really think he will dick why not i said i got fifty from kossy two or three times things that wasnt as much trouble as this yeah he said but there wasnt anyone else in on it he didnt have to pay no one but you he didnt huh i winked at him vas you dere charlie wow fifty bucks charlie said i tell you something dick ill do something if you will what you say we each drop an extra quarter for who flung dung you mean we give him fifty cents besides the thirty cents i said almost a dollar tip what the h charlie said we can afford it cant we well i dont know i said suppose we cant stall long enough we maybe cant get away with it well get away with it charlie said ill knock clinton down and set on him if i have to well all right i said you leave an extra twobits and i will but id feel a lot more comfortable about it if i had that fifty bucks in my pocket fifty bucks charlie said boy oh boy you still want to make a deal on that smith wesson dick ill sell it i said i aint taking any old beatup colt in trade beat up he said and i guess that old smith wesson aint beat up i guess you bought it brand new from mr smith and wesson instead of taking it off of that nigger highjacker i wouldnt say anything about me taking things off of people charlie i said if you follow my meaning well dont go running down my colt all the time he said people hear you knocking it all the time i never will get rid of it i had two or three trades worked up and someone hears a knock on it i aint saying it came from you now and the deal falls through look charlie i said irregardless of what you may have heard to the contrary i have never at any time or place knocked that colt to anyone on the contrary charlie and i can prove it dusty kramer over on city vice he came up to me the other day and said franidy what was my honest opinion and i said franidy i didnt see how a man could go wrong on a good colt i said you asked for my honest opinion and there it is you see yourself a good colt at the right price and you better grab it well charlie said i didnt say you knocked it dick i didnt think youd do a thing like that you know why i dont want to take in a trade i said ive explained the situation to you several times charlie i got a colt and i got a smith wesson and getting rid of the smith wesson i still have the colt i dont want another one two colts even if it aint all beat up this is my last offer charlie said ill swap you the colt and fifteen dollars no twenty dollars thats my last offer dick take it or leave it you just made yourself a deal mister i said ill pay you tomorrow he said just as soon as we get the dough from kossmeyer well all right i said but if its no dough no deal i got to have the cash on the line charlie youll get it he said well stall that clinton if we have to hogtie him we finished our steak and potatoes and had some pie and coffee then we had second coffees and someway the waiter didnt charge us for them so we left that money for him too another twenty cents with the eighty an even dollar tip me and charlie kind of wanted to be around when he picked it up see how hed act you know but he was busy with some other tables and we figured wed better be getting back practically everyone had been gone from the courthouse when we left and everyone was gone now i mean all the other offices was closed up tight but the das and even the elevator boy had gone home all the lights was off but just a few little ones and we practically had to feel our way up the stairs and down the corridor we got to the das office the first one you go into i mean thats got the railing running down the center and went on through the gate charlie was in the lead and i was right on his heels and when we stopped all of a sudden i piled right into him excuse me charlie i said shh he said gd d n he jerked his head at the door of the witness room and i listened i heard the da say something and then i heard the kid say something there was a sound about it i didnt like one little bit and i could tell that charlie didnt like it one little bit either he turned around and looked at me and i looked at him i could tell he was thinking the same thought i was well charlie i said i guess them was just about the most expensive steaks well ever eat gd d n he said sn of a bh i guess we shouldve et em rare i said shh he said listen gd d n it so we listened now bob you want to tell the truth dont

you want me to help you put it in the right words so yyyes charlie alt yanked the cigar out of his mouth and flung it on the floor gd d n he said goodbye fifty bucks l kossmeyer i walked around my desk and got right in front of mrs talbert i let my hands dangle kangaroo fashion pulled the corners of my mouth down and started fluttering my eyelids it was a pretty good imitation of her if i do say so now this is the way you look mrs talbert i said this is the way you sound wheeoo yoweee boohoo blabblab honestly actually really i cant stand it yicketyyicketyyoo blah blah blah it took her completely by surprise she couldnt make up her mind whether to laugh or get sore wwell well honestly she began i you see i grinned at her there you go again well she was pretty redfaced for a moment and then suddenly she burst out laughing talbert gave her a startled look i dont imagine hed heard her laugh like that in years i dont imagine he could have pulled a gag or a bit of clowning if his life depended on it now thats better i said arent you ashamed of yourself mrs talbert a pretty young woman like you running around like a hen with its head off cackling and gabbling around about everything you know and ten times as much that you dont weeping and wailing and yacketyyak blooblahing why if you werent so pretty id turn you over my knee and paddle you she blushed and giggled why mr kossmeyer you awful well all right i said you be a good girl from now on no more gabbing to anyone no more pitching the dirt to or about anyone no more bloobooing and boohooing and all around nuttiness we need friends all we can get understand we need to act confident you want to talk to someone you come and see me well give your old man a sleeping pill and throw a wingding mr kossmeyer she simpered youre just simply terrible youll think im terrible i said if you give me any more trouble now scram on out of here while your husband and i have a little talk go out and talk to my secretary tell her i said to order you up the biggest coke in town or i wont hold her on my knee any more she went out giggling and blushing and the poor old biddy actually twitched her butt at me i drew the chair shed been sitting in up in front of talbert all right i said she needed that that was for laughs this isnt how much money can you raise well uh he hesitated cautiously how much will you need more than ill get out of you i said so make it light on me he frowned uncomfortably he just wasnt used to doing business this way well i uh i just dont know if you could give me some idea look i said look mr talbert youve already placed me under a very serious handicap if youd done what you should have instead of giving way to your emotions and losing your head you wouldnt be here and your boy wouldnt be where he is i know he said i dont know why i i cut him off forget it its over and done so lets get back to the subject all i ask of my clients is that they pay their own way as far as they can you tell me what you can do and well let it go at that well he said a uh thousand dollars i nodded staring at him all right mr talbert you know what you can do will you he looked down at the floor i wouldnt want to feel that bob wasnt that the money it wont make a bit of difference i said ill do just as much for a thousand as i would for ten thousand or a hundred i always do my best thats all i ask my clients to do ive got a house he said a pretty good equity in it i kind of hoped that many of my clients dont have so much as a suit of clothes mr talbert not even the price of their next meal ill get as much as i can he said whatever i can get well ill be glad to do it good i said get busy on it right away he looked a little let down gratitude yet he expected i was putting the blocks to him and i wasnt even being nice about it i tricked him and kicked him at the same time that was the way he felt and why the hell i let it bother me i dont know because ive never had a client who didnt feel exactly the same way enough they dont know what that is but too much thats simple too much is what they pay you and its still too much if they dont pay anything youre getting all that free publicity see worth plenty of dough to you and ive actually had em try to collect well i believe thats about all i said if you want to run along now get busy on that money but he got to his feet slowly frowning but what are you going to do mr kossmeyer i shrugged whatever is necessary mr talbert well i i just wondered i kind of wanted to know thats it i said whatever is necessary i smiled and nodded at him he turned toward the door hesitated and then it came the old old question mumbled and jumbled and garbled as it almost always is but still the same old question mr talbert i said i never think but one thing i not only think it but i believe it as an officer of the court im professionally and morally obliged to otherwise i would be an accomplice in perjury and the obstruction of justice i have had no guilty clients mr talbert to the best of my knowledge and belief they are always innocent well he said shamefaced of course i was sure that go right on being sure i said itll be all right wont it youll hell be cleared my clients are very seldom convicted i said the real trouble often comes later oh he blinked at me how do you all the judges arent in the courtroom i said so never stop being sure never let the boy know that youre not sure its so mixed up he said absently its all so mixed up i know he couldnt have done it i know they made him sign that confession why you look at it this way mr kossmeyer i know it maybe looks funny but certainly i said youre absolutely right mr talbert i grabbed him by the hand shook it and shoved him out the door i waited a couple of days before i dropped in on the district attorney i had a few things i wanted to take care of first and i thought it would be a good idea to let him stew a while as i saw it hed be expecting me right away it would worry him when i didnt show i hoped of course that he might get worried enough to come to me but i hadnt got any other breaks on the deal and i didnt get that one why kossy he said jumping up from his desk this is a pleasant surprise sit down sit down how have you been anyway aaaah i said nothing new clint same old sixes and sevens whats this i hear about your name being put up for a circuit court appointment i was just going to call and ask if i could be of help in any way write a few letters or say a word or two in the right places i believe i have some small influence and well thats very kind of you clint i said but no i guess theres nothing to it my god what would i do on the federal bench id be lost yknow i wouldnt know how to act oh now he murmured i wouldnt say that kossy what they really need is someone like you i said someone with a lot of dignity and a broad background in public service by the way i suppose you know youre considered also he was completely astonished but completely he said so himself why why kossy he said i hardly know what to say not that id stand the slightest chance of course but i dont see why not i said it seems to me you might stand a very excellent chance if i withdraw swing such small support as i may have over to you why well he said i couldnt ask you to do that id appreciate it of course but you dont have to ask i said id simply be doing it as a matter of civic duty after all if you can make the financial sacrifices entailed in accepting the appointment i certainly should be wffling to say a word here and there well he said thats certainly very nice of you its nice of you to feel that way he sat looking down at his desk for a moment rocking back and forth in his swivel chair he sighed shook his head and looked up kossy he said you dirty sonofabitch i meant it i said just that and nothing more and no strings attached and i did mean it i know he said thats what makes you such a sonofabitch its indecent god damn it if you had a spark of humanity in you youd offer me an outright bribe i laughed and he joined in rather tiredly i thought he pushed a cigar box across the desk held a match for me his hand trembled and he drew it away quickly now about young talbert he said i assume youre here in his interests well im willing to do everything i can kossy the boy is more to be pitied than condemned in my opinion hes made a tragic mistake a very serious one but i cant regard him as a criminal in the ordinary sense of the word i and of course hes been very cooperative i said we cant overlook that can we clint he creaked back and forth in his chair his hands folded on his stomach his eyes studying me gravely i folded my hands on my stomach rocked back and forth in my chair and frowned at him he scowled and leaned forward that has all the earmarks of a very nasty insinuation kossy are you implying that the boys constitutional rights were violated of course not i said i cant even think all those big words without getting tangled up all im saying is that you sweated that kid until he didnt know his ass from an adding machine hed have sworn that he killed christ if you told him to well he said thats one murder we didnt have to inquire about i laughed and said he was certainly right someone laughed and said he was certainly right i took the cigar out of my mouth and studied it and studied it damn him the dirty stinking no he hadnt meant what he had said but he had said it damn him damn him da kossy he said that was a rotten thing to say im thoroughly ashamed please forgive me what the hell i said i needled you pretty hard anyway you didnt say anything i wasnt even listening to you now kossy my friend i i said you didnt say anything i said get me i wasnt listening to you i i god damn you call this a cigar you ought to serve corned beef with it all right kossy he smiled okay boy now getting back to this alleged confession clint ill tell you how i feel about it the boy didnt have an alibi he was known to have had relations with the girl all in all and with the newspapers turning on the heat thats one thing i cant figure out incidentally oh the newspapers he shrugged i never pay any attention to em kossy well that just about makes you unique i said at any rate you jumped to the entirely erroneous conclusion that the boy was guilty and you felt justified in uh urging him to admit it insisting that he admit it until he couldnt hold out any longer you were just doing your job as you saw it but youre dead wrong kossy naturally i talked to the boy at some length but there was certainly no duress involved he was as entirely free to maintain his innocence as he was to admit his guilt its his own confession told of his own free will in his own words thats what you believe i said you couldnt prosecute him if you didnt believe it but take a tip from me clint dont go into court with that confession you go into court with that and ill rip you to pieces oh well he said of course if you want to make a jury case out of it have the boy treated like some hardened criminal what did you have in mind i said well i certainly didnt contemplate anything like that kossy now hes your client of course and i wouldnt want to urge any course of action upon you but i thought you and i might just talk it over quietly with one of the juvenile justices someone like old mother meehan and im sure her honor would give very serious consideration to any recommendations such as i said well he pursed his lips state industrial until he attains his majority huhuh i said weel you may well be right kossy im inclined to feel that you are if the boy wasnt responsible for what he did and franidy how can you hold a mere child responsible why he certainly shouldnt be punished he isnt bad hes only sick hes sorely in need of treatment perhaps a brief stay in one of our state hospitals i see no reason at all why he shouldnt be fully restored and ready to return to society within oh possibly eighteen months well a year then or even nine months i believe i can guarantee an outside maximum of nine months i believe i can explain to the court that its largely a matter of rest and quiet having time for reflection and huhuh i said absolutely no you name it then whats your best offer kossy complete dismissal unqualified exoneration the boy was excited overly tired he didnt realize what he was saying nonsense no siree no by god thats it i said and clint that still leaves it plenty bad for the boy it leaves it lousy for him and his parents if he walked out of the place this minute hed still be getting the rawest deal a kid could get hell suffer for it the rest of his life think of it clint think of what its going to mean to him at school and after he leaves school starts looking for a job or when he meets some nice gal and wants to get married would you want a child of yours to run around with a kid who was the prime suspect in a rapemurder case would you want him on your payroll would you want your daughter to marry him would you want to associate with him yourself dont say it clint dont tell me people will forget theyll forget all right that he wasnt convicted its like the old song the words are ended but the melody lingers on and itll get louder and uglier wherever he goes whatever he does as long as he lives thats what you say i feel otherwise mind you now he held up a hand mind you my mind isnt closed on the matter you show me something just anything at all that might cast a reasonable doubt on his guilt and ill be most happy to consider it youll find me unusually receptive kossy ill be just as pleased as you are but hell i cant let him go clint i said itll still be bad enough so arent you being remiss then in asking me to discharge him shouldnt you prove him innocent beyond any shadow of a doubt is anything less fair to him clint i said how many of these sex murderers are ever run down you cant type them on modus operandi theyre not peculiar to any particular group or class they look like you and me and everyone else and they are you and me and everyone else the corner grocer and the chainstore executive the bum and the big business man the choir singer and the dice hustler the minister the prize fighter the guy who mows your lawn and the guy who kossy i think you must have misunderstood me i said nothing about your producing the guil another suspect that isnt what i said at all isnt that about what it amounts to not at all we have evidence of his guilt i merely pointed out that without something to dispel that evidence some reasonably concrete proof of innocence my hands were tied you can see that kossy you cant conscientiously expect me to drop the case it wouldnt be fair to the boy he reached for the cigar box again raised his eyebrows at me i shook my head ill get him off clint i said ill get a verdict or a dismissal you aint got a god damn thing but the confession and ill rip it to pieces itll have more holes in it than a whores convention he laughed ah kossy ill bet you do take my hide off at that however i dont think id count too much on getting him off let him go clint i know you want to i cant kossy its simply unthinkable let him go give him a clean bill of health itll still be bad but its better than anything else i cant understand me kossy i cant i hadnt actually expected him to just hoped his case might not be too strong but it was stronger than mine and with all the newspapers raising hell keeping the deal spotlighted no he couldnt do it i picked up my briefcase from the floor and stood up all right clint i said i guess that takes care of everything for the present now if i can have a little chat with the boy certainly certainly he punched a button on his desk ill tell the matron to clear out and see that youre not disturbed incidentally i think youll see that weve done everything possible to make things pleasant for bob im sure of it i said now about that civil court appointment clint im really going to pour the coal on that im only sorry i didnt get busy on it sooner kossy he said i well i just dont know what to say i dont know how to thank you nuts i said thank me you dont even know anything about it why dont we have lunch some time soon ill give you a ring youd better let me call you i said you know how it is i never know whats going to crop up until the very last minute what about sunday youre not busy on sunday come out for dinner and spend the afternoon with us we havent had a good talk in a long time thanks i said id love to give me a raincheck will you some other time im kind of tied up for the next few weeks his smile faded he turned and stared out the window spoke with his back turned to me he was thinking of that christ murder remark youll never forget that will you he said you cant forget it forget what i said i dont know why i said it kossy you know im no antisemite id give anything in the world if i hadnt said it i know theres no use in saying im sorry but sorry i said what about what are you supposed to have said i didnt hear you say a thing clint l kossmeyer the kid seemed quite contented and at peace with the world they usually are that way after a hard sweating theyve been down through hell and come up the other side and theyre still right there on the brink but it seems nice no more questions no more loud voices and bright lights no more scowls and frowns nothing but smiles and friendliness quiet and rest youve done the right thing see and possibly it is the right thing but its still wrong guilty or innocent its wrong its difficult to place a rope around a mans neck the law slowly evolving through the centuries winding its way up through dungeons and torture chambers emerging at last into the sunlight intended it to be difficult now in suffering the law to be put aside in placing the rope where others could not place it in retreating to the evil chaos of nolaw you have done the right thing and you are rewarded for it and so too are the men like clinton rewarded men who achieve the surface right through the depthless wrong convictions those are the sole criteria in judging the clintons for the law has changed but people have not they are still lingering back in the shadows thumbs turned down on the fallen hustling wood for the witchburner donning their bedsheets and boots at the first smell of blood there was a portable radio going in the window the table was loaded down with fruit and candy bars and potato chips and he had a stack of comic books two feet high he was reading one of the comic books when i went in turning the pages with his finger tips since he had a coke in one hand and a banana in the other he went on reading it answering me absently apparently unconcerned with what had happened and what might happen he was all right now miraculously he had been snatched up from the abyss he did not want to leave the present to look back from it or beyond it he inquired about his folks why hadnt they come to see him i said that theyd wanted to but id felt theyd better not they were badly upset it would be hard on everyone concerned well he said idly i guess maybe thats right i guess maybe they better wait he turned a page of the comic book he read it the coke and banana moving alternately to his mouth and turned another one wait for what bob i said until you serve your sentence or until you get out of the nut house what he said listen to me bob i said i bob yeah he frowned fretfully without looking up im listening aint i i snatched the comic book out of his hand and threw it across the room i brushed the banana into the wastebasket and tossed the coke after it he said hey whatd you do shut up i said im asking all the questions get me i ask the questions and you give the answers and you have your mind on em when you do it do you understand that bob i asked you if you understood that some of the vagueness went out of his eyes he nodded sullenly a little fearfully all right i said question number one why did you lie to me that first night i talked to you lie i didnt tell you any lie who did you lie to come on spit it out you told me you didnt kill josie eddleman and you told the district attorney that you did now which was the lie well i mr clinton said to hell with what mr clinton said i dont give a fastday fart for what he said did you lie to me did you kill that girl he shook his head huhuh o course i didnt you lied to mr clinton then if you didnt lie to me you lied to him isnt that right bob both stories couldnt have been the truth if you told me the truth you didnt tell him the truth isnt that right he hesitated i said well how about it well uh you see his eyes wavered i was kind of mixed up i wanted to tell him the truth but i was mixed up so he said well maybe it was this way an that way how did i know it wasnt and maybe it could have been and i said maybe it was i guess it was i was all mixed up and he wasnt so i told him the truth like he said i see i said you told him you killed josie and that was the truth and you told me you didnt kill her and that was the truth uhhuh thats i slapped him across the mouth i swung my hand back and forth slapping him palm and backhand the matron pounded on the door and rushed in i told her to beat it im slapping hell out of a client i said and i dont want to be disturbed im going to report this to mr clinton you do that i said take your time going and dont hurry back she slammed out and of course she didnt return clint knew what i was doing he couldnt object to it with slight variations and with naturally a contrary purpose i was doing exactly what hed done i led the boy over to the sink telling him hell not to cry i was just trying to be his friend and hed thank me for it some day i helped him to wash his face kidding and joshing until he began to smile a little thats swell i said thats my boy now well start getting somewhere were not mixed up any more now are we nno sir you didnt kill josie did you no sir i guess i no sir you told me the truth what you told mr clinton was not the truth yes sir you were out at the golf course at noon before noon and for some time afterwards yes sir did mr clinton make any promises to you for giving him that confession did he say something like well you tell us you killed josie and well let you go well he hesitated i kind of felt like he did he said that if id do the right thing he would that he knew i didnt really mean to do it and it was just a mistake and he didnt believe in punishing anyone for but he didnt make you any outright promise no not exactly i guess i mean it kind of seemed like he did but i nodded and unstrapped my briefcase he said mr kossmeyer what will they nothing i said they wont do a damned thing just keep telling the truth and everything will be all right i got the briefcase open and took out a thick sheaf of photographs i spread them out on the lounge in three rows and nodded to him these are aerial photographs bob they were taken from a helicopter they begin there at the trestle the canyon near your home and move in a beeline to the golflinks in other words they show the area you passed through on the way to the links yes sir he said now of course being pictures everything is considerably reduced bear that in mind but its all there all the trees and telephone poles and other landmarks you look at them and show me the route you followed as well as you remember it he bent over the pictures after a moment he turned and looked at me they aint theyre not in the right order you want me to unmix em are you sure i said well yes you straighten them out bob the pictures were actually one picture one long strip photograph which id chopped into sections id mixed those sections up deliberately he had them straightened out within two minutes that didnt prove anything of course but it was a little something some satisfaction to me at least it established that he had been through the area very recently i gave him a pencil and he pointed out the route he had followed he did it very quickly maybe i thought a little too quickly did you always go this same way bob down this little slope and up the next one and so on well he scratched his head you went pretty much the same way each time right thats how you remember it so well he studied my face doubtfully cautiously he wet his lips what he edged back a step what you want me to say mr kossmeyer just the truth bob whatever the truth is thats what i want you to tell me well i guess not then i mean i guess i just went that way that day fine i said soothingly thats the truth and thats all i want now lets see lets see if i remember as well as you do you were pretty excited that day you werent thinking about scenery just walking fast without looking to right or left thats right isnt it bob ive got it right then tell me just the truth tell me how you remember the way you went so well well he swallowed noisily maybe i dont remember maybe if you dont want me to say i bob i said listen to me kid im on your side im your friend im like a doctor see you know how a doctor has to hurt a guy sometimes for his own good well thats me thats what i was doing a moment ago you understand that sure you do you re a smart boy and a damned fine one so so just keep right on telling me the truth tell me how you remember well i dont exactly remember i just kind of know yes it kind of comes back to me i wasnt noticing anything hardly at the time but now i sort of do i mean i kind of know i dont exactly remember but i know swell i said youre doing fine bob most of the time usually itd been some other day id kind of wander around id maybe wander off to look at a rabbit hole or something or maybe id try to jump across a little gully or see if i could hit a telephone pole with a rock or well thats the way id usually do but that day i just wasnt interested in anything like that i just went right straight ahead just the straightest i could go and sure you did i said naturally thats exactly what you would do what anyone would do thats swell bob thats really swell no it didnt prove anything it wasnt nearly enough to swing clint around or to go to trial with still it would help a little it was something to build on it sounded so plausible so authentic you know not the kind of thing a kid could invent on the spur of the moment if hed stick to it if it was true if he just wasnt beating his brains out to please me for fear of getting them beat out i wished i hadnt roughed him i wished to god i hadnt and yet thered been nothing else to do hed had to be snapped out of it fast hell he might have taken days to do it by himself if he ever did it and we didnt have days anyway i didnt only one client i had i got forever to spend with one client you should live so long kossmeyer i opened a coke for him and took one myself i kidded with him some more did a little downing made him laugh a few times he seemed pretty much at ease when we went back to the pictures he answered my questions with only normal hesitation telling the truth apparently without regard for how i might take it yeah that was an excavation there by that highline tower but it had been there a long time he didnt know why it was there unless theyd started to dig the hole for the tower in the wrong place but he hadnt seen anyone working there there hadnt been anyone around those towers since he didnt know when yeah that was a pasture all right those were some cows but the house was way off over on the highway several miles off you had to be over by the highway to see it and he hadnt been anywhere near yeah that was kind of a dump over there on the left that is it had been a dump now though it was fenced in and it was against the law to dump anything there anyway it was too far off from the way hed gone it was over on kind of an old country road that no one used any more yeah that was a pond there were two or three of those little ponds but there wasnt anything in them but maybe a few tadpoles no one fished in em or swam in em or anything hed never seen anyone near them so well he guessed there couldnt have been anyone that day no well yeah he did take a smoke now and then but just when someone had given him one he never bought any he hadnt left any butts lying around the spot where hed sat killing time yeah that was the place right in there in those rocks yeah the ground was pretty hard there all right maybe there might be some footprints or something but that wouldnt prove anything would it he might have made them some other day yeah he had this wristwatch hed had that watch for well almost always his dad had bought it for him when they were in the city together and yeah thats how hed known the time he hadnt asked anyone there hadnt been anyone to ask we came to the end of the pictures but he rambled on a minute or two longer talking about the watch and the time his dad had bought it for him then he looked at me and the skin around his cheekbones seemed to tighten i i guess im not doing so well am i he said nonsense i said youre doing swell bob you just keep it up and everythingll be fine bbut whatll mr clinton do if we cant frig mr clinton i said you aint done a god damned thing and they aint going to do a god damned thing to you now lets go back through these pictures just for the hell of it and we went through the pictures again except that he was a little slower with it it was the same story i got up and paced around the room he watched me started to say something a couple of times and i guess i cut him off pretty short i scraped the pictures up from the lounge and carried them over to the window i held them up to the light turned through them slowly nothing id taken him over every step of the way and there was nothing nothing that might mean people someone who could have seen him i came to the last picture and i cursed out loud why couldnt he have gone on to the golf course why couldnt he have gone at least a little further down the bluff so that he might have been seen from the course why the hell did he have to stay back there in those god damned rocks when i let the pictures slide out of my hands all but the last one i held it up to the light turning it this way and that squinting at it bob i said come here hurry up god damn it yyes sir he came running like a dog yes mr kossmeyer this little dark patch over here on the far right see it see where im pointing down in the bottom of that little swell of land there in those weeds or bushes or whatever they are yes sir i see it what is it it looks like it might be a little clearing yes sir i guess maybe it is maybe i said dont you know youve wandered all over hell out there looked at everything else within a ten mile radius dont you know what this is well i there was some colored people over there once over that way and this big old fat woman she looked pretty mean so i figured id better stay away from there he looked at me anxiously i let out a groan you saw a wait a minute you only saw her the one time and yet you never went near there afterward wwell i guess it was more than that i guess ive seen her pretty often her and some colored kids you guess you must have didnt you didnt you when was the last time well i i god i said god in heaven it must be a garden and youve seen people around it and you didnt tell me about it dont you know they must live around there were you ever over in these woods when was the last time you saw them any of them nnot not very long ago i guess it kind of seems like it wasnt yyou see i dont didnt try to see em i mean i get near there i always kind of look the other way so that well they wont think im spying or anything i kind of try to circle around and pretend like when was the last time you saw them i know you pretended not to look over that way and maybe you circled around but youd damned nearve had to see them if they were around youd know they were there even without looking when was it a week ago two weeks four days that day the day you yyes sir he stammered it was that day i guess thats when it was yes sir i remember now it was that day mr kossmeyer i are you sure are you sure bob i grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him then i managed to get hold of myself and i let go and stood back im sorry i said dont pay me any mind bob you know how it is when a guy gets excited yes sire he eyed me watchfully thats all right mr kossmeyer now it doesnt make a bit of difference see if you saw them fine if you didnt see them fine just tell me the truth either way itll be all right he knew better than that he said i saw them maybe i didnt actually see them but i knew they were there some of em were there bob i said i well tell me this bob right from the beginning ive tried to get you to remember if you saw anyone or passed anyone or talked to anyone who might give you an alibi for the time of the murder i tried that first night i talked to you ive gone back and forth through these pictures today trying to and im sure various other people tried to mr clinton and the detectives and the newspaper men and youve maintained all along that there wasnt anyone that you couldnt remember anyone now you suddenly tell me and im sure you wouldnt deliberately represent now you tell me that wwell he faltered you dont want me to say so i wont if you say i didnt well maybe i didnt i mopped my face i do want you to say so bob but only if it is the truth if youre sure that is thats why im asking how you happen to remember now when you couldnt before just to make sure see he wet his lips again looked down uneasily at the floor yes bob how do you happen to remember why do you remember now when you didnt remember before now well i i guess i was trying not to remember you know how it is something youre kind of afraid of but you cant do anything about so you try to act like it isnt there so well thats kind of the way it was with me and them all those colored people and just me by myself and no one else around i tried to shut em out of my mind and i guess i did i nodded that took care of part of the question it sounded reasonable as of course we both wanted it to go on bob i said you made yourself believe they werent there you convinced yourself that they werent now how do you remember they were well his eyes clouded well i guess it was something you said the way you acted or something it kind of scared me out of not remembering sort of reminded me of them i i dont mean youre like them ocourse but its all right i said dont apologize go on well i remembered they yelled at me too cursed and yelled at me when you started to well you know well it came back to me that theyd cursed and yelled theyd never done that before huhuh youd gone by there day after day theyd seen you day after day and theyd never done anything like that before huhuh well maybe that one other time back when i first noticed that place and that big old colored woman just stood and looked at me maybe she said something that day but that was a long time ago after that they never did anything like that afterwards until four days ago uhhuh no i said not uhhuh bob uhhuh isnt enough ive got to know why well i guess maybe it was the way i was acting just walking straight and not trying to keep out of their way or anything kind of acting like i didnt give a darn i guess they mustve thought i was sort of daring em well that too sounded reasonable it all fitted together perfectly just the way we wanted it to i began gathering up the pictures and putting them in my briefcase all right bob i said thats fine of course you realize ill have to find these colored people and talk to them theyll have to verify your story yeah he said yeah i guess so ill have to do it bob theyll have to verify it swear that its true it wont do us any good if they dont in fact if you should be mistaken it might hurt us a great deal well he said sullenly i cant help what they say i spect theyll probably say i wasnt there just to be mean they act like pretty mean people an thats what theyll probably do bob i said look at me what for im lookin at you aint i look at me he looked up he held my eyes stubbornly for a moment then his face crumpled and he began to cry wwhat you want me to say he sobbed what you want me tto say anyhow mmaybe i didnt maybe i i you dont want rnme to say so i wont i parked my car on the road at the foot of the bluff and climbed up to the top i found the garden a few rows of browning corn with withered sweetpotato and stringbean vines wound round the stalks i found a path and followed it down into the woods their house their dwelling rather had been assembled from packing boxes scraps of sheetiron flattenedout tin cans and other odds and ends of junk a rabbit hutch improvised from an old chicken crate stood on pegs against the house and several moulting hens scratched at the packed earth beneath the trees two negro boys perhaps thirteen and fifteen respectively were shucking beans into a kettle while a third boy ten or thereabouts looked on i said hello and they leaped to their feet the older boy placed himself in front of the other two mammy he called over his shoulder not taking his eyes off me some white man heah there was trouble in the way he said white man there was trouble in the woman who squeezed through the door and silently confronted me hands on hips i could see what bob meant when hed said she was plenty meanlooking this was going to be tough as tough as it could be made on me but i was thinking not so much of the fact as the causes that must lie behind it what had been done to them said and done to them to make them like this i was wondering why clinton had made that remark to me hed apologized hed said he hadnt meant it and i wanted to believe he hadnt but why unless hed had it in his mind for a long time had it slipped out so easily how unless a guy thinks a thing can he say it well no matter it wasnt deliberate only an unfortunate slip of the tongue that was best forgotten and i had forgotten it at any rate i certainly didnt hold any grudge

is a postal card the others are letters mr d a dere sir big red kilt that little edelmun girl we sene her squatin down in the bushes there in the canyun an she had her close pult partways down an big red said o o thats fer me an he hopped off this frate he is a mean sunabitch sir an done me plenty of dirt an i hop he gets the chare canot tell you his rele name he got so minny but will probly be heddin fer west coast la or seatle or mabe frisco big redhed fella an i sure hope you git him as he done plenty dirt to me awt to ben ded long ago dear sir this is purely hearsay but from what i am told by a good friend of mine i have strong doubts that robert talbert killed josephine eddleman rather i incline to the belief that she may have met her welldeserved fate at the hands of some publicspirited citizen whom she seduced such as this good friend of mine now sir i cannot give you this mans name but i assure you that he is a respectable business man and has a fine family of his own and is absolutely trustworthy in every respect he tells me that he was kind enough to offer josephine a ride into the city one day and she made such advances to him as he could not resist and intimacy resulted very foolishly and with the best of intentions he was kind enough to give her his name and telephone afterwards from then on he knew no peace she would make appointments with this man and deliberately fail to keep them or when she did keep them she would tantalize this man until he was almost crazy and then withhold herself sometimes she would allow an intimacy but not out of kindness or any sense of justice only to keep him coming back so that she might torment him the more as much as i hate to speak ill of the dead she was an evil wicked spiteful little slut now sir i cannot give you my name and of course this is mere hearsay more or less but i am convinced that the talbert boy is entirely innocent of this entirely justifiable homicide i believe that this friend of mine who is a very respected citizen and a fine family man met josephine by previous arrangement and that driven to distraction by her sluttish wilfulness he dear mr clinton i cannot tell you how i know without involving a third party but talbert is guilty this is gods truth and i can make him admit it with full and irrefutable details the story i will make him tell is nothing like the one he told you my services will not cost you one red penny and i guarantee results if interested as i trust you will be please address me as follows mr switch c o the corporal punishment association pob city ps can come any time day or night honored sir having recently received news in these parts that a nigger one pearlie may jones and family of three figger boys have given sworn depositions in the eddleman murder case i feel duty bound to advise you that this wench is beyond doubt the most uppity noaccount nigger in the country and the truth is not in her nor in anyone related to her the whole family are liars malingerers and scalawags i would not believe one of them on a stack of bibles this outfit which formerly included the husband and father one union victory jones were at one time croppers on my plantation they were always biggity and backtalky and i would not ordinarily have had them around for five minutes but the war was on and niggers were hard to come by i was finally compelled to take steps when the man accused my storekeeper of giving him false weight i ordered him to leave the plantation forthwith he surlily refused to do so until his crop was in and he used very bad language to the sheriff whom i summoned to evict him he was promptly arrested and taken to jail where i am not sorry to say he was killed in an escape attempt he was a plain bad nigger his family is just as uppity and noaccount as he was they hate whites but they have an even greater hatred of the law given the chance to obstruct justice as they were in this case i have not the slightest doubt that it was after midnight i was sitting in the kitchen with a cup of hot milk when arlene came down the backstairs and peered in at me arlene is the peering peeking type she is incapable of the direct approach sans tiptoeing twittering and headtilting i seem to remember a time when i thought her mannerisms charming on a woman of fifty with her hair in curlers and several ounces of cream on her face the less said about them the better dear she said coming in shouldnt you be in bed im all right i said ill be up after a while but you must get your sleep darling you know you wont feel right tomorrow if you dont i didnt say anything she has made that remark to me at least ten thousand times and i can never think of a reply i wonder why it is that supposedly intelligent men men of at least betterthanaverage intelligence will always marry the stupidest women they can find she sat down at the table next to me cuddled is the word she would use squeezing so close that i could smell the face cream and the vinegary odor of the haircurling lotion for a moment i was afraid she might attempt to steal a sip of my milk but fortunately she forbore i seem to have her pretty well broken of that particular kind of cuteness some more of those awful letters darling she wrinkled her nose in distaste why do you keep reading them anyway theres never anything in them but viciousness and ugly things i believe ive explained i said that its my duty to read them some one of these people who write in may have proof of talberts guilt or innocence but you already know hes innocent you know you do dear i sighed and shook my head do i i said well thank you arlene youve taken a very great load off my mind but dear you said all right i said i believe i did feel in the beginning that there was not a very strong case against the boy but the situation has changed since then can you grasp that thought arlene it isnt actually too complex can you understand that circumstances change that what is true one day may not be true the next wel obviously she couldnt understand it it was too deep for her but what about that negro family darling you said please please arlene i said must you keep quoting me cant i ever make an offhand remark without your throwing it up to me later what are you supposed to be my wife or my conscience now darling she laughed trillingly you know you did say that i said it then i sighed then arlene at the time kossmeyer discovered the family and got their story i thought it was reasonably conclusive and i believed the public would think it was since the public apparently wasnt and isnt completely convinced i may have been wrong at any rate i cant dismiss the case she nodded slowly her forehead puckered in a frown creasing the face cream into white greasy little worms i see she said then it doesnt really matter whether hes guilty or not does it whether he could actually prove that he was innocent it isnt what he is but what other people are if they say hes guilty they dont say so i said they simply dont say that hes innocent theyre not convinced that he is i i hesitated i dont understand it myself all this furor in the newspapers theyve wrung the thing for all its worth and then some but yet they keep on one following the other one trying to outdo the other i know how it got started but but dear you said you werent influenced by the newspapers youve always said that all right i said but you did dear i dont know how many times ive heard you say that oh come now i said surely youve kept count go on and tell me arlene how many times have i said that i wasnt influenced by the newspapers silly she forced a laugh now youre teasing me arent you i turned and looked at her i gave her a long slow look letting my eyes move over her face letting her see them move a little at a time letting her see what i saw then i looked away and picked up my milk she was silent for what must have been more than a minute she hardly seemed to be breathing and yet her laughter went on i could feel her shoulder shiver against mine sense without seeing the rigor mortislike contortions of body and face she rocked back and forth proving herself blithe and unhurt unaware of intended hurt silencing the sounds that would have denied the actions it was a splendid piece of acting i doubt that bernhardt could have done it as well but then i doubt that the divine sarah ever repeated a scene so often as arlene has this one i dont mean to imply that it is the only bit in her repertoire she has others the helpless child the winsome weeper the dignified doormat et cetera and all very effective too for perhaps the first few hundred times you see them but she surpasses herself as the mute and mirthful martyr practice has made her well nigh perfect wwell she spoke at last getting a gasping tremoloish note into her voice yyou see what you do to me dear you simply mustnt tease me any more if youre at all interested i said id like to set the record straight on my attitude toward the newspapers of course darling id love to have you not that you need to do it on my account but im not influenced by the newspapers but i am by public opinion as reflected in the newspapers they dont mold it or make that opinion to any great extent but they do reflect it theyre a barometer of what the public wants or is about to want they may get a little ahead of the public but theyre never behind it theyre never greatly in disagreement with it when they are they get in agreement quickly or they go out of business do you understand what im saying arlene of course certainly dear she nodded earnestly not influenced by newspapers only whats in newspapers is that right darling you know it isnt i said youre deliberately twisting my words what i said was that that oh to hell with it poor darling she patted my arm i just hate myself for being so silly and stupid when you have so many troubles well forget it i said maybe that federal judgeship will come through soon enough to take me off the hook lf that is it comes through at all kossmeyer is doing everything he can but but i wouldnt blame him if he didnt i wouldnt blame him if he actually blocked the appointment made me look like such an abysmal idiot that id be dropped from consideration he could do it id look like seven kinds of a malicious bigoted fool if i was forced to rip into that negro woman and her three children make her look like a liar a malcontent an ignorant spiteful all kossmeyer had to do was sit back and let me cut my own throat darling yes i said what will happen to the boy if when you get the appointment if the case is still pending i mean i dont know i said my successor will have to take care of it oh she said yes i suppose it would be his responsibility i turned and looked at her i said if you want something to worry about arlene ill gladly help you out would you like me to do that give you some suggestions for personal improvement before you start improving others oh you she laughed now you just stop teasing me dear go to bed i said do you hear me arlene i want you to go to bed now and of course she chose deliberately to misunderstand me mmm she said getting up lingeringly oh you naughty bad boy you she moved around the table and struck a pose in front of me seduction in sheer silk and i had to look away quickly or burst into laughter and there are some things you cannot laugh about shed never put on any weight she still had that cute figure as theyd spoken of it in the twenties flatchested hipless thighs hinged to her torso a build like a clothespin you could have laid a thick book even a blackstone flat in her crotch without crimping the binding i kept my eyes on the table forced them to stay there after a time i heard the kitchen door open but there was no sound of its closing arlene i said i asked you to go to bed please isnt it terrible she said slowly isnt it terrible youre just like you always were the very same person and suddenly that isnt good enough any more now its bad youre no good youre treated like youre no good and theres nothing you can do to defend yourself nothing you can say or do you were good you thought you were and you tried to be and you never stop trying but now youre bad and youre punished for it forever and forever i looked up at last i managed a fairly pleasant smile dont worry any more about it i said the newspapers cant keep up their racket much longer talberts going to be all right talbert she said blankly tal oh of course im so sorry darling i guess i was thinking of someone else herself donald skysmith it was about five in the morning when i reached the office the charwomen had just finished their cleaning leaving the venetian blinds drawn high and all the lights burning i got the bottle out of my desk and drew a chair up to the windows i sat there drinking and smoking staring out over the city watching the red spears of sunlight stab through the horizon and splinter into shimmering motes of silvery yellow dawn the slow unsheathing of a sword then the untempered effulgence of day rapacious brutal striking away the merciful shadows challenging the pygmy man to battle daring him to look yet again upon his handiwork and pronounce it good i sat there for a long time until it was not i who looked out at the city but the city that looked in at me i moved back i got up and wandered aimlessly around the room and still it looked in at me appraising me thoughtfully studying the rhodes scholar the guggenheim fellow the pulitzer prizewinner the managing editor those things this thing this peculiar and puzzling animal that was donald skysmith able bodied yes he was ablebodied intelligent well yes one would have to assume so kindly a man of good heart of course certainly well why then why had the donald skysmith become this donald skysmith what had happened to him what had he been trying to get and what had he got i looked around the office i lowered the blinds and drew their slats tight and i turned off all the lights that was better the burning in my eyes grew less painful and there was some small surcease from the blinding brainsplitting headache i sat down at the desk and pillowed my head on my arms i hadnt had any sleep last night teddy had taken a sudden turn for the worse shortly after i reached home and it was not until one in the morning that that the doctor had left the children were very wakeful and in need of reassuring about teddy by the time i got them sufficiently soothed to be turned over to their nurse sleep was impossible for myself probably it would have been impossible anyway teddy theodora poor teddybear but she was all right now shed be swell from now on as good now in a way as she used to be laughing and cutting up carrying on as much over a sack of popcorn as you would a tencourse banquet god i could hear her now the shrieks and squeals the oohs and ohs and ahs the giggles and snickers the wondrous and wondering delight in simply being alive i could feel the thin arms hugging around my neck see the toolarge eyes laughing innocently into mine i marveled that i could ever have got annoyed with her a little irritated and eversoslightly bored it was such a short time really since wed been together hardly more than yesterday it seemed since our marriage i was working in oklahoma city no it was tulsa hell how could i get mixed up on a thing like that and teddy well lets see oh yes teddy was going to the university there and working as a parttime teller in a bank thats how i met her i cashed my paycheck there and it just seemed a step from that to getting her in bed and i didnt know until it was too late that she was virginal teddy thought it was a wonderful joke on me she thought it was wonderful period she squealed and groaned so ecstatically that my landlady came up and pounded on the door well i had a short payday that week some lousy loan shark had garnisheed my wages but teddy had a pretty good watch and a heavy gold crucifix so we hocked those and caught a bus into kansas we barely had enough for the trip the license and the jps fee she was pregnant the first month and i think that must have marked the beginning of the cancer because of course anything but an abortion was out of the question and we didnt have the money for a good one she bled for days on end until i didnt see how a drop of blood could be left in her and long after the bleeding stopped the pain continued night after night i sat with her on my lap holding her and rocking her as you might rock a baby it was the only way she could go to sleep the only thing that helped the pain it was as though part of the pain went out of her and came into me and we shared it together some nights we were like that all night long and with every creak of the rocker the one thought burned deeper and deeper into my mind i made a song out of it a song that was a promise never again teddy never again my teddybear no more pain for dons sweet teddy never never ever teddybear that was the way it went something along that order and then there was the refrain bye bye byeohbeddy sleep sleep my little teddy sleep sleep my sweet the phone was ringing i snatched up the receiver and answered before my eyes were opened habit you know the firehorse lunging into harness at the sound of the bell there was no practical reason for politeness and promptness it was the captain he went on talking to the operator youre very sure now miss hes the genuine donald skysmith he hee hee yyes sir its mr skysmith sir youre positive are you theres no chance that he might be an impostor yes sir im sure tee hee hee i raised the receiver up to arms length took careful aim and crashed it down into the cradle as hard as i could i hoped it burst their god damned eardrums i hoped it knocked that bitch off her chair and that sonofabitch out of his halfacre bed the lousy filthy rotten bastardly fascistic old fart id get that whoremonger yet by god id get him yet id swing those god damned floozies by the heels beat the piss out of him with his own floozies and then id make a pile out of them with him at the top and burn the whole shideree to a cinder id the phone was ringing again i looked at it dully beat him burn him why when he was already doing so much worse to himself he must be you know he had to be sensibility presupposes sensitivity one cannot be at once sensible and insensible he did nothing without thinking it through carefully without complete realization of the consequences he had to know what he was doing knowingly he created a hell of wretchedness and violence bigotry ignorance and class hatred and the knowledge of what he had deliberately created must be more searing than the hell itself but why why was he the way he was well why was i and dont we all dig our hells i lifted the receiver and said hello captain ah don he said how are you this morning im all right i said and teddy what about teddy don shes all right now i said she was never better in fact she gave me a little message to pass on to you just before she went to sleep last night thats very touching don what was the message i told him and no i wasnt making it up i used her exact words here it is captain she said tell the old horses ass to kiss mine wonderful he laughed softly a wonderful girl teddy i liked her from the moment i met her and i dont like many people thats quite a coincidence isnt it i said the phone seemed to go completely dead for a few moments if anyone but the captain had been on the wire id have thought hed hung up but the captain never did things that way when the captain was through with you he said so until he did say so my heart began to pound with a kind of dull excitement with hope and something akin to selfhorror i still wanted my job i was still willing anxious to go on if i was allowed to he cleared his throat hesitated for a second to get my attention its difficult isnt it don a graphic ifiustration of darwins soundness man may be uncomfortable in the trees but hes by nature a climbing animal he you still must live get ahead the excitement was growing and the horror with it i wanted to stay on here work live get ahead climb and i hated myself for wanting to i dont know don he said quietly id like to think about it a few minutes meanwhile what happened on this talbert story i never intended for you to go to such extreme lengths you knew i didnt we were after our opposition not the boy why did you make such a thoroughgoing botch of things i i stared down at the desk trying to come to a decision its jumped our circulation captain as much as its lost does the temporary jump in newsstand sales offset what weve lost the alienation of a large block of solid regular readers i dont think so don and you havent answered my question i dont think i need to i said you already know just as you know everything else that happens here yes he said i already know but theres one thing i dont know don i cant understand why you allowed a man like willis to remain on the star a man who apparently was shrewder than you that was very bad management one of the first concerns of an efficient executive is to eliminate potential competition willis is a good newspaper man i said i had no reason to fire him ah don you disappoint me more and more i tried to promote him i said when he was organizing the union he laughed at me perhaps you didnt offer him anything good enough don perhaps i didnt he sighed i could picture the thoughtful calculating look on his vultures face getting back to the talbert story don you were over a barrel but why stay over it why havent you swung the other way gone over to the boys side started a defense fund for him given him the treatment in reverse that would give us another jump on the opposition it would get back our solid circulation and were going to have to do it were going to free the boy why havent you done it before this a story thats all the boy was the story had run out and we needed another only one reason i said i wasnt smart enough i see he murmured well the realization itself contains a great deal of wisdom perhaps yes sir i said and was there eagerness in my voice yes captain i dont know don perhaps youve never needed to be prodded to have a club swung at you it was at my hand so i used it but possibly it wasnt necessary you might even do much better without it i think i think id like to have you step over to the windows don stick your head out sir i said you heard me put your head out the window then come back and tell me whether it is raining no i said no i its not necessary sir i know it isnt raining don no i tell you it isnt i heard it then the gust of wind the drops striking against the panes i waited and again there was that long dead silence and then at last another sigh youre guilty of a very common failing don fear of symbols you think i make a puppet out of you you dont like it youre humiliated degradation by association and yet all im doing is testing you your powers of observation to get ahead to climb youve got to observe still you must be very tired you must be very very tired i suggest you go downstairs and get yourself a cup of coffee nno no i said who the hell do you think you are anyway who the hell do you think you are do you think youre god yes dont you think that you are get the coffee don yyes sir i said yes captain i laid the receiver on the desk very gently i went out through the city room and down on the elevator to the lobby i walked blindly down the street toward the lunchroom i came to it and i passed it by and i entered a bar i sat down on one of the leathercovered stools and ordered a double scotch with water i was down near the bottom of the drink when a waiter touched my shoulder i followed him to the telephone yes captain i said the club was necessary wasnt it don he said you have to be driven and now i have nothing to drive you with no way of bringing pressure on you i cant use teddys health any more nothing to tempt you or make you afraid or make you work harder nothing i said and it feels good your desk is being cleared out don and the business office is preparing your check if youll just remain where you are a copy boy will be down with everything within the next few minutes its ninethirty i said i expect to be paid for every damned minute i have to wait i assumed you would youll find the check takes care of your salary through ninefortyfive and don well i said he was silent spit it out i said what have you got to say he coughed apologetically he didnt sound at all like the captain im afraid i cant say it don i dont seem to be able to find the words to express what i feel all i can say is that im sorry i was very sorry to learn of teddys death end
