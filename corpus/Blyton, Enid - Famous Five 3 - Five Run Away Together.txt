famous five five run away togetherblyton enid it was exciting remembering all the things that had happened last year it made george long all the more for the next day when her three friends would arrive i wish mother would let us go and live on the island for a week thought george that would be the greatest fun we could have to live on my very own island it was georges island it really belonged to her mother but she had said two or three years back that george could have it and george now thought of it as really her own she felt that all the rabbits on it belonged to her all the wild birds and other creatures ill suggest that we go there for a week when the others come she thought excitedly well take our food and everything and live there quite by ourselves we shall feel like robinson crusoe she went to meet her cousins the next day driving the pony and trap by herself her mother wanted to come but she said she did not feel very well george felt a bit worried about her so often lately her mother had said she didnt feel very well perhaps it was the heat of the summer the weather had been so very hot lately day after day had brought nothing but blue sky and sunshine george had been burnt a darkbrown and her eyes were startlingly blue in her sunburnt face she had had her hair cut even shorter than usual and it really was difficult to know whether she was a boy or a girl the train came in three hands waved madly from a window and george shouted in delight julian dick anne youre here at last the three children tumbled pellmell out of their carriage julian yelled to a porter our bags are in the guards van hallo george how are you golly youve grown they all had they were all a year older and a year bigger than when they had had their exciting adventures on kirrin island even anne the youngest didnt look such a small girl now she flung herself on george almost knocking her over and then went down on her knees beside timothy who was quite mad with joy to see his three friends there was a terrific noise they all shouted their news at once and timothy barked without stopping we thought the train would never get here oh timothy you darling youre just the same as ever woof woof woof mothers sorry she couldnt come and meet you too george how brown you are i say arent we going to have fun woof woof shut up tim darling and do get down youve bitten my tie almost in half oh you dear old dog its grand to see you woof the porter wheeled up their luggage and soon it was in the ponycart george clicked to the waiting pony and it cantered off the five in the little cart all talked at once at the top of their voices tim far more loudly than anyone else for his doggy voice was strong and powerful i hope your mother isnt ill said julian who was fond of his aunt fanny she was gentle and kind and loved having them all i think it must be the heat said george what about uncle quentin asked anne is he all right the three children did not very much like georges father because he could get into very fierce tempers and although he welcomed the three cousins to his house he did not really care for children so they always felt a little awkward with him and were glad when he was not there fathers all right said george cheerfully only hes worried about mother he doesnt seem to notice her much when shes well and cheerful but he gets awfully upset if anything goes wrong with her so be a bit careful of him at the moment you know what hes like when hes worried the children did know uncle quentin was best avoided when things went wrong but not even the thought of a cross uncle could damp them today they were on holiday they were going to kirrin cottage they were by the sea and there was dear old timothy beside them and fun of all kinds in store for them shall we go to kirrin island george asked anne do lets we havent been there since last summer the weather was too bad in the winter and easter holidays now its gorgeous of course well go said george her blue eyes shining do you know what i thought i thought it would be marvellous to go and stay there for a whole week by ourselves we are older now and im sure mother would let us go and stay on your island for a week cried anne oh that would be too good to be true our island said george happily dont you remember i said i would divide it into four and wed all share it well i meant it you know its ours not mine what about timothy said anne oughtnt he to have a share as well cant we make it five bits one for him too he can share mine said george she drew the pony to a stop and the four children and the dog gazed out across the blue bay theres kirrin island said george dear little island i can hardly wait to get to it now i havent been able to go there yet because my boat wasnt mended then we can all go together said dick i wonder if the rabbits are just as tame as ever woof said timothy at once he had only to hear the word rabbits to get excited its no good your thinking about the rabbits on kirrin said george you know i dont allow you to chase them tim timothys tail dropped and he looked mournfully at george it was the only thing on which he and george did not agree tim was firmly convinced that rabbits were meant for him to chase and george was just as firmly convinced that they were not get on said george to the pony and jerked the reins the little creature trotted on towards kirrin cottage and very soon they were all opposite the front gate a sourfaced woman came out from the back door to help them down with their luggage the children did not know her whos she they whispered to george the new cook said george joanna had to go and look after her mother who broke her leg then mother got this cookmrs stick her name is good name for her grinned julian she looks a real old stick but all the same i hope she doesnt stick here for long i hope joanna comes back i liked old fat joanna and she was nice to timmy mrs stick has a dog too said george a dreadful animal smaller than tim all sort of mangy and motheaten tim cant bear it where is it asked anne looking round its kept in the kitchen and tim isnt allowed near it said george good thing too because im sure hed eat it he cant think whats in the kitchen and goes sniffing round the shut door till mrs stick nearly goes mad the others laughed they had all climbed down from the ponycart now and were ready to go indoors julian had helped mrs stick in with all the bags george took the ponycart away and the other three went in to say howdoyoudo to their uncle and aunt well dears said aunt fanny smiling at them from the sofa where she was lying down how are you all im sorry i could not come to meet you uncle quentin is out for a walk you had better go upstairs and wash and change then come down for tea the boys went up to their old bedroom with its queer slanting roof and its window looking out over the bay anne went to the little room she shared with george how good it was to be back again at kirrin what fun they would have these holidays with george and dear old timmy chapter two the stick family it was lovely to wake up the next morning at kirrin cottage and see the sun shining in at the windows and to hear the faroff plashplashplash of the sea it was gorgeous to leap out of bed and rush to see how blue the sea was and how lovely kirrin island looked at the entrance of thebay im going for a bathe before breakfast said julian and snatched up his bathing trunks coming dick you bet said dick call the girls well all go so down they went the four of them with tim galloping behind them his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen and his long pink tongue hanging out of his mouth he went into the water with the others and swam all round them they were all good swimmers but julian and george were the best they put towels round themselves rubbed their bodies dry and pulled on jeans and jerseys then back to breakfast they went as hungry as hunters anne noticed a boy in the back garden and stared in surprise whos that she said oh thats edgar mrs sticks boy said george i dont like him he does silly things like putting out his tongue and calling rude names edgar appeared to be singing when the others went in at the gate anne stopped to listen georgieporgie pudding and pie sang edgar a silly look on his face he seemed about thirteen or fourteen a stupid yet slylooking youth georgieporgie pudding and pie george went red hes always singing that she said furiously just because im called george i suppose he thinks hes clever i cant bear him julian called out to edgar you shut up youre not funny only jolly silly georgieporgie began edgar again a silly smile on his wide red face julian made a step towards him and he at once disappeared into the house shant stand much of him said julian in a decided voice i wonder you do george i wonder you havent slapped his face stamped on his foot bitten his ears off and done a few other things you used to be so fierce welli am still really said george i feel frightfully fierce down inside me when i hear edgar singing silly songs at me like that and calling out namesbut you see mother really hasnt been well and i know jolly well if i go for edgar mrs stick will leave and poor old mother would have to do all the work and she really isnt fit to at present so i just hold myself in and hope that timmy will do the same good for you old thing said julian admiringly for he knew how hard it was for george to keep her temper at times i think ill just go up to mothers room and see if shed like breakfast in bed said george hang on to old timmy a moment will you if edgar appears again he might go for him julian hung on to timmys collar timmy had growled when edgar had been in the garden now he stood stock still his nose twitching as if he were trying to trace some smell suddenly a mangylooking dog appeared out of the kitchen door it had a dirty white coat out of which patches seemed to have been bitten and its tail was well between its legs wooooof said timmy joyfully and leapt at the dog he pulled julian over for he was a big dog and the boy let go his hold of the dogs collar timmy pounced excitedly on the other dog who gave a fearful whine and tried to go into the kitchen door again timmy come here sir yelled julian but timmy didnt hear he was busy trying to snap off the other dogs earsor at least that is what he appeared to be doing the other dog yelled for help and mrs stick appeared at the kitchen door a saucepan in her hand call off that dog she screeched she hit out at timmy with the saucepan but he dodged and it hit her own dog instead making it yelp all the more dont hit out with that said julian youll hurt the dogs hi timmy timmy edgar now appeared looking very scared he picked up a stone and seemed to be watching his chance to hurl it at timmy anne shrieked youre not to throw that stone youre not to you bad wicked boy in the middle of all this turmoil uncle quentin appeared looking angry and irritable good heavens what is all this going on i never heard such a row in my life then george appeared flying out of the door like the wind to rescue her beloved timothy she rushed to the two dogs and tried to pull timmy away her father yelled at her come away you little idiot dont you know better than to separate two fighting dogs with your bare hands wheres the garden hose it was fixed to a tap nearby julian ran to it and turned on the tap he picked up the hose and turned it on the two dogs at once the jet of water spurted out at them and they leapt apart in surprise julian saw edgar standing near and couldnt resist swinging the hose a little so that the boy was soaked he gave a scream and ran in at once what did you do that for said uncle quentin annoyed george tie timothy up at once mrs stick didnt i tell you not to let your dog out of the kitchen unlessyou had him on a lead i wont have this kind of thing happening wheres the breakfast late as usual mrs stick disappeared into the kitchen muttering and grumbling taking her drenched dog with her george looking sulky tied timothy up he lay down in his kennel looking beseechingly at his mistress ive told you not to take any notice of that mangylooking dog said george severely now you see what happens you put father into a bad temper for the rest of the day and mrs stick will be so angry she wont make any cakes for tea timmy gave a whine and put his head down on his paws he licked a few hairs from the corner of his mouth it was sad to be tied upbut anyhow he had bitten a bit off the tip of one of that dreadful dogs ears they all went in to breakfast sorry i let timmy go said julian to george but he nearly tore my arm off i couldnt possibly hold him hes grown into an awfully powerful dog hasnt he yes said george proudly he has he could eat mrs sticks dog up in a mouthful if wed let him and edgar too and mrs stick said anne allof them i dont like any of them breakfast was rather a subdued meal as aunt fanny was not there but uncle quentin wasand uncle quentin in a bad temper was not a very cheerful person to have at the breakfasttable he snapped at george and glared at the others anne almost wished they hadnt come to kirrin cottage but her spirits rose when she thought of the rest of the daythey would take their dinner out perhaps and have it on the beachor maybe even go out to kirrin island uncle quentin wouldnt be with them to spoil things mrs stick appeared to take away the porridge plates and bring in the bacon she banged the plates down on the table no need to do that said uncle quentin irritably mrs stick said nothing she was scared of uncle quentin and no wonder she put the next lot of plates down quietly what are you going to do today asked uncle quentin towards the end of breakfast he was feeling a little better by that time and didnt like to see such subdued faces round him we thought we might go out for a picnic said george eagerly i asked mother she said we might if mrs stick will make us sandwiches well i shouldnt think shell try very hard said uncle quentin trying to make a little joke they all smiled politely but you can ask her there was a silence nobody liked the idea of asking mrs stick for sandwiches i do wish she hadnt brought stinker said george gloomily everything would be easier if he wasnt here is that the name of her son asked uncle quentin startled george grinned oh no though it wouldnt be a bad name for him because he hardly ever has a bath and hes jolly smelly its her dog i mean she calls him tinker but i call him stinker because he really does smell awful i dont think its a very nice name said her father in the midst of the others giggles no it isnt said george but then he isnt a very nice dog in the end it was aunt fanny who saw mrs stick and arranged about the sandwiches mrs stick went up to see aunt fanny who was having breakfast in bed and agreed to make sandwiches though with a very bad grace i didnt bargain for three more children to come traipsing along she said sulkily i told you they were coming mrs stick said aunt fanny patiently i didnt know i should be feeling so ill myself when they came if i had been well i could have made their sandwiches and done many more things i can only ask you to help as much as you can till i feel better i may be all right tomorrow let the children have a good time for a week or so and then if i still feel ill i am sure they will all turn to and help a bit but let them have a good time first the children took their packets of sandwiches and set off on the way they met edgar looking as stupid and sly as usual why dont you let me come along with you he said lets go to that island i know a lot about it i do no you dont said george in a flash you dont know anything about it and id never take you its my island see well ours it belongs to all four of us and timmy too we should never allow you to go tisnt your island said edgar thats a lie that is you dont know what youre talking about said george scornfully come on you others we cant waste time talking to edgar they left him looking sulky and angry as soon as they were at a safe distance he lifted up his voice georgieporgie pudding and pie she knows how to tell a lie georgieporgie pudding and pie julian made as if he would go back after the rude edgar but george pulled him on hell only go and tell tales to his mother and shell walk out and therell be no one to help mother she said ill just have to put up with it well try and think of some way to get our own back though nasty creature i hate his pimply nose and screwedup eyes woof said timmy feelingly timmy says he hates stinkers miserable tail and silly little ears explained george and they all laughed that made them feel better they were soon out of hearing of edgars silly song and forgot all about him lets go and see if your boat is ready said julian then maybe we could row out to the dear old island chapter three a nasty shock georges boat was almost ready but not quite it was having a last coat of paint on it it looked very gay for george had chosen a bright red paint and the oars were painted red too oh cant we possibly have it this afternoon said george to jim the boatman he shook his head no master george he said not unless you all want to be messed up with red paint itll be dry tomorrow but not before it always made the others smile to hear the boatmen and fishermen call georgina master george the local people all knew how badly she wanted to be a boy and they knew too how plucky and straightforward she was so they laughed to one another and said well they reckoned she behaved like a boy and if she wanted to be called master george instead of miss georgina she deserved it so georgina was master george and enjoyed strutting about in her jeans and jersey on the beach using her boat as well as any fisherboy and swimming faster than them all well go to the island tomorrow then said julian well just picnic on the beach today then well go for a walk so they picnicked on the sands with timothy sharing more than half their lunch the sandwiches were not very nice the bread was too stale there was not enough butter inside and they were far too thick but timothy didnt mind he gobbled up as many as he could his tail wagging so hard that it sent sand over everyone timothy do take your tail out of the sand if you want to wag it said julian getting sand all over his hair for the fourth time timmy wagged his tail hard again and sent another shower over him everyone laughed lets go for a walk now said dick jumping up my legs could do with some good exercise where shall we go well walk along the clifftop where we can see the island all the time shall we said anne george is the old wreck still there george nodded the children had once had a most exciting time with an old wreck that had lain at the bottom of the sea a great storm had lifted it up and set it firmly on the rocks they had been able to explore the wreck then and had found a map of the castle in it with instructions as to where hidden treasure was to be found do you remember how we found that old map in the wreck and how we looked for the ingots of gold and found them said julian his eyes gleaming as he remembered it all isnt the wreck battered to pieces yet george no said george i dont think so its on the rocks on the other side of the island you remember so we cant see it from here but we might have a look at it when we go on the island tomorrow yes lets said anne poor old wreck i guess it wont last many winters now they walked along the clifftop with timothy capering ahead of them they could see the island easily and the ruined castle rising up from the middle theres the jackdaw tower said anne looking the other towers fallen down hasnt it look at the jackdaws circling round and round the tower george yes they build in it every year said george dont you remember the masses of sticks round about the tower that the jackdaws dropped when they built their nests we picked some up and made a fire with them once id like to do that again said anne i would really lets do it each night if we stay a week on the island george did you ask your mother oh yes said george she said she thought we might but she would see i dont like it when grownups say theyll see said anne it so often means they wont let you do something after all but they dont like to tell you at the time well i expect she will let us said george after all were much older than last year why julian is in his teens already and i soon shall be and so will dick only anne is small im not said anne indignantly im as strong as you are i cant help being younger hush hush baby said julian patting his little sister on the back and laughing at her furious face hallolook whats that over there on the island he had caught sight of something as he was teasing anne everyone swung round and gazed at kirrin george gave an exclamation gollya spire of smoke surely its smoke someones on my island on our island corrected dick it cant be that smoke must come from a steamer out beyond the island we cant see it thats all but i bet the smoke comes from a steamer we know no one can get to the island but us they dont know the way if anyones on my island began george looking very fierce and angry if anyones on my island illillill youll explode and go up in smoke said dick thereits gone now im sure it was only a steamer letting off steam or smoking hard whatever they do they watched kirrin island for some time after that but they could see no more smoke if only my boat was ready said george restlessly id go over this afternoon ive a good mind to go and get my boat even if the paint tr wet dont be an idiot said julian you know what an awful row wed get into if we go home with all our things bright red have a bit of sense george george gave up the idea she watched for a steamer to appear at one side of the island or another to come into the bay but none came probably anchored out there said dick come on are we going to stand rooted to this spot for the rest of the day wed better get back home said julian looking at his wristwatch its almost teatime i hope your mother is up george its much nicer when shes at meals oh i expect she will be said george come on then lets go back they turned to go back they watched kirrin island as they walked but all they could see was jackdaws or gulls in the sky above it no more spires of smoke appeared it must have been a steamer all the same im going over tomorrow to have a look said george firmly if any trippers are visiting my island ill turn them off our island said dick george i wish youd remember you said youd share it with us welli did share it out with you said george but i cant help feeling its still my island come on im getting hungry they came back at last to kirrin cottage they went into the hall and then into the sittingroom to their great surprise edgar was there reading one of julians books what are you doing here said julian and who told you you could borrow my book im not doing any harm said edgar if i want to have a quiet read why shouldnt i you wait till my father comes in and finds you lolling about here said george my goodness if youd gone into his study youd have been sorry ive been in there said edgar surprisingly ive seer those funny instruments hes working with how dare you said george going white with rage why even we are not allowed to go into my father study as for touching his things well julian eyed edgar curiously he could not imagine why the boy should suddenly be so insolent wheres your father george he said i think we had better get him to deal with edgar he must be mad call him if you like said edgar still lolling in the chair and flicking over the pages of julians book in a most irritating way he wont come what do you mean said george feeling suddenly scared wheres my mother call her too if you like said the boy looking sly go on call her the children suddenly felt afraid what did edgar mean george flew upstairs to her mothers room shouting loudly mother mother where are you but her mothers bed was empty it had not been madebut it was empty george flew into all the other bedrooms shouting desperately mother mother father where are you but there was no answer george ran downstairs her face very white edgar grinned up at her what did i tell you he said i said you could call all you liked but they wouldnt come where are they demanded george tell me at once find out yourself said edgar there was a resounding slap and edgar leapt to his feet holding his left cheek with his hand george had flown at him and dealt him the hardest smack she could edgar lifted his hand to slap her back but julian stood in front youre not fighting george he said shes a girl if you want a fight ill take you on i wont be a girl im a boy shouted george trying to push julian away ill fight edgar and ill beat him you see if i dont but julian kept her off edgar began to edge towards the doorway but he found dick there one minute said dick before you go where are our uncle and aunt grrrrrrr suddenly said timothy in such a threatening voice that edgar stared at him in fright the dog had bared his great teeth and had put up the hackles on his neck he looked very frightening hold that dog said edgar his voice trembling he looks as if hes going to spring at me julian put his hand on tims collar quiet tim he said now edgar tell us what we want to know and tell us quickly or youll be sorry well there isnt much to tell said edgar keeping his eye on timothy he shot a look at george and went on your mother was suddenly taken very ill with a terrible pain hereand they got the doctor and theyve taken her away to hospital and your father went with her thats all george sat down on the sofa looking paler still and rather sick oh she said poor mother i wish i hadnt gone out today oh dearhow can we find out whats happened edgar had slipped out of the room shutting the door behind him so that timmy should not follow the kitchen door was slammed too the children stared at one another feeling sorry and dismayed poor george poor aunt fanny there must be a note somewhere said julian and looked round the room he saw a letter stuck into the rim of the big mirror there addressed to george he gave it to her it was from georges father read it quickly said anne oh dearthis is really a horrid beginning to our holidays here chapter four a few little upsets george read the letter out loud it was not very long and had evidently been written in a great hurry dear george your mother has been taken very ill i am going with her to the hospital i shall not leave her till she is getting better that may be in a few days time or in a weeks time i will telephone to you each day at nine oclock in the morning to tell you how she is mrs stick will look after you all try to manage all right till i come back your loving father oh dear said anne knowing how dreadful george must feel george loved her mother dearly and for once in a way the girl had tears in her eyes george never criedbut it was terrible to come home and find her mother gone like this and father too no one there but mrs stick and edgar i cant bear mother going like this sobbed george suddenly and buried her head in a cushion sheshe might never come back dont be silly george said julian sitting down and putting his arm round her of course she will why shouldnt she didnt your father say he was staying with her till she was getting betterand that would be probably in a few days time cheer up george it isnt like you to give way like this but i didnt say goodbye sobbed poor george and i made her ask mrs stick for the sandwiches instead of me i want to go and find mother and see how she is myself you dont know where theyve taken her and if you did they wouldnt let you in said dick gently lets have some tea we shall all feel better after that i couldnt eat anything said george fiercely timothy pushed his nose into her hands and tried to lick them they were under her buried face the dog whined a little poor timmy he cant understand said anne hes awfully upset because you are unhappy george that made george sit up she rubbed her hands over her eyes and let timmy lick the wet tears off them he looked surprised at the salty taste he tried to get on to georges knee silly timmy said george in a more ordinary voice dont be upset i just got a shock thats all im better now timmy dont whine like that silly im all right im not hurt but timothy felt certain george was really hurt or injured in some way to cry like that and he kept whining and pawing at george and trying to get on to her knee julian opened the door im going to tell mrs stick we want our tea he said and went out the others thought he was rather brave to face mrs stick julian went to the kitchen door and opened it edgar was sitting there one side of his face scarlet where george had slapped it mrs stick was there looking grim if that girl slaps my edgar again ill be after her she said threateningly edgar deserved what he got said julian can we have some tea please ive a good mind to get you none said mrs stick her dog started up from its corner and growled at julian thats right tinker you growl at folks that slap edgari said mrs stick julian was not in the least afraid of tinker if you are not going to get us any tea ill get it myself said the boy where is the bread and where are the cakes mrs stick stared at julian and the boy looked back al her steadfastly he thought she was a most unpleasant woman and he certainly was not going to allow her to get the better of him he wished he could tell her to go but he had a feeling that she wouldnt so it would be a waste of his breath mrs stick dropped her eyes first ill get your tea she said but if ive any nonsense from you ill get you no other meals and if i have any nonsense from you i shall go to the police said julian unexpectedly he hadnt meant to say that it came out quite suddenly but it had a surprising effect on mrs stick she looked startled and alarmed now theres no call to be nasty she said in a much more polite voice weve all had a bit of a shock and were upset likeill get you your tea right now julian went out he wondered why his sudden threat of going to the police had made mrs stick so much more polite perhaps she was afraid the police would get on to his uncle quentin and he would come tearing back uncle quentin wouldnt care for a hundred mrs sticks he went back to the others teas coming he said so cheer up everyone it wasnt a very cheerful company that sat down to the tea mrs stick brought in george was now feeling ashamed of her tears anne was still upset dick tried to make a few silly jokes to cheer everyone up but they fell so flat that he soon gave it up julian was grave and helpful suddenly very grownup timothy sat close beside george his head on her knee i do wish i had a dog who loved me like that thought anne timmy kept gazing up at george out of big brown devoted eyes he had no eyes or ears for anyone but his little mistress now she was sad nobody noticed what they had for tea but all the same it did them goodiand they felt better after it they didnt like to go out to the beach afterwards in case the telephone bell rang and there was news of georges mother so they sat about in the garden keeping an ear open for the telephone from the kitchen came a song georgieporgie pudding and pie sat herself down and had a good cry georgieporgie julian got up he went to the kitchen window and looked in edgar was there alone come on out here edgar said julian in a grim voice ill teach you to sing another song come along edgar didnt stir cant i sing if i want to he said oh yes said julian but not that song ill teach you another come along out no fear said edgar you want to fight me yes i do said julian i think a little bit of good honest fighting would be better for you than sitting singing nasty little songs about a girl who is miserable are you coming out or shall i come in and fetch you ma called edgar suddenly feeling panicky ma where are you julian suddenly reached a long arm in at the window caught hold of edgars overlong nose and pulled it so hard that edgar yelled in pain led go led go youre hurding me led go by dose mrs stick came hurrying into the kitchen she gave a scream when she saw what julian was doing she flew at him julian withdrew his arm and stood outside the window how dare you yelled mrs stick first that girl slaps edgar and then you pull his nose whats the matter with you all nothing said julian pleasantly but theres an awful lot wrong with edgar mrs stick we feel we just must put it right it should be your job of course but you dont seem to have done it youre downright insolent said mrs stick outraged and furious yes i dare say i am said julian its just the effect edgar has on me stinker has the same effect stinker cried mrs stick getting angrier still thats not my dogs name and well you know it well it really ought to be said julian strolling off give him a bath and maybe well call him tinker instead leaving mrs stick muttering in fury he went back to the others they stared at him curiously he somehow seemed a different juliana grim and determined julian a very grownup julian a rather frightening julian im afraid the fats in the fire now said julian sitting down on the grass i pulled old edgars nose nearly off his fat face and ma saw me doing it i guess its open warfare now we shant have a very merry time from now on i doubt if well get any meals well get them ourselves then said george i hate mrs stick i wish joanna would come back i hate that horrid edgar too and that awful stinker lookthere is stinker suddenly said dick putting out his hand to catch timothy who had risen with a growl but timmy shook off his hand and leapt across the grass at once stinker gave a woeful howl and tried to escape but timothy had him by the neck and was shaking him like a rat mrs stick appeared with a stick and lashed out not seeming to mind which dog she hit julian rushed for the hose again edgar skipped indoors at once remembering what had happened to him before the water gushed out and timothy gave a gasp and let go the howling mongrel he held in his teeth stinker at once hurled himself on mrs stick and tried to hide in her skirts trembling with terror ill poison that dog of yours said mrs stick furiously to george always setting on to mine you look out or ill poison him she disappeared indoors and the four children went and sat down again george looked really alarmed do you suppose she really might try to poison timmy she asked julian in a scared voice shes a nasty bit of work said julian in a low tone i think it would be just as well to keep old timmy close by us day and night and only to feed him ourselves from our own plates george pulled timothy to her horrified at the thought that anyone might want to poison him but mrs stick really was awfulshe might do anything like that george thought how she wished her father and mother were back it was horrid to be on their own like this the telephone bell suddenly shrilled out and made everyone jump they all leapt to their feet and timmy growled george flew indoors and lifted the receiver she heard her fathers voice and her heart began to beat fast is that you george said her father are you all right i hadnt time to stay and tell you everything fatherwhat about mother tell me quickhow is she said george we shant know till the day after next said her father ill telephone tomorrow morning and then the next morning too i shant come back till i know shes better oh fatherits awful without you and mother said poor george mrs stick is so horrid now george said her father rather impatiently surely you children can see to yourselves and make do with mrs stick till i get back dont worry me about such things now ive enough worry as it is when will you be back do you think said george can i come and see mother no said her father not for at least two weeks they say ill be back as soon as i can but im not going to leave your mother now she needs me goodbye and be good all of you george put back the receiver she turned to face the others shant know about mother till the day after next she said and weve got to put up with mrs stick till father comes backand goodness knows when that will be its awful isnt it chapter five in the middle of the night mrs stick was in such a bad temper that evening that there was no supper at all julian went to ask about some but he found the kitchen door locked he went back to the others with a gloomy face for they were all hungry shes locked the door he said she really is a dreadful creature i dont believe well get any supper tonight well have to wait till she goes to bed said george well go down and hunt in the larder then and see what we can find they went to bed hungry julian listened for mrs stick and edgar to go to bed too when he heard them going upstairs and was sure their doors had shut he slipped down into the kitchen it was dark there and julian was just about to put on the light when he heard the sound of someone breathing heavily he wondered who it could be was it stinker noit couldnt be the dog it sounded like a human being julian stood there his hand over the light switch puzzled and a little scared it couldnt be a burglar because burglars dont go to sleep in the house they have come to rob it couldnt be mrs stick or edgar then who was it he snapped on the light the kitchen was flooded with radiance and julians eyes fastened on the figure of a small man lying on the sofa he was fast asleep his mouth wide open he was not a very pleasant sight he had not shaved for some days and his cheeks and chin were bluishblack he didnt seem to have washed for even longer than that for his hands were black and so were his fingernails he had untidy hair and a nose exactly like edgars must be dear edgars father thought julian to himself what a sight well poor edgar hadnt much chance to be decent with a father and mother like his the man snored julian wondered what to do he badly wanted to go to the larder but on the other hand he didnt particularly want to wake up the man and have a row he didnt see how he could turn him outfor all he knew his aunt and uncle might have agreed to mrs sticks husband coming there now and again though he hardly thought so julian was very hungry the thought of the good things in the larder made him snap off the light again and creep towards the larder door in the dark he opened the door he felt along the shelves goodthat felt like a pie of some sort he lifted it up and sniffed it smelt of meat a meatpiegood he felt along the shelf again and came to a plate on which were what he thought must be jamtarts for they were round and flat and had something sticky in the middle well a meatpie and jamtarts ought to be all right for four hungry children julian picked up the meatpie and the dish of tarts and made his way carefully out of the larder he pushed the door to with his foot then he turned to go out of the room but in the dark he went the wrong way and by bad luck walked straight into the sofa the dish of tarts got a sudden jerk and one of them fell off it landed on the open mouth of the sleeping man and woke him up with a start blow said julian to himself and began to back away quietly hoping that the man would turn over and go to sleep again but the sticky jamtart sliding down his chin had startled the man and he sat up with a jerk whos there that you edgar what you doing down here julian said nothing but sidled towards what he hoped was the door the man leapt up and lurched over to where he thought the light switch was he found it and switched it on he stared in the greatest astonishment at julian what are you doing here he demanded just what i was about to ask you said julian coolly what do you think youre doing here sleeping in my uncles kitchen ive a right to be here said the man in a rude voice my wifes cook here isnt she my ships in and im on leave your uncle arranged with my wife i could come here then see julian had feared as much how awful to have a mr stick as well as a mrs and master stick in the house it would be quite unbearable i can ask my uncle about it when he telephones in the morning said julian now get out of my way please i want to go upstairs ho said mr stick eyeing the meatpie and jamtarts that julian was carrying ho stealing out of the larder i see nice goingson i must say julian was not going to argue with mr stick who evidently felt that he was topdog get out of my way he said i will talk to you in the morning after my uncle has telephoned mr stick didnt seem as if he was going to get out of the way at all he stood there a nasty little man not much taller than julian a sarcastic smile on his unshaven face julian pursed up his lips and whistled there came a bump on the floor above that was timothy jumping off georges bed then there came the pattering of feet down the stairs and up the kitchen passage timmy was coming he smelt mr stick in the doorway put up his hackles bared his teeth and growled mr stick hastily removed himself from the doorway and then neatly banged the door in the dogs face he grinned at julian now what are you going to do he said shall i tell you said julian his temper suddenly rising im going to hurl this nice juicy meatpie straight into your grinning face he raised his arm and mr stock ducked now dont you do that he said im only pulling your leg see dont you waste that nice meatpie you can go upstairs if you want to he moved away to the sofa julian opened the door and timothy bounded in growling mr stick eyed him uncomfortably dont you let that nasty great dog come near me he said i dont like dogs then i wonder you dont get rid of stinker said julian come here timmy leave him alone hes not worth growling at julian went upstairs with timothy close at his heels the others crowded round him wondering what had happened for they had heard the voices downstairs they laughed when julian told them how he had nearly thrown the meatpie at mr stick it would have served him right said anne though it would have been a great pity because we shouldnt have been able to eat it well mrs stick may be simply horrible but she can cook this pie is gorgeous the children finished all the pie and the tarts too julian told them all about mr stick coming on leave from his ship three sticks are a lot too much said dick thoughtfully pity we cant get rid of them all and manage for ourselves george cant you possibly persuade your father tomorrow to let us get rid of the sticks and look after ourselves ill try said george but you know what he isawfully difficult to argue with but ill try golly im sleepy now come on timmy lets get to bed lie on my feet im hardly going to let you out of my sight now in case those awful sticks poison you soon the four children now no longer hungry were sleeping peacefully they did not fear the sticks coming up to their rooms for they knew that timmy would wake and warn them at once timmy was the best guard they could have in the morning mrs stick actually produced some sort of breakfast which surprised the children very much guess she knows your father will telephone george said julian and she wants to keep herself in the right when did he say he would phone nine oclock wasnt it well its halfpast eight now lets go for a quick run down to the beach and back so off they went the five of them ignoring edgar who stood in the back garden ready to make some of his silly faces at them the children couldnt help thinking he must be a bit mad he didnt behave at all like a boy of julians age when they came back it was about ten minutes to nine well sit in the sittingroom till the telephone rings said julian we dont want mrs stick to answer it first but to their great dismay as they reached the house they heard mrs stick using the telephone in the hall yes sir they heard her say everything is quite all right i can manage the children sir even if they do make things a bit difficult yes sir of course sir well sir its lucky my husband is home on leave from his ship sir because he can help me round like and it makes things easier dont you worry about nothing sir and dont you bother to come back till youre ready ill manage everything george flew into the hall like a wild thing and snatched the receiver out of mrs sticks hand father its me george hows mother tell me quick no worse george said her fathers voice but we shant know anything definite till tomorrow morning im glad to hear from mrs stick that everything is all right im very upset and worried and im glad to feel i can tell your mother that you are all right and everything is going smoothly at kirrin cottage but it isnt said george wildly it isnt its all horrid cant the sticks go and let us manage things by ourselves good gracious me of course not said her fathers voice surprised and annoyed what can you be thinking of i did hope george that you would be sensible and helpful i must say you talk to him julian said george helplessly and thrust the receiver into julians hand the boy put it to his ear and spoke into the telephone in his clear voice good morning sir this is julian im glad my aunt is no worse well she will be if she thinks things are going wrong at kirrin cottage said uncle quentin in an exasperated voice cant you manage george and make her see reason good gracious cant she put up with the sticks for a week or two i tell you frankly julian i am not going to sack the sticks in my absencei want the house ready for me to bring back your aunt if you cant put up with them you had better find out from your own parents if they can take you back for the rest of the holidays but george is not to go with you she is to stay at kirrin cottage thats my last word on the subject but sir began julian wondering how in the world he could deal properly with his hottempered uncle i must tell you that there was a click at the other end of the phone uncle quentin had put down his receiver and gone there was no more to be said blow julian pursed up his mouth and looked round at the others frowning hes gone he said cut me off just as i was trying to reason with him serves you right said mrs sticks harsh voice from the end of the hall now you know where you stand im here and im staying here on your uncles orders and youre all going to behave yourselves or itll be the worse for you chapter six julian defeats the sticks there was a slam the kitchen door shut and mrs stick could be heard telling the news triumphantly to edgar and mr stick the children went into the sittingroom sat down and stared at one another gloomily fathers awful said george furiously he never will listen to anything well after all he is very upset said dick reasonably it was a great pity that he rang before nine so that mrs stick got her say in first what did father say to you said george tell us exactly he said that if we couldnt put up with the sticks anne and dick and i were to go back to our own parents said julian but you were to stay here george stared at julian well she said at last you cant put up with the sticks so youd better all go back i can look after myself dont be an idiot said julian giving her arm a friendly shake you know we wouldnt desert you i cant say i look forward to the idea of being under the thumb of the amiable sticks for a week or two but there are worse things than that well stick it together but the feeble little joke didnt raise a smile even from anne the idea of being under the sticks three thumbs was a most unpleasant prospect timothy put his head on georges knee she patted him and looked round you go back home she said to the others ive got a plan of my own and youre not in it ive got timmy and hell look after me telephone to your parents and go home tomorrow george stared round defiantly her head was up and there was no doubt but that she had made a plan of some sort julian felt uneasy dont be silly he said i tell you we all stand together in this if youve got a plan well come into it but were staying here with you whatever happens stay if you like said george but my plan goes on and youll find youll have to go home in the end come on timothy lets go to jim and see if my boat is ready well go with you said dick he was sorry for george he could see below her defiance and he knew she was very unhappy worried about her mother angry with her father and upset because she felt the others were staying on because of her when they could go back home and have a lovely time it was not a happy day george was very standoffish and kept on insisting that the others should go back home and leave her she grew quite angry when they were as insistent that they would not youre spoiling my plan she said at last you might go back you really might i tell you youre spoiling my plan completely well what is your plan said julian impatiently i cant help feeling youre just pretending youve got a plan so that well go im not pretending said george losing her temper do i ever pretend you know i dont if i say ive got a plan i have got a plan but im not giving it away so its no good asking me its my own secret private plan well i really do think you might tell us said dick quite hurt after all were your best friends arent we and were going to stick by you plan or no planyes even if we spoil your plan as you say we shall still stay here with you i shant let you spoil my plan said george her eyes flashing youre mean youre against me just like the sticks are oh george dont said anne almost in tears dont lets quarrel its bad enough quarrelling with those awful sticks without us quarrelling too georges temper died down as quickly as it had risen she looked ashamed sorry she said im an idiot i wont quarrel but i do mean what i say i shall go on with my plan and i shant tell you what it is because if i do it will spoil the holidays for you please believe me lets take our dinner out with us again said julian getting up well all feel better away from this house today ill go and tackle the old stick dear old ju isnt he brave said anne who would rather have died than go and face mrs stick at that moment mrs stick proved very difficult she felt rather victorious at the time and was also very annoyed to find that her beautiful meatpie and jamtarts had disappeared mr stick was in the middle of telling her where they had gone when julian appeared how you can expect sandwiches for a picnic when youve stolen my meatpie and jamtarts i dont know she began indignantly you can have dry bread and jam for yourpicnic and thats all and whats more i wouldnt give you that either except that im glad to be rid of you good riddance to bad rubbish murmured edgar to himself he was lying sprawled on the sofa reading some kind of highlycoloured comic paper if youve anything to say to me edgar come outside and say it said julian dangerously you leave edgar alone said mrs stick at once theres nothing i should like better said julian scornfully who wants to be with him cowardly little spottyface now now look ere began mr stick from his corner i dont want to look at you said julian at once now look ere said mr stick angrily standing up ive told you i dont want to said julian youre not a pleasant sight insolence said mrs stick rapidly losing her temper no not insolencejust the plain truth said julian airily mrs stick glared at him julian defeated her he had such a ready tongue and he said everything so politely the ruder his words were the more politely he spoke mrs stick didnt understand people like julian she felt that they were too clever for her she hated the boy and banged a saucepan viciously down on the sink wishing that it was julians head under the saucepan instead of the sink stinker jumped up and growled at the sudden noise hallo stinker said julian had a bath yet alas no as smelly as ever arent you you know that dogs name isnt stinker said mrs stick angrily you get out of my kitchen right said julian pleased to go dont bother about the dry bread and jam ill manage something a bit better than that he went out whistling stinker growled and edgar repeated loudly what he had said beiore good riddance to bad rubbish what did you say said julian suddenly poking his head in at the kitchen door again but edgar did not dare to repeat it so off went julian again whistling merrily but not feeling nearly as merry as his whistle he was worried after all if mrs stick was going to make meals as difficult as this life was not going to be very pleasant at kirrin cottage anyone feel inclined to have dry bread and jam for lunch inquired julian when he returned to the others not i rather thought so so i turned down mrs sticks kind offer i vote we go and buy something decent that shop in the village has good sausagerolls george was very silent all that day she was worrying about her mother the others knew she was probably thinking about her plan too they thought and wondered whatever it could be shall we go over to kirrin island today asked julian thinking that it would take georges mind off her worries if they went to her beloved island george shook her head noi she said i dont feel like it the boats all ready i knowbut i just dont feel like it yousee till i know mother is going to get better i dont feel i want to be out of reach of the house if a telephone message came from father the sticks could always send edgar to look for meand if i was on the island he couldnt find me the children messed about that day doing nothing at all they went back to tea and mrs stick provided them with bread and butter and jam but no cake the milk was sour too and everyonehad to have tea without milk which they all disliked as they ate their tea the children heard edgar outside the window he held a tin bowl in his hand and put it down on the grass outside your dogs dinner he yelled he looks like a dogs dinner himself said dick in disgust messy creature that made everyone laugh edgar the dogs dinner said anne any biscuits in that tin on the sideboard do you think george george got up to see timothy slipped out of doors and went to the dish put down forhim he sniffed at it george coming back from the sideboard looked out of the window as she passed and saw him at once the thought of poison came back to her mind and she yelled to timothy making the others jump out of their skins tim tim dont touch it timothy wagged his tail as if to say he didnt mean to touch it anyway george rushed out of doors and picked up the mess of raw meat she sniffed at it you havent touched it have you timothy she said anxiously dick leaned out of the window no he didnt eat any i watched him he sniffed all round and about it but he wouldnt touch it i bet its been dosed with ratpoison or something george was very white oh timmy she said youre such a sensible dog you wouldnt touch poisoned stuff would you woof said timmy decidedly stinker heard the bark and put his nose out of the kitchen door george called to him in a loud voice stinker stinker come here timmy doesnt want his dinner you can have it come along stinker here it is edgar came rushing out behind stinker dont you give that to him he said why not asked george go on edgartell me why not he dont eat raw meat said edgar after a pause he only eats dog biscuits thats a lie said george flaming up i saw him eating meat yesterday here stinker you come and eat this edgar snatched the bowl from george almost snarling at her and ran indoors at top speed george was about to go after him but julian who had jumped out of the window when edgar came up stopped her no good old thing he said you wont get anything out of him the meats probably at the back of the kitchen fire by now from now on we feed timothy ourselves with meat bought from the butcher with our own money dont be afraid that hell eat poisoned stuff hes too wise a dog for that he might if he was terribly awfully hungry julian said george looking rather green now she felt sick inside i wasnt going to let stinker eat that poisoned stuff of course but i guessed that ifit was poisoned one of the sticks would come rushing out and stop stinker eating it and edgar did so it proves it was poisoned doesnt it i rather think it does said julian but dont worry george timmy wont be poisoned but he might he might said george putting her hand on the big dogs head oh i cant bear the thought of it julian i cant i really cant dont think about it then said julian taking her indoors again here have a biscuit you dont think the sticks would poison us do you said anne looking suddenly scared and gazing at her biscuit as if it might bite her no idiot they only want to get timmy out of the way because he guards us so well said julian dont look so scared all this will settle down in a day or two and well have a grand time after all youll see but julian only said this to comfort his little sister secretly he was very worried he wished he could take anne dick and george back to his own home but he knew george wouldnt come and how could they leave her to the sticks it was quite impossible friends must stick together and somehow they must face things until aunt fanny and uncle quentin came back chapter seven better news do you think wed better slip down after the sticks have gone to bed and get some food out of the larder again said dick when no supper appeared that evening julian didnt feel inclined to sneak down and confront mr stick again not that he was afraid of him but the whole thing was so unpleasant this was their house the food was theirsso why should they have to beg for it or take it on the sly it was ridiculous come here timothy said julian the dog left georges side and went to julian looking up at the boy inquiringly youre going to come with me and persuade dear kind mrs stick to give us the best things out of the larder said julian with a grin the others laughed cheering up at once good idea said dick can we all come and see the fun better not said julian i can manage fine by myself he went down the passage to the kitchen the radio was going inside so no one in the kitchen heard julian till he was actually standing inside the door then edgar looked up and saw timothy as well as julian edgar was scared of the big dog who was now growling fiercely he went behind the kitchen sofa and stayed there eyeing timmy fearfully what do you want said mrs stick turning off the radio supper said julian pleasantly supper the best things out of the larderbought with my uncles money cooked on my aunts stove with gas she pays foryes supper open the larder door and lets see what there is in there well of all the nerve began mr stick in amazement you can have a loaf of bread and some cheese said mrs stick and thats my last word well it isnt my last word said julian and he went to the larder door timmy keep to heel growl all you like but dont bite anybodyyet timmys growls were really frightful even mr stick put himself at the other end of the room as for stinker he was nowhere to be seen he had gone into the scullery at the very first growl and was how shivering behind the wringer mrs sticks mouth went into a hard straight line you take the bread and cheese and clear out she said julian opened the larder door whistling softly which annoyed mrs stick more than anything else my word said julian admiringly you do know how to stock a larder i must say mrs stick a roast chicken i thought i smelt one cooking i suppose mr stick killed one of our chickens today i thought i heard a lot of squawking and what fine tomatoes best to be got from the village ive no doubt and oh mrs stickwhat a perfectly marvellous treacle tart i must say youre a good cook i really must julian picked up the chicken the dish of tomatoes and then balanced the plate with the treacle tart on the top mrs stick yelled at him you leave them things alone thats our supper you leave them there youve made a little mistake said julian politely its our supper weve had very little to eat today and we could do with a good supper thanks awfully now look ere began mr stick angrily furious at seeing his lovely supper walking away you surely dont want me to look at you again said julian in a tone of amazement what for have you shaved yetor washed im afraid not so if you dont mind i think id rather not look at you mr stick was speechless he was not ready with his tongue at any time and a boy like julian took his breath away and left him with nothing to say except his favourite now look ere put them things down said mrs stick sharply what do you think were going to have for our supper if you walk off with them you tell me that easy said julian let me offer you our supperbread and cheese mrs stick bread and cheese mrs stick made an angry noise and started to go after julian with her hand raised but timothy immediately leapt at her and his teeth snapped together with a loud click oh howled mrs stick that dog of yours nearly took my hand off the brute ill do for him one day you see if i dont you had a good try today didnt you said julian in a quiet voice fixing his eyes straight on the womans face thats a matter for the police isnt it be careful mrs stick ive a good mind to go to the police tomorrow just as before the mention of the police seemed to frighten mrs stick she cast a look at her husband and took a step backward julian wondered if the man had done something wrong and was hiding from the police he never seemed to put a foot out of doors the boy went up the passage triumphantly timmy followed at his heels disappointed that he hadnt been able to get a nibble at stinker julian marched into the sittingroom and set the dishes carefully down on the table what ho he said look what ive gotthe sticks own supper then he told the others all that had happened and they laughed loudly how do you think of all those things to say said anne admiringly i dont wonder you make them feel wild ju its a good thing weve got timmy to back us up yes i shouldnt feel nearly so bold without timmy said julian it was a very good supper there were knives and forks in the sideboard and the children made do with fruit plates from the sideboard too rather than go and get plates from the kitchen there was bread over from their tea so they were able to make a very good meal they enjoyed it thoroughly sorry we cant give you the chicken bones tim said george but they might split inside you and injure you you can have all the scraps see you dont leave any for stinker timmy didnt with two or three great gulps he cleared his plate and then sat waiting for any scraps of treacle tart that might descend his way the children felt cheerful after such a good meal they had completely eaten the chicken nothing was left except a pile of bones they had eaten all the tomatoes too finished the bread and enjoyed every scrap of the treacle tart it was late anne yawned and then george yawned too lets go to bed she said i dont feel like having a game of cards or anything so they went to bed and as usual timothy lay heavily on georges feet he lay there awake for some time his ears cocked to hear noises from below he heard the sticks go up to bed he heard doors closing he heard a whine from stinker then all was silence timmy dropped his head on to his paws and sleptbut he kept one ear cocked for danger timothy didnt trust the sticks any more than the children did the children awoke very early in the morning julian awoke first it was a marvellous day julian went to the window and looked out the sky was a very pale blue and rosypink clouds floated about it the sea was a clean blue too smooth and calm julian remembered what anne often saidshe said that the world in the early morning always looked as if it had come back fresh from the laundry so clean and new and fresh the children all bathed before breakfast and this time they were back at halfpast eight afraid that georges father might telephone early again julian saw mrs stick on the stairs and called to her has my uncle telephoned yet no said the woman in a surly tone she had been hoping that the telephone would ring while the children were out then as she had done the day before she could answer it and get a few words in first well have breakfast now please said julian a good breakfast mrs stick my uncle might ask us what wed had for breakfast mightnt he you never know mrs stick evidently thought that julian might tell his uncle if she gave them only bread and butter for breakfast so very soon the children smelt a delicious smell of bacon frying mrs stick brought in a dish of it garnished with tomatoes she banged it down on the table with the plates edgar arrived with a pot of tea and a tray of cups and saucers ah here is dear edgar said julian in a tone of amiable surprise dear old spottyface garn said edgar and banged down the teapot timmy growled and edgar fled for his life george didnt want any breakfast julian put hers back in the warm dish and put a plate over it he knew that she was waiting for news if only the telephone would ringthen she would know if her mother was really better or not it did ring as they were halfway through the meal george was there before the bell had stopped pealing she put the receiver to her ear father yes its george hows mother there was a pause as george listened all the children stopped eating and listened in silence waiting for george to speak they would know by her next words if the news was good or not ohoh im so glad they heard george say did she have the operation yesterday oh you never told me but its all right now is it poor mother give her my love i do want to see her oh father cant i come evidently the answer was no george listened for a while then spoke a few more words and said goodbye she ran into the sittingroom you heard didnt you she said joyfully mothers better shell get all right now and will be back home soonin about ten days father wont come back till he brings her home its good news about motherbut im afraid we cant get rid of the sticks chapter eight georges plan mrs stick had overheard the conversation on the telephoneat least she had heard georges side of it she knew that georges mother was better and that her father would not return till her mother could be brought home that would be in about ten days the sticks could have a fine time till then no doubt about that george suddenly found that her appetite had come back she ate her bacon hungrily and scraped the dish round with a piece of bread she had three cups of tea and then sat back contentedly i feel better she said anne slipped her hand in hers she was very glad that her aunt was going to be all right if it wasnt for those awful sticks they could have a lovely time then george said something that made julian cross well now that i know mother is going to be better i can stand up to the sticks all right by myself with timmy so i want you three to go back home and finish the hols without me i shall be all right shut up george said julian weve argued this all out before ive made up my mindand i dont change it any more than you do when ive made it up you make me cross well said george i told you id got a planand you dont come into it im afraidand youll find youll have to go back home whether you mean to or not dont be so mysterious george said julian impatiently what is this strange plan youd better tell us even if were not in it cant you trust us yes of course but you might try to stop me said george looking sulky then youd certainly better tell us said julian feeling uneasy george was such a madcap once she got ideas into her head goodness knows what she might do but george wouldnt say another word julian gave it up at last but secretly made up his mind not to let george out of his sight that day if she was going to carry out some wild plan then she would have to do it under his julians eye but george didnt seem to be carrying out any wild plan she bathed again with the others went for a walk with them and went for a row on the sea she didnt want to go to kirrin island so the others didnt press her thinking that she didnt want to be out of sight of the beach in case edgar came with a message from her father it was quite a pleasant day the children bought sausage rolls again and fruit and picnicked on the beach timmy had a large and juicy bone from the butchers ive got a bit of shopping to do said george about teatime you others go and see if mrs stick is getting some tea for us and ill fly down to the shops and get what i want julian pricked up his ears at once was george sending them off so that she could be alone to carry out this mysterious plan of hers ill come with you said julian getting up dick can tackle mrs stick for once and take timmy with him no you go said george i wont be long but julian was determined not to go in the end they all went with george for dick did not want to face mrs stick without julian or george george went into the little general shop and got a new battery for her torch she bought two boxes of matches and a bottle of methylated spirit whatever do you want that for said anne in surprise oh it might come in useful said george and said no more they all went back to kirrin cottage tea was actually on the table true it was not a thrilling tea being merely bread and jam and a pot of hot teastill it was there and was eatable it rained that evening the children sat round the table and played cards their hearts were lighter now that they had had good news of georges mother in the middle of the game julian got up and rang the bell the others stared at him in the greatest surprise what are you ringing the bell for asked george her eyes wide with astonishment to tell mrs stick to bring some supper said julian with a grin but no one answered the bell so julian rang again and then again the kitchen door opened at last and mrs stick came up the passage evidently in a bad temper she came into the sittingroom you stop ringing that bell she said angrily im not answering any bells rung by you i rang it to tell you that we wanted some supper said julian and to say that if you would rather i came and got it myself from the larderwith timmyas i did last night ill come with pleasure but if not you can bring a decent supper to us yourself if you come stealing things out of my larder again illill began mrs stick youll call in the police julian finished for her do that would please us very much i can see our local policeman taking down all the details in his notebook i could give him quite a few mrs stick muttered something rude under her breath glared at julian as if she could kill him and went off down the passage again by the sound of the clattering and crashing of crockery in the kitchen it was plain that mrs stick was getting some sort of supper for them and julian grinned to himself as he dealt out the cards supper was not as good as the night before but it was not bad it was a little cold ham cheese and the remains of a milk pudding there was also a plate of cooked meat for timmy george looked at it sharply take that away she said i bet youve poisoned it again take it away no on the contrary leave it here said julian ill take it down to the local chemist tomorrow and get him to test it if as george thinks its poisoned the chemist might have a lot of interesting things to tell us mrs stick took the meat away without a word horrible woman said george pulling timothy close to her how i hate her i feel so afraid for timmy somehow that spoilt the evening as it grew dark the children became sleepy its ten oclock said julian bed i think everyone anne ought to have gone long ago she isnt nearly old enough to stay up as late as this well began anne indignantly im nearly as old as george arent i i cant help being younger can i all right all right said julian laughing i shant make you go off to bed by yourself dont worry we all keep together in this house while the sticks are about come on well go now shall we the children were tired they had swum walked and rowed that day julian tried to keep awake a little while but he too fell asleep very quickly he awoke with a jump thinking that he had heard a noise but everything was quiet what could the noise have been was it one of the sticks creeping about noit couldnt be that or tim would have barked the house down then what was it something must have waked him i suppose its not old george doing anything about that plan of hers thought julian suddenly he sat up he felt about for his dressinggown and put it on without waking dick he crept to the girls room and switched on his torch to see that they were all right anne was in her bed sleeping peacefully but georges bed was empty georges clothes were gone blow said julian under his breath where has she gone i bet shes run away to find where her mother is his torch picked out a white envelope pinned to georges pillow he stepped softly over to it it had his name printed on it in bold letters julian julian ripped it open and read it dear julian said the note dont be angry with me please i darent stay in kirrin cottage any longer in case the sticks somehow poison timmy you know that would break my heart so ive gone to live by myself on our island till mother and father come back please leave a note for father and tell him to ask jim to sail near kirrin island with his little red flag flying from the mast as soon as they are back then ill come home you and dick and anne must go back to your own parents now ive gone it would be silly to stay at kirrin cottage with the sticks now im not there love from george julian read the note through well why didnt i guess that was her plan he said to himself thats why we didnt come into it she meant to go off by herself with timmy i cant let her do that she cant live all by herself on kirrin island for so long she might fall ill she might slip on a rock and hurt herself and no one would ever know the boy was really worried about the determined little girl he wondered what to do that noise he heard must have been made by george so she couldnt have got a very long start really if he tore down to the beach george might still be there and he could stop her so in his dressing gown he ran down the front path out of the gate and took the road to the beach the rain had stopped and the stars were out but it was not at all a light night how can george expect to get through those rocks in the dark he thought shes mad shell strike her boat on a rock and sink he tore on in the darkness talking aloud to himself no wonder she wanted a new battery for her torch and matchesand i suppose the methylated spirit was for her little cooking stove why ever couldnt she tell us it would have been fun to go with her he came to the beach he saw the light of a torch where george kept her boat he ran to it his feet sinking in the soft wet sand george idiot youre not to go off like this all alone in the dead of night called julian george was pushing her boat out into the water she jumped when she heard julians voice you cant stop me she said im just off but julian caught hold of the boat as he waded up to his waist in the water george listen to mej you cant go like this youll strike a rock come back no said george getting cross you can go back to your own home julian i shall be all right let go my boat george why didnt you tell me your plan said julian almost swept off his feet by a wave dash these waves i shall have to get into the boat he climbed in he could not see george but he felt quite certain she was glaring at him timmy licked his wet legs youre spoiling everything said george with a break in her voice that meant she was upset im not silly said julian in a gentle voice listenyou come back to kirrin cottage with me now george and ill faithfully promise you something tomorrow well all go to the island with you see the whole lot of us why shouldnt we your mother said we could spend a week there anyway didnt she we shall be out of the reach of those horrible sticks we shall enjoy ourselves and have a marvellous time so will you come back now george and let us go together tomorrow chapter nine an exciting night there was a silence except for the waves splashing round the boat then georges voice came out of the darkness lifted joyfully oh juliando you really mean it will you really come with me i was afraid id get into trouble for doing this because father said i must stay at kirrin cottage till he came backand you know how he hates disobedience but i knew if i stayed there you would tooand i didnt want you to be miserable with those horrid sticksso i thought id come away i didnt think youd come too because of getting into trouble i never even thought of asking you youre a very stupid person sometimes arent you george said julian as if wed care about getting into trouble so long as we were all together sticking by one another of course well come with youand ill take all the responsibility for this escape and tell your father its my fault oh no you wont said george quickly i shall say it was my idea if i do wrong im not afraid to own up to it you know that well we wont argue that now said julian we shall have at least a week or ten days on kirrin island to do all the arguing we want to the thing islets get back now wake up the others for a bit and have a nice quiet talk in the dead of night about this plan of yours i must say its a very very good idea george was overjoyed i feel as if i could hug you julian she said where are the oars oh here they are the boats floated quite a long way out she rowed strongly back to the shore julian jumped out and pulled the boat up the beach with georges help he shone his torch into the boat and gave an exclamation youve quite a nice little store of things here he said bread and ham and butter and stuff how did you manage to get them without old mr stick seeing you tonight i suppose you slipped down and got them out of the larder yes i did said george but there was no one in the kitchen tonight perhaps mr stick has gone to sleep upstairs or maybe he has gone back to his ship anyway there was no one there when i crept down not even stinker wed better leave them here said julian stuff them into that locker and shut down the lid no one will guess theres anything there well have to bring down a lot more stuff if were all going to live on the island golly this is going to be fun the children made their way back to the house feeling thrilled and excited julians wet dressinggown flapped round his legs and he pulled it up high to be out of the way timothy gambolled round not seeming at all surprised at the nights doings when they got back to the house they woke the other two who listened in astonishment to what had happened that night anne was so excited to think that they were all going to live on the island that she raised her voice in joy oh thats the loveliest thing that could happen oh i do think shut up said three furious voices in loud whispers youll wake the sticks sorry whispered anne but ohits so terribly awfully exciting they began to discuss their plans if we go for a week or ten days we must take plenty of stores said julian the thing iscan we possibly find food enough for so long even if we entirely empty the larder i doubt if that would be enough for a week or so we all seem such hungry people somehow julian said george suddenly remembering something i know what well do mother has a storecupboard in her room she keeps dozens and dozens of tins of food there in case we ever get snowed up in the winter and cant go to the village that has happened once or twice you know and i know where mother keeps the key cant we open the cupboard and get out some tins of course said julian delighted i know aunt fanny wouldnt mind and anyway we can make a list of what we take and replace them for her if she does mind it will be my birthday soon and i am sure to get money then wheres the key whispered dick letsgo into mothers room and ill show you where she keeps it said george i only hope she hasnt taken it with her but georges mother had felt far too ill when she left home to think of cupboard keys george fumbled at the back of a drawer in the dressingtable and brought out two or three keys tied together with thin string she fitted first one and then another into a cupboard set in the wall the second one opened the door julian shone his torch into the cupboard it was filled with tins of food of all kinds neatly arranged on the shelves golly said dick his eyes gleaming souptins of meattins of fruittinned milksardinestinned butterbiscuitstinned vegetables theres everything we want here yes said julian pleased its fine well take all we can carry is there a sack or two anywhere about george do you know soon the tins were quietly packed into two sacks the cupboard door was shut and locked again the children stole to their own rooms once more well thats the biggest problem solvedfood said julian well raid the larder too and take what bread there isand cake what about water george is there any on the island well i suppose there is some in that old well said george thinking but as theres no bucket or anything we cant get any i was taking a big container of fresh water with mebut wed better fill two or three more now you are all coming i know where there are some quite clean and new so they filled some containers with fresh water and put them with the sacks ready to take to the boat it was so exciting doing all these things in the middle of the night anne could hardly keep her voice down to a whisper and it was a wonder that timothy didnt bark for he sensed the excitement of the others there was a tin of cakes in the larder freshly made so those were added to the heap that was forming in the front garden there was a large joint of meat too and george wrapped it in a cloth and put that with the heap telling timmy in a fierce voice that if he so much as sniffed at it she would leave him behind ive got my little stove for boiling water on or heating up anything whispered george its in the boat thats what i bought the methylated spirit for of course you didnt guess did you and the matches for lighting it i saywhat about candles we cant use our torches all the time the batteries would soon run out they found a pound of candles in the kitchen cupboard a kettle a saucepan some old knives and forks and spoons and a good many other things they thought they might possibly want they also came across some small bottles of gingerbeer evidently stored for their own use by the sticks all bought out of my mothers money said george well well take the gingerbeer too it will be nice to drink it on a hot day where are we going to sleep at night said julian in that ruined part of the old castle where there is just one room with a roof left and walls thats where i planned to sleep said george i was going to make my bed of some of the heather that grows on the island covered by a rug or two which ive got down in the boat well take all the rugs we can find said julian and some cushions for pillows i say isnt this simply thrilling i dont know when ive felt so excited i feel like a prisonerescaping to freedom wont the sticks be amazed when they find us gone yes well have to decide what to say to them said george rather soberly we dontwant them sending people after us to the island making us come back i dont think they should know weve gone there well discuss that later said dick the thing is to get everything to the boat while its dark it will soon be dawn how are we going to get all this down to georges boat said anne looking at the enormous pile of goods by the light of her torch well never be able to carry them all certainly it looked a great pile julian had an idea as usual are there any barrows in the shed he asked george if we could pile the things into a couple of barrows we could easily take everything in one journey we could wheel the barrows along on the sandy side of the road so that we dont make any noise oh good idea said george delighted i wish id thought of that before i had to make about five journeys to and from the boat when i took my own things there are two barrows in the shed well get them one has a squeaky wheel but well hope no one hears it stinker heard the squeak as he lay in a corner of mrs sticks room he pricked up his ears and growled softly he did not dare to bark for he was afraid of bringing timothy up mrs stick did not hear the growl she slept soundly not even stirring she had no idea what was going on downstairs the things were all stowed into the boat the children didnt like leaving them there unguarded in the end they decided to leave dick there sleeping on the rugs they stood thinking for a moment before they went back without dick i do hope weve remembered all we shall want said george wrinkling up her forehead gollyi know we havent remembered a tinopenernor a thing to take off the tops of the gingerbeer bottles theyve got those little tin lids that have to be forced off by an opener well put those in our pockets when we get back to the house and find them said julian i remember seeing some in the sideboard drawer goodbye dick well be down very early to row off we must get some bread at the bakers as soon as he opens because weve got hardly any and well see if we can pick up a very large bone at the butchers for timmy george has got a bag of biscuits in the boat for him too the three of them set off back to the house with timmy leaving dick curled up comfortably on the rugs he soon fell asleep again his face upturned to the stars that would soon fade from the sky the others talked about what to tell the sticks i think we wont tell them anything said julian at last i dont particularly want to tell them deliberate lies and im certainly not going to tell them the truth i know what well dothere is a train that leaves the station about eight oclock which would be the one wed catch if we were going back to our own home well find a timetable leave it open on the diningroom table as if wed been looking up a train and then well all set off across the moor at the back of the house as if we were going to the station oh yesthen the sticks will think weve run away and gone to catch the train back home said anne they will never guess weve gone to the island thats a good idea said george pleased but how shall we know when father and mother get back is there anyone you could leave a message withsomebody you could really trust asked julian george thought hard theres alf the fisherboy she said at last he used to look after tim for me when i wasnt allowed to have him in the house i know hed not give us away well call on alf before we go then said julian now lets look for that timetable and lay it open on the table at the right place they hunted for the timetable found the right page and underlined the train they hoped that the sticks would think they were catching they found the tin and bottle openersand put them into their pockets julian found two or three more boxes of matches too he thought two would not last long enough by this time dawn had come and the house was being flooded with early sunshine i wonder if the baker is open said julian we might as well go and see its about six oclock they went to the baker he was not open but the new loaves had already been made the baker was outside sunning himself he had baked his bread at night ready to sell it newmade in the morning he grinned at the children up early today he said what you want some of my loaveshow many six good gracious whatever for to eat said george grinning julian paid for six enormous loaves and they went to the butchers his shop was not open either but the butcher himself was sweeping the path outside could we buy a very big bone for timmy please asked george she got an enormous one and timmy looked at it longingly such a bone would last him for days he knew now said julian as they set off to the boat well pack these things into the boat thengo back to the house and make a noise so that the sticks know were there then well set off across the moors and hope the sticks will think we are making for the train they woke dick who was still sleeping peacefully in the boat and packed in the bread and bone take the boat into the next cove said george can you do that we shall be hidden there from anyone on the beach then the fishermen are all out in their boats fishing we shant be seen if we set offin about an hours time well be back by then they went back to the house and made a noise as if they were just getting up george whistled to timmy and julian sang at the top of his voice then with a great banging of doors they set out down the path and cut across the moors in full sight of the kitchen window hope the sticks wont notice dick isnt with us said julian seeing edgar staring out of the window i expect theyll think hes gone ahead they kept to the path until they came to a dip where they were hidden from any watcher at kirrin cottage then they took another path that led them unseen to the cove where dick had taken the boat he was there waiting anxiously for them ahoy there yelled julian in excitement the adventure is about to begin chapter ten kirrin island once more they all clambered into the boat timothy leapt in lightly and ran to the prow where he always stood his tongue hung out in excitement he knew quite well that something was upand he was in it no wonder he panted and wagged his tail hard off we go said julian taking the oars sit over there a bit anne the luggage is weighing down the boat awfully the other end dick sit by anne to keep the balance better thats right off we go and off they went in georges boat rocking up and down on the waves the sea was fairly calm but a good breeze blew through their hair the water splashed round the boat and made a nice gurgly friendly noise the children all felt very happy they were on their own they were escaping from the horrid sticks they were going to stay on kirrin island with the rabbits and gulls and jackdaws doesnt that newmade bread smell awfully good said dick feeling very hungry as usual can we just grab a bit do you think yes lets said george so they broke off bits of the warm brown crust handed some to julian who was rowing and chewed the delicious newmade bread timmy got a bit too but his was gone as soon as it went into his mouth timmys funny said anne he never eats his food as we dohe seems to drink itjust takes it into his mouth and swallows it as if it was water the others laughed he doesnt drink his bones said george he always eats those all rightchews on them for hours and hours dont you timothy woof said timmy agreeing he eyed the place where that enormous bone was wishing he could have it now but the children wouldnt let him they were afraid it might go overboard and that would be a pity i dont believe anyone has noticed us going said julian except alf the fisherboy of course we told him about going to the island dick but nobody else they had called at alfs house on their way to the cove alf was alone in the yard at the back his mother was away and his father was out fishing they had told him their secret and alf had nodded his tousled head and promised faithfully to tell nobody at all he was evidently very proud at being trusted if my mother and father come back you must let us know said george sail as near the island as you dare and hail us you can get nearer to it than anyone else ill do that promised alf wishing he could go with them so you see dick said julian as he rowed out to the island if by any chance aunt fanny does return sooner than we expect we shall know at once and come back i think weve planned everything very well yes we have said dick he turned and faced the island which was coming nearer we shall soon be there isnt george going to take the oars and guide the boat in yes said george weve come to the difficult bit now where weve got to weave our way in and out of the different rocks that keep sticking up give me the oars ju she took the oars and the others watched in admiration as the girl guided the big boat skillfully in and out of the hidden rocks she certainly was very clever they felt perfectly safe with her the boat slid into the little cove it was a natural harbour with the water running up to a stretch of sand high rocks sheltered it the children jumped out eagerly and four pairs of willing hands tugged the boat quickly up the sand higher up still panted george you know what awful storms suddenly blow up in this bay we want to be sure the boat is quite safe no matter how high the seas run the boat soon lay on one side high up the stretch of sand the children sat down puffing and blowing lets have breakfast here said julian i dont feel like unloading all those heavy things at the moment well get what we want for breakfast and have it here on this warm bit of sand they got a loaf of new bread some cold ham a few tomatoes and a pot of jam anne found knives and forks and plates julian opened two bottles of gingerbeer funny sort of breakfast he said setting the bottles down on the sand but simply gorgeous when anyone is as hungry as we are they ate everything except about a third of the loaf timmy was given his bone and some of his own biscuits he crunched up the biscuits at once and then sat down contentedly to gnaw the fine bone how nice to be timmywith no plate or knife or fork or cup to bother about said anne lying on her back in the sun feeling that she really couldnt eat anything more oh if we are always going to have mixedup meals like this on the island i shall never want to go back who would have thought that ham and jam and gingerbeer would go so well together timmy was thirsty he sat with his tongue hanging out wishing that george would give him a drink he didnt like gingerbeer george eyed him lazily oh timmyare you thirsty she said oh dear j feel as if i really cant get up youll have to wait a few minutes then ill go to the boat and empty out some water for you but timothy couldnt wait he went off to some nearby rocks which were out of reach of the sea in a hole in one of them he found some rainwater and he lapped it up eagerly the children heard him lapping it and laughed isnt timmy clever murmured anne i should never have thought of that the children had been up half the night and now they were full of good things and were very sleepy one by one they fell asleep on the warm sand timothy eyed them in astonishment it wasnt nighttime yet here were all the children sleeping tightly well wella dog could always go to sleep too at any time so timothy threw himself down beside george put his head right on her middle and closed his eyes the sun was high when the little company awoke julian awoke first then dick feeling very hot indeed for the sun was blazing down they sat up yawning goodness said dick looking at his arms the sun has caught me properly i shall be terribly sore by tonight did we bring any cream julian no we never thought of it said julian cheer up youll be burnt much more by the time this day ends the suns going to be hottheres not a cloud in the sky they woke up the girls george pushed timmys head off her tummy you give me nightmares when you put your heavy head there she complained oh i saywere on the island arent we for a moment i thought i was back in bed at kirrin cottage isnt it gorgeoushere we are for ages all by ourselves with tons of nice things to eat able to do just what we like said anne contentedly i guess the old sticks are glad weve gone said dick spotty face will be able to loll in the sittingroom and read all our booksi if he wants to and stinkerdog will be able to wander all over the house and lie on anybodys bed without being afraid that timothy will eat him whole said george well let him i dont care about anything now that ive escaped it was fun to lie there and talk about everything but soon julian who could never rest for long once he was awake got up and stretched himself come on he said to the others there is work to do lazybones come along work to do what do you mean said george in astonishment well weve got to unload the boat and pack everything somewhere where it wont get spoilt if the rain happens to come said julian and weve got to decide exactly where were going to sleep and get the heather for our beds and pile the rugs on them theres plenty to do oh dont lets do it yet said anne not at all wanting to get up out of the warm sand but the others pulled her up and together they all set to work to unload the boat lets go and have a look at the castle said julian and find the little room where well sleep its the only one left whole so it will have to be that one they went right to the top of the inlet climbed up on to the rocks and made their way towards the old ruined castle whose walls rose up from the middle of the little island they stopped to gaze at it its a fine old ruin said dick arent we lucky to have an island and a castle of our own fancy this is all ours they gazed through a big brokendown archway to old steps beyond the castle had once had two fine towers but now one was almost gone the other rose high in the air halfruined the black jackdaws collected there talking loudly chack chack chack chack chack chack nice birds said dick i like them see the grey patch at the back of their heads anne i wonder if they ever stop talking i dont think so said george oh look at the rabbitstamer than ever the courtyard was full of big rabbits who eyed them as they came near it really seemed as if it would be possible to pat them they were so tamebut one by one they edged away as the children approached timothy was in a great state of excitement and his tail quivered from end to end oh those rabbits why couldnt he chase them why was george so difficult about rabbits why couldnt he make them run a bit but george had her hand on his collar and gave him stern glance now timothy dont you dare to chase even the smallest of these rabbits theyre mine every one o them ours corrected anne at once she wanted to share in the rabbits as well as in the castle and the island ours said george lets go and have a look at the little dark room where well spend the nights they made their way to where the castle did not seen to be quite so ruined they came to a doorway and looked inside here it is said julian peeping in i shall have to us my torch the windows are only slits here and its quit dark he turned on his torchand the children all gaze into the old room where they proposed to store their goods and sleep george gave a loud exclamation golly we cant use this room the roof has fallen in since last summer so it had julians torch shone on to a heap of fallen stones scattered all over the floor it was quite impossible to use the old room now in any case it might be dangerous to do so for it looked as if more stones might fall at any moment blow said julian what shall we do about this w shall have to find somewhere else for a storing an sleepingplace chapter eleven on the old wreck it was quite a shock to have their plans spoilt they knew there was no other room in the ruined castle that was sufficiently whole to shelter them and they must find some sort of shelter for although the weather was fine at the moment it might rain hard any dayor a storm might blow up and storms round about kirrin are so very violent said julian remembering one or two do you remember the storm that tossed your wreck up from the bottom of the sea george oh yes said george and anne together and anne added eagerly lets go and see the wreck today if we can id love to see if its still balanced on those rocks as it was last year when we explored it well first we must make up our minds where we are going to sleep said julian firmly i dont know if you realise it but its about three oclock in the afternoon we slept for hours on the sandtired out with our exciting night i suppose we really must find some safe place and put our things there at once and make our beds well but where shall we go said dick theres no other place in the old castle theres the dungeon below said anne shivering but i dont want to go there its so dark and mysterious nobody wanted to sleep down in the dungeons dick frowned and thought hard what about the wreck he said any chance of living there we might go and see said julian i dont somehow fancy living on a damp old rotting wreckbut if its still high on the rocks maybe the sun will have dried it and it might be possible to have our bed and stores there lets go and see now said george so they made their way from the ruined castle to the old wall that ran round it from there they would be able to see the wreck it had been cast up the year before and had settled firmly on some rocks they stood on the wall and looked for the wreck but it was not where they had expected it its moved said julian in surprise there it is look on those rocksnearer to the shore than it was before poor old wreck its been battered about a good bit this last winter hasnt it it looks much more of a real wreck than it did last summer i dont believe we shall be able to sleep there said dick its dreadfully battered we might be able to store food there though do you know i believe we could get to it from those rocks that run out from the island yes i believe we could said george we could only reach it safely by boat last summerbut when the tide is down i think we could climb out over the line of rocks right to the wreck itself well try in about an hour said julian feeling excited the tide will be off the rocks by then lets go and have a look at the old well said dick and they made their way back to the courtyard of the castle here the summer before they had found the entrance to the wellshaft that ran deep down through the rock past the dungeons below lower than the level of the sea to fresh water the children looked about for the well and came to the old wooden cover they drew it back there are the rungs of the old iron ladder i went down last year said dick peering in now lets find the entrance to the dungeon the steps down into it are somewhere near here they found the entrance but to their surprise some enormous stones had been pulled across it who did that said george frowning we didnt someone has been here trippers i suppose said julian do you remember that we thought we saw a spire of smoke here the other day i bet it was trippers you know the story of kirrin island and its old castle and dungeons and the treasure we found in it last year was all in the newspapers i expect one of the fishermen has been making money by taking trippers and landing them on our island how dare they said george looking very fierce i shall put up a board that says trespassers will be sent to prison i wont have strangers on our island well dont worry about the stones pulled across the dungeon entrance said julian i dont think any of us want to go down there look at poor old timmy hes gazing at those rabbits most unhappily isnt he funny timothy was sitting down behind the children looking most mournfully at the ring of rabbits all round the weed grown courtyard he looked at the rabbits and then he looked at george then he looked back atthe rabbits no good timmy said george firmly im not going to change my mind about rabbits youre not to chase them on our island i expect he thinks youre most unfair to him said anne after all you said he might share your quarter of the island with youand so he thinks he ought to have his share of your rabbits too everyone laughed timmy wagged his tail and looked hopefully at george they all walked across the courtyardand then julian suddenly came to a stop look he said in surprise pointing to something on the ground look someone has been here this is where they built a fire everyone gazed at the ground there was a heap of woodash there quite evidently left from a fire stamped into the ground was a cigarette end too there was absolutely no doubt about itsomeone had been on the island if trippers come here ill set timmy on to them cried george in a fury this is our own place it doesnt belong to anybody else at all timothy you mustnt chase rabbits here but you can chase anybody on two legs except us see timmy wagged his tail at once woof he said quite agreeing he looked all round as if he hoped to see somebody appearing that he could chase but there was no one i should think the tide is about off those rocks by now said julian lets go and see if it is well climb along them and see if we can get to the wreck anne had better not come she might slip and fall and the sea is raging all round the rocks of course im coming cried anne indignantly youre just as likely to fall as i am well ill see if it looks too dangerous said julian they made their way over the castle wall down to the line of rocks that ran out seawards towards the wreck big waves did wash over the rocks occasionally but it seemed fairly safe if you keep between me and dick you can come anne said julian but you must let us help you over difficult parts and not make a fuss we dont want you to fall in and get washed away they began to make their way along the line of rugged slippery rocks the tide went down even farther as the got nearer to the wreck and soon there was very little danger of being washed off the rocks it was possible now to get right to the wreck across the rocksa thing they had not been able to do the summer before here we are said julian at last and he put his ham on the side of the old wreck she was a big ship now that they were near to her she towered above them thick with shellfish and seaweed smelling musty and old the water washed round the bottom part of her but the top part was right out of the water even when the tide was at its highest shes been thrown about a bit last winter said george looking at her there are a lot more new hole in her side arent there and part of her old mast is gone and some of the deck how can we get up to her ive got a rope said julian and he undid a rope that he had wound round his waist half a minuteill make a loop and see if i can throw it round that post sticking out up there he threw the rope two or three times but could not get the loop round the post george took it from him impatiently at the first throw she got it round the post she was very good indeed at things like thatbetter than a boy in some things anne thought admiringly she was up the rope like a monkey and soon stood on the sloping slippery deck she almost slipped but caught at a broken piece of deck just in time julian helped anne to go up and then the two boys followed its a horrid smell isnt it said anne wrinkling up her nose do all wrecks smell like this i dont think ill go and look down in the cabins like we did last time the smell would be worse there so the others left anne up on the halfrotten deck while they went to explore a bit they went down to the smelly seaweedhung cabins and into the captains old cabin the biggest of the lot but it was quite plain that not only could they not sleep there but they could certainly not hope to store anything there either the whole place was damp and rotten julian was half afraid his foot would go through the planking at any moment lets go up to the deck he said its nasty down hereawfully dark too they were just going up when they heard a shout from anne i say come here quick ive found something they hurried up as fast as they could slipping and sliding on the sloping deck anne was standing where they had left her her eyes shining brightly she was pointing to something on the opposite side of the ship what is it said george whats the matter lookthat wasnt here when we came here before surely said anne still pointing the others looked when she pointed they saw an open locker at the other side o the deck and stuffed into it was a small black trunk how extraordinary a little black trunk said julian in surprise nothat wasnt there before its not been there long eitherits quite dry and new whoever does it belong to and why should it be here chapter twelve the cave in the cliff cautiously the children made their way down the slippery deck towards the locker the door of this had evidently been shut on the trunk but had come open so that the trunk was not hidden as had been intended julian pulled out the little black trunk all the children were amazed why should anyone put a trunk there smugglers do you think said dick his eyes gleaming yesit might be said julian thoughtfully trying to undo the straps of the trunk this would be a very good place for smugglers ships that knew the way could put in cast off a boat with smuggled goods leave them here and go on their way knowing that people could come and collect the goods at their leisure do you think there are smuggled goods inside the trunk asked anne in excitement what would there be diamonds silks anything that has a duty to be paid on it before it can get into the country said julian blow these straps i cant undo them let me try said anne who had very deft little fingers she began to work at the buckles and in a short time had the straps undone but a further disappointment awaited them the trunk was well and truly locked there were two good locks and no keys blow said george how sickening how can we get the trunk open now we cant said julian and we mustnt smash it open because it would warn whoever it belongs to that the goods had been found we dont want towarn the smugglers that we have discovered their little game we want to try and catch them ooooh said anne going red with excitement catch the smugglers oh julian do you really think we could why not said julian no one knows we are here if we hid whenever we saw a ship approaching the island we might see a boat coming to it and we could watch and find out what is happening i should think that the smugglers are using this island as a sort of droppingplace for goods i wonder who comes and fetches them someone from kirrin village or the nearby places i should think this is going to be awfully exciting said dick we always seem to have adventures when we come to kirrin its absolutely full of them this will be the third one we have had i think we ought to be getting back over the rocks said julian suddenly looking over the side of the ship and seeing that the tide had turned come on we dont want to be caught by the tide and have to stay here for hours and hours ill go down the rope first then you come anne they were soon climbing over the rocks again feeling very excited just as they reached the last stretch of rock leading to the rocky cliff of the island itself dick stopped whats up said george pushing behind him do get on isnt that a cave just beyond that big rock there said dick pointing it looks awfully like one to me if it was it would be a simply lovely place to store our things in and even to sleep in if it was out of reach of the sea there arent any caves on kirrin began george and then she stopped short what dick was pointing at really did look like a cave it was worth while seeing if it was one after all george had never explored this line of rocks and so had never been able to catch sight of the cave that lay just beyond it could not possibly be seen from the land well go and see she said so they changed their direction and instead of climbing back the way they had come they cut across the mass of rock and made their way towards a juttingout part of the cliff in which the cave seemed to be they came to it at last steep rocks guarded the entrance and half hid it except from where dick had seen it it was really impossible to catch sight of it it was so wellhidden it is a cave said dick in delight stepping into it and my what a fine one it really was a beauty its floor was spread with fine white sand as soft as powder and perfectly dry for the cave was clearly higher than the tide reached except possibly in a bad winter storm round one side of it ran a stone ledge exactly like a shelf made for us cried anne in joy we can put all our things here how lovely lets come and live here and sleep here and look julianweve even got a skylight in the roof the little girl pointed upwards and the others saw that the roof of the cave was open in one part giving on to the clifftop itself it was plain that somewhere on the heathery cliff above was a hole that looked down to the cave making what anne called a skylight we could drop all our things down through that hole said julian quickly making plans we would have an awful time bringing them over the rocks if we can find that hole up there when we are out on the cliff again we can let down everything on a rope its not a very high skylight as anne calls it for the cliffs are low just here i believe we could swing ourselves down a rope easily so that we neednt have the bother of clambering over the rocks to the seaward entrance we have just come in by this was a grand discovery our island is even more exciting than we thought said anne happily weve got a beautiful cave to share now the next thing to do of course was to go up on the cliff and find the hole that led to the roof of the cave so out they all went timmy too timmy was funny on the slippery rocks his feet slithered about and two or three times he fell into the water but he just swam across the pools he fell into clambered out and went on again with his slithering hes like george said anne with a laugh he never gives up whatever happens to him they climbed up to the top of the cliff it was easy to find the hole once they knew it was there pretty dangerous really said julian when he had found it and was peering down any one of us might have run on this cliff and popped down the hole by accident see its all crisscrossed with blackberry brambles they scratched their hands trying to free the hole from the brambles once they had cleared the hole they could look right down into the cave quite easily its not very far down said anne it looks almost as if we could jump down if we let ourselves slide down this hole dont you do anything of the sort said julian youd break your leg wait till we get a rope fixed up hanging down into the cave then we can manage to get in and out easily they went back to the boat and began unloading it they took everything across to the seaward side of the island where the cave was julian took a strong rope and knotted it thickly at intervals to give our feet a hold as we go down he explained if we drop down too quickly well hurt our hands these knots will stop us slipping and help us to climb up let me go down first and then you can lower all our things to me said george so down she went hand over hand her feet easily finding the thick knots feeling for one after another it was a good way to go down how shall we get timmy down said julian but timothy who had been whining anxiously at the edge of the hole watching george sliding away from him solved the difficulty himself he jumped into the hole and disappeared down it there came a shriek from below oh my goodness whats this oh timmy have you hurt yourself the sand was very soft like a velvet cushion and tim had not hurt himself at all he gave himself a shake and then barked joyfully he was with george again he wasnt going to have his mistress disappearing down mysterious holes without following her at once not timmy then followed the business of lowering down all the goods anne and dick tied the things together in rugs and julian lowered them carefully george untied the rope as soon as it reached her took out the goods and then back went the rope again to be tied round another bundle last one called julian after a long spell of really hard work then down we come too and i dont mind telling you that before we make our beds or anything our next job is to have a jolly good meal its hours and hours since we had a meal and im starving soon they were all sitting on the warm soft floor of the cave they opened a tin of meat cut huge slices of bread and made sandwiches then they opened a tin of pineapple chunks and ate those spooning them out of the tin full of sweetness and juice after that they still felt hungry so they opened two tins of sardines and dug them out wit biscuits it made a really grand meal gingerpop to finish up with please said dick my word why dont people always have meals like this wed better hurry up or we shant be able to get heather for our beds said george sleepily who wants heather said dick i dont this lovely soft sand is all i shall wantand a cushion and a rug or two i shall sleep better here than ever i did in bed so the rugs and cushions were spread out on the sandy floor of the cave a candle was lighted as it grew dark and the four sleepy children looked at one another timmy as usual was with george goodnight said george i cant keep awake another minute goodnight ev ery body good night chapter thirteen a day on the island the children hardly knew where they were the next day when they woke up the sun was pouring into the cave entrance and fell first of all on georges sleeping face it awoke her and she lay halfdozing wondering why her bed felt rather less soft than usual but im not in my bedim on kirrin island of course she thought suddenly to herself she sat up and gave anne a punch wake up sleepyhead were on the island soon they were all awake rubbing the sleep from their eyes i think im going to get heather today for my bed after all said anne the sand feels soft at first but it gets hard after a bit the others agreed that they would all get heather for their beds set on the sand with rugs for covering then they would have really fine beds its fun to live in a cave said dick fancy having a fine cave like this on our island as well as a castle and dungeons we arc really very lucky i feel sticky and dirty said julian lets go and have a bathe before we have breakfast then cold ham bread pickles and marmalade for me we shall be cold after our bathe said george wed better light my little stove and put the kettle on to boil while were bathing then we can make some hot cocoa when we come back shivering oh yes said anne who had never boiled anything on such a tiny stove before do lets ill fill the kettle with water from one of the containers what shall we do for milk theres a tin of milk somewhere in the pile said julian we can open that wheres the tinopener it was not to be found which was most exasperating but at last julian discovered it in his pocket so all was well the little stove was filled with methylated spirit and lighted the kettle was filled and set on top then the children went off to bathe look theres a simply marvellous pool in the middle of those rocks over there called julian pointing weve never spotted it before golly its like a small swimmingpool made specially for us kirrin swimming pool five pence a dip said dick free to the owners though come onit looks gorgeous and see how the waves keep washing over the top of the rocks and splashing into the pool couldnt be better it really was a lovely rockpool deep clear and not too cold the children enjoyed themselves thoroughly splashing about and swimming and floating george tried a dive off one of the rocks and went in beautifully george can do anything in the water said anne admiringly i wish i could dive and swim like george but i never shall we can see the old wreck nicely from here said julian coming out of the water blow we didnt bring any towels well use one of the rugs turn and turn about said dick ill go and fetch the thinnest one i saydo you remember that trunk we saw in the wreck yesterday odd wasnt it yes very odd said julian i dont understand it well have to keep a watch on the wreck and see who comes to collect the trunk i suppose the smugglersif they are smugglerswill come slinking round this side of the island and quietly send off a boat to the wreck said george drying herself vigorously well wed better keep a strict lookout and see if anything appears on the sea out there in the way of a small steamer boat or ship yes we dont want them to spot us said dick we shant find out anything if they see us and are warned theyd at once give up coming to the island i vote we each of us take turns at keeping a lookout so that we can spot anything at once and get under cover good idea said julian well im dry but not very warm lets race to the cave and get that hot drink and breakfast golly icould eat a whole chicken and probably a duck as well to say nothing of a turkey the others laughed they all felt the same they raced off to the cave running over the sand and climbing over a few rocks then down to the cavebeach and into the big entrance still splashed with sunshine the kettlewas boiling away merrily sending a cloud of steam up from its tin spout get the ham out and a loaf of bread and that jar of pickles we brought ordered julian ill open the tin of milk george you take the tin of cocoa and that jug and make enough for all of us im so terribly happy said anne as she sat at the entrance to the cave eating her breakfast its a lovely feeling its simply gorgeous being on our island like this all by ourselves able to do what we like they all felt the same it was such a lovely day too and the sky and sea were so blue they sat eating and drinking gazing out to sea watching the waves break into spray over the rocks beyond the old wreck it certainly was a very rocky coast lets arrange everything very nicely in the cave said anne who was the tidiest of the four and always liked to play at houses if she could this shall be our house our home well make four proper beds and well each have our own place to sit in and well arrange everything tidily on that big stone shelf there it might have been made for us well leave anne to play houses by herself said george who was longing to stretch her legs again well go and get some heather for beds and ohwhat about one of us keeping a watch on the old wreck to see who comes there yesthats important said julian at once ill take first watch the best place would be up on the cliff just above this cave i can find a gorse bush that will hide me all right from anyone out at sea you others get the heather we will take twohourly watches we can read if we like so long as we keep on looking up dick and george went to get the heather julian climbed up the knotted rope that still hung down through the hole tied firmly to the great old root of an enormous gorse bush he pulled himself out on the cliff and lay on the heather panting he could see nothing but to sea at all except for some big steamer miles out on the skyline he lay down in the sun enjoying the warmth that poured into every inch of his body this lookout job was going to be very nice he could hear anne singing down in the cave as she tidied up her house her voice came up through the caveroof hole rather muffled julian smiled he knew anne was enjoying herself thoroughly so she was she had washed the few bits of crockery they had used for breakfast in a most convenient little rainpool outside the cave timmy used it for drinkingwater too but he didnt seem to mind anne using it for washingup water though she apologised to him for doing so im sorry if i spoil your drinking water timmy darling she said but you are such a sensible dog that i know if it suddenly tastes nasty to you you will go off and find another rainpool woof said timmy and ran off to meet george who was just arriving back with dick armed with masses of soft sweetsmelling heather for beds put the heather outside the cave please george said anne ill make the beds inside when im ready right said george well go and get some more arent we having fun julians gone up the rope to the top of the cliff said anne hell yell if he sees anything unusual i hope he does dont you it would be exciting agreed dick putting down his heather on top of timmy and nearly burying him oh sorry timmyare you there bad luck anne had a very happy morning she arranged everything beautifully on the shelf crockery and knives and forks and spoons in one place saucepan and kettle in another tins of meat next tins of soup together tins of fruit neatly piled on top of one another it really was a splendid larder and dresser she wrapped all the bread up in an old tablecloth they had brought and put it at the back of the cave in the coolest place she could find the containers of water went there too and so did all the bottles of drinks then the little girl set to work to make the beds she decided to make two nice big ones one on each side of the cave george and i and tim will have the one this side she thought busy patting down the heather into the shape of a bed and julian and dick can have the other side i shall want lots more heather oh is that you dick youre just in time i want more heather soon the beds were made beautifully and each had an old rug for an underblanket and two better rugs for covers cushions made pillows what a pity we didnt bring nightthings thought anne i could have folded them neatly and put them under the cushions there it all looks lovely weve got a beautiful house julian came sliding down the rope from the cliff to the cave he looked round admiringly my word annethe cave does look fine everything in order and looking so tidy you are a good little girl anne was pleased to hear julians praise though she didnt like him calling her a little girl yes it does look nice doesnt it she said but why arent you watching up on the cliff ju its dicks turn now said julian the two hours are up did we bring any biscuits i feel as if i could do with one or two and i bet the others could too lets all go up to the clifftop and have some george and timmy are there with dick anne knew exactly where to put her hand on the tin of biscuits she took out ten and climbed up to the clifftop julian went up on the rope soon all five were sitting b the big gorsebush nibbling at biscuits timmy too at least he didnt nibble he just swallowed the day passed very pleasantly and rather lazily they took turns at being lookout though anne was severely scolded by julian in the afternoon for falling asleep during her watch she was very ashamed of herself and cried youre too little to be a lookout thats what it is said julian we three and timmy had better do it oh no do let me too begged poor anne i never never will fall asleep again but the sun was so hot and dont make excuses said julian it only makes things worse if you do all rightwell give you another chance anne and see if you are really big enough to do the things we do but though they all took their turns and kept a watch on the sea for any strange vessel none appeared the children were disappointed they did so badly want to know who had put that trunk on the wreck and why and what it contained better go to bed now said julian when the sun sank low its about nine oclock come on im really looking forward to a sleep on those lovely heathery beds that anne has made so nicely chapter fourteen disturbance in the night it was dark in the cave not really quite dark enough to light a candle but the cave looked so nice by candlelight that it was fun to light one so anne took down the candlestick and lighted the candle at once queer shadows jumped all round the cave and it became a rather exciting place not at all like the cave they knew by daylight i wish we could have a fire said anne wed be far too hot said julian and it would smoke us out you cant have a fire in a cave like this theres no chimney yes there is said anne pointing to the hole in the roof if we lighted a fire just under that hole it would act as a chimney wouldnt it it might said dick thoughtfully but i dont think so wed simply get the cave full of stifling smoke and we wouldnt be able to sleep for choking well couldnt we light a fire at the cave entrance then said anne who felt that a real home ought to have a fire somewhere just to keep away wild beasts say thats what the people of old times did it says so in my history book they lighted fires at the cave entrance at night to keep away any wild animal that might be prowling around well what wild beasts do you think are likely to come and peep into this cave asked julian lazily finishing up a cup of cocoa lions tigers or perhaps you are afraid of an elephant or two everyone laughed noi dont really think animals like that would come said anne onlyit would be nice to have a red glowing fire to watch when we go to sleep perhaps anne thinks the rabbits might come in and nibble our toes or something said dick woof said tim pricking up his ears as he always did at the mention of rabbits i dont think we ought to have a fire said julian because it might be seen out at sea and give a warning to anyone thinking of coming to the island to do a bit of smuggling oh no julianthe entrance to this cave is so wellhidden that im sure no one could see a fire out to sea said george at once theres that line of high rocks in front which must hide it completely i think it would be rather fun to have a fire it would light up the cave so queerly and excitingly oh good george said anne delighted to find someone agreeing with her well we cant possibly fag out and get sticks for it now said dick who was far too comfortable to move you dont need to said anne eagerly i got plenty myself today and stored them at the back of the cave in case we wanted a fire isnt she a good little housewife said julian in great admiration she may go to sleep when shes lookout but shes wideawake enough when it comes to making a house for us out of a cave all right annewell make a fire for you they all got up and fetched the sticks from the back of the cave anne had been to the jackdaw tower and had picked up armfuls that the birds had dropped when making their nests in the tower they built them up to make a nice little fire julian got some dried seaweed too to drop into it they lighted the fire at the caveentrance and the dry sticks blazed up at once the children went back to their heatherbeds and lay down on them watching the red flames leaping and crackling the red glow lit up the cave and made it very weird and exciting this is lovely said anne halfasleep really lovely oh timmy move a bit do youre so heavy on my feet here george pull timothy over to your sideyoure used to him lying on you goodnight said dick sleepilythe fire is dying down but i cant be bothered to put any more wood on it im sure all the lions and tigers and bears and elephants have been frightened away silly said anne you neednt tease me about it youve enjoyed it as much as i have goodnight they all fell asleep and dreamed peacefully of many things julian awoke with a jump some queer noise had awakened him he lay still listening timothy was growling deeply right down in his throat rrrrrrr he went grrrrrrrrr george awoke too and put out her hand sleepily whats the matter tim she said hes heard something george said julian in a low voice from his bedon the other side of the cave george sat up cautiously timmy was still growling sh said george and he stopped he was sitting up straight his ears well cocked perhaps its the smugglers come in the night whispered george and a funny prickly feeling ran down her back somehow smugglers in the day time were rather exciting and quite welcomebut at night they seemed different george didnt at all want to meet any just then im going out to see if i can spy anything said julian getting off his bed quietly so as not to wake dick ill go up the rope to the top of the cliff i can see better from there take my torch said george but julian didnt want it no thanks i can feel the way up that knotted rope quite well whether i can see or not he said he went up the rope in the dark his body twisting round as the rope turned he climbed up on to the cliff and looked out to sea it was a very dark night and he could see no ship at all not even the wreck it was far too dark pity theres no moon thought julian i might be able to see something then he watched for a few minutes and then georges voice came through the hole in the roof coming out queerly at his feet julian is there anything to see shall i come up nothing at all said julian is timmy still growling yes when i take my hand off his collar said george i cant imagine whats upset him suddenly julian caught sight of something it was a light a good way beyond the line of rocks he watched in excitement that would be just about where the wreck was yesit must be someone on the wreck with a lantern george come up he said putting his head inside the hole george came up hand over hand like a monkey leaving timothy growling below she sat by julian on the clifftop see the wrecklook over there said julian at least you cant see the wreck itself its too darkbut you can see a lantern that someone has put there yesthats someone on our wreck with a lantern said george feeling excited oh i wonder if its the smugglerscoming to bring more things or somebody fetching that trunk said julian well well know tomorrow for well go and see lookwhoever is there is moving off nowthe light of the lantern is going lowerthey must be getting into a boat by the side of the wreck and now the lights gone out the children strained their ears to hear if they could discover the splash of oars or the sound of voices over the water they both thought they could hear voices the boat must have gone off to join a ship or something said julian i believe i can see a faint light right out thereout to sea look maybe the boat is going to it there was nothing more to see or hear and soon the two of them slid down the knotted rope back to the cave they didnt wake the others who were still sleeping peacefully timothy leapt up andlicked julian and george whining joyfully he did not growl any more youre a good dog arent you said julian patting him nothing ever escapes your sharp ears does it timothy settled down on georges feet again it was plain that whatever it was that had disturbed him had gone it must have been the presence of the stranger or strangers on the old wreck well they would go there in the morning and see if they could discover what had been taken away or brought there in the night anne and dick were most indignant the next morning when they heard julians tale you might have waked us said dick crossly we would have if there had been anything much to see said george but there was only just the light from a lantern and nothing else except that we thought we heard the sound of voices when the tide was low enough the children and timothy set off over the rocks to the wreck they clambered up and stood on the slanting slippery deck they looked towards the locker where the little trunk had stood the door of the locker was shut this time julian slid down towards it and tried to pull it open someone had stuffed a piece of wood in to keep the locker from swinging open julian pulled it out then the door opened easily anything else in there said george stepping carefully over the slimy deck to julian yes said julian look tins of food and cups and plates and thingsjust as if someone was going to come and live on the island too isnt it funny the trunk is still here too locked as before and here are some candles and a little lampand a bundle of rags whatever are they here for it really was a puzzle julian frowned for a few minutes trying to think it out it looks as if someone is going to come and stay on the island for a bitprobably to wait there and take in whatever goods are going to be smuggled wellwe shall be on the lookout for them day or night they left the wreck feeling excited they had a fine hidingplace in their caveno one could possibly find them there and from their hidingplace they could watch anyone coming to and from the wreck and from the wreck to the island what about our cove where we put our boat said george suddenly they might use that cove you knowif they came in a boat its rather dangerous to reach the island from the wreck if anyone tried to get to the rocky beach nearby wellif anyone came to our cove theyd see our boat said dick in alarm wed better hide it hadnt we how said anne thinking that it would be a difficult thing to hide a boat as big as theirs dont know said julian well go and have a look all four and timmy went off to the cove into which they had rowed their boat the boat was pulled high up out of reach of the waves george explored the cove well and then had an idea do you think we could pull the boat round this big rock it would just about hide it though anyone going round the rock would see it at once the others thought it would be worth while trying anyway so with much panting and puffing they hauled the boat round the rock which almost completely hid her good said george going down into the cove to see if very much of the boat showed a bit of her does show still lets drape it with seaweed so they draped the prow of the boat with all the seaweed they could find at hand and after that unless anyone went deliberately round the big rock the boat really was not noticeable at all good said julian looking at his watch i sayits long past teatime and you know while weve been doing all this with the boat we quite forgot to have someone on the lookout post on the clifftop what idiots we are well i dont expect anything has happened since weve been away from the cave said dick putting a fine big bit of seaweed on the prow of the boat as a last touch i bet the smugglers will only come at night i dare say youre right said julian i think wed better keep a lookout at night too the lookout could take rugs up to the clifftop and curl up there timmy could be with whoever is keeping watch said anne then if the lookout goes to sleep by mistake timmy would growl and wake them up if he saw anything you mean when you go to sleep said dick grinning come onlets get back to the cave and have some tea and then timothy suddenly began to growl again chapter fifteen who is on the island sh said julian at once get down behind this bush quick everyone they had left the cove and were walking towards the castle when timmy growled now they all crouched behind a mass of brambles their hearts beating fast dont growl timmy said george in timothys nearest ear he stopped at once but he stood stiff and quivering on the watch julian peeped through the bush parting the brambles and scratching his hands he could just see somebody in the courtyardone persontwo personsmaybe three he strained his eyes to try and see but even as he looked they disappeared i believe theyve moved those big stones over the entrance to the dungeons and have gone down there he whispered stay here and ill creep out a bit and see i wont let anyone spot me he came back and nodded yestheyve gone down the dungeons do you think they can be the smugglers do you suppose they are storing their smuggled goods down there it would be a marvellous place of course lets get back to the cave while they are underground said george im so afraid timmy will give the game away by barking hes just bursting himself trying not to make some sort of noise come on then said julian dont go across the courtyardmake for the shore and well scramble round it till we get to the cave then one of us can pop up through the hole and hide behind that big gorsebush there to see who the smugglers are they must have come in by boat either from the wreck or by rowing cleverly through the rocks offshore they got to the cave at last and went in but no sooner had julian shinned up the rope helped by the others than timothy disappeared he ran out of the cave while the others backs were turned and when george turned round there was no timmy to be seen timmy she called in a low voice timmy where are you but no answer came timmy had gone off on his own if only the smugglers didnt see him what a bad dog he was to do that but timmy had smelt something excitinghe had smelt a smell he knewa dogsmelland he meant to find the owner of it and bite off his ears and tail grrrrrr timmy was not going to allow dogs on his island julian sat close beside the gorsebush watching all round there was nothing to be seen on the wreck and there was no ship out to sea probably the boat that had brought the strangers to the island was hidden down below among the rocks julian looked behind him towards the castleand even as he looked he saw an astonishing sight a dog was sniffing about the bushes not far awayand creeping up behind him all his hackles up was timothy timothy was stalking the dog as if he were a cat stalking a rabbit the other dog suddenly heard him and leapt round facing timothy timmy flung himself on the dog with a bloodcurdling howl and the dog howled in fright julian watched in horror not knowing what to do the two dogs made a fearful noise especially the other dog whose howls of terror and yelps of rage resounded everywhere this will bring the smugglers up and they will see timmy and know theres someone on the island thought julian oh blow you timmywhy didnt you stay with george and keep quiet from the walls of the ruined castle came three figures running pellmell to see what was happening to their dogand julian stared at them in the very greatest amazement for the three people were no other than mr stick mrs stick and edgar golly said julian crawling round the bush to get to the hole quickly theyve come after us theyve guessed weve gone here and theyve come to look for us the beasts to make us go back well they wont find us but oh what a pity timmys given the show away there came a shrill whistle from down below him it was george who hearing the row from the dogs was feeling worried and had sent out her piercing whistle for timmy it was a whistle the dog always obeyed and he let go his hold of the dog and shot off to the clifftop at once just as the three sticks arrived on the scene and picked up their bleeding whining mongrel edgar tore after timmy up to the clifftop julian dropped down to the cave when he spotted edgar appearing timmy ran to the hole and dropped bodily down landing almost on top of julian he flung himself on george shut up shut up said george in an urgent whisper to the excited dog do you want to give our hidingplace away you idiot edgar panting and puffing arrived on the clifftop and was completely amazed to see timothy apparently disappear into the solid earth he hunted about for a bit but it was clear that the dog was no longer on the cliff mr and mrs stick came up too where did that dog go shouted mrs stick what was he like he looked awfully like that horrible dog of the childrens said edgar his voice could clearly be heard by everyone down in the cave the children kept as quiet as mice but it couldnt be came mrs sticks voice the children have gone homewe saw them and the dog too making off towards the railway it must be some sort of stray dog left here by a tripper well where is he then said mr sticks hoarse voice cant see no dog anywhere about now he disappeared into the earth said edgar in a surprised voice mr stick made a rude and scornful noise you tell lovely tales you do he said disappeared into the earth what next fell over the cliff i should think well he got his teeth into poor tinker good and proper my word if i see that dog ill shoot him he might have some hidingplace about this cliff said mrs stick lets have a look the children sat as quiet as mice george with a warning hand on timmys collar they could hear that the sticks were really very near julian expected one of them to fall down the hole at any moment but mercifully they didnt happen on the hole that led down to the cave they stood quite near to it though while they were discussing the problem if its the childrens dog then those tiresome kids must have come to this island instead of going home said mrs stick that would upset our plan all right we shall have to find out ill have no peace till i know we can soon find out said mr stick no need to worry about that their boat will be here somewhereand theyll all be about too its impossible for four children a dog and a boat to be hidden on this small island once anyone starts hunting for them edgar you go round that way clara you get along round about the castle they may be hiding somewhere in the ruins ill have a look about here the children crouched together in the cave how they hoped that their boat would not be found how they hoped that no one would find any traces of them at all timmy growled softly wishing that he could go and find that stinkerdog again it had been lovely to bite his ears hard edgar was halfscared of finding the children and a good deal more scared of coming up against timmy somewhere so he did not make much of a search for either the children or the boat he went into the cove where the boat had been pulled up and although he saw traces where the vessel had been hauled up barely smoothed out by the seawater at hightide he did not notice the seaweedy prow of the boat sticking out round the rock behind which it was hidden nothing here he called to his mother who was going round and about the ruins looking into every likely nook but she found nothing either and neither did mr stick couldnt have been the childrens dog said mr stick at last theyd be here if he was and so would their boat but theres no sign of them at all that dog must have been some wild stray have to look out for him no doubt about it gone wild i should think the children relaxed after about an hour thinking that the sticks must have given up looking for them they boiled the kettle to make some tea and anne began to cut some sandwiches timmy was tied up in case he wandered out again to look for stinker they ate their tea quietly not speaking above a whisper the sticks havent come here to look for us after all said julian its quite plain from what they said that they thought we had gone to catch the train home taking george and timmy with us then what are they here for demanded george fiercely its our island theyve no right here lets go and turn them off theyre scared of timmy well take him with us and say well set him on to them if they dont clear out no george said julian do be sensible we dont want them rushing off and telling your father we are here or he may lose his temper and come flying home to order us back andtheres another thing ive thought of what asked the others seeing julians eyes gleam in the way they did when he had an idea well said julian dont you think its possible that the sticks are something to do with the smugglers dont you think they may come here to take off smuggled goods or to hide them till they can take them off in safety mr stick is a sailor isnt he he would know all about smuggling i bet hes in the pay of the smugglers all right i believe youre right said george in excitement wellwell wait till the sticks have gone and then well go down into the dungeons and see if theyve hidden anything there well find out their little game and stop it it will be terribly thrilling wont it chapter sixteen the sticks get a fright but the sticks didnt go the children peeped out of the spyhole at the top of the caveroof every now and again and saw one or other of the sticks the evening went on and it began to be dark still the sticks didnt go julian ran down to the nearby shore and discovered a small boat there so the sticks had managed to find their way round the island rowed near the wreck maybe landed on it too and then come to the shore cleverly avoiding the rocks they might strike against it looks as if the sticks have come to stay for the night said julian gloomily this is going to spoil our stay here isnt it we rush away here to escape from the sticksand lo and behold the sticks are on top of us again its too bad lets frighten them saidgeorge her eyes shining by the light of the one candle in the cave what do you mean said dick cheering up he always liked georges ideas mad as they sometimes were well i suppose they must be living down in one of the dungeon rooms mustnt they said george there is no place in the ruins to live in proper shelter or wed be there ourselvesand the only other place is down in the dungeons i wouldnt care to sleep there myself but i dont suppose the sticks would mind well what about it said dick whats your idea couldnt we creep down and do a bit of shouting so that the echoes start up all round said george you know how frightening we found the echoes when we first went down into the dungeons we only had to say one or two words and the echoes began saying them over and over again shouting them back at us oh yes i remember said anne and wasnt timmy frightened when he barked the echoes barked back at him and he thought there were thousands of dogs hiding down there he was awfully frightened its a good idea said julian serve the sticks right for coming to our island like this if we can frighten them away that would be one up to us lets do it what about timothy said anne hadnt we better leave him behind no he can come and stand at the dungeon entrance to guard it for us said george then if any of the real smugglers happened to come timmy could give us warning im not going to leave him behind come on then lets go now said julian it would be a fine trick to play its quite dark but ive got my torch and as soon as we are certain that the sticks are down in the dungeons we can start to play our joke there was no sign or sound of the sticks anywhere about no light of fire or candle was to be seen no sound of voices to be heard either they had gone or they were below in the dungeons the stones had been taken from the entrance so the children felt sure they were down there now timmy you stay quite still and quiet here whispered george to timmy bark if anyone comes but not unless were going down into the dungeons i think perhaps ill stay up here with timothy said anne suddenly she didnt like the dark look of the dungeon entrance you see georgetimmy might be frightened or lonely up here by himself the others chuckled they knew anne was frightened julian squeezed her arm you stay here then he said kindly you keep old timmy company then julian george and dick went down the long flight of steps that led into the deep old dungeons of kirrin castle they had been there the summer before when they had been seeking for lost treasure now here they were again they crept down the steps and came to the many cellars or dungeons cut out of the rock below the castle there were scores of those some big and some small queer damp underground rooms in which maybe unhappy prisoners had been kept in the olden days the children crept down the dark passages julian had a piece of white chalk with him and drew a chalkline here and there on the rocky walls as he went so that he might easily find the way back suddenly they heard voices and saw a light they stopped and whispered softly together in each others ears theyre in that room where we found the treasure last year thats where theyre camping out what noises shall we make ill be a cow said dick i can moo awfully like a cow ill be a cow ill be a sheep said julian george you be a horse you can whinny and hrrrumph just like a horse dick you begin so dick began hidden behind a rocky pillar he opened his mouth and mooed dolefully like a cow in pain at once the echoes took up the mooing magnified it sent it along all the underground passages till it seemed as if a thousand cows had wandered there and were mooing together moooooooooooooo ooooomooooooo the sticks listened in amazement and fright at the sudden awful noise what is it ma said edgar almost in tears stinker crouched at the back of the cave terrified its cows said mr stick amazed them theres cows cant you hear the moos but how did cows get to be here nonsense said mrs stick recovering herself a little cows down these caves youre mad youll be telling me theres sheep next it was funny that she should have said that for julian chose that moment to begin baaing like a flock of sheep his one long bleating baabaaaaaa was taken up by the echoes at once and it seemed suddenly as if hundreds of poor lost sheep were baaing their way down the dungeons mr stick jumped to his feet as white as a sheet well if it isnt sheep now he said whats up whats in these ere dungeons i never did like them baaaaaaaaaaaaaap went the mournful bleats all round and about and then george started her whinnying and neighing just like an impatient horse the little girl tossed her head in the darkness and hrrrumphed exactly like a horse and then she stamped with her foot and at once the echoes stamped too sending the whinnying and neighing and stamping into sticks cave twenty times louder than george had made them poor stinker began to whine pitifully he was frightened almost out of his life he pressed himself against the floor as if he would like to disappear into it edgar clutched his mothers arm lets go up he said i cant stay here theres hundreds of sheep and horses and cows roaming these dungeons you can hear them theyre not real but theyve got voices and hoofs and im scared of them mr stick went to the door of the room they were in and shouted loudly get out you clear out whoever you are george giggled then she shouted out in a very deep hoarse voice beware and the echoes thundered out all round ware ware wareareare mr stick went back quickly into the caveroom and lighted another candle he shut the big wooden door that led into the room his hands were shaking queer goingson he said shant stay here much longer if we get this kind of thing happening every night julian dick and george were now in such a state of giggle that they could not imitate any morecows horses or sheep george did begin to be a pig and gave such a realistic snort and grunt that dick nearly died of laughing the snorts and grunts were echoed everywhere come out gasped julian at last i shall burst with trying not to laugh come out come out whispered the echoes come out out out they stumbled out stuffing hankies into their mouths as they went following julians chalkmarks easily by the light of his torch it was impossible to take the wrong passage if they followed his guidinglines they sat on the dungeon steps with anne and timmy and choked with laughter as they related all they had done we heard old stick yelling to us to clear out said george and he sounded scared stiff as for stinker we never heard even the smallest growl from him i bet the sticks will clear off tomorrow after this it must have given them a most terrible fright oh that was grand said julian it was a pity i began to laugh i was just feeling i might trumpet like an elephant next the echoes would like that funny the sticks all staying on the island like this said dick thoughtfully theyve left kirrin cottagebut theyre not looking for us they must be in league with the smugglers all right perhaps thats why mrs stick took the job with your mother george to be near the island when the time camewhen the smugglers wanted their help we could really go back to kirrin cottage couldnt we said anne who much as she loved the islandwas not nearly so keen on it now that the sticks were there go back leave an adventure just when its beginning said george scornfully how silly you are anne go back if you want to but im sure nobody will go with you oh anne will stay with us all right said julian knowing that anne would feel hurt at the suggestion she should leave them it will be the sticks who have to go dont worry lets go back to the cave said anne thinking longingly of its safety and bright little candle they got up and made their way across the courtyard to the little wall that ran round the castle they climbed over it and turned their steps to the cliff julian switched on his torch when he thought it was safe for it was impossible to see clearly in the dark and he did not want any of them to fall down the hole instead of climbing down properly by the rope julian stood by the hole at last shining his torch so that the others might climb down the rope in safety one by one he glanced up looking over the dark sea as he stood there and then stared intently there was a light out to sea and it was signalling it must have seen his torchlight julian watched wondering if it was a ship that was signalling and how far out it was and why it was signalling perhaps theyre going to put more stuff into the old wreck for the sticks to find he thought i wonder if they are how id like to find outbut it would be dangerous to go there in daylight in case the sticks see us the signalling went on for a long time as if a message was being flashed julian could not for the life of him make out what itwas it simply looked like the flashflashflash of a lantern to him but it must mean a signal or message of some sort to the sticks well they wont get it tonight thought julian with a chuckle when at last the signalling stopped i rather think the stick family will stay where they are tonight too scared of sheep and cows and horses rushing about in those dungeons julian was quite rightthe sticks did stay where they were nothing would get them out of their underground room till morning chapter seventeen a shock for edgar the children slept well that night and as timothy did not growl at all they were sure that nothing important could have happened they had a fine breakfast of tongue tinned peaches bread and butter golden syrup and gingerbeer thats the end of the gingerbeer im afraid said julian regretfully i must say gingerbeer is a gorgeous drinkseems to go with simply everything that was the nicest meal ive ever had said anne it really was we do have lovely meals on kirrin island i wonder if the sticks are having nice meals too you bet they are said dick i expect they have ransacked aunt fannys cupboards and taken the best they can find oh the beasts said george her eyes flashing i never thought of thatthey may have robbed the house and taken all kinds of things they probably have said julian and he frowned i say i never thought of that somehow how awful george if your mother came back feeling ill and weak and found half her belongings gone oh dear said anne dismayed george wouldnt that be dreadful yes said george looking very angry i would believe anything of those sticks if they have the cheek to come to our island and live here theyve the cheek to steal from my mothers house i wish we could find out they could have brought quite a lot of things away in their boat said julian they must have come here by boat if they did bring stolen goods they must have put them somewheredown in the dungeons i suppose we might have a look round and see if we can spy anything without the sticks seeing us suggested dick lets have a look round now said george who always liked doing things at once anne you do the washing up and tidy our cavehouse for us will you anne was torn between wanting to go with the others and longing to play house again she did so love arranging everything and making the beds and tidying up the cave in the end she said she would stay and the others could go so up the rope they went timothy stayed with anne because they were afraid he might bark anne tied him up and he whined a little but did not make a terrible noise the other three lay flat on the clifftop looking down on the ruined castle there seemed to be no one about but even as they watched the three sticks appeared apparently coming up from the dungeons they seemed glad to be in the sunshine and the children were not surprised for the dungeons were so cold and dark the sticks looked all round stinker kept close to mrs stick his tail well down theyre looking for the cows and sheep andhorses they heard down in the dungeons last night whispered dick to julian the sticks spoke together for a minute or two and then went off in the direction of the shore that faced the wreck edgar went to the room in which the children had first planned to sleepthe one whose roof had fallen in im going to stalk the two sticks whispered julian to the others you two see what edgar is up to julian disappeared keeping behind bushes as he watched where the sticks went and followed them george and dick went cautiously and quietly over the cliff to the castle in the middle of the little island they could hear edgar whistling stinker was running about the courtyard of the castle edgar appeared out of the ruined room carrying a pile of cushions which had evidently been stored there george went red with rage and clutched dicks arm fiercely mothers best cushions she whispered oh the beasts dick felt angry too it was quite plain that the sticks had helped themselves to anything handy when they had left kirrin cottage he picked up a clod of earth took careful aim and flung it into the air it fell between edgar and stinker breaking into a shower of earth edgar dropped the cushions and looked up into the air in fright it was plain that he thought something had fallen from the sky george picked up another clod took aim and flung it high into the air it fell all over stinker and the dog gave a yelp and scuttled down the hole that led into the dungeons edgar looked up into the sky and then all round and about him his mouth wide open what could be happening dick waited until he was looking in the opposite direction and then once more sent a big clod into the air it fell into bits and scattered itself all over the startled edgar then dick gave one of his realistic moos exactly like a cow in pain and edgar stood rooted to the spot almost frightened out of his skin those cows again where were they dick mooed again and edgar gave a yell found his feet and almost fell down the dungeon steps he dis appeared with a dismal howl leaving behind all the cushions on the ground quick said dick jumping to his feet he wont be back for a few minutes anyhow hell be too scared lets grab the cushions and bring them here i dont see why the sticks should use them down in those awful old dungeons the two children raced to the courtyard picked up the cushions and raced back to their hidingplace dick looked across to the room where edgar had brought them from what about slipping across there and seeing what else theyve stored away he said i dont see why they should be allowed to have anything that isnt theirs ill go across and you keep watch by the dungeon entrance said george youve only got to moo again if you see edgar and hell run for miles right said dick with a grin and went swiftly to the flight of steps that led underground to the dungeons there was no sign of edgar at all nor of stinker george went to the ruined room and gazed round in anger yes the sticks certainly had helped themselves to her mothers things no doubt about that there were blankets and silver and all kinds of food mrs stick must have gone into the big cupboard under the stairs and taken out various things stored there for weekly use george ran to dick there are heaps of our things she said in a fierce whisper come and help me to get them well see if we can take them all before edgar appears or the sticks come back just as they were whispering together they heard a low whistle they looked round and saw julian coming along he joined them the sticks have rowed off to the wreck he said theyve got an old boat somewhere down among those rocks old pa stick must be a good sailor to be able to take the boat in and out of those awful hidden rocks oh then weve got time to do what we want to do said dick pleased he hurriedly told julian of the things george had seen in the ruined room awful thieves said julian indignantly they dont mean to go back to kirrin cottage thats plain theyve got some business on with the smugglers hereand when that is done theyll go off with all their stolen goods join a ship somewhere and get off scotfree no they wont said george at once we are going to get everything and take it to the cave dicks going to keep watch for edgar at the cave entrance and you and i julian can quickly carry the things away we can drop them down the hole into the cave hurry then said julian we must do it before the sticks return and i dont expect theyll be long theyve probably gone to fetch the trunk and anything else in the wreck you know i saw a light out to sea last nightmaybe thats a signal that the smugglers were leaving something in the wreck for the sticks to fetch george and julian ran to the ruined room piled their arms with the goods there and then ran to hide them on the cliff ready to take them to the hole when they had time it looked as if the sticks had just taken whatever was easiest to lay their hands on they had even got the kitchen clock edgar did not appear at all so dick had nothing to do but sit by the steps of the dungeon and watch the others after some time julian and george gave a sigh of relief and beckoned to dick he left his place and went to join them weve got everything now said julian im just going to the cliffedge to see if the sticks are returning yet if theyre not well all carry the things to the hole in the roof of the cave he soon returned i can see their boat tied to the wreck he said were safe for some while yet come on lets get the things to safety this really is a bit of luck they carried the things to the hole and called down it to anne anne weve got tons of things to put down the hole stand by to catch soon all kinds of things came down the hole into the cave anne was most astonished the silver and anything that might be hurt by a fall was first wrapped up in the blankets and then let down by a rope my goodness said anne this cave will really look like a house soon when i have arranged all these things too just as they were finishing their job the children heard voices in the distance the sticks are back said julian and looked cautiously over the clifftop he was right they had returned to their boat and were even now on their way back to the castle carrying the trunk from the wreck lets follow them and see what happens when they find everything gone grinned julian come on everyone they wriggled over the cliff on their tummies and came to a clump of bushes behind which they could hide and watch the sticks put the trunk down and looked round for edgar but edgar was nowhere to be seen wheres that boy said mrs stick impatiently hes had plenty of time to do everything edgar edgar edgar mr stick went to the ruined room and peeped inside he came back to mrs stick hes taken everything down he said he must be down in the dungeon that rooms quite empty i told him to come up and sit in the sun when hed finished said mrs stick tisnt healthy down in them dungeons edgar this time edgar heard and his head appeared looking out of the entrance to the dungeon he looked extremely scared come on up said mrs stick youve got all the things down and youd better stay up here in the sunshine now im scared said edgar im not staying up here alone why not said mr stick astonished its them cows again said poor edgar hundreds of them pa all amooing round me and throwing things at me theyre dangerous animals they are and im not coming up here alone chapter eighteen an unexpected prisoner the sticks stared at edgar as if he was mad cows throwing things said mrs stick at last what do you mean by that cows dont throw any thing these ones did said edgar and then began to exaggerate in order to make his parents sympathise with him they were dreadful cows they werehundreds of them with horns as long as reindeer and awful mooing voices and they threw things at me and tinker proper scared he was and so was i i dropped the cushions i was taking down and rushed away to hide where are the cushions said mr stick looking round i cant see no cushions i suppose youll tell us the cows ate them didnt you take everything down into the dungeons demanded mrs stick because that rooms empty now theres not a thing in it i didnt take nothing down at all said edgar coming cautiously out of the dungeon entrance i dropped the cushions just about where youre standing whats happened to them look ere said mr stick in amazement oos been ere since weve been gone someones taken them cushions and everything else too where have they put them pa it was them cows said edgar looking all round as if he expected to see cows walking off with cushions and silver and blankets shut up about them cows said mrs stick suddenly losing her temper for one thing there arent any cows on this island and that we do know for we looked all over it this morning what we heard last night must have been queer sort of echoes rumbling round no my boy theres something funny about all this looks as if there w somebody on the island a dismal howl came echoing up from below the ground it was stinker terrified at being alone below and not daring to come up poor lamb said mrs stick who seemed much fonder of stinker than of anyone else whats up with him stinker let out an even more doleful howl and mrs stick hurried downthe steps to go to him mr stick followed her and edgar lost no time in going after them quick said julian standing up come with me dick we may just have time to get that trunk run the two boys ran quickly down to the courtyard of the ruined castle each took a handle of the small trunk and lifted it betweenthem they staggered back to george with it well take it to the cave whispered julian you stay here a few minutes and see what happens the boys went over the cliff with the trunk george flattened herself behind her bush and watched mr stick appeared again in a few minutes and looked round for the trunk his mouth fell open in astonishment when he saw that it was gone he yelled down the entrance to the dungeon clara the trunks gone mrs stick was already on her way up with stinker close beside her and edgar just behind she climbed out and stared round gone she said in enormous surprise gone wheres it gone thats what id like to know said mr stick we leave it here a few minutes and then it goes walks off by itselfjust like all the other things look here theres someone on this island said mrs stick and im going to find out who it is got your gun pa i have said mr stick slapping his belt you get a good stout stick too and well take tinker if we dont ferret out whoevers trying to spoil our plans my names not stick george slipped away quietly to warn the others before she slid down the rope into the cave she pulled several bramble sprays across the hole she dropped down to the floor of the cave and told the others what had happened julian had been trying to open the trunk but it was still locked he looked up as george panted out her tale well be all right here so long as no one falls down that hole in the roof he said now keep quiet everyone and dont you dare to growl timmy nothing was heard for some time and then stinkers bark came in the distance quiet now said julian they are near here the sticks were up on the cliff once more searching carefully behind every bush they came to the great bush behind which the children often hid and saw the flattened grass there someones been here said mr stick i wonder if theyre in the middle of this bushits thick enough to hide half an army ill try and force my way in clara while you stand by with my gun edgar wandered off by himself while this was happening feeling certain that nobody would be foolish enough to live in the middle of such a prickly bush he walked across the cliff and then to his awful horror he found himself falling his legs disappeared into a hole he clutched at some thorny sprays but could not save himself down he went and down and downand downcrash edgar had fallen down the hole in the roof of the cave he suddenly appeared before the childrens startled eyes and landed in a heap on the soft sand timmy at once pounced on him with a fearsome growl but george pulled him off just in time edgar was halfstunned with fright and his fall he lay on the floor of the cave groaning his eyes shut the children stared at him and then at one another for a few moments they were completely taken aback and didnt know what to do or say timmy growled ferociouslyso ferociously that edgar opened his eyes in fright he stared round at the four children and their dog in the utmost surprise and horror he opened his mouth to yell for help but at once found julians large hand over it yell just once and timmy shall have a bite out of any part of you he likes said julian in a voice as ferocious as timothys growl see like to try it timmys waiting to bite i shant yell said edgar speaking in such a low whisper that the others could hardly hear him keep that dog off i shant yell george spoke to timothy now you listen timothyif this boy shouts you just go for him lie here by him and show him your big teeth bite him wherever you like if he yells woof said timmy looking really pleased he lay down by edgar and the boy tried to move away but timmy came nearer every time he moved edgar looked round at the children what you doing on this island he said we thought youd gone home its our island said george in a very fierce voice weve every right to be on it if we want tobut you have no right at all none what are you and your father and mother here for dont know said edgar looking sulky youd better tell us said julian we know youre in league with smugglers edgar looked startled smugglers he said i didnt know that pa and ma dont tell me nothing i dont want nothing to do with smugglers dont you know anything said dick dont you know why youve come to kirrin island i dont know nothing said edgar in an injured tone pa and ma are mean to me they never tell me nothing i do as im told thats all i dont know nothing about smugglers i tell you that it was quite plain to the children that edgar really did not know anything of the reasons for his parents coming to the island well im not surprised they dont let spottyface into their secrets said julian hed blab them if he could i bet anyway we know its smuggling theyre mixed up in you let me go said edgar sullenly you got no right to keep me here were not going to let you go said george at once youre our prisoner now if we let you go back to your parents youd tell them all about us and we dont want them to know were here were going to spoil their pretty plans you see edgar saw he saw quite a lot of things he felt rather sick was it you that took the cushions and things oh no dear edgar said dick it was the cows wasnt it dont you remember how you told your mother about the hundreds of cows that mooed at you and threw things and stole the cushions you dropped surely you havent forgotten your cows already funny arent you said edgar sulkily what you going to do with me i wont stay here thats flat but you will spottyface said julian you will stay here till we let you goand that wont be till weve cleared up this little smuggling mystery and let me warn you that any nonsense on your part will be punished by timmy lot of beasts you are said edgar seeing that he could do nothing but obey the four children my pa and ma wont half be furious with you his ma and pa were feeling extremely astonished there had of course been nobody hiding in the big thick bush and when mr stick had wriggled out scratched and bleeding he had looked round for edgar and edgar was not to be seen wheres that dratted boy he said and shouted for him edgar edgar but edgar did not answer the sticks spent a very long time looking for edgar both above ground and underground mrs stick was convinced that poor edgar was lost in the dungeons and she tried to send stinker to find him but stinker only went as far as the first cave he remembered the peculiar noises of the night before and was not at all keen on exploring the dungeons julian turned his attention to the little trunk once edgar had been dealt with im going to open this somehow he said im sure its got smuggled goods in though goodness knows what youll have to smash the locks then said dick julian got a small rock and tried to smash the two locks he managed to wrench one open after a while and then the other gave way too the children threw back the lid on the top was a childs blanket embroidered with white rabbits julian pulled it off expecting to see the smuggled goods below but to his astonishment there were a childs clothes he pulled them out there were two blue jerseys a blue skirt some vests and knickers and a warm coat at the bottom of the trunk were some dolls and a teddy bear golly said julian in amazement what are all these for why did the sticks bring these to the islandand why did the smugglers hide them in the wreck its a puzzler edgar appeared to be as astonished as the rest he too had expected valuable goods of some kind george and anne pulled out the dolls they were lovely ones anne cuddled them up to her she loved dolls though george scorned them who do they belong to she said oh wont she besad not to have them julian isnt it funny why should anyone bring a trunk full of clothes and dolls to kirrin island chapter nineteen a scream in the night nobody could even guess the answers to annes surprised questions the children stared into the trunk and puzzled over it it seemed such a funny thing to smuggle they remembered the other things in the wreck toothe tins of food they were queer things to smuggle into the island there didnt seem any point in it funny said dick at last it beats me theres no doubt that queer things are afoot here or the sticks wouldnt be hanging around our island and weve seen signals from a ship out to sea somethings going on we thought if we opened this trunk it might help us but its only made the mystery deeper just then the voices of the two parent sticks could be heard shouting for edgar but edgar did not dare to shout back timmys nose was poked against his leg he might be nipped at any time timmy growled every now and again to remind edgar that he was still there do you know anything about the ship that signals to this island at night asked julian turning to edgar the boy shook his head never heard of no signals he said i just heard my mother saying that she expected the roomer tonight but i dont know what she meant the roomer said george at once whats thata manor a boator what i dont know said edgar id only have got a clip on the ear if id asked find out yourself we will said julian grimly well watch out for the roomer tonight thanks for the information the children spent a quiet and rather boring day in the caveall but anne who had plenty of things to arrange again really the cave looked most homelike when she had finished she put the blankets on the bed and used the rugs as carpets so the cave really looked most imposing edgar was not allowed to go out of the cave and timothy didnt leave him for a moment he slept most of the time complaining that them cows and things had frightened him so much the night before that hed not been able to sleep a wink the others discussed their plans in low voices they decided to keep watch on the clifftop two and two together that night they would wait and see what happened if the roomer came they would hurriedly make fresh plans then the sun sank the night came up dark over the sea edgar snored softly after a very good supper of sardines pressed beef sandwiches tinned apricots and tinned milk anne and dick went up to keep the first watch it was about halfpast ten at halfpast twelve julian and george climbed up the knotted rope and joined the other two they had nothing to report they went down into the cave got into their comfortable beds and went to sleep edgar was snoring away in his corner timmy still on guard julian and george looked out to sea watching for any sign of a ship the moon was up that night and things were not quite so dark suddenly they heard low voices and saw shadowy figures down by the rocks below the two sticks whispered julian going to row out to the wreck again i suppose there was the splash of oars and the children saw a boat move out over the water at the same time george nudged julian violently and pointed out to sea a light was being shown a good way out from a ship that the children could barely see then the moon went behind a cloud and they could see nothing for some time they watched breathlessly was that shadowy ship a good way out the roomer or was the owner of it the roamer were the smugglers at work tonight theres another boat cominglook said george it must be coming from that ship out to sea now the moon has come out again you can just see it it is going to the old wreck it must be a meetingplace i should think then most irritatingly the moon went behind a cloud again and remained there so long that the children grew impatient at last it sailed out again and lighted up the water both boats are leaving the wreck now said julian excitedly theyve had their meetingand passed over the smuggled goods i supposeand now one boat is returning to the ship and the other the sticks boat is coming back here with the goods well follow the sticks when they get back and see where they put the goods after a long time the sticks boat came to shore again the children could not see anything then but presently they saw the sticks going back towards the castle mr stick carried what looked like a large bundle flung over his shoulder they could not see if mrs stick carried anything the sticks went into the courtyard of the castle and came to the dungeon entrance theyre taking the smuggled goods down there whispered julian to george the children were now watching from behind a nearby wall well go back and tell the others and make some more plans we must somehow or other get those goods ourselves and take them back to the mainland and get in touch with the police just then a scream rang out in the night it was a highpitched terrified scream and frightened the watching children very much they had no idea where it came from quick it must be anne said julian and the two ran as fast as they could to the hole that led down to the cave they dropped down the rope and julian looked round the quiet cave anxiously what had happened to anne to make her scream like that but anne was peacefully asleep on her bed and so was dick edgar still snored and timmy watched his eyes gleaming green funny said julian still startled awfully queer who screamed like that it couldnt possibly have been annebecause if she had screamed in her sleep like that she would have wakened the others well who screamed then said george feeling rather scared wasnt it weird julian i didnt like it it was somebody who was awfully frightened but who could it be they woke dick and anne and told them about the strange scream anne was very startled dick was interested to hear that two boats had met at the wreck and that the sticks had brought back smuggled goods of some sort and taken them down in the dungeons well get those tomorrow somehow he said cheerfully well have good fun why did you think it was me screaming asked anne did you think it was a girls scream yes it sounded like the scream you give when one of us jumps out at you suddenly said julian a proper little girls screamnot a yell like a boy gives its funny said anne she cuddled down into her bed again and george got in beside her oh anne said george in disgust youve got our bed simply full of those dollsand that teddy bear is here too you really are a baby no im not said anne the dolls and the bear are babiesthey are frightened and lonely because theyre not with the little girl they belong to so i had them in bed with me instead im sure the little girl would be glad the little girl said julian slowly we thought we heard a little girl scream tonightwe found a small trunk full of a little girls clothes and a little girls dolls what docs it all mean there was a silenceand then anne spoke excitedly i know the smuggled goods are a little girl theyve stolen a little girl awayand these are her dolls and those over there are her clothes that were stolen at the same time for her to dress in and play with the little girls here on this island nowyou heard her scream tonight when those horrid sticks carried her down into the dungeons well i do believe anne has hit on the right idea said julian clever little girl anne i think youre right it isnt smugglers who are using this islandits kidnappers what are kidnappers said anne people who steal away children or grownups and hide them somewhere till a large sum of money is paid out for them explained julian its called a ransom till the ransom is paid the prisoner is held by the captors well thats whats happened here then said george i bet it has some poor little rich girl has been stolen awayand brought to the wreck by boat from some ship and taken over by those horrible sticks wicked creatures and we heard the poor little thing scream just as she was taken down underground said george julian weve got to rescue her yes of course said julian we will never fear well rescue her tomorrow edgar woke up and joined in the conversation suddenly what you talking about he said rescue who never you mind said julian george nudged him and whispered all i hope is that mrs stick is feeling as upset about losing her dear edgar as the mother of the little girl she said tomorrow we find the little girl somehow and take her away said julian i expect the sticks will be on guard but well find a way im tired now said george lying down lets go to sleep well wake up nice and fresh oh anne do put these dolls your side im lying on at least three anne took the dolls and the bear and arranged them on her side of the bed dont feel lonely george heard her say ill look after you all right till you go back to your own mistress sleep tight soon they all sleptall but timothy who lay with one eye open all night long there was no need to put anyone on guard while timmy was there he was the best guardian they could have chapter twenty a rescueand a new prisoner the next day julian was awake early and went up the rope to the clifftop to see if the sticks were about he saw them coming up the steps that led from the dungeons mrs stick looked pale and worried weve got to find our edgar she kept saying to mr stick i tell you weve got to find our edgar hes not down in the dungeons that i do know weve yelled ourselves hoarse down there and hes not on the island said mr stick we hunted all over it yesterday i think whoever was here then took our goods caught edgar and made off with him and everything else in their boat thats what i think well theyve taken him to the mainland then said mrs stick wed better take our boat and go back there and ask a few questions what id like to know iswho is it messing about here and interfering with our plans it makes me scared just when things are going nicely too is it all right to leave here just now said mr stick doubtfully suppose whoever was here yesterday is still herethey might pop down into the dungeons when were gone well theyre not here said mrs stick firmly use your common sense if youve got anywouldnt our edgar yell the place down if he was being kept prisoner on this little islandand wouldnt we hear him i tell you he must have been taken off in a boat together with all the other things that are gone and i dont like it all right all right said mr stick in a grumbling tone that boys always a nuisancealways in silly trouble of some sort how can you talk of poor edgar like that cried mrs stick do you think the poor child likes being captured goodness knows what hes going through feeling frightened and lonely without me julian felt disgusted here was mrs stick talking like that about old spottyfaceand yet she had a little girl down in the dungeonsa child much younger than edgar what a beast she was what about tinker said mr stick in a sulky tone better leave him here hadnt we to guard the entrance to the dungeons not that there will be anyone here if what you say is right oh well leave tinker said mrs stick setting off to the boat julian saw them embark leaving the dog behind tinker watched them rowing away his tail well down between his legs then he turned and ran back to the courtyard and lay down dolefully in the sun he was very uneasy his ears were cocked and he kept looking this way and that he didnt like this queer island and its unexpected noises julian tore back to the cave and dropped down the rope startling edgar very much come outside the cave and ill tell you my plans said julian to the others he didnt want edgar to hear them they all went outside anne had got breakfast ready while julian had been gone and the kettle was boiling away merrily on the little stove listen said julian the sticks have gone off in their boat back to the mainland to see if they can find their precious little darling edgar mrs stick is all hot and bothered because she thinks someones gone off with him and shes afraid the poor boy will be feeling frightened and lonely well said george doesnt she think that the little kidnapped girl must be feeling much worse what a horrid woman she is youre right said julian well what i propose to do is thiswell go down into the dungeons now and rescue the little girland bring her here to our cave for breakfast then well take her off in our boat go to the police find out where her parents are and telephone to them that she is safe what shall we do with edgar said anne i know said george at once well put edgar into the dungeon instead of the little girl think how astonished the sticks will be to find the little girl gone and their dear edgar shut up in the dungeon instead ooohthat is a good idea said anne and all the others laughed and agreed you stay here anne and cut some more bread and butter for the little girl said julian he knew that anne hated going down into the dungeons anne nodded pleased all right i will ill just take the kettle off for a bit too or else the water will boil away they all went back into the cave come with us edgar said julian you come too timmy where you going to take me said edgar suspiciously a nice cosy comfortable place where cows cant get at you said julian come on buck up grrrrrr said timmy his nose against edgars leg edgar got up in a hurry they all went up the rope one after another though edgar was terribly scared and was sure he couldnt but with timmy snapping at his ankles below he climbed up the rope remarkably quickly and was hauled out at the top by julian now quick march said julian who wanted to get everything over before the sticks thought of returning and quick march it was over the cliffs over the low wall of the castle and down into the courtyard im not going down into them dungeons with you said edgar in alarm you are spottyface said julian amiably wheres my pa and ma said edgar looking anxiously all round those cows have got them i expect said george the ones that came and mooed at you and threw things you know everyone giggled except edgar who looked worried and pale he did not like this kind of adventure at all the children came to the dungeon entrance and found that the sticks had not only closed down the stone that opened the way to the dungeons but had also dragged heavy rocks across it blow your parents said julian to edgar making a lot of trouble for everybody come on stir yourself all hands to these stones edgar pull when we pull go on youll get into trouble if you dont edgar pulled with the rest and one by one the rocks were moved away then the heavy trapdoor stone was hauled up too and the flight of steps was exposed leading down into darkness theres tinker suddenly cried edgar pointing to a bush some distance away tinker was there hiding quite terrified at seeing timothy again tat lot of good stinker is said julian no timmyyoure not to eat him stay here he wouldnt taste nice if you did eat him timothy was sorry not to be able to chase stinker round and round the island if he couldnt chase rabbits he might at least be allowed to chase stinker they all went down into the dungeons julians white chalkmarks were still on the rocky walls so it was easy to find the way to the cavelike room where the children last summer had found piles of golden ingots they felt sure that the little kidnapped girl had been put there for this cave had a big wooden door that could be bolted on the outside they came to the door it was well and truly bolted there was no sound from inside everyone halted outside and timmy scratched at the door whining gently he knew there was someone inside hallo there shouted julian in a loud and cheerful voice are you all right weve come to rescue you there was a scrambling noise as if someone had got up from a stool then a small voice sounded from the cave hallo who are you oh do please rescue me im so lonely and frightened just undoing the door called back julian cheerfully were all children out here so dont be afraid youll soon be safe he shot back the bolts and flung open the door inside the cave which was lighted by a lantern stood a small girl with a scared little white face and large dark eyes dark red hair tumbled round her cheeks and she had evidently been crying bitterly for her face was dirty and tearstained dick went to her and put his arm round her everythings all right now he said youre safe well take you back to your mother i do want her i do i do said the little girl and tears ran down her cheeks again why am i here i dont like being here oh its just an adventure youve had said julian its over nowat least nearly over theres still a bit of it lefta nice bit though we want you to come and have breakfast with us in our cave weve a lovely cave oh have you said the little girl rubbing her eyes i want to go with you i like you but i didnt like those other people of course you didnt said george look this is timothy our dog he wants to be friends with you what a simply lovely dog said the little girl and flung her arms around timmys neck he licked her ir delight george was pleased she put her arm round the little girl whats your name she said jennifer mary armstrong said the little girl whats yours george said george and the little girl nodded thinking that george was a boy not a girl for she was dressed in jeans just like julian and dick and her hair was short too though very curly the others told her their namesand then she looked at edgar who had said nothing this is spottyface said julian he isnt a friend of ours it was his father and mother who put you here jennifer now we are going to leave him here in your place it will be such a pleasant surprise for them wont it edgar gave a yell of dismay and tried to back awaybut julian gave him a strong shove that sent him flying into the cave theres only one way to teach people like you and your parents that wickedness doesnt pay said the boy grimly and that is to punish you hard people like you dont understand kindness you think its just being soft and silly all rightyou can have a taste of what jennifer has had it will do you good and do your parents a lot of good too goodbye edgar began to howl dismally as julian bolted the big wooden door top and bottom i shall starve he wailed oh no you wont said julian theres plenty of food and water in there so help yourself it would do you good to go hungry for a while all the same mind the cows dont get you called dick and he gave a realistic moo that startled jennifer very much for the echoes came mooing round too its all rightonly the echoes said george smiling at her in the torchlight edgar howled away in the cave sobbing like a baby little coward isnt he said julian come onlets get back im awfully hungry for my breakfast so am i said jennifer slipping her small hand into julians i wasnt hungry at all in that cave but now i am thank you for rescuing me dont mention it said julian grinning at her its a real pleasureand an even greater one to put old spottyface there instead of you nice to give the sticks a dose of their own medicine jennifer didnt know what he meant but the others did and they chuckled they made their way back through the dark musty passages of the dungeons passing many caves big and small on the way they came at last to the flight of steps and went up them into the dazzling sunlight oh said jennifer breathing in great gulps of the fresh seasmelling air oh this is lovely where am i on our island said george and this is our ruined castle you were brought here last night in a boat we heard you scream and thats how we guessed you were being made a prisoner they walked to the cliff and jennifer was amazed at the way they disappeared down the knotted rope she was eager to try too and soon slid down into the cave nice kid isnt she said julian to george my word shes had even more of an adventure than we have chapter twentyone a visit to the police station anne liked jennifer very much and gave her a hug and a kiss jennifer looked round the wellfurnished cave in amazement and wonderand then she gavea scream of surprise and joy she pointed to annes neatlymade bed on which sat a number of beautiful dolls and a large teddybear my dolls she said oh and teddy too oh oh where did you get them ive missed them so oh josephine and angela and rosebud and marigold have you missed me she flung herself on the dolls anne was very interested to hear their names ive looked after them well she told jennifer theyre quite all right oh thank you said the little girl happily i do think youre all nice oh i saywhat a lovely breakfast it was anne had opened a tin of salmon two tins of peaches a tin of milk cut some bread and butter and made a big jug of cocoa jennifer sat down and began to eat she was very hungry and as she ate she began to lose her paleness and look rosy and happy the children talked busily as they ate jennifer told them about herself i was playing in the garden with my nurse she said and suddenly when nurse had gone indoors to fetch something a man climbed over the wall threw a shawl round my head and took me away we live by the sea you know and i soon heard the sound of the waves splashing on the shore and i knew i was being put into a boat i was taken to a big ship and locked down in a cabin for two days then i suppose i was brought here one night i was so frightened that i screamed that was the scream we heard said george it was lucky we heard it we had thought there was smuggling going on here in our islandwe didnt guess it was a case of kidnapping till we heard you screamthough we had found your trunk with your clothes and toys i dont know how the man got those said jennifer maybe one of our maids helped him there was one i didnt like at all she was called sarah stick ah said julian at once thats the one then it was mr and mrs stick who brought you here sarah stick your maid must be some relation of theirs they must have been in the pay of someone else i should thinksomeone who had a ship and could bring you here to hide you jolly good hidingplace too said george no one but us would ever have found it out they ate all their breakfast made some more cocoa and discussed their future plans well take our boat and go to the mainland this morning said julian well go straight to the policestation with jennifer i expect the newspapers are full of her disappearance and the police will recognise her at once i hope they catch the sticks said george i hope they wont disappear into thin air as soon as they hear that jennifer is found yeswe must warn the police of that said julian thoughtfully better not spread the news abroad till the sticks are caught i wonder where they are lets get the boat now said dick theres no point in waiting about jennifers parents will be thrilled to know she is safe i dont really want to leave this lovely cave said jennifer who was thoroughly enjoying herself now i wish i lived here too are you going to come back to the island and live here julian well we shall come back for a few days more i expect said julian you see our aunts home is empty at the moment because she is away ill and our uncle is with her so we might as well stay on our island till they come back oh could i come back with you begged jennifer her small round face alight with joy at the thought of living in a cave on an island with these nice children and their lovely dog oh do let me i would so like it and i do so lovetimmy i dont expect your parents would let you especially after youve just been kidnapped said julian but you can ask them if you like they all went to the boat and got in julian pushed off george steered the boat in and out of the rocks they saw the wreck which interested jenny very much indeed she badly wanted to stop but the others thought they ought to get to land as quickly as possible soon they were near the beach alf the fisherboy was there he saw them and waved he ran to help them to pull in their boat i was coming out in my boat this morning he said your fathers back master george but not your mother shes getting better they say and will be back in a weeks time well whats my father come back for demanded george in surprise he got worried because nobody answered the telephone explained alf he came down and asked me where you all were i didnt tell him of course i kept your secret but i was just coming out to warn you this morning he got back last nightand wasnt he wild no one there to give him any food all the house upside down and half the things gone hes at the police station now golly said george thats just where we are going too we shall meet him there oh dear i do hope he wont be in an awful temper you just cant do anything with my father when hes cross come on said julian its a good thing in a way that your father is here george we can explain everything to him and to the police at the same time they left alf who looked very surprised to see jennifer with the others he couldnt make out where she had come from certainly she had not started out to the island with thembut she had come back in their boat how was that it seemed very mysterious to alf the children arrived at the police station and marched in much to the surprise of the policeman there hallo he said whats the matter been doing a burglary or something and come to own up listen said george suddenly hearing a loud voice in theroom next to theirs thats fathers voice she darted to the door the policeman called to her shocked now dont you go in there the inspectors in there come over here special he has and mustnt be interrupted but george had flung open the door and gone inside her father turned and saw her he rose to his feet george where have you been how dare you go away like this and leave the house and everything its been robbed right and left ive just been telling the inspector about all the things that have been stolen dont worry father said george really dont worry weve found them all hows mother better much better said her father still looking amazed and angry thank goodness i can go back and tell her where you are she kept asking me about you all and i had to keep saying you were all right so as not to worry her but i hadnt any idea what was happening to you or where you had gone i feel very displeased with you where were you on the island said george looking rather sulky as she often did when her father was angry with her julian will tell you all about it julian came in followed by dick anne jennifer and timothy the inspector a big cleverlooking man with dark eyes under shaggy eyebrows looked at them all closely when he saw jennifer he stared hardand then suddenly rose to his feet whats your name little girl he said jennifer mary armstrong said jenny in a surprised voice bless us all said theinspector in a startled voice heres the child the whole country is looking forand she walks in here as cool as a cucumber lands sakes where did she come from what do you mean said georges father looking surprised what child is the whole country looking for i havent read the papers for some days then you dont know about little jenny armstrong being kidnapped said the inspector sitting down and pulling jenny near him shes the daughter of harry armstrong the millionaire you know well somebody kidnapped her and wants a hundred thousand pounds ransom for her my word weve combed the country for her and here she is as merry as you please well im blessedthis is the queerest thing i ever knew where have you been little missy on the island said jenny julianyou tell it all so julian told the whole story from beginning to end the policeman from outside came in and took notes down as he spoke everyone listened in amazement as for georges father his eyes nearly fell out of his head what adventures these children did have to be sure and how well they managed everything and do you happen to know who was the owner of the ship that brought little miss jenny alongthe one that sent a boat off to the wreck and put her there for the sticks to take asked the inspector no said julian all we heard was that the roomer was coming that night aha said the inspector with great satisfaction in his voice aha and oho we know the roomer all right a ship weve been watching for some timeowned by somebody were very very suspicious of we think hes dabbling in a whole lot of shady deals now this is very good news indeed the thing is where are the sticksand how can we catch them redhanded now youve got miss jenny out of their clutches theyll probably deny everything i know how we could catch them said julian quickly weve left their nasty son edgar locked in the same dungeon where they put jenny if only one of us could pass the word to the sticks that that is where edgar is theyd go back to the island all right and go right into the dungeonsso if you found them there it wouldnt be much good them denying that they dont know anything about the island and have never been there that would certainly make things a lot easier said the inspector he pressed a bell and another policeman came into the room the inspector gave him a full description of mr and mrs stick and told him to watch the countryside round about and report when they were found then master julian you might like to go and have a little conversation with them about their son edgar said the inspector smiling if they do go back to the island we shall follow them and get all the evidence we want thank you for your very great help now we must telephone to miss jennys parents and tell them she is safe she can come back to kirrin cottage with us said georges father still looking rather dazed at all that had happened ive got joanna our old cook to come back for a while to put things straight so there will be someone there to see to the children they must all come back well father said george firmly we will come back just for today but we plan to spend another week on kirrin island till mother comes back she said we could and we are having such a fine time there let joanna stay at kirrin cottage and keep it in order and get it ready for mother when she comes home she wont want the bother of looking after us too we can look after ourselves on the island i certainly think these children deserve a reward for the good work they have done remarked the inspector and that settled the matter very well said georges father you can all go off to the island againbut you must be back when your mother returns george of course i will said george i badly want to see mother but home isnt nice without her i would rather be on our island and i want to be there too said jenny unexpectedly ask my parents to come to kirrin please so that i can ask them if i can go with the other children ill do my best said the inspector grinning at the five children they liked him very much georges father stood up come along he said i want my lunch all this has made me feel hungry well go and see if joanna has got anything for us off they all went talking nineteen to the dozen making georges poor father feel quite bewildered he always seemed to get into the middle of some adventure when these children were about chapter twentytwo back to kirrin island soon everyone was at kirrin cottage joanna the old cook they had had before gave them a good welcome and listened to their adventures in astonishment getting the lunch ready all the while it was while they were having lunch that julian looking out of the window suddenly caught sight of a figure he knew very wellsomeone skulking along behind the hedge old pa stick he said and jumped up ill go after him stay here everyone he went out of the house ran round a corner and came face to face with mr stick do you want to know where edgar is said julian mysteriously mr stick looked startled he stared at julian not knowing what to say hes down in the dungeons locked in that cave said julian even more mysteriously you dont know nothin about edgar said mr stick where have you been didnt you go home never you mind said julian but if you want to find edgarlook in that cave mr stick gave the boy a glare and left him julian hurried indoors and rang up the police station he felt sure that mr stick would tell mrs stick what he had said and that mrs stick would insist on going back to the island to see if what he had said was true so all that needed to be done was for the police to keep a watch on the boats along the shore and see when the sticks left the children finished their dinner and uncle quentin announced that he must return to his wife who would want to know his news ill tell her you are having a fine time on the island he said and we can tell her all the extraordinary details when she returns home better he left in a car and the children wondered whether they might now return to their island or not but they decided to wait a little for they did not know what to do with jennifer very soon a large car drove up and stopped outside the gate of kirrin cottage out jumped a tall man with dark red hair and a pretty woman they must be your father and mother jenny said julian they wereand jennifer got so many hugs and kisses that she quite lost her breath she had to tell her story again and again and her father could not thank julian and the others enough for all they had done ask me for any reward you like he said and you can have it i shall never never be able to tell you how grateful i am to you for rescuing our little jenny ohwe dont want anything thank you said julian politely we enjoyed it all very much we like adventures ah but you must tell me something you want said jennys father julian glanced round at the others he knew that none of them wanted a reward jenny nudged him hard and nodded her head vigorously julian laughed well he said there is one thing wed all like very much its granted before you ask it said jennys father will you let jenny come and spend a week with us on our island said julian jenny gave a squeal and pressed julians arm very hard between her two small hands jennys parents looked rather takenaback well said her father wellshes just been kidnapped you knowand we dont feel inclined to let her out of our sight at the moment and you promised julian youd grant what he asked you promised daddy said jenny urgently oh please do let me ive always wanted to live on an island and this one has got a perfectly marvellous cave and a wonderful ruined castle and the dungeons where i was kept and and we take timothy our dog with us said julian see what a big powerful fellow he isnobody could come to much harm with timmy about could they tim woof said timothy in his deepest voice well you can go jenny on one condition said the little girls father at last and that is that i and your mother come over tomorrow and spend the day on the island to see that everything is all right for you oh thank you thank you daddy cried jenny and danced round the room in delight a whole week on the island with these new friends ofhers and timmy the dog what could be lovelier jenny can stay here the night cant she said george youll be staying at the hotel i suppose soon jennys parents left and went to the police station to get all the details of the kidnapping the children went to see if joanna was going to make cakes for tea just about teatime there came a knocking at thedoor a large policeman stood outside is master julian here he said oh youre the boy we want sir the sticks have just left for the island in their boat and weve got ours on the beach to follow but we dont think we know the way in and out of those hidden rocks that lie all round kirrin island could you or miss georgina guide us do you think im master george not miss georgina said george in a cold voice sorry sir said the policeman with a grin well could you come too well all come said dick jumping up i want to go back to the dear old island and sleep in our cave again tonight why should we miss a single night we can fetch jennys people tomorrow in our own boat well all come the policeman was a little doubtful about the arrangement but the children insisted and as there was no time to waste they all ended in crowding into the two boats with three big policemen george and julian leading the way in their own boat timmy lay down at georges feet as usual george guided the boat as cleverly as ever and soon they landed in the usual little sandy cove the sticks had evidently gone round by the wreck as usual and landed on the rockier part now no noise said julian warningly they all went quietly towards the ruin and came into the courtyard there was no sign of the sticks well go down underground said julian ive got my torch i expect the sticks are down there already letting out dear edgar they went down the steps into the dark dungeons anne went too this time holding on to the hand of one of the big policemen they moved quietly through the long dark winding passages they came at last to the door of the cave in which they had imprisoned edgar it was still bolted at the top and bottom look said julian in a whisper shining his torch on to the door the sticks havent been down here yet sh said george as timmy growled softly theres someone coming hide its the sticks i expect they all hid behind the wall that ran near by they could hear footsteps coming nearer and then the voice of mrs stick raised in anger if my edgars locked in there ill have something to say about it locking up a poor innocent boy like that i dont understand it if hes there wheres the girl you answer me that wheres the girl its my belief that the boss has done some doublecrossing to do us out of our share of the money didnt he say that hed give us a thousand pounds if we kept jenny armstrong for a week now i think he must have sent someone to this island played tricks on us taken the girl himself and locked up our edgar you may be right clara said mr stick his voice coming nearer and nearer but how did this boy julian know where edgar was theres a lot i dont understand about all this now the sticks were right at the door of the cave with stinker at their heels stinker smelt the others in hiding and whined in fear mr stick kicked him stop it its enough to hear our own voices echoing away all round without your whines too mrs stick was calling out loudly edgar are you there edgar ma yes im here yelled edgar let me out quick im proper scared let me out mrs stick undid the bolts at once and flung open the door by the light of the lantern in the cave she saw edgar he ran to her halfcrying who put you here demanded mrs stick you tell your pa and hell knock their heads off wont you pa putting a poor frightened child into a dark cave like this its a wicked thing to do suddenly the stick family had the fright of their lives for a large policeman stepped out of the shadows torch in one hand and notebook in the other ah said the policeman in a deep voice youre right clara stick to shut up a poor frightened child in that cave is a wicked thing to do and thats what you did isnt it you put jenny armstrong there shes only a little girl this boy of yours knew he wasnt coming to any harm but that little girl was scared to death mrs stick stood there opening and shutting her mouth like a goldfish not finding a word to say mr stick squealed like a rat caught in a corner were copped its a trap thats it were copped edgar began to cry sobbing like a fouryearold the other children felt disgusted with him the sticks suddenly caught sight of all the children when julian switched on his torch snakes alive theres all the childrenand theres jenny armstrong too said mr stick in a tone of the greatest amazement whats all this whats happening who shut up edgar well tell you the answers when we get to the policestation said the big policeman now are you coming quietly the sticks went quietly edgar sobbing away to himself he imagined his mother and father in prison and he himself sent to a hard and difficult school not allowed to see his mother for years not that that would matter for the sticks both mother and father were no good to edgar and had taught him nothing but bad things there might be a chance for the wretched boy if he were kept away from them and set a good example instead of a bad one we shant be coming back with you said julian politely to the policeman were staying here the night you could go back in the sticks boat they know the way all right take their dog with you there he isstinker we call him then he added i guess your colleagues could follow in the police boat the sticks boat was found and the policeman the two grownup sticks and edgar got in stinker jumped in too glad to get away from the glare of timothys green eyes julian pushed the boat out goodbye he called and the other children waved goodbye too goodbye mr stick dont go kidnapping any more children goodbye mrs stick look after edgar better in case he gets kidnapped again goodbye spottyface try and be a better boy goodbye stinker do get a bath as soon as possible goodbye the policemen grinned and waved the sticks said not a word nor did they wave they sat sullen and angry trying to work out in their minds what had happened to make things end up like this the boats rounded a high rock and were soon out of sight hurrah said dick theyve gonegone for ever weve got our island to ourselves at last come on jenny well show you all over it what a lovely time were going to have they raced away happy and carefree five children and a dog alone on an island they loved and we will leave them there to enjoy their weeks happiness they really do deserve it
