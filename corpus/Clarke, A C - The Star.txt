 it is three thousand lightyears to the vatican once i be lieved that space could have no power over faith just as i believed that the heavens declared the glory of gods handiwork now i have seen that handiwork and my faith is sorely troubled i stare at the crucifix that hangs on the cabin wall above the mark vi computer and for the first time in my life i wonder if it is no more than an empty symbol i have told no one yet but the truth cannot be con cealed the data are there for anyone to read recorded on the countless miles of magnetic tape and the thousands of photographs we are carrying back to earth other scientists can interpret them as easily as i canmore easily in all probability i am not one who would condone that tamper ing with the truth which often gave my order a bad name in the olden days the crew is already sufficiently depressed i wonder how they will take this ultimate irony few of them have any religious faith yet they will not relish using this final weapon in their campaign against methat private good natured but fundamentally serious war which lasted all the way from earth it amused them to have a jesuit as chief astrophysicist dr chandler for instance could never get over it sometimes he would meet me on the observation deck where the lights are always low so that the stars shine with undiminished glory he would come up to me in the gloom and stand staring out of the great oval port while the heavens crawled slowly round us as the ship turned end over end with the residual spin we had never bothered to correct well father he would say at last it goes on forever and forever and perhaps something made it but how you can believe that something has a special interest in us and our miserable little worldthat just beats me then the argument would start while the stars and nebulae would swing around us in silent endless arcs beyond the flawlessly clear plastic of the observation port it was i think the apparent incongruity of my position which yes amused the crew in vain i would point to my three papers in the astrophysical journal my five in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society i would remind them that our order has long been famous for its scientific works we may be few now but ever since the eighteenth century we have made contributions to as tronomy and geophysics out of all proportion to our num bers will my report on the phoenix nebula end our thousand years of history it will end i fear much more than that i do not know who gave the nebula its name which seems to me a very bad one if it contains a prophecy it is one which cannot be verified for several thousand mil lion years even the word nebula is misleading this is a far smaller object than those stupendous clouds of mist the stuff of unborn starswhich are scattered throughout the length of the milky way on the cosmic scale indeed the phoenix nebula is a tiny thinga tenuous shell of gas surrounding a single star or what is left of a star the rubens engraving of loyola seems to mock me as it hangs there above the spectrophotometer tracings what would you father have made of this knowledge that has come into my keeping so far from the little world that was all the universe you knew would your faith have risen to the challenge as mine has failed to do you gaze into the distance father but i have traveled a distance beyond any that you could have imagined when you founded our order a thousand years ago no other sur vey ship has been so far from earth we are at the very frontiers of the explored universe we set out to reach the phoenix nebula we succeeded and we are homeward bound with our burden of knowledge i wish i could lift that burden from my shoulders but i call to you in vain across the centuries and the lightyears that lie between us on the book you are holding the words are plain to read ad maiorem dei gloriam the message runs but it is a message i can no longer believe would you still believe it if you could see what we have found we knew of course what the phoenix nebula was every year in our galaxy alone more than a hundred stars explode blazing for a few hours or days with thousands of times their normal brilliance before they sink back into death and obscurity such are the ordinary novaethe com monplace disasters of the universe i have rocorded the spectrograms and light curves of dozens since i started working at the lunar observatory but three or four times in every thousand years occurs something beside which even a nova pales into total insig nificance when a star becomes a supernova it may for a little while outshine all the massed suns of the galaxy the chinese astronomers watched this happen in ad not knowing what it was they saw five centuries later in a super nova blazed in cassiopeia so brilliantly that it was visible in the daylight sky there have been three more in the thousand years that have passed since then our mission was to visit the remnants of such a catas trophe to reconstruct the events that led up to it and if possible to learn its cause we came slowly in through the concentric shells of gas that had been blasted out six thou sand years before yet were expanding still they were im mensely hot radiating still with a fierce violet light but far too tenuous to do us any damage when the star had exploded its outer layers had been driven upward with such speed that they had escaped completely from its gravitational field now they formed a hollow shell large enough to engulf a thousand solar systems and at its center burned the tiny fantastic object which the star had now becomea white dwarf smaller than the earth yet weigh ing a million times as much the glowing gas shells were all around us banishing the normal night of interstellar space we were flying into the center of a cosmic bomb that had detonated millennia ago and whose incandescent fragments were still hurtling apart the immense scale of the explosion and the fact that the debris already covered a volume of space many billions of miles across robbed the scene of any visible movement it would take decades before the unaided eye could detect any motion in these tortured wisps and eddies of gas yet the sense of turbulent expansion was overwhelming we had checked our primary drive hours before and were drifting slowly toward the fierce little star ahead once it had been a sun like our own but it had squandered in a few hours the energy that should have kept it shining for a million years now it was a shrunken miser hoarding its resources as if trying to make amends for its prodigal youth no one seriously expected to find planets if there had been any before the explosion they would have been boiled into puffs of vapor and their substance lost in the greater wreckage of the star itself but we made the automatic search as always when approaching an unknown sun and presently we found a single small world circling the star at an immense distance it must have been the pluto of this vanished solar system orbiting on the frontiers of the night too far from the central sun ever to have known life its remoteness had saved it from the fate of all its lost com panions the passing fires had seared its rocks and burned away the mantle of frozen gas that must have covered it in the days before the disaster we landed and we found the vault its builders had made sure that we should the mono lithic marker that stood above the entrance was now a fused stump but even the first longrange photographs told us that here was the work of intelligence a little later we detected the continentwide pattern of radioactivity that had been buried in the rock even if the pylon above the vault had been destroyed this would have remained an immovable and all but eternal beacon calling to the stars our ship fell toward this gigantic bullseye like an arrow into its target the pylon must have been a mile high when it was built but now it looked like a candle that had melted down into a puddle of wax it took us a week to drill through the fused rock since we did not have the proper tools for a task like this we were astronomers not archaeologists but we could improvise our original program was forgotten this lonely monument reared at such labor at the greatest possible distance from the doomed sun could have only one meaning a civilization which knew it was about to die had made its last bid for immortality it will take us generations to examine all the treasures that were placed in the vault they had plenty of time to prepare for their sun must have given its first warnings many years before the final detonation everything that they wished to preserve all the fruits of their genius they brought here to this distant world in the days before the end hoping that some other race would snd them and that they would not be utterly forgotten if only they had a little more time they could travel freely enough between the planets of their own sun but they had not yet learned to cross the interstellar gulfs and the nearest solar system was a hundred lightyears away even if they had not been so disturbingly human as their sculpture shows we could not have helped admiring them and grieving for their fate they left thousands of visual records and the machines for projecting them together with elaborate pictorial instructions from which it will not be difficult to learn their written language we have exam ined many of these records and brought to life for the first time in six thousand years the warmth and beauty of a civil ization which in many ways must have been superior to our own perhaps they only showed us the best and one can hardly blame them but their worlds were very lovely and their cities were built with a grace that matches anything of ours we have watched them at work and play and lis tened to their musical speech sounding across the centuries one scene is still before my eyesa group of children on a beach of strange blue sand playing in the waves as chil dren play on earth and sinking into the sea still warm and friendly and life giving is the sun that will soon turn traitor and obliterate all this innocent happiness perhaps if we had not been so far from home and so vul nerable to loneliness we should not have been so deeply moved many of us had seen the ruins of ancient civiliza tions on other worlds but they had never affected us so profoundly this tragedy was unique it was one thing for a race to fail and die as nations and cultures have done on earth but to be destroyed so completely in the full flower of its achievement leaving no survivorshow could that be rec onciled with the mercy of god my colleagues have asked me that and i have given what answers i can perhaps you could have done better father loyola but i have found nothing in the exercitia spmtua lia that helps me here they were not an evil people i do not know what gods they worshiped if indeed they wor shiped any but i have looked back at them across the cen turies and have watched while the loveliness they used their last strength to preserve was brought forth again into the light of their shrunken sun i know the answers that my colleagues will give when they get back to earth they will say that the universe has no purpose and no plan that since a hundred suns explode every year in our galaxy at this very moment some race is dying in the depths of space whether that race has done good or evil during its lifetime will make no difference in the end there is no divine justice for there is no god yet of course what we have seen proves nothing of the sort anyone who argues thus is being swayed by emo tion not logic god has no need to justify his actions to man he who built the universe can destroy it when he chooses it is arroganceit is perilously near blasphemy for us to say what he may or may not do this i could have accepted hard though it is to look upon whole worlds and peoples thrown into the furnace but there comes a point when even the deepest faith must fal ter and now as i look at my calculations i know i have reached that point at last we could not tell before we reached the nebula how long ago the explosion took place now from the astronom ical evidence and the record in the rocks of that one sur viving planet i have been able to date it very exactly i know in what year the light of this colossal conflagration reached earth i know how brilliantly the supernova whose corpse now dwindles behind our speeding ship once shone in terrestrial skies i know how it must have blazed low in the east before sunrise like a beacon in that oriental dawn there can be no reasonable doubt the ancient mystery is solved at last yet god there were so many stars you could have used what was the need to give these people to the fire that the symbol of their passing might shine above bethlehem
