carolina moon nora roberts tory to me fair friend you never can be for as you were when first your eye i eyed such seems your beauty still вђ william shakespeare she woke in the body of a dead friend she was eight tall for her age fragile of bone delicate of feature her hair was the color of corn silk and slid prettily down her narrow back her mother loved to brush it every night one hundred strokes with the softbristled silverbacked brush that sat on the graceful cherrywood vanity the childs body remembered this felt this each long sustained beat with the brush and how it made her imagine herself a cat being petted how the light slanted over the pin boxes and the bottles of crystal and cobalt and struck the silver back of the brush as it flashed over her hair she remembered the scent of the room smelled it even now gardenia always gardenia for mama and in the mirror by lamplight she could see the pale oval of her face so young so pretty with those thoughtful blue eyes and smooth skin so alive her name was hope the windows and french doors were closed because it was high summer heat pressed its damp fingers against the glass but inside the house the air was cool and her cotton nightgown stayed so crisp it crackled when she moved it was the heat she wanted and the adventure but she kept those thoughts inside as she kissed mama good night a dainty peck against a perfumed cheek mama had the hall runners taken up and rolled into the attic every june now the loblolly pine floors with their coating of paste wax felt slick and smooth under the young girls bare feet as she wandered out down the hall with its panels of bald cypress and paintings in thick frames of dull gold up the sharp winding curves of the stairs to her fathers study there her fathers scent smoke leather old spice and bourbon she loved this room with its rounded walls and big heavy chairs with leather the color of the port her papa sometimes drank after supper here the circling shelves were jammed full with books and treasures she loved the man who sat behind the enormous desk with his cigar and his shot glass and his ledgers the love was an ache of the heart in the woman inside the child a shaft of longing and of envy for that uncomplicated and complete love his voice boomed his arms were strong and his stomach soft as he enveloped her in a hug that was so different from the gentle and restrained goodnight kiss from mama thereвђs my princess going off to the kingdom of dreams what will i dream about papa knights and white chargers and adventures over the sea she giggled but rested her head on his shoulder a bit longer than usual humming a little in her throat like a purring kitten did she know somehow did she know she would never sit safe on his lap again back down the stairs past cades room not his bedtime not yet because he was four years older and a boy and could stay up late on summer nights watching tv or reading books as long as he was up and ready for his chores in the morning one day cade would be the master of beaux reves and sit at the big desk in the tower study with the ledgers he would do the hiring and firing and oversee the planting and the harvest and smoke cigars at meetings and complain about the government and the price of cotton because he was the son that was fine with hope she didnt want to have to sit at a desk and add up figures she stopped in front of her sisters door hesitated it wasnt fine with faith nothing ever seemed to be all right with faith lilah the housekeeper said miss faith would argue with god almighty just to irritate him hope supposed that was true and even though faith was her twin she didnt understand what made her sister so prickly all the time just tonight shed been sent straight to her room for sassing now the door was shut tight and there was no light under it hope imagined faith was staring up at the ceiling with that sulky look on her face and her fists clenched tight as if she waited to box with the shadows hope touched the doorknob most times she could coax faith out of those black moods she could huddle in bed with her in the dark and make up stories until faith laughed and the spit in her eyes dried up again but tonight was for other things tonight was for adventures it was all planned but hope didnt let the excitement come until she was in her own room with the door shut she left the light off moving quietly in the dark that was silvered by moonlight she changed her cotton gown for shorts and a tshirt her heart drummed pleasantly in her chest as she arranged the pillows on the bed in a shape that to her naive and childish eyes resembled a sleeping form from under the bed she took her adventure kit the old dometopped lunch box held a bottle of cocacola gone warm a bag of cookies sneaked carefully from the kitchen jar a small rusted penknife matches a compass a water pistolвђfully loadedвђand a red plastic flashlight for a moment she sat on the floor she could smell her crayons and the talc that clung to her own skin from after her bath she could hear just barely hear the music drifting out from her mothers sitting room when she slid her window open quietly took out the screen she was smiling young agile and bright with anticipation she swung her leg over the sill found a toehold in the trellis mad with vining wisteria the air was like syrup and the hot sweet flavor of it filled her lungs as she climbed down a splinter stabbed into her finger causing her to hiss in a breath but she kept moving keeping her eyes on the lighted windows of the first floor she was a shadow she thought and no one would see her she was hope lavelle girl spy and had a meeting with her contact and partner at precisely ten thirtyfive she had to stifle a giggle and was breathless from the laughter that wanted to bubble out as she hit the ground to add to her own excitement she darted and dashed behind the thick trunks of the grand old trees that shaded the house then peeked around them toward the faint blue light that pulsed against the window in the room where her brother watched tv up to the clearer yellow glow where each of her parents spent their evening discovery now would mean disaster for the mission she thought crouching as she raced through the gardens and the sweet scent of roses and nightblooming jasmine she must avoid capture at all costs as the fate of the world rested on her shoulders and those of her stalwart partner the woman inside the child screamed out go back oh please go back but the child didnt hear she wheeled her pink bike out from behind the camellias where shed stashed it that afternoon snuggled her kit into the white basket then pushed it over the cushion of grass alongside the long gravel drive until the house and the lights were dim with distance when she rode she rode like the wind imagining the pretty little bike was a soupedup motorcycle complete with nerve gas dispenser and oil slick shooter the white plastic streamers danced from the ends of the handlebars and slapped each other gaily she flew through the thick air and the chorus of peepers and cicadas became the panther roar of her speeding machine at the fork in the road she bore left then jumped nimbly off her bike to wheel it off the road down into the narrow gully where it would be hidden by brush though the moon was bright enough she took the flashlight out of her kit the smiling princess leia on her watch told her she was fifteen minutes early without fear without thought she turned onto the narrow path into the marsh into the end of summer of childhood of life there the world was alive with sound water and insects and small night creatures the light came in thinning ribbons through the canopy of tupelo and cypress with its dripping moss here magnolia blossoms grew fat with a perfume high and sweet the way to the clearing was second nature to her this meeting place this secret place was well tended guarded and loved as the first to arrive she took old twigs and stubby branches from the stockpile of wood and set to making a fire the smoke discouraged mosquitoes but she scratched idly at bites already dotting her legs and arms she settled down to wait with a cookie and her coke as time passed her eyes drooped and the music of the marsh lulled her the fire ate through the thin scraps of wood then settled down to a simmer drifting she rested her cheek on her updrawn knees at first the rustling was just part of her dream of dodging down twisting paris streets to evade the wicked russian spy but the snap of a twig underfoot had her head jerking up and the sleep clearing from her eyes the wide grin came first but she quickly shifted into the stern professional expression of a top secret agent password there was silence in the marsh but for the monotonous buzz of insects and the faint crackle of a fire dying she scrambled to her feet the flashlight cocked in her hand like a gun password she called again and aimed the short beam of light but now the rustle came from behind her so she whirled heart leaping beam dancing in nervous jerks fear something so rarely tasted in eight short years slicked hot and burning in her throat come on cut it out youвђre not scaring me a sound from the left deliberate taunting as the next snake of fear curled in her gut she took a step in retreat and heard the laughter soft panting close running now running through thick shadows and jumping light terror so sharp in the throat that it slices screams before they can escape footsteps pounding behind her fast too fast and too close something hits her from behind bright pain in her back that vibrates down to the soles of her feet the jolt of bone and breath as she falls hard to the ground air rushes out of her lungs in a sob as the weight of him pins her down she smells sweat and whiskey she screams now one long cry of desperation and calls out for her friend tory tory help me and the woman trapped inside the dead child weeps when tory came back to herself she was lying on the flagstones of her patio wearing only a nightshirt already soaked through from the thin spring rain her face was wet and she tasted the salt of her own tears screams echoed in her head but she didnt know if they were her own or those of the child she couldnt forget shivering she rolled onto her back so the rain could cool her cheeks and wash the tears away the episodesвђspells her mother always called themвђoften left her weak and queasy there had been a time shed been able to fight them off before they swamped her it had either been that or the shocking sting of her fathers belt iвђll whip the devil out of you girl to hannibal bodeen the devil was everywhere in every fear and temptation lurked the hand of satan and hed done his best to drive that wickedness out of his only child at the moment with the sickness circling in her belly tory wished hed managed it it amazed her that for a space of years shed actually embraced what was in her had explored it used it even celebrated it a legacy her grandmother had told her the sight the shining a gift of the blood through the blood but there was hope more and more there was hope and those flashes of her childhood friends memories hurt her heart and frightened her nothing shed experienced either blocking or embracing this gift had taken her like this taken her away taken her over it made her helpless when shed promised herself she would never be helpless again yet here she was sprawled on her own patio in the rain without any memory of how she got outside shed been in the kitchen brewing tea standing at the counter the lights and the music on reading a letter from her grandmother that was the trigger tory realized as she slowly got to her feet her grandmother was her link to her childhood to hope into hope she thought as she closed the patio door into the pain and fear and horror of that terrible night and still she didnt know the who or the why still shivering tory went into the bath stripped and turning the shower hot stepped under the spray i cant help you she murmured closing her eyes i couldnt help you then i cant help you now her best friend her sister of the heart had died that night in the swamp while shed been locked in her room sobbing over the latest beating and she had known she had seen she had been helpless guilt as fresh as it had been eighteen years before swarmed through her i cant help you she said again but im coming back we were eight years old that summer that longago summer when it seemed those thick hot days would last forever it was a summer of innocence and foolishness and friendship the kind that combines to form a pretty glass globe around your world one night changed all of that nothings been the same for me since how could it be most of my life ive avoided speaking of it that didnвђt stop the memories or the images but for a time i tried to bury it as hope was buried to face it now to record this out loud if only for myself is a relief like pulling a splinter out of the heart the ache will linger awhile she was my best friend our bond had the deep and immediate intensity only children are capable of forging i suppose we were an odd pair bright and privileged hope lavelle and dark shy tory bodeen my daddy leased a small patch of land a little corner of the grand plantation hers owned sometimes when her mama gave a big society dinner or one of her lavish parties mine would help out with the cleaning and serving but those gaps of social standing and class never touched the friendship indeed they never occurred to us she lived in a grand house one her reputedly eccentric ancestor had built to resemble a castle rather than the georgian style so popular during its era it was stone with towers and turrets and what you would call battlements i suppose but there was nothing of the princess about hope she lived for adventures and when i was with her so did i with her i escaped from the miseries and turmoils of my own house my own life and became her partner we were spies detectives knights on quests pirates or space marauders we were brave and true bold and daring in the spring before that summer we used her pocketknife to cut a narrow slice in our wrists solemnly we mixed our blood we were lucky i suppose we didnt end up with lockjaw instead we became blood sisters she had a sister a twin but faith rarely joined in our games they were too silly for her or too rough too dirty they were always too something for faith we didnt miss her temper or complaints that summer hope and i were the twins if someone had asked me if i loved her i would have been embarrassed i wouldnt have understood but every day since that terrible time that august i have missed her as i have missed that part of me that died with her we were to meet at the swamp in our secret place i dont suppose it was really much of a secret but it was ours we often played there in that damp green air having our adventures among the birdsong and moss and wild azalea it was against the rules to go in after sunset but at eight rules are an exciting thing to break i was to bring marshmallows and lemonade part of that was pride my parents were poor and i was poorer but i needed to contribute and had counted out the money from the mason jar i hid under my bed i had two dollars and eightysix cents on that august nightвђafter having bought the supplies at hansonsвђthe sum account of my financial worth rested in a glass canning jar and consisted of pennies and nickels and some hardwon quarters we had chicken and rice for supper the house was so hot even with the fans going on high that eating was a chore but if there was a grain of rice on your plate daddy expected you to eat it and be grateful before supper there was grace depending on daddys mood it would last anywhere from five minutes to twenty while the food sat going cold and your belly grumbled and the sweat ran down your back in nasty rivers my grandma used to say that when hannibal bodeen found god even god tried to find another place to hide he was a big man my father and grew thick in the chest and arms ive heard that he was once considered handsome years carve a man in different ways and my fathers years had carved him bitter bitter and stern with a meanness under it all he wore his dark hair slicked back and his face seemed to rise out of that dome like sharpedged rocks out of a mountain rocks that would flay the skin off your bones at one careless misstep his eyes were dark too a burning kind of dark i recognize now in the eyes of some television preachers and street people my mother feared him i try to forgive her for that for fearing him so much she never came to my side when he used his belt to whip his vengeful god into me that night i was quiet at supper chances were hed take no notice of me if i was quiet and cleaned my plate inside me the anticipation of the night was like a living thing jittery and joyful i kept my eyes down trying to pace my eating so he wouldnt accuse me of dawdling over the food or of bolting it it was always a fine line to balance with daddy i remember the sound of the fans whirling and of forks scraping against plates i remember the silence the silence of souls hiding in fear that lived in my fathers house when my mother offered him more chicken he thanked her politely and took a second helping the room seemed to breathe easier it was a good sign my mother encouraged by this made some mention of the tomatoes and corn coming in fine and how shed be canning for the next weeks theyd be canning over at beaux reves too and did he think it was a good idea for her to help out there as shed been asked she didnt mention the wage shed earn even when daddys mood was mild you were wise not to bring up the coin that the lovelies would dole out for a service he was the breadwinner in his house and we were not permitted to forget this allimportant point the room held its breath again there were times just the mention of the lovelies put the thunder in daddys dark eyes but that night he allowed as that would be a sensible thing as long as she didnt neglect any of her chores under the roof he was putting over her head this relatively pleasant response made her smile i remember how her face softened up and how it made her almost pretty again now and again if i think very hard i can remember mama being pretty han she called him when she was smiling tory and ill keep things going around here dont you worry ill go on over and talk to miss lilah tomorrow and see about getting it all done with the berries coming in ill be making jelly too i know ive got some paraffin around here but i cant think where its got to and that just that casual remark about jelly and wax and ness changed everything i suppose my mind had drifted off during their conversation that i was thinking of the adventure to come i spoke without thought without knowledge of the consequences so i said the words that damned me the box of paraffins in the top shelf of the cabinet over the stove up there behind the molasses and the cornstarch i simply said what i saw in my head the square box of block wax behind the dark bottle of blackstrap and reached for my cold sweet tea to wash down the starchy grains of rice before i took the first sip i heard the silence come back the mute wave that swamped even the monotonous hum of fans my heart started to pound inside that vacuum one hard hammer strike after the next with a ringing that was only inside my own head and was the sudden and vicious pulse of blood the pulse of fear he spoke softly then as he did always did just before the rage how do you know where the wax is victoria how do you know its up there where you cant see it where you cant reach it i lied it was foolish because i was already doomed but the lie tumbled out a desperate defense i told him i guess i saw mama put it there i just remember seeing her put it there is he tore that lie to shreds he had a way of seeing through lies and ripping them to uneven pieces and sticky parts when did i see that why didnt i do better in school if my memory was so keen i could remember where the paraffin was a year after the last canning season and how was it i knew it was behind the molasses and cornstarch and not in front of them or beside them oh he was a clever man my father and never missed the smallest of details mama said nothing while he spoke in that soft voice punching the words at me like fists wrapped in silk she folded her hands and her hands shook did she tremble for me i suppose i like to think so but she said nothing as his voice grew louder nothing as he shoved back from the table nothing as the glass slipped from my hand and crashed to the floor a shard of it nicked my ankle and through the rising terror i felt that little pain he checked first of course he would tell himself that was the fair thing the right thing to do when he opened the cabinet pushed aside the bottles slowly took that square blue box of canning wax out from behind the dark molasses cried i still had tears in me then i still had hope even as he yanked me to my feet i had the hope that the punishment would only be prayers hours of prayer until my knees went numb sometimes at least sometimes that summer that was enough for him hadnt he warned me not to let the devil in but still i brought wickedness into his house shamed him before god i said i was sorry that i didnt mean to please daddy please i wont do it again ill be good i begged him he shouted scripture and with his big hard hands dragged me toward my room but still i begged him it was the last time i did so there was no fighting back it was worse if you fought him the fourth commandment was a sacred thing and you would honor your father in his house even when he beat you bloody his face was deep red with his righteousness big and blinding as the sun he only slapped me once that was all it took to stop my pleading and my excuses and to kill my hope i lay across the bed on my stomach passive now as any sacrificial lamb the sound his belt made when he slid it out of the loops on his work pants was a snake hissing then a crack sharp slick as he snapped it he always snapped it three times a holy trinity of cruelty the first whip is always the worst no matter how many times theres been a first the shock and pain is stunning and rips a from your belly your body jerks in protest no in disbelief then the second slap bites into you and the third soon your cries are more animal than human your humanity has been compromised buried under an avalanche of pain and humiliation he would preach as he beat me and his voice would become a great roar and under that roar was a hideous excitement a vile sort of pleasure i didnt understand and recognize no child should know that slippery undercoating and from that for a time i was spared the first time he beat me i was five my mother tried to stop him and he blackened her eye for it she never tried again i dont know what she did that night while he whaled away beating at the devil that gave me visions i couldnt see not with eyes nor with mind anything but a bloodred haze the haze was hate but i didnt recognize that either he left me weeping and locked the door from the outside after a while the pain sent me to sleep when i awoke it was dark and it seemed a fire burned in me i cant say the pain was unbearable because you bear it what choice is there i prayed too prayed that whatever was inside of me had finally been driven out i didnt want to be wicked yet even as i prayed the pressure built in my belly and the tingling came like sharp little fingers dancing over the back of my neck it was the first time it came into me this way and i thought i was sick feverish then i saw hope as vividly as if i were sitting beside her in our clearing in the swamp i smelled the night the water heard the whine of mosquitoes the buzz of insects and like hope i heard the rustling in the brush like hope i felt the fear fresh hot gushes of it when she ran i ran my breath sobbing out so that my chest hurt from it i saw her fall under the weight of whatever leaped out at her a shadow a shape i couldnt see clearly though i could see her she called for me screamed for me then i saw nothing but black when i woke the sun was up and i was on the floor and hope was gone shed chosen to lose herself in charleston and for nearly four years had managed it the city had been like a lovely and generous woman to her more than willing to press her against its soft bosom and soothe the nerves that had shattered on the unforgiving streets of new york city in charleston the voices were slower and in their warm fluid stream she could blend she could hide as shed once believed she could hide in the thick rushing crowds of the north money wasnt a problem she knew how to live frugally and was willing to work she guarded her savings like a hawk and when that nest egg began to grow allowed herself to dream of owning her own business working for herself and living the quiet and settled life that always eluded her she kept to herself real friendships meant real connections she hadnt been willing or strong enough to open herself to that again people asked questions they wanted to know things about you or pretended they did tory had no answers to give and nothing to tell she found the little houseвђold rundown perfectвђand had bargained fiercely to buy it people often underestimated victoria bodeen they saw a young woman small and slight of build they saw the soft skin and delicate features a serious mouth and clear gray eyes they often mistook for guileless a small nose just a little crooked added a touch of sweetness to a face framed by quiet brown hair they saw fragility heard it in the gentle southern flow of her voice and never saw the steel inside steel forged by countless strikes with a sam browne belt what she wanted she worked for fought for with all the focus and determination of a frontline soldier taking a beach shed wanted the old house with its overgrown yard and peeling paint and shed wheeled and dealed badgered and pushed until it was hers apartments brought back memories of new york and the disaster that had ended her life there there would be no more apartments for tory shed nurtured that investment as well using her own time and labor and skill to rehabilitate the house one room at a time it had taken her three full years and now the sale of it added to her savings was going to make her dream come true all she had to do was go back to progress at her kitchen table tory read over the rental agreement for the storefront on market street a third time she wondered if mr harlowe at the realtors office remembered her shed been barely ten when theyd moved away from progress to raleigh so her parents could find steady work better work her father had claimed than scratching out a living on a playedout plot of land leased from the almighty lavelles of course theyd been just as poor in raleigh as theyd been in progress theyd just been more crowded didnt matter tory reminded herself she wasnt going back poor she wasnt the scared and skinny girl shed been but a businesswoman starting a new enterprise in her hometown then why her therapist would ask are your hands trembling anticipation tory decided excitement and nerves all right there were nerves nerves were human she was entitled to them she was normal she was whatever she wanted to be damn it teeth gritted she snatched up the pen and signed the agreement it was only for a year one year if it didnt work out she could move on shed moved on before it seemed she was always moving on but before she moved on this time there was a great deal to be done the lease agreement was only one thin layer of a mountain of paperwork mostвђthe licenses and permits for the shop she intended to openвђwere signed and sealed she considered the state of south carolina little better than a mugger but shed paid the fees next up was the settlement on the house and dealing with the lawyers who shed decided gave muggers a bad name but by end of day shed have the check in her hand and be on her way the packing was nearly finished not that much to it she thought now as shed sold nearly everything shed acquired since her move to charleston traveling light simplified things and shed learned early never never to become attached to anything that could be taken from her rising she washed out her cup dried it then wrapped it in newspaper to store in the small box of kitchen utensils she thought most practical to take with her from the window over the sink she looked out at her tiny backyard the little patio was scrubbed and swept she would leave the clay pots of verbena and white petunias for the new owners she hoped they would tend the garden but if they plowed it under well it was theirs to do as they liked shed left her mark here they might paint and paper carpet and tile but what she had done would have come first it would always be under the rest you couldnt erase the past or kill it or wish it out of existence nor could you will away the present or change what was coming we were all trapped in that cycle of time just circling around the core of yesterdays sometimes those yesterdays were strong enough willful enough to suck you back no matter how hard you struggled and how much more depressing could she be tory thought with a sigh she sealed the box hefted it to take out to her car and walked out of the kitchen without looking back three hours later the check from the sale of her house was deposited she shook hands with the new owners listened politely to their giddy enthusiasm over buying their first home and eased her way outside the house and the people who would now live in it were no longer part of her world tory hold on a minute tory turned one hand on the car door and her mind already on the road but she waited until her lawyer crossed the bank parking lot meandered was more the word tory corrected abigail lawrence didnt hurry anything especially herself which probably explained why she always looked as though shed just stepped graciously from the pages of vogue for todays settlement shed chosen a pale blue suit pearls that had likely been handed down from her greatgrandmother and thinly spiked heels that made torys toes cramp just looking at them whew abigail waved a hand in front of her face as if shed just run two miles rather than strolled ten yards all this heat and its barely april she glanced past tory to the station wagon scanned the boxes so thats it seems to be thank you abigail for handling everything you handled most of it dont know when ive had a client who understood what i was talking about half the time much less one who could give me lessons she took a peek into the back of the station wagon vaguely surprised that one womans life took up so little room i didnt think you were serious about heading straight out this afternoon i shouldвђve known she shifted her gaze back to torys face youre a serious woman victoria no reason to stay abigail opened her mouth then shook her head i was going to say i envy you packing it up taking what fits in the back of your car and going off to a new place a new life a new start but the fact is i dont not one little bit god almighty the energy it takes and the guts then again youre young enough to have plenty of both maybe a new start but its back to my beginnings i still have family in progress such as it is you ask me it takes more guts to go back to the beginning than just about anyplace else i hope youre happy tory ill be fineвђќ fines one thing to torys surprise abigail took her hand then leaned over and brushed her cheek in a light kiss happys another be happy i intend to tory drew back there was something in the handtohand connection something in the concern in abigails eyes you knew tory murmured of course i did abigail gave torys fingers a light squeeze before releasing them news from new york winds its way down here and some of us even pay attention to it now and again you changed your hair your name but i recognized you im good with faces why didnt you say anything ask me you hired me to see to your business not to pry into it the way i figured it is if youd wanted people to know you were the victoria mooney who made news out of new york city a few years back youd have said so thank you for that the formality and the caution had abigail grinning for heavens sake honey do you think im going to ask you if my sons ever going to get married or where the hell i lost my mamas diamond engagement ring all im saying is i know youve been through some rough times and i hope you find better now if you have any problems up there in progress you just give a holler simple kindness never failed to fluster her tory fumbled with the door handle thank you really id better get started i have several stops to make but she held out her hand once more i appreciate everything drive safe tory slid inside hesitated then opened the window as she started the engine in the middle file cabinet drawer of your home office between the ds and es whats that your mothers ring its a little too big for you and it slipped off fell in the files you should have it sized tory reversed quickly swung the car around while abigail blinked after her she headed west out of charleston then dipped south to begin her planned circle of the state before landing in progress the list of artists and craftsmen she intended to visit was neatly typed and in her new briefcase directions for each were included and it meant taking a number of back roads timeconsuming but necessary shed already made arrangements with several southern artists to display and sell their work in the shop she would open on market street but she needed more starting small didnt mean not starting well startup costs buying stock finding an acceptable place to live were going to take nearly every penny shed saved she intended to make it worthwhile and she intended to make more in a week if everything went as planned she would begin setting up shop by the end of may she would open the doors then they would see as for the rest she would deal with what came when it came when the time was right she would drive down the long shady lane to beaux reves and face the lavelles she would face hope at the end of a week tory was exhausted several hundred dollars poorer thanks to a cracked radiator and ready to call an end to her travels the replacement radiator meant she had to postpone her arrival in florence until the following morning and make do for a night with the dubious comfort of a motel off route outside of chester the room stank of stale smoke and its amenities included a sliver of soap and pay movies designed to stimulate the sexual appetites of the rentbythehour clientele that kept the establishment out of bankruptcy there were stains on the carpet the origin of which she decided it best not to contemplate shed paid cash for one night because she didnt like the idea of handing over her credit card to a slyeyed clerk who smelled like the gin he cleverly disguised in a coffee mug the room was as unappealing as the idea of climbing back behind the wheel for another hour but it was there tory carried the single flimsy chair to the door and hooked its spindly top under the knob she decided it was every bit as securityproof as the thin and rusted chain still using both gave her the illusion of safety it was a mistake she knew to allow herself to become so fatigued resistance went down but everything had conspired against her the potter shed seen in greenville had been temperamental and difficult to pin down if he hadnt also been brilliant tory would have walked out of his studio after twenty minutes instead of spending two hours praising placating and persuading the car had taken another four hours between getting towed negotiating for a reconditioned radiator at the junkyard browbeating the mechanic to do the repair on the spot add to that she admitted it was her own stupidity that had landed her in the by the way inn if shed simply booked a room back in greenville or stopped at one of the perfectly respectable motor lodges on the interstate she wouldnt be stumbling with exhaustion around a smelly room only one night she reminded herself as she eyed the dingy green cover on the bed for pocket change it offered the questionable delights of magic fingers she decided to pass just a few hours sleep then shed be on her way to florence where her grandmother would have the guest roomвђclean sheets a hot bathвђready she just had to get through the night without even taking off her shoes she lay down on the spread and closed her eyes bodies in motion slicked with sweat baby yeah baby give it to me harder a woman weeping pain rolling through her hot as lava oh god god what am i going to do where can i go any place but back please donвђt let him find me scattered thoughts and fumbling hands all panicked excitement and raging guilt what if i get pregnant my mother will kill me is it going to hurt does he really love me images thoughts voices washed over her in waves of shapes and sounds leave me alone she demanded just leave me alone with her eyes still shut tory imagined a wall thick and high and white she built it brick by brick until it stood between her and all the memories left hanging in the room like smoke behind the wall was all cool clear blue water to float in to sink in and finally to sleep in and high above that pale blue pool the sun was white and warm she could hear birdsong and the lap of water as she trailed her hands through it her body was weightless here her mind quiet at the edges of the pool she could see the grand live oaks and their lacing of moss and a willow bowing like a courtier to dip its fronds in the glassy surface smiling to herself she closed her eyes and drifted the sound of laughter was high and bright a girls careless joy lazily tory opened her eyes there by the willow hope stood waving hey tory hey i was looking for you joy struck a bright arrow turning in the water tory waved back come on in the waters great we get caught skinnydipping weвђre both going to get it but giggling hope shucked off her shoes her shorts then her shirt i thought you went away dont be dopey where would i go ive been looking a long time slowly hope eased into the water willow slim and marble white her hair spread out to float on the surface gold against blue forever and ever the water darkened began to stir the graceful fronds of the willow snapped up like whips and the water was cold suddenly so cold tory began to shiver storms coming up wed better go in its over my head i canвђt reach the bottom you have to help me as the water churned hope flailed out her thin young arms beating spewing up curtains of water that had gone the murky brown of a marsh tory struck out strong strokes frantic speed but every arm span took her farther away from where the young girl struggled the water burned her lungs dragged at her feet she felt herself going under felt herself drowning with hopes voice inside her head you have to come you have to hurry she awoke in the dark her mouth full of the taste of the swamp without the heart or energy to build her wall again tory rolled out of bed in the bathroom she splashed rusty water on her face then raised it dripping to the mirror eyes shadowed and still glazed from the dream stared back at her too late to turn back she thought it always was she grabbed her purse and the unused travel kit shed brought in with her the dark was soothing now and the candy bar and soft drink shed bought from the rumbling vending machine outside her room kept her system wired she turned on the radio to distract her mind she wanted to think of nothing but the road when she hit the heart of the state the sun was up and the traffic thick she stopped to refuel the gasguzzling station wagon before heading east when she passed the exit that led to where her parents had once again relocated her stomach clenched and stayed tight for another thirty miles she thought of her grandmother of the stock loaded in the back of the car or being shipped to progress she thought of her budget for the next six months and the work involved in having her store up and running by memorial day she thought of anything but the real reason driving her back to progress just outside of florence she stopped again and used the rest room of a shell station to brush her hair apply some makeup the artifice wouldnt fool her grandmother but at least shed have made an effort she stopped again on impulse at a florist her grandmothers gardens were always a showplace but the dozen pink tulips were another kind of effort she livedвђhad lived tory reminded herselfвђjust under two hours from her grandmother and hadnt made the trip the effort of it since christmas when she turned down the pretty street with its blooming dogwoods and redbuds she wondered why it was a good place the kind of neighborhood where children played in the yards and dogs napped in the shade a gossipoverthebackyardfencekind of place where people noticed strange cars and kept their eye on their neighbors house as much out of consideration as curiosity iris mooneys house sat in the middle of the block bandbox neat with old and enormous azaleas guarding the foundation the blooms were past their peak but the faded pinks and purples added a delicate color to the strong blue paint her grandmother had chosen as expected her front garden was lush and lovely the gentle slope of the yard well trimmed and the stoop scrubbed and swept a pickup truck with the sign anytime plumbing was parked in the drive behind her grandmothers aging compact tory pulled to the curb the tension shed ignored along the drive began to ease as she walked toward the house she didnt knock shed never had to knock on this door and had always known it would open in welcome to her there had been times when that alone had kept her from crumbling it surprised her to find the house quiet it was nearly ten she noted as she stepped inside shed expected to find her grandmother in her garden or fussing around inside the house the living room was cluttered as always with furniture knickknacks books and tory noted a vase holding a dozen red roses that made her tulips look like poor relations she set aside her suitcase her purse then turning toward the hallway called out gran are you home carrying the flowers she started back toward the bedrooms then lifted her eyebrows when she heard the movement behind her grandmothers closed door tory honeypot ill be right out go on back and get yourself some iced tea with a shrug tory kept walking toward the kitchen glancing back once when she heard what sounded like a muffled giggle she laid the flowers on the counter then opened the refrigerator the pitcher of tea was waiting made as she enjoyed it most with slices of lemon and sprigs of mint gran never forgot anything tory thought and felt tears of sentiment and fatigue sting her eyes she blinked them back when she heard grans quick steps goodness youre early i didnt expect you until after noon if that small slim and agile iris mooney swept into the room and caught tory in a hard hug i got an early start and just kept going did i wake you arent you feeling well what youre still in your robe oh ha after one last squeeze iris drew back im just as fine as rain let me look at you aw honey youre wore out just a little tired but you you look wonderful it was inevitably true sixtyseven years of living had lined her face but it hadnt dulled the magnolia skin or dimmed the deep gray of her eyes her hair had been red in her youth and she saw that it remained that way if god had meant a woman to be gray iris liked to say he wouldnt have invented miss clairol she took care of herself and pampered her looks which she thought now was more than she could say about her granddaughter you sit down right here im going to fix you some breakfast dont trouble gran you know better than to argue with me dont you now sit she pointed to a chair at the little ice cream parlor table oh look at these arent they pretty she swept up the tulips her delight in them sparkling in her eyes youre the sweetest thing my tory ive missed you gran im sorry i havent visited youve got your own life which is what i always wanted for you now you just relax and when youve got your feet back under you you can tell me all about your trip it was worth every mile i found some wonderful pieces got my eye for pretty things she winked turning just in time to see her granddaughter gape at the man who had stepped into the kitchen doorway he was tall as an oak with a chest wide as a buick his grizzled hank of hair was the color and texture of steel wool his eyes were the burnished brown of acorns and drooped like a basset hounds his leathered face was tanned to match he cleared his throat with an exaggerated flourish then nodded at tory morning he began in an upcountry drawl ah miz mooney i got that drain cleared for you cecil stop being a moron you dont even have your toolbox with you iris set aside a carton of eggs no need to blush she told him my granddaughters not going to faint at the notion her grandmas got herself a beau tory this is cecil axton the reason im not dressed at ten this morning iris the blush rose up to his cheeks like fire under cordwood im pleased to meet you tory your grans been looking forward to seeing you how do you do tory said for lack of something more clever she offered a hand and because she was still dazed and cecils feelings were so close to the surface she had a quick and blurred image of just what had made her grandmother giggle behind the bedroom door she shut it off fast as her eyes met cecils with mutual mortification youre youre a plumber mr axton he came to fix my water heater iris put in and hes been keeping me warm ever sinceвђќ iris cecil ducked his head hunched the twin mountains of his shoulders but couldnt quite hide the grin i gotta get on hope you enjoy your visit tory dont you think about running off without kissing me goodbye to solve the matter iris crossed to him took his weathered face between her hands to pull it down to her level and kissed him firm on the mouth there now lightning did not strike thunder did not roll and the child here did not collapse in shock she kissed him again then patted his cheek you go on handsome and have a good day i guess ill um see you later on youd better we decided on this cecil now you scat ill talk to tory im going with a hesitant smile he turned to tory you can argue with this woman but it just gives you a headache he took a faded blue gimme cap from a kitchen peg set it on his wiry hair and hurried out isnt he the cutest thing i got some nice lean bacon here how do you want your eggs in chocolate chip cookies gran tory drew a careful breath and rose its absolutely none of my business but of course its not your business unless i invite you into it which i have iris laid bacon in the old black spider skillet to sizzle im going to be very disappointed in you tory if youre shocked and appalled by the idea of your grandmother having a sex life tory winced but managed to compose her face when iris turned toward her not shocked not appalled but certainly a little disconcerted the idea of coming here this morning and nearly walking in on hmmmвђќ well you were early honeypot im going to fry these eggs and were both going to indulge in a nice greasy midmorning breakfast i guess you worked up an appetite iris blinked then threw back her head and laughed now thats my girl you worry me sugar plum when you dont smile what have i got to smile about youre the one having sex amused iris cocked her head and whose fault is that yours you saw cecil first tory got down two glasses poured the tea how many women she wondered could claim a grandmother who had hot affairs with the plumber she wasnt sure whether she should be proud or amused and decided the combination of both suited the situation he seems like a very nice man he is better hes a very good man iris poked at the bacon and decided to get it done all at once tory hes living here living youre living with him he wants to get married but im not sure thats what i want so im taking him for what you might call a test drive i think ill just sit down after all jesus gran have you told mama no and i dont intend to as i can live without the lecture on living in sin and perdition and gods almighty plan your mama is the biggest pain in the butt since selfservice gas stations how any daughter of mine turned out to be such a mouse of a woman is beyond me survival tory murmured but iris only snarled shedвђve survived just fine if shed walked out on that son of a bitch she married twentyfive years ago or any day since thats her choice tory if she had any gumption shed have made a different one you did did i i dont know what choices i made or which were made for me i dont know which were right and which were wrong and here i am gran circling right back to where i started i tell myself im in charge now that its all my decision but under it all i know i just cant stop it do you want to i dont know the answer then youll keep going until you find it youve got such a strong light in you tory youll find your way so you always said but the one thing thats always scared me the most is being lost i should have helped you more i should have been there for you gran tory rose crossed the room to wrap her arms around iriss waist to press cheek to cheek while the bacon snapped and sizzled youve always been the one steady hand in my life i wouldnt be here without you yes you would iris patted torys hand then briskly lifted out bacon to drain youre stronger than the lot of us put together and that if you ask me is what scared hannibal bodeen he wanted to break you out of his own fear in the end well he forged you didnt he ignorant sob she cracked an egg on the side of the skillet let it slide into the bubbling grease make us some toast honeypot shes nothing like you mama tory said as she dropped bread into the toaster shes nothing like you at all i dont know what sarabeths like i lost her years ago same time i lost your granddaddy i suppose she was only twelve when he died hell i was hardly more than thirty myself and found myself a widow with two children to raise on my own that was the worst year of my life nothings ever come close to matching it sweet jesus i loved that man she let out a sigh flipped the eggs onto plates he was my world my jimmy one minute the world was steady and the next it was just gone and theres sarabeth twelve years old and jr barely sixteen she went wild on me maybe i couldve reined her in god knows i should have you cant blame yourself i dont but you see things when you look back see how if one thing was done different the whole picture of a life changes if id moved away from progress back then if id used jimmys insurance instead of taking a job at the bank if i hadnt been so hellbent to save so my children could have a college education you wanted the best for them i did iris set the plates on the table turned to get butter and jelly from the refrigerator jr got his college education and he used it sarabeth got hannibal bodeen thats the way it was meant to be thats why my granddaughter and i are going to sit here and eat a couple of heart attacks on a plate if i could go back and do that one thing different i wouldnt because i wouldnt have you im going back gran knowing i cant do anything different tory put the toast on a little plate carried it to the table it scares me that i need to go back so much i dont know those people anymore im afraid i wont know myself once im there you wont settle yourself until you do this thing tory until you take hold of it you cant let go of it youve been heading back to progress since you left it i know and having someone else understand that helped smiling a little tory lifted a slice of bacon so tell me about your plumber oh that sweetie pie delighted with the topic iris dug into her breakfast looks like a big old bear doesnt he you wouldnt guess looking at him how smart he is started that company on his own over forty years back lost his wife i knew her slightly about five years ago hes mostly retired now two of his sons do most of the running of the business got six grandsons six yes indeed fact is one of thems a doctor goodlooking young man i was thinkingвђ stop right there eyes narrowed tory slathered jelly on toast im not interested how do you know you havent even met the boy im not interested in boys or men tory you havent been involved with a man since jack tory finished thats right and i dont intend to be involved again once was enough since it still left a bitter taste in her mouth she picked up her tea not all of us are made to be half of a couple gran im happy on my own at iriss lifted eyebrows tory shrugged okay lets say i intend to be happy on my own im going to work my ass off to make sure of it it had been too long tory thought since shed sat on a porch swing watching the stars come out and hearing the crickets chirp a long time since shed been relaxed enough to simply sit and smell the breeze even as she thought it she realized it was likely to be a long time before she did so again tomorrow shed travel the last miles to progress there she would pick up the pieces of her life and finally lay a dead friend to rest but tonight was for soft breezes and quiet thoughts she glanced up at the squeak of the screen door and offered cecil a smile her grandmother was right she decided he did look like a big old bear and at the moment a very nervous one iris kicked me out of the kitchen he had a dark brown bottle of beer in one hand and shifted uneasily from foot to foot on size fourteen boots she said how i should come on out here and sit a spell keep you company she wants us to be friends why dont you sit a spell id like the company feels a little funny he eased his bulk down on the swing darted a look at tory out of the corner of his eye i know what you young people think an old coot like me courting a woman like iris he still smelled of the lava soap hed used to wash up before dinner lava soap tory mused and coors it was a pleasantly male combination your family doesnt approve oh theyre all right with it now iriss charmed the socks off my boys shes got that way about her one son jerry he got a mite huffy about it but she brought him around the thing is he trailed off cleared his throat twice tory folded her hands and bit back a grin as he launched into what was surely a prepared speech youre mighty important to her tory i guess youre about the most important thing there is to iris shes proud of you and she worries about you and she brags on you i know theres a rift between her and your mama guess you could say that makes you even more special to her the feelings mutual i know it i could see how it is over dinner the thing is he said again then lifted his beer and gulped deeply oh hell i love her he blurted it out and color sprang into his cheeks i guess that sounds foolish to you coming from a man who wont see sixtyfive again butвђ why would it she wasnt comfortable with casual touching but since he seemed to need it she patted his knee and what does age have to do with it gran cares for you thats good enough for me relief slid through him tory could hear it in his sigh never thought id have these feelings again i was married fortysix years to a wonderful woman we grew up together raised a family together started a business together when i lost her i figured that was the end of that part of my life then i met iris and christ jesus she makes me feel twenty years old again you put stars in her eyes he blushed deeper at that but his lips twitched into a shy and delighted smile yeah im good with my hands at torys uncontrollable snort of laughter his eyes went huge i mean to say im handy around the house fixing stuff i know what you meant and stella that was my wife i guess you could say she trained me pretty good i know better than to track in mud on a clean floor to toss dirty towels on the floor i can cook a little if youre not too particular and ive got a decent living gran was right tory decided the man was a sweetie pie cecil are you asking for my blessing he huffed out a breath i mean to marry her she wont hear of it just now mule stubborn that woman but i got a hard head of my own just want you to know that im not taking advantage that my intentions are honorable tory finished wonderfully moved im pulling for you yeah he sat back again making the swing groan thats a relief to me tory thats a relief all right god almighty im glad thats over with a shake of his head he drank more beer my tongue gets all tangled up you did fine cecil you keep her happy i aim to at ease again he draped his arm over the back of the swing and looked out over iriss back garden nice night yeah a very nice night she slept deep and dreamless in her grandmothers house вђњi wish youвђd stay just another day or twoвђќ i have to get started iris nodded struggling not to fuss as tory carried her suitcase toward the car youll call once you settle in a bit of course i will and youll go see jr right off so he and boots can help you along ill go see him and aunt boots and wade she kissed both her grandmothers cheeks now stop worrying im just missing you already give me your hands when tory hesitated iris simply took them indulge me honeypot she held firm her eyes blurring a bit as she focused she didnt have the brilliance of light her granddaughter had been gifted with she saw in colors and shapes the smudgy gray of worry the shimmering pink of excitement the dull blue of grief and through it all was the dark deep red of love youll be all right iris gave her hands a last squeeze ill be right here if you need me ive always known that tory climbed in the car took a deep breath dont tell them where i am gran iris shook her head knowing tory meant her parents i wont i love you she kept her eyes straight ahead as she drove away the fields began to roll gentle ripples on the earth covered with the tender green of growing things she recognized the row crops soybeans tobacco cotton the delicate shoots hazed the brown soil shed missed planting time the land had never called to her as it did to some she enjoyed puttering in a flower garden now and then but had no driving need to feel earth under her hands to tend and harvest to put by what shed grown still she appreciated the cycle the continuity she enjoyed the look of it the neat and practical fields men plowed and nurtured rode side by side with the tangled lushness of the live oaks and moss the ubiquitous sumac the ribbons of dark water that could never would never be truly tamed the smell of it was rich and again dark fertilizer and swamp water more she thought the perfume of the south than any magnolia this was its true heart after all beyond the formal gardens and lavish lawns the south beat on crops and sweat and the secret shadows of its rivers shed taken the back roads for solitude and with every mile felt herself drawn closer to that heart on the west edge of progress some of the farms and fields had given way to homes tidy developments with yards kept green and lush with underground sprinklers there were latemodel sedans and minivans in the drives and sidewalks running wide and even here were the young marrieds she mused most with double incomes who wanted a nice home in the suburbs for raising a family these were her target customers and the primary reason shed been able to justify the move successful home owners with disposable income enjoyed decorating their space with the right advertising and clever displays she would draw them into her shop and they would buy were there any living well in those quiet homes shed known as a child any who might remember the thin young girl whod come to school with bruises would they remember shed sometimes known things she wasnt supposed to know memories were short tory reminded herself and even if some remembered she would find a way to use it to promote her store the houses elbowed closer together as she approached the town line as if they were anxious for company into her mind flashed an image of the far side where the narrow whip of the river was the border of progress in her youth the houses that slipped and slithered down into the had been small and dark with leaky roofs and rusted trucks that most often stood on chipped cinder blocks a place where dogs snarled and leaped viciously at the ends of their chains where the women hung out dingy laundry while children sat on patchy grass that was mostly dirt some of the men farmed to eke out a living and some of them simply lived on beer and mead as a child shed been one shaky step above that fate and even as a child shed feared losing the balance and tumbling into the holler where daily bread was served with exhaustion she saw the church steeple first the town boasted four or had still nearly everyone shed known had belonged to the baptist church shed sat countless hours on one of the hard pews listening listening desperately to the sermon because her father would quiz her on the content that night before supper if she didnt respond well the punishment was hard and it was quick she hadnt been inside a church of any kind in eight years dont think about it she ordered herself think about now but now she saw was very much like then it seemed to her very little had changed inside the edges of progress deliberately she turned onto live oak drive to cruise through the oldest residential section of town the homes here were large and gracious the trees old and leafy her uncle had moved here a few years before shed left progress on his wifes money her father had said brittlely tory hadnt been allowed to visit there and even now felt a twinge of guilty panic just driving by the lovely old white brick home with its flowering shrubs and sparkling windows her uncle would be at work now managing the bank as hed managed it nearly as long as she could remember and though she had a great deal of affection for her aunt tory wasnt in the mood for boots mooneys fluttering hands and whispery voice she wove through the streets past smaller homes and a small apartment complex that hadnt existed sixteen years before she lifted her eyebrows at a corner convenience store that had sprung up in bright reds and yellows out of the old progress drivein the high school had an addition and there was a charming little park just off the square where thered once been a line of crumbling row houses there were new young trees planted among the old soldiers and graceful flowers spilling out of concrete pots it all seemed prettier cleaner fresher than she remembered she wondered how much would turn out to be the same under that new coat of varnish as she turned onto market she was ridiculously pleased to see hansons was still standing still wore the same battered old sign and its front window remained patch worked with flyers and billboards the sweet childhood taste of grape nehi immediately filled her mouth her throat and made her smile the beauty salon had changed hands she noted lous beauty shoppe was now called hair today but the market street diner stood where it had always stood and it seemed to her the same old men wearing the same overalls were loitering outside to gossip midway down the block tucked between rollins paint and hardware and the flower basket was the old drygoods store that tory thought as she pulled to the curb would be her change she climbed out of the car and stepped into the thick midday heat the outside of the building was exactly as she remembered the old clinker bricks cobbled together with the mortar gray as smoke between the window was high and wide and just now coated with dust and street grime but she would fix that the door was glass as well and cracked the landlord she determined taking out her notebook would that shed put a bench outside the narrow one with the black wroughtiron back she was having shipped and beside it pots filled with purple and white petunias friendly flowers high on the window above the bench shed have the store name printed southern comfort that would be what she offered her clientele comfortable surroundings where stock was stylishly displayed and tagged in her mind she was already inside filling shelves arranging tables and lamps she didnt hear her name called until she was scooped off her feet the blood rushed to her head ringing there while her pulse went into panic trip tory i thought that was you ive been keeping an eye out for you the last days wade his name came out in a whoosh i scared you immediately contrite he set her back on her feet sorry im just so glad to see you let me catch my breath you catch it while i look at you damn has it really been two years you look wonderful do i it was nice to hear even if didnt believe it for a minute she pushed back her hair while her pulse leveled though he was a couple of inches shy o six feet she had to tip her head back to study his face hed always been pretty she remembered but she imagined he was relieved that the angelic face of his youth had weathered a bit his eyes were a deep slumberous chocolate his face had fined down from childhood but he still boasted dimples his hair shades lighter than her own was well cut to tame the tendency to curl he was dressed in jeans and a plain cotton shirt of faded blue as she took his measure his lips quirked he looked she decided young handsome and quietly prosperous if i look wonderful i dont have words for how you look you got all the handsome in the family cousin wade he flashed a grin at that quick and boyish but resisted hugging her again tory he knew had always been skittish about hugs and strokes he settled for giving her hair a little tug im glad youre back i couldnt have picked a better welcoming committee she gestured widely the town looks good the same in a lot of ways but better tidier i suppose progress in progress he said we owe a lot of it to the lavelles the town council and particularly the mayor of the last five years you remember dwight dwight frazier вђњdwight the dweeb one of the mighty three formed by you him and cade lavelleвђќ the dweeb hit his stride in high school became a track star married the homecoming queen went into his daddys construction business and helped turn progress around were all goddamn solid citizens these days standing there with the light traffic cruising the street behind him hearing the familiar rhythm of his voice she remembered why hed always held her affection miss hellraising do you wade some listen im between appointments i have to get back and convince a great dane named igor he needs his rabies shotвђќ better you than me dr mooney my office is across the street end of the block walk up with me and ill buy you an iced tea id like that but i need to go by the realtor see what theyve got lined up for me she caught the flicker in his eyes tilted her head what i dont know how youll feel about it but your old place its vacant the house instinctively she crossed her arms hugged her elbows fate she thought had such a long and sneaky reach i dont know how i feel about it either i guess i should find out in a town of less than six thousand it was hard to walk two blocks without running into someone you knew it didnt matter if youd been away sixteen years or sixty when she stepped into the realtors office there was only one person manning a desk the woman was pretty petite and polished her long blond hair was swept back from a heartshaped face dominated by big babyblue eyes afternoon the woman fluttered her lashes and set aside a paperback novel with a barechested pirate on the cover can i help you tory had a quick image of the playground at progress elementary a group of little girls shrieking in fear and disgust and running away and the smug satisfied look in the big blue eyes of the leader as she tossed a sneer over her shoulder while her long blond hair flew behind her вђњlissy harlowe lissy cocked her head вђњdo i know you why im so sorry i just dont those blue eyes widened tory tory bodeen for heavens sake she gave a little squeal and hauled herself to her feet she looked to be about six months pregnant from the bulge under the pale pink shirt daddy said how youd be coming by sometime this week despite torys automatic step in retreat lissy scurried around the desk to embrace her like a longlost friend this is so exciting she pulled back to beam cheer and welcome tory bodeen come back to progress after all this time and dont you look pretty thank you tory watched lissys eyes scan measure then glint with satisfaction there was no doubt here whod grown up better you look so much the same but you were always the prettiest girl in progress oh what foolishness lissy waved a hand but couldnt stop herself from preening a bit now you just sit right down and let me get you something cold to drink no dont bother im fine did your father get the lease agreement seems like he mentioned he did the whole towns talking about your shop i cant wait till youre open you just cant find pretty things in progress she walked behind the desk again as she spoke lord knows you cant be driving down to charleston every time you want something with a bit of style thats good to know tory sat and found herself eye level with the sign that identified lissy frazier frazier dwight you married dwight five happy years we have a son my lukes the cutest thing she turned a framed photo around to show off a bright eyed towheaded toddler and were expecting his brother or sister by end of summer she gave the mound of her belly a satisfied pat and wiggled her fingers so her wedding and engagement rings caught the light and flashed fire from the diamonds you never married honey there was just enough bite in the question to let tory know lissy still liked being the best no i just admire you career women more than i can say youre all so brave and smart yall put us homebodies to shame when tory lifted a brow at the desk and the name plate lissy laughed and waved her hand again oh i just come in a couple times a week to help daddy out once the babys born im sure i wont have the time or energy and would lissy thought go quickly and not so quietly mad at home with two children but shed deal with that and dwight when the time came now you just tell me everything youve been up to id love to chat lissy if you yanked my tongue out and wrapped it around my neck but i need to get settled oh how silly of me you must be just worn out and ready to drop the thin smile told tory that if she wasnt lissy certainly thought she looked it well have ourselves a nice long catchup once youre rested ill look forward to it remember tory told herself this is just the type of customer you need i ran into wade just a few minutes ago he mentioned the houseвђmy old houseвђmight be available to rent why it sure is the lavelle tenants moved on just a couple weeks back but honey you dont want to live way out there now do you weve got some nice apartments right here in town river terrace has everything a single girl could want including single men she added with a sly wink modern fixtures walltowall carpet weve got us a garden unit available thats just lovely im not interested in an apartment id enjoy being out in the country a ways whats the rent ill just look that up for you she knew it of course lissys mind was much sharper than people expected she preferred it way she shifted her chair fumbled with the keyboard of her computer a bit for form i swear ill never get the hang of these things you know thats a onebath frame construction yes i know scanning the screen lissy tossed off the monthly rent now thats a good fifteen twentyminute drive from town this sweet little apartment i was telling you abouts no moreвђn a tenminute walk on a pretty day ill take the house lissy glanced up blinked take it dont you want to run out and see it first i have seen it ill write out a check first and last months rent yes lissy shrugged just let me print out the rental agreement less than thirty seconds after the deal was signed and sealed and tory walked out with the keys lissy was on the phone spreading the word this too had changed the house stood as it had always stood back from a narrow dirt lane a short spit from the swamp fields spread on its west side the tender shoots of cotton already sprung up out of the earth their rows neat as docile schoolchildren but someone had planted azaleas in pink and white and a young magnolia tree near the bedroom window she remembered the screens going rusty and the white paint going gray but someone had taken care here the windows sparkled and the paint was a fresh and soft blue a front porch had been added wide enough for the rocking chair that stood alongside the door it was almost welcoming her pulse beat dull and thick as she walked toward it there would be ghosts but ghosts were why shed come back wasnt it better to face them all the keys rattled in her hand the screen door squeaked she told herself it was a homey sound a friendly screen door should squeak and it should slam bracing it open she fit the key in the lock turned it she took one deep breath before stepping inside she saw the ragged couch with its faded roses the old console tv the frayed braided rug dull yellow walls with no pictures to brighten the space the smell of overcooked greens and lysol tory you get in here and clean yourself up this minute didnt i tell you i wanted this table set for supper before your daddy gets home then the image winked away and she stood in an empty room the walls were painted cream a plain but serviceable color the floors were bare but clean the air carried the faint scent of paint and polish more efficient than offensive she stepped through to the kitchen the counters had been redone in a neutral stone gray and the cabinets painted white the stove was newвђor newer than the one her mother had sweated over the window over the sink looked out to the swamp as it always had lush and green and secret gathering her courage she turned and headed toward her old bedroom had it always been so small she wondered barely big enough to swing a cat in she decided though it had been large enough for her needs her bed had been close to the window shed liked looking out into the night or into the morning shed had a little dresser and its drawers had swelled and stuck every summer shed hidden books in the bottom drawer because daddy didnt approve of her reading anything but the bible there were good memories mixed with the bad in this room of reading late into the night in secret of dreaming private dreams of planning adventures with hope and of course of the beatings no one would ever lay hands on her again it would make a reasonable office she decided a desk a file cabinet perhaps a reading chair and lamp it would do she would sleep in her parents old room yes she would sleep there and she would make it her own she started to go out but couldnt resist quietly she opened the closet door there the ghost of herself huddled in the dark face streaked with tears shed shed tears of a lifetime before she was eight crouching she ran her fingers along the baseboard and they trembled over the shallow carving with her eyes closed she read the letters with fingertips the way the blind read braille i am tory thats right thats right i am tory you couldnt take that from me couldnt beat that out of me im tory and back unsteadily she got to her feet air thought she needed air there was never any air in the closet never any light sweat sprang to her palms as she backed up she turned to dash from the room would have run from the house but a shadow wavered outside the screen door the afternoon sun poured in behind it outlined into the shape of a man as the door squeaked open she was eight years old again alone helpless terrified the shadow said her name the whole of it victoria so that it flowed out like something rich poured from a warmed bottle she might have run and it shamed and surprised her to find there was still that much rabbit inside her that wanted to careen away plunge into a bolthole at the first snap of a twig the ghosts of the house circled around her whispering taunts in her ear shed run before more than once it had never saved her she stood where she was frozen panic swam up sickly from gut to throat as the door creaked open ive frightened you im sorry his voice was quiet the tone a man uses to soothe the injured or complete a seduction i wanted to stop by see if you needed anything he stood just inside the door so the sun beamed behind him blurred his features in her mind thoughts tumbled going soft so they spilled over each other вђњhow did you know i was here have you been away so long you dont know how quick the grapevine climbs in progress there was a smile in his voice calculated she thought to put her at ease it meant the fear showed and made her too easy a target that at least that she could stop she folded her hands no i havent forgotten anything who are you that sound you hears my ego crumbling even after all these years i couldve picked you out in a crowd its cade he said and stepped closer kincade lavelle he stepped out of the harsh light until it fell behind him into sun and shadow the keenest edge of fear ebbed with the glare and she saw him clearly kincade lavelle hopes brother would she have recognized him no she didnt think so the boy she remembered had been thin of body and soft of face this mans build was rangy hinted of tough in the muscles of the forearms showing under rolledup sleeves of his work shirt and though he smiled easily enough there was nothing soft in the sharp bones and high planes of his face his hair was darker than it had been the color of walnuts with the curling tips bleached out by the sun hed always been one for the outofdoors she remembered that remembered shed sometimes see him walking the fields with his father in a kind of swagger that came from owning the lad your feet landed on the eyes she thought she might have placed the eyes that deep summer blue like hopes the sun had left its mark there as well with faint lines etched into the corners the kind she thought that brought men character and women despair those eyes watched her now with a kind of lazy patience that might have embarrassed her if her pulse had been level its been a long time was the best she could do about half my life he didnt offer his hand instinct told him shed only jolt and embarrass both of them she looked ready to jump or collapse neither would suit him instead he tucked his thumbs casually in the front pockets of his jeans why dont you come on out on the front porch and sit down it appears that old rockers the only chair weve got right now im fine im all right white as death was what she was with those soft gray eyes that had always fascinated him still wide and bright growing up in a household largely dominated by women had taught him how to get around female pride and sulks with the least fuss and energy he simply turned back pushed open the screen stuffy in here he said and stepped out keeping the door wide and banking on man nudging her to follow left with little choice she crossed the room walked out onto the porch he caught the faintest drift of her scent and thought of the jasmine that preferred to bloom at night almost in secret in his mothers garden must be an experience he touched her now lightly to guide her to the chair coming back here she didnt jump but she did edge away in a small but deliberate motion i needed a place to live and wanted to settle in quickly her stomach muscles refused to loosen up again she didnt like talking to men this way you never knew not for certain what was under the easy words and easy smiles youve been living in charleston awhile lifes a lot quieter here i want quiet he leaned back against the rail there was an edge here he mused however delicate she looked there was an edge like a raw nerve ready to scream odd he realized it was just what he remembered most about her her delicacy like the business end of a scalpel theres a lot of talk about your store thats good she smiled just the faintest curve of lips but her eyes remained serious and watchful talk means curiosity and curiosity will bring people through the door did you run a store in charleston i managed one ownings different so it is beaux reves was his now and owning was indeed different he glanced behind him out to the fields where seedlings and sprouts reached for the sun how does it look to you tory after all this time and distance the same she didnt look at the fields but at him and not at all the same i was thinking that about you you grew up he looked back at her watched her fingers curl on the arms of the chair as if to steady herself grew into your eyes you always had a womans eyes when i was twelve they spooked me it took the will and the pride shed carved into herself to keep her gaze level when you were twelve you were too busy running wild with my cousin wade and dwight theвђdwight frazier to pay any notice of me youre wrong about that when i was twelve he said slowly there was a space of time i noticed everything about you i still carry that picture of you inside my head why dont we stop pretending shes not standing right here between us tory rose in a jerk walked to the far end of the porch and stood arms crossed over her chest to stare out at the fields we both loved her cade said we both lost her and neither of us has forgotten her the weight descended on her chest like hands pushing i cant help you im not asking you for help for what then puzzled he shifted then settled back again to study her profile shed closed he realized whatever small opening been was shuttered down again im not asking for anything tory is that what expect from everyone she felt stronger now on her feet an turned to give him a steady stare yes a bird darted behind him a quick gray flash that swept by and found a perch in one of the tupelos edging the swamp and then it seemed to her it sang its heart out for hours before cade spoke again had she forgotten this she wondered the long easy pauses the patient rhythm of country conversations thats a pity he said as her began to beat in the silence but i donвђt want anything from you except maybe friendly word now and then the fact is hope meant something to both of us losing her had an effect on my life i hesitate to call a lady a liar but if you were to stand there eye to eye with me and tell me it didnвђt affect yours thats what id have to doвђќ what difference does it make to you how i feel she wanted to rub the chill from her arms but resisted вђњwe dont know each other we never really did we knew her maybe your coming back stirs things to the surface again thats no fault of yours it just is is this visit a welcome back or a warning for me to keep my distance he said nothing for a moment then shook his head the humor slid back into his eyes a glint so much speedier than his voice you sure grew up prickly first i dont make a habit of asking beautiful women to keep their distance id be the one to suffer wouldnt i she didnt smile but he did and this time deliberately took a step closer perhaps the motion perhaps the sound of work boots on wood sent the bird deeper into the swamp and silenced the song you could always tell me to keep mine but im unlikely to listen i came by to welcome you back tory and to get a look at you i got a right to my own curiosity and seeing you brings some of that summer back thats a natural thing its going to bring it back for others too you had to know that before you decided to comeвђќ вђњi came for me is that why you look sick and scared and tired he wondered then welcome home he held out his hand she hesitated but it seemed as much a dare as an offering when she placed hers in it she found his warm and harder than shed expected just as she felt the connection a kind of quiet internal click unexpected and unwelcome im sorry if it seems unfriendly she slid her hand free but ive got a lot of work to do i need to get started you just let me know if theres anything i can do for you i appreciate that ah you fixed the house up nice its a good house but he looked at her as he said it its a good spot ill let you get doing he added and started down the steps he stopped beside a toughlooking pickup that desperately needed washing tory you know that picture of you i carried in my head he opened the truck door and a quick little breeze ruffled through his sunstreaked hair i got a better one now he drove off keeping her framed in the rearview mirror until he made the turn from hardpacked dirt to asphalt he hadnt meant to bring up hope not right off as the owner of beaux reves as her landlord as a childhood acquaintance hed told himself it was a straight duty call but he hadnt fooled himself and he obviously hadnt fooled tory either curiosity had sent him straight out to what people hereabouts still called the marsh house when hed had a dozen pressing matters demanding his attention hed been raised to run the farm but he ran it his own way that way didnt please everyone hed learned to play politician and diplomat hed learned to play whatever role was required as long as he got what he wanted he wondered just what role hed need to play with tory whether she was ready to admit it or not her coming back shifted all manner of balances she was the pebble in the pond and the ripples were going to run long and wide he wasnt sure what to do about her what he wanted to do about her but he was a man of the land and men who made their living from earth and seed and weather knew how to bide time on impulse he pulled the truck to the side of the road he had no business making this stop when all his responsibilities were gathered at beaux reves the new crops were coming up and when the crops grew so did the weeds he had cultivating to oversee this was a pivotal year for the plans hed implemented he wanted his finger on every step and stage still he got out of the cab walked across the little wooden bridge and stepped into the swamp here the world was green and rich and alive paths had been cleared and alongside them neat as a park grew azaleas in staggering stubborn bloom among the magnolia and tupelo were swaths of wildflowers tidy hills and spears of evergreens it was no longer the exciting slightly dangerous world of his youth now it was a shrine to a lost child his father had done this in grief in pride perhaps even in the fury hed never shown but it had lived inside him cade knew like a cancer growing and spreading in secret and silence those tumors of rage and despair grief had been treated like a disease inside the walls of beaux reves and here he thought it had been turned to flowers lilies would dance in the summer a colorful parade and the delicate yellow irises that liked their feet wet were already blooming in the spring shadows like tiny sunbeams brush had been cleared for them though it grew back quickly as long as his father had lived there had been hands to hack it down again now that responsibility lay on cade as well there was a small stone bench in the clearing where hope had built her fire that last night of her life there was another arched bridge over the tobaccobrown water haunted by cypress trees bordered by thickly curling ferns and rhododendrons flowering in sheer white camellias and pansies that would bring flower and scent over the winter when they thrived and between the bench and the bridge in the midst of a pool of pink and blue blossoms stood a marble statue carved in the likeness of a laughing young girl who would be forever eight they had buried her eighteen years before on a hill in the sunlight but here in the green shadows and wild scents was where hopes spirit lay cade sat on the bench let his hands dangle between his knees he didnt come here often since his fathers death eight years before no one did at least no one in the family as far as his mother was concerned this place ceased to exist from the moment hope had been found raped strangled then tossed aside like a usedup doll just how much cade asked himself as he had countless times over that long sea of years just how much of what had been done to her was on his head he sat back closed his eyes hed lied to tory he admitted now he did want something from her he wanted answers answers hed waited for more than half his life he took five precious minutes to steady himself strange he hadnt realized until now how much it had unnerved him to see her again shed been right that hed paid scant attention to her when they were children shed been the little bodeen girl his sister had run with and beneath the notice of a twelveyearold boy until that morning that horrible morning in august when shed come to the door with her cheek raw and bruised and her wide eyes terrified from that moment thered been nothing about her he hadnt noticed nothing about her hed forgotten hed made it his business to know all there was to know about where shed gone what shed done who shed been long after she left progress hed known nearly to the hour when shed begun making her plans to come back and still he hadnt been prepared to see her standing in that empty room the color leached out of her face so that her eyes stood out like pools of smoke theyd both take rime to settle cade decided as he got to his feet and then theyd deal with each other then theyd deal with hope he walked back to his truck drove out to check his crops and his crew he was hot sweaty and dirty by the time he turned between the stone pillars that guarded the long shady lane to beaux reves twenty oaks ten on either side flanked the drive and arched over it to make a green and gold tunnel in between their thick trunks he could see the flowering shrubs in bloom the wide sweep of lawn the ribbon of a bricked path that led to garden and outbuildings when he was tired as he was now this last stretch never failed to reach out to him to stroke at his fatigue like a loving hand through drought and war through the ripping apart of one way of life and the making of another beaux reves stood more than two hundred years the land had been in lavelle hands they had tended it nurtured it abused it and cursed it but it survived it had buried them and it had birthed them and now it was his perhaps the house was one huge eccentricity in the center of elegance more fortress than house more defiant than graceful the stone caught sparks from the dying sun and glinted the towers lanced arrogantly into a sky going the color of a fresh bruise there was a huge pool of flowers in the oval centering the circular drive some longago ancestors attempt to soften the arrogantly masculine lines cade had always thought instead the sea of flowers and shrubs served as a sharp contrast to the massive front doors of deeply carved oak and the straight spears of windows he left the truck at the far curve of the drive and walked up the six stone steps the veranda had been added on by his greatgrandfather a bit of civility cade mused with its shading roof and twining vines of clematis he could sit if he chose as those of his blood had sat for generations and look out over grass and tree and flower without smudging the view with the vicious and sweatsoaked work of the fields which was why he rarely sat there he scraped the soil off his boots inside those doors was his mothers domain and though she would say nothing her disapproving silence her cooleyed stare at any trace of the fields on her floors would be worse than a blistering lecture spring had been kind so the windows were open to the evening the scents from the gardens spilled in to mingle with the perfumes of the flowers that had been selected and arranged indoors the entrance hall was massive the floor marbled in sea green so it felt as though his feet would simply sink into cool water he thought of a shower a beer and a good hot meal before he tackled the evenings paperwork he moved quietly listening and felt no guilt at the hope he could avoid any contact with his family until he was clean and refueled hed gotten as far as the bar in the main parlor had just popped the top on a becks when he heard the feminine click of heels he winced but his face was composed and relaxed when faith swirled into the room pour me a white wine darling i got some rough edges need smoothing she stretched herself out on the sofa as she spoke with a fussy little sigh and a finger brush of her short bob of blond hair she was back to blond there were those who said faith lavelle changed her hair color nearly as often as she changed men there were those who relished saying it shed been divorced twice in her twentysix years and had gathered and discarded more lovers than most cared to count particularly faith yet she managed to project the image of the delicate southern flower with camelliawhite skin and the lavelle blue eyes moody blue eyes that could well up with tears on command and were skilled at making promises she might or might not intend to keep her first husband had been a wild and handsome boy of eighteen with whom shed eloped two months before she graduated from high school shed loved him with all the passion and capriciousness of youth and had been devastated when hed left her flat and broke less than a year later not that she let anyone know that as far as the world was concerned shed dumped bobby lee matthews and had come back to beaux reves because shed grown bored playing house three years later she d married an aspiring countrywestern singer shed met in a bar that she had done out of boredom but shed stuck it out for two years before she realized clive had also aspired to live the cheating beating lyrics of the songs he scribbled in a haze of budweiser and marlboros so once again she was back at beaux reves edgy dissatisfied and secretly disgusted with herself she sent cade a sweet and melting smile when he brought her a glass of wine honey you look worn out why dont you sit down and put your feet up for a while she grabbed his hand gave it a little tug you work too hard anytime you want to pitch in her smile sharpened a blade turned to the keen edge beaux reves is yours papa made that clear all our lives papas not here anymore faith merely moved one careless shoulder doesnt change the facts she lifted her wine sipped she was a lovely woman who took great pains to exploit her beauty even now for an evening at home shed added soft color to her cheeks painted her sensuously wide mouth a poppy pink and had draped herself in a silk blouse and slacks in soft rose you can change anything you want to change ive been raised to be decorative and useless she tossed her head then stretched like a cat and im so good at it you irritate me faith im good at that too amused she nudged his leg with her bare foot dont be cross cade arguings going to spoil my taste for this wine ive already had words with mama today a day doesnt go by you dont have words with mama i wouldnt if she wasnt so critical of every damn thing shes been in a mood most of the day faiths eyes glittered since lissy called from town anyhow no point in it she knew tory was coming back comings different from being i dont think she likes the idea of renting the marsh house to her if she doesnt live there shell just live somewhere else since he was tired he lay his head back and tried to will the tension of the day out of his neck and shoulders shes back and it appears she means to stay so you did go see her faith drummed her fingers against her thigh i thought you would duty first for our cade well whats she like polite reserved nervous i think about being back he took a sip of beer attractive attractive i remember treebark hair and knobby knees skinny and spooky he let it pass faith tended to pout if a man even her brother commented on another womans good looks he wasnt in the mood for her sulks you could make the effort to be nice to her faith tory wasnt responsible for what happened to hope whats the point of making her feel as though she were did i say i wasnt going to be nice to her faith ran her fingers around the rim of her glass she couldnt seem to keep them still i imagine she could use a friend faith dropped her hand and her silky voice went flat she was hopes friend never mine maybe not but hopes not here anymore either and you could use a friend yourself honey ive got plenty of friends its just that none of them happens to be a woman fact is things are so dull around here i might go into town tonight after all see if i can find me a friend for a few hours suit yourself he pushed her foot aside and rose i need a shower cade she said before he got to the door shed seen that flare of derision in his eyes and it stung i got a right to live my life as i choose youve got a right to waste your life as you choose all right she said evenly and so do you but im saying maybe for once i agree with mama on one thing wed all be better off if victoria bodeen went back to charleston and stayed there youd sure as hell be better off keeping your distance from whatever trouble shes carrying with her what are you afraid of faith everything she thought as he walked away just everything restless now she uncurled herself and paced to the tall front windows gone now was the languorous southern belle her movements were quick almost jittering with nervous energy maybe she would go into town she thought go somewhere maybe shed just leave altogether and go where nothing was what she thought it would be when she left beaux reves no one was how she thought they would be including herself every time she left she told herself it was for good but she always came back every time she left she told herself it would be different that she would be different but she never was how could she expect anyone to understand that everything that had happened before everything that had happened since all hinged on that one night when sheвђwhen hopeвђhad been eight now the person who connected the night with all the others was back standing looking out over the lawn and gardens going silver with dusk faith wished tory bodeen to hell it was nearly eight when wade finished with his last patient an elderly mixed breed with failing kidneys and a heart murmur his equally elderly owner couldnt bring herself to put the poor old dog down so wade had once again treated the dog and gently soothed the human he was too tired for the diner and thought hed just slap together a sandwich or open a can the small apartment above his office suited him it was efficient convenient and cheap he could have afforded better and so both of his parents continually reminded him but he preferred to live simply and shovel the profits of his practice back into it he had no pets of his own at the moment though hed had quite a menagerie as a child dogs and cats of course and with them the prerequisite wounded birds the frogs the turtles the rabbits and once a runt pig hed called buster his indulgent mother hadnt drawn the line until hed wanted to bring home a black snake hed found stretched across the road hed been sure he could talk her into it but when hed come to the kitchen door with a plea in his eyes and four feet of wiggling snake in his hands his mother had screamed loud enough to bring mr pritchett from next door leaping over their shared fence pritchett had sprained his hamstring wades mother had dropped her beloved milk glass pitcher on the kitchen tiles and the snake had been banished to the river outside of town but bless her wade thought shed tolerated everything else hed dragged in with hardly a word of complaint eventually hed have a house and yard and the time to indulge himself but until he could afford a larger staff most of his workdays ran ten hours minimum and that didnt count the emergencies people who didnt have the time to devote to pets shouldnt have them he felt the same way about children he headed into the kitchen first grabbed an apple dinner such as it was would wait until hed washed the dog off him crunching into the apple he flipped through the mail hed carried up with him as he walked to the bedroom he smelled her before he saw her that hot wave of woman hit his senses scattered his thoughts she stirred on the bed a rustle of silky skin against the sheets she wore nothing but an invitational smile hello lover you worked late you said youd be busy tonight faith crooked a finger i intend to be why dont you come over here and occupy me wade tossed the mail and the apple aside why dont i it was a pitiful thing wade supposed for a man to be hung up on one woman all of his life more than pitiful when that woman insisted on flitting in and out of that life like a careless butterfly and the man let her each time she came back he told himself he wouldnt play the game and each time she hooked him in until he was too deep into the pot to fold his hand and walk away hed been the first man to have her he had no hope of being the last he was no more able to resist her now than hed been over ten years before that bright summer night shed climbed in his window and into his bed while he slept he could still remember what it had been like to wake with that sleek hot body sliding over his that hungry mouth smothering him devouring him clamping over him until he was rock hard and randy she was fifteen years old he thought now and shed taken him with the quick heartless efficiency of a fiftydollar whore and shed been a virgin that shed told him had been the point she didnt want to be a virgin and shed decided to get rid of the burden with as fuss as possible and with someone she knew liked and trusted simple as that for little faith it had always been simple but for wade that summer night weeks before hed gone back to college had layered the first of many complicated tiers that made up his relationship with faith lavelle theyd had sex as often as they manage that summer in the backseat of hi car late at night when his parents down the hall in the middle of the day when his mother sat on the veranda gossiping with friends faith was willing eager ready shed been a young mans wet dream sprung to life and had become wades obsession hed been sure shed wait for him in less than two years while hed been studying fiercely and planning for the future their future shed run off with bobby lee wade had gotten drunk and stayed drunk for a week shed come back of course to progress and eventually to him with no apology n tearful plea for forgiveness that was the pattern of their relationship he detested her for it nearly as much as h detested himself so faith climbed over him tugged a cigarette from the pack on the nightstand and straddling him lighted it tell me about tory when did you start smoking again today she smiled leaning down to give him a little nip on the chin dont give me grief on it wade everyones entitled to a vice which one have you missed she laughed but there was an edge to it an edge in her eyes if you dont try them out how do you know which ones fit now come on baby tell me about tory im just dying to know everything theres nothing to know shes back faith let out a huge sigh men are such irritating creatures what does she look like how does she act whats she up to she looks grownup and acts very much the same shes up to opening a gift shop on market street at faiths cool stare he shrugged tired she looks tired maybe a little too thin like someone who hasnt been altogether well just lately but theres a sheen on her the kind you get from city living as for what shes up to i cant say why dont you ask her she trailed her hand over his shoulder he had such wonderful shoulders shes not likely to tell me never liked me thats not true faith i oughta know impatient she rolled off him off the bed graceful and contrary as a cat drawing deep on her cigarette while she paced the moonlight shimmered over her white skin lending it a faint and exotic blue cast he could see fading smudges on her the shadows of bruises shed wanted it rough always staring at me with those spooky eyes hardly saying boo except to hope she always had plenty to say to hope the two of them were all the time whispering together whats she want to move back into the old marsh house for whats she thinking i imagine shes thinking itd be nice to have a familiar roof over her head he rose quietly closing the curtains before one of the neighbors saw her you know what went on under that roof as well as i do faith turned back her eyes glittering when wade switched the bedside light on low what kind of person goes back to a place where they were trapped maybe shes as crazy as people used to say shes not crazy weary now wade tugged on his jeans shes lonely sometimes lonely people come back home because theres no place else that hit a little too close to the heart she turned her eyes away from his tapped out her cigarette sometimes homes the loneliest place of all he touched her hair just a light stroke it made her yearn to burrow in cling tight deliberately she lifted her head smiled brilliantly why are we talking about tory bodeen anyway lets fix ourselves some supper and eat in bed slowly her eyes on his she drew down the zipper of his jeans i always have such an appetite when im with you later he woke in the dark she was gone she never stayed never slept with him in the most simple way there were times wade wondered if she slept at all or if that internal engine of hers forever ran fueled on nerves and on needs that were never quite met it was his curse he supposed to love a woman who seemed incapable of returning genuine feelings he should cut her out of his life it was the sane thing to do shed only slice him open again and every time she did it took longer to heal sooner or later thereвђd be nothing left of his heart but scar tissue and hed have no one but himself to blame he felt the anger building a black heat that bubbled in the blood leaving the lights off he dressed in the dark his fury needed a target before it turned inward and imploded it would have been smarter more comfortable god knew more sensible to have booked a room in a hotel for the night i would have been a simple matter to have accepted her uncles hospitality and slept one of the overly fussy decoratedtodeath bedrooms boots kept ready in the big house as a child shed often dreamed of sleeping in that perfect house on that perfect street where shed imagined everything smelled o perfume and polish instead tory spread a blanket on the bare floor and lay awake in the dark pride stubbornness a need to prove her self she wasnt sure of her own motives for spending her first night in progress in the empty house of her childhood but made her bed so to speak and was deter mined to lie in it in the morning there would be a great deal to do already that evening shed gone over her lists and made a dozen more she needed to buy a bed and a phone new towels a shower curtain she needed a lamp and a table to put it on camping out wasnt quite the adventure it used to be and having simple tastes and needs didnt mean she didnt require basic comforts lying there in the dark she used her lists in much the same way she had used the sheer white wall each item mentally ticked off was another brick set in place to bloc out images and keep herself centered in the now shed go to the market and stock the kitchen if she let that go too long shed fall back into the habit of skipping meals again when she neglected her body it was more difficult to control her mind shed go to the bank open accounts personal and business a trip to the progress weekly was in order shed already designed her ad most of all while she set up the store in the next weeks she needed to be visible shed work on being friendly personable normal it would take time to weather the expected whispers the questions the stares she was prepared for it by the time she opened for business people would be used to seeing her again more much more important they would become used to seeing her as she wanted to be seen gradually shed become a fixture in town and then she would begin to explore she would ask questions shed begin to look for the answers when she had them she could say goodbye to hope closing her eyes she listened to the night sounds the chorus of peepers so cheerfully monotonous the sharp and jarring screech of an owl on the hunt the soft groans of old wood settling the occasional sly riveting of mice making themselves at home behind the wall shed have to set traps she thought sleepily she was sorry for it but she didnt care to share her space with rodents shed put mothballs under the porches to discourage snakes it was mothballs wasnt it it had been so long since shed lived in the country you put out mothballs for snakes and hung soap for deer and protected what was yours even though it had been theirs first and if the rabbits came to nibble at the kitchen garden you laid out pieces of hose so they thought it was the snakes you shooed away with the mothballs else daddyd come home and shoot them with his youd have to eat them for supper even though you got sick after because you could see how cute they were twitching their long ears you had to eat what god provided or pay the price getting sick was better than getting a beating no dont think about that she ordered herself and shifted on the hard floor no one was going to make her eat what she didnt want to eat not ever again no one was going to raise a strap to her or a fist she was in charge now she dreamed of sitting on the soft ground by a fire that snapped and smoked and burned the marshmallows she held into the flame on a stick she liked it burnt so that the outside was black and crackled over the gooey white center lifting it out she blew on the fire that came with it she singed the roof of her mouth but that was all part of the ritual the quick pain then the contrast of crisp and sweet sugar might as well eat charcoal hope said turning her own candy so that it bubbled gold now this is a perfectly toasted marshmallow i like them my way to prove it tory got another from the bag and stabbed it onto the pointy end of her stick like lilah says to each his own said the lady as she kissed the cow grinning hope nibbled delicately on her marshmallow im glad you came back tory i always wanted to i guess maybe i was afraid i guess i still am but youre here you came just like you were supposed to i didnt come that night tory looked away from the fire into the eyes of childhood i guess you werent supposed to i promised i would ten thirtyfive then i didnt i didnt even try you have to try now cause there were more and therell still be more until you stop it the weight was lowering again so that her eightyearold chest strained under it what do you mean more more like me just like me solemn blue eyes deep as pools looked through the smoke and into torys you have to do what youre supposed to do tory you have to be careful and you have to be victoria bodeen girl spy hope im not a girl anymore thats why its time the fire climbed higher grew brighter the deep blue eyes captured glints of it specks of wild light you have to stop it how but hope shook her head and whispered somethings in the dark torys eyes shot open her heart was thundering in her chest and in her mouth was the taste of fear and burnt candy somethingвђs in the dark she heard it the echo of hopes voice and the rustle like a tail of the wind through the leaves just outside her window she saw it the faint shifting of the light as someone stepped into the path of the moon the child inside her wanted to curl up to cover her face with her hands to will herself invisible she was alone defenseless whoever was outside was watching waiting even through the fear she could feel that she struggled to blank her mind to bring the face the form the name into it but there was only the sheer glass wall of terror not all the terror was hers theyre afraid too she realized afraid of me why her hand trembled as she slowly reached out for the flashlight beside the blanket the solid weight of it helped her beat back the worst of the fear she would not lie helpless she would defend herself she would confront she would take charge the child had been a victim the woman wouldnt be she swung up to her knees flicked at the switch fumbled nearly screamed when the beam flashed on she aimed it at the window like a weapon and there was nothing there but shadows and moon her breath came in pants but she got to her feet she rushed to the door slapped on the overhead lights whoever was outside could see her now let them look she thought let them see she wouldnt cower in the dark the beam of light bobbed as she hurried from the bedroom into the kitchen again she switched on the overheads let them look she thought again and grabbed a carving knife out of the wooden block shed unpacked let them look and see im not defenseless shed locked the doors a habit shed developed in the city but she was well aware how useless such a precaution was here one good kick would spring the locks she stepped out of the light into the shadows of the living room with her back to the wall she willed herself to regulate her breathing until it began to come slow and quiet she couldnt see if her thoughts were tumbling couldnt concentrate if her blood was screaming for the first time in over four years she prepared to open herself to the gift shed been cursed with at birth but lights stabbed through the front window and washed across the room her thoughts scattered wild as blown petals at the sound of a car driving fast up her lane tires sent the thin layer of gravel spitting an impatient demanding sound her breath came harsh again as she forced herself to the door she jabbed the flashlight in the pocket of the sweats shed slept in gripped the knife firmly in one hand and turned the lock the car lights clicked off as the driver yanked open the door what do you want snatching the flashlight again tory shoved at the switch what are you doing here just visiting an old friendвђќ tory aimed the beam at the figure that stepped out of the car her knees went weak her skin clammy hope she choked out the name as the knife slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor oh god another dream another episode or maybe it was just madness maybe it always had been she stepped up to the porch moonlight shimmered onto her hair into her eyes the screen door creaked as she opened it you look like youve seen a ghost or were expecting one she bent down picked up the knife with one elegant finger she tapped the tip of the blade but im real enough so saying she held up the finger and the tiny drop of blood gleamed its faith she added and simply walked in i saw your light as i was driving by faith there was a rush like the sea in her head the joy in it that frantic leap of it ebbed as she said the name again faith вђњthatвђs right got anything to drink around here she wandered into the kitchen as if she owned the place tory thought then reminded herself that the lavelles did indeed own the place she ran a hand over her face into her hair then bracing herself followed faith into the kitchen i have some iced tea i meant something with a little more punch no im sorry i dont im not exactly set up for company as yet so i see intrigued faith did a turn around the kitchen laying the knife on the counter as she passed a little more spartan than i expected even for you this was how hope would have looked if shed lived tory couldnt get the thought out of her head she would have looked just like this deep blue eyes against clear white skin hair the color of corn silk slim and beautiful and alive i dont need much that was always the difference one of them anyway between us you didnt need much i needed everything did you ever get it faith arched a brow then only smiled and leaned back on the counter oh im still collecting how does it feel to be back i havent been back long enough to know long enough to come to the door with a kitchen knife in your hand when someone pays a call im not used to calls at three in the morning i had a late date im between husbands at the moment you never did marry did you no i swear i heard something about you being engaged at one time i guess it didnt work out the sense of failure despair betrayal wanted to come no it didnt work out i take it your marriagesвђtwo of them werent thereвђdidnt work out either faith smiled and this time meant it she preferred an even match grew into your teeth i see i dont want to take a bite out of you faith and it seems pointless for you to take one out of me after all this time i lost her tooвђќ she was my sister you never could remember that she was your sister she was my only friend something tried to stir inside her but faith blocked it off you could have made new friends youre right theres nothing i can say to make up for it to change things to bring her back nothing i can say nothing i can do then why come back they never let me say goodbye its too late for goodbyes you believe in fresh starts and second chances tory yes i do i dont and ill tell you why she took a cigarette out of her purse lighted it after taking a drag she waved it nobody wants to start over those who say they do are liars or delusional but mostly liars people just want to pick up where they left off wherever things went wrong and start off in a new direction without any of the baggage those who manage it are the lucky ones because somehow theyre able to shrug off all those pesky weights like guilt and consequences she took another drag giving tory a contemplative stare you dont look all that lucky to me you know what neither do you and thats a surprise faiths mouth trembled open then she shut it again and smiled thinly oh i travel light and travel often you just ask anyone looks like weve landed in the same place why dont we make the best of it long as you remember who got here first we wont have a problem youve never let me forget it but right now this is my house and im tired then ill see you around she started out trailing smoke you sleep tight tory oh and if staying out here all alone gives you the willies id trade that knife in for a gun she stopped opened her purse and lifted out a trim pearlhandled pistol вђњa woman just cant be too careful can she with a light laugh she dropped the gun back into her bag snapped it closed then let the screen door slap behind her tory made herself stand in the doorway even when the headlights blinded her she stood there until the car reversed out of the lane swung onto the road and sped away she locked the door then went back in the kitchen for the flashlight and the knife part of her wanted to get into the car drive into town and knock on her uncles door but if she couldnt spend this first night in the house it would be that much easier to avoid the next and the next she lay with her back to the wall her eyes on the window until the dark softened and the first birds of morning woke he had been afraid when hed crept so quietly to the window hed felt what he felt so rarely a fist of fear squeezing at his gut tory bodeen back where it had all started she was sleeping curled on the floor like a gypsy and he could see the curve of her cheek the shape of her lips in the slant moonlight something would have to be done heвђd known that had begun to plan for it in quiet and steady way but what a jolt to her here to remember it all so vividly j by seeing her here hed been startled when shed woke coming out of sleep as fast and straight an arrow from a bow even in the dark h seen visions in her eyes it had brought sweat to his face to the palms of his hands but there were plenty of shadows shelter to slide into cracks in the wall hed folded himself into one of the cracks and watched faith arrive the bright gleaming in the moonlight in such an interesting contrast to torys dark tory v seemed to absorb the light rather than fleet it hed known of course in that instant when theyd stood together when their voices had mixed where they would take him where he would take them it would be as it had been the first time so long ago it would be what heвђd been trying to recapture for eighteen long years it would be perfect shed planned to be up early when a knock at the front door woke her at eight tory wasnt certain if she was more irritated with herself or the new visitor rubbing the sleep from her eyes she stumbled out of the bedroom blinked at the sunlight and fumbled with the lock she gave cade one bleary stare through the screen maybe i shouldnt be paying rent if the lavelles have decided to make this their home away from home sorry nothing she gave the screen one hearted push that wasnt entirely an invitation then turned away i need coffee i woke you he stepped in to follow her into the kitchen farmers tend to think everyones up at dawn iвђ he stopped by the halfopen door of the bedroom swore for christs sake tory you dont even have a bed im getting one today why didnt you stay with jr and boots because i didnt want to вђњyou prefer sleeping on the floor whats this he walked into the room taking over as his sister had the night before then came out holding the knife вђњitвђs my crochet hook iвђve got one hell of an afghan going when he only stared at her out a breath and stomped into i had a late night and im surly so watch your stepвђќ saying nothing he slid the knife back its slot in the block while she measured coffee and water he set the plate he carried on the counter whats that вђњlilah sent it over she knew i was coming this way this morning cade peeled up a corner of the foil coffee cake she said you had a taste for her sour cream coffee cake tory merely stared at it shocking both when her eyes filled before he could move she held up a hand kept it aloft like a shield as she turned away unable to resist he ran a hand over her hair then let it drop when she step quickly deliberately out of reach you tell her i appreciate it very much shes well is she why dont you come by and see yourself no not for a while yet i dont think a little while yet steadier she opened a cupboard and took down a cup you gonna share she glanced back over her shoulder eyes were dry now and clear he did look like a damn farmer she thought he was tanned and lean and his hair streaked from the sun his jeans were old and his shirt faded blue there were sunglasses hooked carelessly by one earpiece in the breast pocket what he looked like she decided was some hollywood directors image of a young prosperous southern farmer who could ooze charm and sex appeal with one easy smile she didnt trust images i suppose i have to be polite you could be rude and greedy he said but youd feel terrible about it later she had four cups he noted four saucers all in solid sensible white she had an automatic coffeemaker and no bed her shelves were already tidily lined again in white there wasnt a single chair in the house just what he wondered did such matters say about tory bodeen she took out another knife then lifted her eyebrows at him as she measured a slice he wagged his fingers until she widened it got an appetite this morning she asked as she cut through ive been smelling that all the way over here he picked up the plates why dont we have this out on the front porch i take my coffee black he added then walked out tory only sighed and poured two cups he was sitting on the steps when she out resting his back against the top riser she sat beside him sipping her coffee and looking out over his fields shed missed this the realization came a backward slap of surprise that was m shock than pain shed missed mornings when the heat of the day had yet to the air when the birds sang like miracles the fields lay green and growing hed had precious mornings like even as a child when she had sat on had been a cracked concrete stoop stud the coming day and dreamed fool dreams вђњitвђs a nice smile he commented is it the cake or the company that tugged it out of you it vanished like a ghost why were coming this way this morning cade i got fields to look after crews to checkвђќ he broke off a corner of coffee cake and i wanted another look at you why to see if you were as pretty as i thought you were yesterday she shook her head took a bite of cake and went straight back to miss lilahs wonderful kitchen it cheered her so much smiled again took another bite why really you did look a sight better yesterday he said conversationally but i have to take into account you didnt get much sleep on that floor you make a fine cup of coffee miz bodeen theres no reason you have to feel you need to check up on me im fine here i just need a couple of days to settle in im not going to be here half the time anyway setting up the stores going to take most of my time i imagine so have dinner with me tonight what for when he didnt answer she turned her head his eyes were amused his lips faintly curved and in that mild and friendly expression she saw something shed successfully avoided for years frank male interest no no oh no she lifted her cup gulped down coffee that was pretty definite lets make it tomorrow night no cade im sure thats very flattering but i dont have the time or the inclination for any sort of a of a thing he stretched out his long legs crossed them at the ankles we dont know what sort of a thing either of us has in mind at this stage me i enjoy a meal now and again and find i enjoy one more in good company i dont date is that a religious obligation or a societal preference its a personal choice now because he looked to be settling in entirely too comfortably she got to her feet im sorry but i have to get started on my day im already behind schedule he rose watched her eyes go wide and watchful when he shifted just an inch closer somebody roughed you up plenty didnt they вђњdonвђtвђќ thats just the point tory because he didnt care to have her flinch away from him he eased back i wouldnt thanks for the coffee he walked to his truck pausing to turn back when hed opened the door he gave her a good long stare figuring it would do them both good for her to get used to it i was wrong he called out as he climbed in the cab youre just as pretty today she smiled before she could help herself watched him grin before he backed out of the lane alone she sat back down oh hell she muttered and stuffed more cake into her mouth independent smalltown banks were a dying breed tory knew this because her uncle whod managed progress bank and trust for twelve years rarely failed to mention it even without the family connection she would have chosen it for her business it was just good politics it sat on the east side of market two blocks down from her shop that added convenience the old redbrick building had been carefully and lovingly preserved that added charm the lavelles had established it in and maintained a proprietary interest there she thought as she turned toward the front door was the politics if you wanted to do business successfully in progress south carolina you did business with the lavelles it was a rare pie their fingers werent dipped in the interior of the bank had changed she could remember visiting with her grandmother and thinking the tellers worked in cages like exotic animals in the zoo now the lobby area was open almost airy and four tellers manned a long high counter theyd added a drivethrough window in the back and behind a waisthigh wooden rail and gate two employees sat at lovely old desks topped with sharp and efficient looking computers there were several nicely executed paintings of south carolinian land and seascapes adorning the walls someone she mused had figured out how to modernize without deleting the soul she wondered if she could gently nudge uncle into one of the paintings or wall hangings shed soon have for sale tory bodeen is that you with a little jolt tory turned her attention to the woman behind the rail she worked up a smile as she tried to place the face and came up blank yes hello well its just so nice to see you again and all grownup too the woman was tiny could barely have topped five feet she came through the gate held out both hands always knew youd be a pretty thing you wont remember me it felt so rude not to in the face of such sincere delight for a moment tory tempted to use the connection grab on to a name but she couldnt break a vow over something so trivial im sorry now theres no need for that you were just a bit of a thing last i saw you im betsy gluck your grandma trained me when i was just out of high school i remember how you used to come in now and again and sit quiet as a mouse you gave me lollipops it was such a relief to remember to have that quick sweet taste of cherry on her tongue why imagine you remembering that after all this time betsys green eyes sparkled as she gave torys hands a squeeze now youre here to see jr if hes busy i can justвђ dont be silly ive got instructions to take you straight into his office she wrapped an arm around torys waist as she led her through the gate shed have to get used to this tory reminded herself to being touched handled she couldnt be a stranger here it must be so exciting opening a store all your own i just cant wait to come shopping i bet miz mooneys just so proud she could pop betsy rapped on a door at the end of a short hall вђњjr your niece is here to see you the door swung open and jr mooney filled it the size of him always astonished tory how this big brawny man had come from her grandmother was one of lifes mysteries there she is his voice was as big as the rest of him and boomed out as he made his grab tory was braced for it and still lost he breath when he scooped her off her feet into his wild grizzly hug and as always the surprise came as her toes left the ground that the ribcracking embrace made her laugh uncle jimmy tory pressed her face into his bulls neck and finally finally felt home jr youre going to snap that girl like twig shes little jr winked at betsy вђњbut shes wiry you make sure we got us a few minutes quiet in here wont you betsy dont you worry welcome home tory betsy added and closed the door here now you sit down want anything cocacola no nothing im fineвђќ she didnt sit but lifted her hands then dropped them i should have come to see you yesterday dont you fret about that youre now he leaned back on his desk a man of sixtwo and a muscled twofifty his ginger colored hair hadnt faded with age but there were thin wires of silver wove through the mass of it the brush mustache that added a bit of dash to his round face had grown in pure silver as had his wooly caterpillar eyebrows his eyes were more blue than gray and had always seemed as kind to tory abruptly he grinned big as the moon вђњgirl you look like city just as pretty and polished as a tv star boots is gonna love showing you off he laughed at torys automatic wince oh now youll indulge her a bit wont you she never did have that daughter she pined for and wade just wont cooperate and get married to give her little granddaughters to dress up she tries to put a lace pinafore on me were going to have trouble ill go see her uncle jimmy i need

lissy frazier hold the record for biggest mouth in progress these days she runs neck and neck with a few others now i dont mean to crowd you or anything like that but cade lavelle wouldnвђt hold you

got eyes i can see that youve been on your own some years now but i cant say as i like the idea of you living out there not in that house i dont see how it can be good for you good or not it feels necessary he beat me in that house when jr closed his eyes tory stepped closer uncle jimmy i dont say that to hurt you i shouldve done something about it i shouldnвђve got you out of there away from him shouldve got you both out mama wouldnt go she spoke gently now because he seemed to need it you know that i didnt know how bad it was not then i didnt look hard enough but i know now and i dont like to think about you being out there remembering all that i remember it wherever i am staying there well that proves to me i can face it i can live with it im not afraid of him anymore i wont let myself be why dont you come on to the house just for a few days then see how you settle he only sighed when she shook her head its my plight to be surrounded by stubborn women well sit down so i can do this paperwork and take your money at noon the bells of the baptist church chimed the hour tory stepped back wiped the sweat off her face her display window sparkled like a diamond shed carted boxes in from her car and stacked them in the storeroom shed measured for shelving for counters and made a list of demands and requirements she intended to take down to the realtor she was working on the second list one she would take to the hardware store when someone tapped on the cracked glass of the shop door she studied the spare man in workmans clothes as she approached dark hair well cut a smooth handsome face with an easy crooked smile sunglasses hid his eyes im sorry im not open she said as she opened the door looks like you could use a carpenter he tapped his finger at the crack again and a glass man hows it going tory he took off his sunglasses revealing dark intense eyes and a tiny hookshaped scar just under the right one dwight frazier i didnt recognize you few inches taller several pounds lighter than the last time you saw me thought i should come by welcome you as mayor and shift hats to see if theres anything frazier construction can do for you mind if i come in a minute oh sure she stepped back nothing much to see just now its a good space he moved well she noted not at all like the awkward chubby boy hed been the braces were gone and so was the ruthless buzz cut his father had insisted on he looked fit and he looked prosperous no she thought she wouldnt have recognized him its a solid building he continued with a strong foundation and the sound he turned back flashing the smile that had helped his orthodontist buy a cabin cruiser i should know we put it on two years back then ill know who to come after if it leaks he laughed and hooked his sunglasses in the collar of his tshirt frazier builds to last youre going to want counters shelves displays yes i was just measuring i can send you a good carpenter at a fair rate it was smart and again political to use local labor if she thought local labor met her budget well your idea of a fair rate and mine might not connect his grin was lightning and full of charm tell you what let me get some things out of my truck you can tell me what youve got in mind and ill give you an estimate well see if we can make them connect he was aware she was measuring him even as he measured her walls he was used to it as a boy his father had measured him and had forever found him just short of the mark dwight frazier exmarine avid hunter town councilman and founder of frazier construction had high standards for the fruit of his loins his disappointment when that fruit had turned out undersized and soft had been keen young dwight junior had never been allowed to forget it the truth was dwight mused as he scribbled numbers on his clipboard he had been short of the mark short fat clumsy hed been a prime candidate for jokes and sneers and his fathers tightlipped disappointment worse hed had a brain as a boy there was no more deadly combination than a pudgy body clumsy feet and a sharp brain hed been the darling of his teachers which meant he might as well have painted a kick my ass sign on his back his mother had struggled to make up for it the best way she knew how by shoving food in his face there was nothing like a box of ho hos in his dear mamas thinking to make all right with the world again his salvation had been cade and wade why theyd befriended him had never made full sense to dwight class had been part of it they had come from three of the towns most prominent families for that he had been and continued to be grateful perhaps there was still a tiny splinter of resentment in his gut over the whims of fate that had made those two tall handsome and agile while hed been plump plain and awkward but hed made up for it in spades i started running when i was fourteen he said it casually as he drew out his measuring tape again excuse me youre wondering he crouched noted on his pad again got sick of being the fat kid and decided to do something about it took off twelve pounds of blubber in a couple of months first few times i ran i did it at night when no one could see me i got sick as three dogs stopped eating the cupcakes and candy bars and chips my mother packed in my lunch every day thought id starve to death he rose flashed his grin again first year of high school i started going out to the track at night running there i was still overweight still slow but i didnt puke up dinner anymore seems that coach heister used to come out there at night too in his chevy sedan in the company of another mans wife i wont mention who as the lady remains married and is the proud grandmother of three now hold this end for me sugar fascinated tory took the end of the measuring tape as dwight walked backward to span the projected counter area now it so happened that on one of our mutual visits to the progress high school track i got an eyeful of the coach and the future grandmother of three it was you can imagine a rather awkward moment for all parties involved to say the least and the least said the better which is what coach suggested to me as he clamped his hands around my throat i had to agree however being a fair man or perhaps just a suspicious one he offered me a token in return if i continued to train and could take off another ten pounds hed give me a place on the track team come spring this was our tacit agreement that i would forget the incident and that he would refrain from killing me and burying my body in a shallow grave seemed to work for everyone sure worked for me i took off the weight and shocked everyone including myself by not only making the team but blowing the competition to hell in the fifty and hundredyard dash i was a hell of a sprinter it turned out i won the all star trophy three years running and the love of pretty lissy harlowe she warmed to him one outsider to another thats a nice story happy endings i think i can help you get your own here in your shop why dont i buy you lunch and well talk about it i dontвђ she broke off as the door opened behind her dont tell me youre hiring this twobit hustler wade strolled in swung an arm around torys shoulder thank god i got here in time this puppy doctor here doesnt know a damn thing about building go give a poodle an enema wade im about to take your pretty cousin and my potential client to lunch then ill just have to come along and protect her interests i need shelves more than i need a sand ill see you get both dwight winked at her come on sugar and bring this dead weight along with you she took thirty minutes and enjoyed herself more than shed expected it was a pleasure to see the adult friendship between dwight and wade that had its roots in the boys she remembered it made her miss hope it was easy enough for a woman who was rarely comfortable around men to relax when one was her cousin and the other tidily married so tidily dwight was showing off pictures of his son before the sandwiches were served tory would have made the appropriate and expected noises in any case but the truth was the little boy was seriously adorable with lissys pretty face and dwights snapping eyes and she decided as she headed off to do errands it had been constructive as well as easy not only did dwight understand what she wanted but he improved on her basic layout and the estimate slipped comfortably into her budget or did after she wheedled refused questioned and pushed and wiping imaginary sweat from his brow he promised the work would be done before the middle of may satisfied she went out and bought a bed she really meant to pick up just the mattress and box spring years of frugality had never permitted her to impulse buy and it was rare very rare for her to experience the deepseated desire to own something the minute she saw it she was hooked she walked away from it twice and back again the price wasnt out of line but she didnt need a lovely classic iron bed with slim smooth posts to frame both head and foot of the mattress yes it was practical but it wasnt necessary a sturdy bed frame and a good solid mattress set that was all she required all she was going to do was sleep in it for goodness sake she argued with herself even as she pulled out her credit card as she drove to the loading dock as she drove home then she was too busy hauling and cursing and tugging to waste time arguing standing between rows of newly cultivated cotton cade watched her struggle for ten minutes then he did some cursing of his own marched to his truck and drove down to her lane he didnt slam the door after he climbed out but he wanted to you forgot your magic bracelets she was out of breath some stray wisps of hair had escaped her braid and were plastered to her face but she had the huge and heavy box halfway up the porch steps she straightened tried not to pant what you cant be wonder woman without your magic bracelets ill get this end i dont need any help stop being an ass and get the door she stomped over yanked the door open are you always here he took off his sunglasses tossed them aside it was a habit that cost him a pair on the average of two a month you see that field over there its mine now move aside while i get this up there what the hell kind of bed is this iron she said with some satisfaction when she noted he had to put his back into it figures we need to angle it up through the door i knew that she planted her feet crouched and took the weight of her end there was a lot of muttering a great deal of finessing and a scraped knuckle on her end but they got it through she continued to walk backward forced to trust him as he directed her right or left until they muscled it into the bedroom thank you her arms felt like rubber i can manage from here got any tools of course i have tools good get them itll save me from going for mine might as well set this up before we bring the rest in in one irritable gesture she pushed her sweaty hair back i can do it and youre almost contrary enough for me to let you i am trapped by my superior breeding he took her hand examined the broken skin and kissed it lightly before she could snatch it free you can put something on that while i do this she considered insulting him ordering him out even kicking him out and decided every option was a waste of time she got the tools he admired the seriously efficient black toolbox arent you just prepared for everything you probably dont know pliers from a wrench obviously amused he pulled out a pair of needlenose pliers scissors right when the breath she huffed out ended on a laugh he got to work on the heavyduty staples plugged into the box go put something on that knuckle its all right he didnt bother to look at her or change the tone of his voice but there was the light and tempered steel of command put something on it then why dont you go fix us something cold to drink look cade im not the little woman he glanced up now measured her with one cool look youre little and youre a woman and ive got the scissors i dont suppose my suggesting just where you might shove those pliers would wipe that smile off your face i dont suppose telling you youre sexy when youre frazzled would convince you to christen this bed with me once we set it up jesus was all she said as she strode out of the room she left him alone she could hear the clatter and the occasional oath as she hauled in groceries put them away brewed tea he had long hands she mused elegant pianists fingers that contrasted with the hard calloused palms she was sure he knew how to plant and tend and harvest hed been raised to do so but everyday chores no that was a different matter since she didnt expect hed put together a single bed frame in his own privileged life she imagined shed walk in on complete chaos and she was determined to give him plenty of time to make a mess of things she hooked up her new kitchen phone put away her new dishcloths and lazily sliced lemons for the tea satisfied hed had enough time to mortify himself she poured two glasses over ice and strolled into the bedroom with them he was just turning the last bolt her eyes lit up and the quick little sound she made was one of sheer feminine delight oh its wonderful its really wonderful i knew it would be without thinking she shoved the glasses into his hands so she could run hers over the iron his first reaction was amusement then a cool satisfaction just as he started to sip the tea she stepped into the center of the frame and ran her fingertips up the iron rungs and his reaction turned to sheer lust so basic so strong he took one deliberate step in retreat he could imagine perfectly wrapping her fingers around those posts holding them there as he thrust into her one hard long stroke after another while those longlidded witch eyes of hers went to smoke its sturdy she gave the headboard a little shake and his stomach pitched and knotted damn well better be you did a good job and i was rude thank you and im sorry youre welcome and forget it he handed her the glass then reached up to tug the chain of the ceiling fan its warm in here he wanted to bite that spot just under her left ear where her jaw began its curve because his voice was clipped she suffered another pang of guilt i really was rude cade im not very good with people not good with people and youre going to open a shop where youll deal with them every day thats customers she said im very good with customers im positively gracious with customers so he moved in until he stood just on the other side of the frame if i buy something from you youll be friendly she didnt have to read his thoughts when she could read his eyes not that friendly nimbly she sidestepped him and moved out of the room i could be a very good customer youre trying to frazzle me again i am frazzling you again tory he laid a hand on her shoulder stop that he said mildly when she stiffened he set his glass on the floor then turned her to face him there that didnt hurt a bit did it he had gentle hands it had been a long time a very long time since shed felt a gentle touch from a man im not interested in flirtations i am but we can compromise for now lets try to be friends im not a good friend i am now why dont we get the rest of your bed in here so you can get a decent nights sleep tonight she let him get nearly to the door shed told herself she wouldnt speak of it not to him not to anyone until she was ready until she was strong and she was sure but it was bubbling up inside her cade you never asked not then not now youve never once asked how i knew her palms went damp as he turned so she clutched them to her elbows youve never asked how i knew where to find her how i knew what had happened i didnt have to ask her words rushed out now popping like overwound springs some people think i was with her even though i said i wasnt that i ran away and left her that i just left herвђ thats not what i think and the ones who believed me believed that i saw the way i said i did they stepped back from me kept their children away from me they stopped looking me in the eye i looked you in the eye tory then and now she had to take a breath to settle herself why if you can believe i have that inside me why didnt you step back why are you coming around here now do you expect me to tell you the future because i cant or give you some stock tips because i wont her face was flushed he noted her eyes dark and alive with ripe and ready emotions one of those emotions one that prickled through the surface of all the others was anger he wouldnt play to it or to what he believed were her expectations i prefer living each day as it comes thanks all the same and ive got broker to take care of my portfolio did it ever occur to you that im coming around here now because i like the look of you no then you are the first and only female without vanity ive had occasion to meet wouldnt hurt to get yourself some now he cocked his head do you want to get this mattress in here or astound and amaze me by telling me what i had for lunch this afternoon her mouth opened as he walked out the door had he actually made a joke about it people made fun of her or rolled their eyes or backed cautiously away some came begging for her to solve all their problems and unhappiness but no one in her experience made a casual joke she rolled the tension out of her shoulders then walked outside to help him carry in the mattress they worked in silence now her stewing and his mind elsewhere when the bed was in place cade polished off his tea took the glass into the kitchen then headed out you should be able to handle it from here im a bit behind schedule oh no you dont she thought and rushed after him i appreciate the help i really do whether it was impulse or annoyance she followed it and wrapped her fingers around his arm until he stopped and glanced down well then you just think of me when youre sliding off to dreamland tonight i know it cost you some time oh you said something about lunch baffled he shook his head lunch it was just enough yes your lunch today half a ham sandwich with swiss and brown mustard you gave the other half to that skinny black dog who comes begging the fields when he sees you she smiled now stepped away you ought to be ready for supper soon he pondered a minute then decided to go with instinct tory why dont you come back here and tell me what im thinking now she felt something like a laugh rumble her chest i believe ill just let you keep that to yourself she let the screen door slam behind her it was the flowers margaret always thought that kept her sane when she tended her flowers they never talked back never told her she didnt understand never yanked up their roots and stalked away in a huff she could prune away the wild parts those sudden growth sprigs that thought they could go their own way until the plant was shaped as she intended for it to be shaped shed have been much better off she imagined if shed stayed a spinster and had raised peonies instead of children children broke hearts just by being children but marriage had been expected of her she had done for as long as she could remember what had been expected of her occasionally she did a little more but rarely very rarely did she do less and she had loved her husband for surely that had been expected as well jasper lavelle had been a handsome young man when hed come courting her oh and hed had charm as well the same slow sly grin she sometimes saw cruise across the face of the son theyd made together hed had a temper but that had been exciting shed been young enough to things exciting she recognized that same temper the quick flash of it in he daughter the daughter whod lived hed been big and strong a dramatic kind of man with a loud laugh and hard hands perhaps that was why she saw so much of him and so little of herself in children who had been left to them it angered her when she took stock how vague and blurred her imprint was on the clay of those lives shed helped create she had opted sensibly she was sure to concentrate on leaving her mark on beaux reve instead there her touch her vision ran deep as the roots of the old oaks that lined the drive and that more than son or daughter had become her pride if hope had lived it would have been different she snipped off the faded head of dianthus without sentiment or regret for the loss of the once fragrant bloom if hope had lived she would have reflected and realized all the hopes and dreams a mother instilled in a daughter she would have given a new luster to the polish of the lavelle name jasper would have stayed steady and never have disgraced himself with loose women and casual scandal he would never have strayed from the path they had both started on and left his wife to rub the smudges from the name they shared but in the end jasper had been a storm and when he hadnt been crashing hed been brewing life with him had been a series of events she supposed his last had been the poor taste to suffer a fatal heart attack in the bed of his mistress the fact that the woman had had the sense and the dignity to step back while the incident was hushed up sat in margarets craw like a jagged bone still all said and done it was so much easier to be his widow than it had been to be his wife she couldnt say why he was so much on her mind just now on this blissfully cool morning when the dew lay wet kisses on her blossoms and the sky was the soft and gentle blue of spring hed been a good husband for the first stage of their marriage hed been a strong and solid provider a man whod made the decisions so she didnt have to mind the details hed been an attentive father if perhaps a mite too indulgent the passion between them had quieted by the first anniversary of their wedding night but passion was a difficult and distracting element in a life such a demanding and unstable emotion not that shed ever refused him of course never once since their wedding night had she turned from him in their bed margaret was proud of that proud shed been a good and dutiful wife even when the idea of sex sickened her hadnt she lain silent and allowed him his release she clipped off more deadheads with a sharp clack of blades placed the faded flowers in her discard basket it was he who had turned away he who had changed nothing had been the same in their marriage in their lives in their home since that terrible morning that hot sticky august morning when theyd found their hope in the marsh sweet goodnatured hope she thought with a grief that had become both duller and more heavy through the years hope her bright little angel the only one of the children whod come from her who had seemed truly connected truly hers there were times after all these years there were still times she wondered if that loss had been a kind of punishment the taking away of the child shed loved most but what crime what sin had she committed that had merited that kind of punishment indulgence perhaps indulging the little girl when it would have been wiserвђit was so easy to be wise with distanceвђto have discouraged even to have forbade her sweet innocent hope from associating with the bodeen girl that had been a mistake but surely not a sin and if it had been a sin it had been more jaspers hed brushed away her concerns when shed voiced them even laughed at them the bodeen girl was harmless thats what hed said harmless jasper had paid for that misconception that mistake that sin the whole rest of his life and still it wasnt enough it would never be enough the bodeen girl had killed hope as surely as if shed choked the life from her with her own small and dirty hands now she was back back to progress back to the marsh house back to their lives as if she had the right margaret yanked out some bindweed tossed it into her basket her grandmother had liked to say that weeds were just wildflowers that bloomed in the wrong place but they werent they were invaders and needed to be pulled out cut down destroyed however it could be done victoria bodeen could not be allowed to set roots and bloom in progress she looked so pretty cade mused his mother that admirable and unreachable woman she dressed for gardening as s dressed for everything with care precise and perfection she wore a widebrimmed straw hat shade her head the ribbon around it a soft blue to match the long cotton skirt and crisp blouse she protected with a dull gray gardening apron there were pearls at her ears round moons of white as luminous as the gardenias she so treasured shed let her hair go white as well thou she was only fiftythree it was as if she wanted that symbol of age and dignity her skin was smooth worry never seemed show on it the contrast of that pretty youthful face and the shock of white hair was striking shed kept her figure she sculpted ruthlessly with diet and exercise unwanted pounds werent tolerated any more than a stray weed in her gardens shed been a widow eight years now a had slid so slickly into that slot it was hard to remember her being otherwise he knew she was displeased with him but that was nothing new her displeasure was most usually expressed in the same way as her approval with a few cool words he couldnt remember the last time she touched him with feeling or with warmth he couldnвђt remember if he had ever expected her to do so but she remained his mother and he would do what he could to close the rift between them he knew too well how a rift could widen into a gulf with silence a small yellow butterfly flitted around her head and was ignored she knew it was there just as she knew he walked to her with long strides along the bricked path but she acknowledged neither its a nice morning for being outside cade began springs been good to the flowers we could use some rain theyre calling for some tonight and none too soon aprils been drier than i like he crouched down leaving an arm span between them nearby bees hummed madly in the hills of azaleas most of the cultivatingвђs done ive got to go round and check on how the cattles doing weve got some bull calves ready to become steers ive got some errands here and there is there anything i can pick up for you i could use some weed killer she lifted her head then her eyes were a paler quieter blue than his own but they were just as direct unless you have some moral objection to my using it in my gardens theyre your gardens mama and your fields as i have been reminded youвђll deal with them as you choose just as the properties are your properties youll rent them to whom you please thats right he could be as cool as she when he chose and the income from those fields and those properties will keep beaux reves in the black well into it as long as its in my hands she pinched off a pansy with quick ruthless fingers income is not the standard by which one lives ones life it sure as hell makes life easier there is no call to take that tone with me i beg your pardon i thought there was he set his hands on his knees waited for them to relax i changed the way the farms run started changing it over five years back and it works still you refuse to accept or acknowledge that ive made it work theres nothing i can do about that as for the properties i do that my own way as well papas way isnt mine do you think he would have let that bodeen girl set foot on what was ours i dont know or care she said and went back to her weeding maybe not he looked away i canвђt live my life asking myself what he wouldвђve done or wanted or expected but i do know tory bodeen isnt responsible for what happened eighteen years ago youre wrong well one of us is he got to his feet either way shes here has a right to be here theres nothing to be done about it they would see margaret thought as her son left her alone they would see what could be done about it his mood stayed raw throughout the day no matter how many times he tried and failed to reach his mother he felt the sting of that rejection as fresh as the first hed stopped trying to explain and justify his changes to the farm he still remembered the night hed shown her charts and graphs and projections still remembered how shed stared at him had stonily informed him before shed walked away that beaux reves was something that couldnt be put on paper and analyzed it had hurt more he supposed because shed been right it couldnt be put on paper neither could the land itself that he was so determined to protect preserve and pass on to the next generation of lavelles his pride in it his duty to it were no less fierce than hers but to cade it was had always been a living thing that breathed and grew and changed with the seasons and to her it was static like a monument carefully tended or a grave he tolerated her lack of belief in him just as he tolerated the amusement and the resentment of his neighbors hed dealt with countless sleepless nights during the first three years hed been in charge of the farm the fear and worry that he was wrong that he would fail that the legacy that had come into his hands would somehow slip through them in his eagerness in the sheer stubbornness to do things his way but he hadnt been wrong not about the farm yes it cost more in time effort and money to grow cotton organically but the landвђoh the land thrived he could see it bursting in the summer resting in the winter and in spring thirsty for what he would put into it he refused to poison it no matter how many told him that by that refusal he was dooming earth and crop theyd called him wrongheaded stubborn foolish and worse and the first year hed met government standards for organic cotton had harvested and sold his crop hed celebrated by getting quietly drunk alone in the tower office that had been his fathers he bought more cattle because he believed in diversification he added on more horses because he loved them and because both horses and cattle made manure he believed in the strength and value of green cotton he studied he experimented he learned he stood by his beliefs enough to handchop weeds when it was necessary and to nurse his blisters without complaint he watched the skies and the stock reports with equal devotion and he plowed the profits back into the land just as he plowed the cotton after harvest other areas of the operation were necessary the leases and rentals and factories he used them worked them juggled them but they didnt own his heart the land did he couldnt explain it and had never tried but he loved beaux reves the way some men love a woman completely obsessively jealously every year his blood thrilled when it gave birth for him cool morning had become steamy afternoon by the time he finished the bulk of his chores and errands he carried the list in his head ticking them off systematically he stopped by the nursery two blocks off the town square to pick up his mothers weed killer the flats of flowers distracted him he selected a tray of pink rosebud impatiens on impulse and carried them inside the clampetts had run the nursery for ten years starting it as a roadside operation to supplement their soybean farm over the decade theyd done better with flowers than crop the more successful the nursery the bigger the burr that lodged in the craw of the clampett men get another one of them for twenty percent off billy clampett puffed on camel directly under the no smoking sign his mother had tacked to the wall charge me for two then ill pick the other up on the way outвђќ cade set the flat on the counter hed gone to school with billy though theyd never really been friends hows it going slow but sure billy squinted through smoke his eyes were dark and discontented he wore his hair in a vicious buzz cut that looked sharp as needles to the touch and was no particular color at all hed put on weight since high school or more accurately had lost the muscle that had made him a star tackle you gonna plant those as another cover cropвђќ no unwilling to get into a pissing match cade wandered over to study a collection of pots he picked two in a verdigris shade set them on the counter вђњi need some roundupвђќ billy pinched off the cigarette dropped the butt into the bottle he kept under the counter he knew better than to leave evidence his ma would find and scald him over вђњwell now didnвђt think you approved of such things whend you stop hugging trees and a bag of potting soil for the impatiens cade said easily might could get you some aldicarb too you in the market for insecticide no thanks no thats right billy gave a wheezy laugh you dont go for insecticides and pesticides and that nasty chemical fertilizer your crops theyre virgin pure got yourself wrote up in a magazine cause of it when did you start reading cade said pleasantly or did you just look at the pictures fancy magazines and speeches dont mean squat around here everybody knows you just sit back and take the benefits from the expense your neighbors put into their fields is that so yeah thats so billy lashed out youve had a couple of good years just dumbass luck if you ask me i dont recall asking you billy you want to ring me up here sooner or later its going to cave in on you youre just inviting pest and disease it had been a long boring day and cade lavelle was one of billys favorite targets the pussy never fought back your crops get infected others will too then therell be hell to pay ill keep that in mind cade took some bills from his wallet tossed them on the counter вђњiвђll just carry this out to the truck while you ring it up he kept a choke chain on his temper much as he would a vicious dog unleashed it was a cold and savage thing billy clampett wasnt worth the time and the effort it would take to yank it back in line once it was loose thats what he told himself as he set the pots and the two flats in the truck when he came back the roundup and a twentypound bag of potting soil were on the counter you got three dollars and six cents coming with deliberate slowness billy counted out the change saw that sister of yours a time or two round town she sure looks good these days he raised his eyes smiled real good cade shoved the change in his pocket kept his fist in there as it wanted to plant itself on that sneering mouth hows your wife these days billy darlene shes just fine pregnant again third time i expect i planted another strong son in her when i plow a field or a woman i do it right his eyes glinted as his smile spread just ask your sister cades hand was out of his pocket and yanking billy to his toes by the collar before either of them was prepared for it just one thing cade said softly you want to remember who holds the deed on that house youre living in you want to remember that billy and you want to stay clear of my sister you wave your money around fast enough but you havent got the balls to try your fists like a man stay clear of my sister cade repeated or youll find out just what ive got the balls for cade released him picked up the rest of his purchases and strode out he drove out of the lot and to the first stop sigh there he simply sat eyes closed until the red wash of fury dulled he wasnвђt sure which was worse all but coming to blows with clampett while the two of them were surrounded by posies or having the seed rooting in this mind that his sister had let scum like clampett put his hands on her shoving the truck into first he turned and headed over to market he found spot half a block from torys shop just behind dwights truck doing his best to smother his temper he hauled the pots out carried them down to set them outside the door he could hear the high whine of a skill saw before he walked inside the base of the counters was in place and the first line of shelves set sheвђd gone with pine and had them clearvarnished a smart choice cade thought simple and clean theyd show off her wares instead of distracting from them the floor was covered with tarp and tools and the air of sawdust and smelled sweat hey cade dwight walked over skirting tools cade gave dwightвђs blue and gold striped tie a tap now arent you pretty had a meeting bunch of bankers as if just remembering it was over dwight reached up and loosened the knot in the tie just came by to check on the job before i go into the office youre making progress the client has definite ideas about what she wants and when she wants it dwight rolled his eyes were here to accommodate and let me tell you she dont give you an inch of wiggle room that skinny little girl grew up to be one hardheaded businesswoman where is she in the back dwight nodded toward the closed door stays out of the way ill give her that stays out once she gets her way is more like it cade took another moment to scan the workinprogress her way looks good he decided gotta admit it does listen cade dwight shifted his feet lissys got this friend no well jesus just hear me out i dont have to shes got a friend a single female friend whod be just perfect for me why dont i give this single female friend a call or come on by and have dinner with this single female friend and yвђall at the house or meet for drinks well

laughter rolled up from the gut thatll work just fine way things are shell just start lining up men for you god almighty it wasnt cade realized out of the realm of possibility then tell her im having a blazing backstreet affair with someone who pick somebody cade said waving it off and heading for the backroom door just tell her no he knocked then shoved inside without waiting for an answer tory stood on a stepladder replacing a fluorescent tube in the overhead light fixture here let me do that ive got it this is a tenants obligation not the landlords it still grated just a little to realize he owned the building i see they got the glass replaced on the front door yes thank you feels like they fixed the airconditioning thats right if you need to be pissed off at me today youre going to have to get in line theres quite a wait he turned away hands in pockets shed gone for metal shelves in here he noted gray ugly sturdy and practical they were already jammed with cardboard boxes and the boxes meticulously labeled by stock number shed bought a desk again sturdy and practical a computer and a phone were already on it as was a neatly stacked pile of paperwork in ten days shed organized considerably not once had she asked for or accepted his help he wished it didnt irk him she was wearing black shorts a gray tshirt and gray sneakers he wished they didnt appeal to him he turned back as she came down the ladder took hold of it to fold up just as she did ill put it away for you i can do it he tugged so did she goddamn it tory the sudden hiss of temper the dangerous flash in his eyes had her stepping back clasping her hands he slapped the ladder together shoved it into a small closet when he just stood there his back to her she felt a pang of guilt and of sympathy it was odd to realize she didnt feel fear or trepidation as she usually did around angry men sit down cade why because you look like you need to she walked over to where shed hauled in a minifridge found a bottle of coke twisted the top here cool off thanks he dropped down on the chair at her desk took a long swig from the bottle bad day ive had a score of better ones saying nothing she opened her purse and found the cloisonne pillbox where she kept aspirin when she offered him two he lifted his brows she felt heat rise fast and dark to her cheeks i didnt it just shows thats all appreciate it he popped the aspirin sighed rolled his shoulders i dont suppose youd be willing to make it some better by coming over here and sitting on my lap no i wouldnt had to ask how about dinner and a movie no dont say no without even thinking about it he said before she could speak just dinner and a movie hell a pizza a burger something friendly i promise not to ask you to marry me thats a relief but not much of an incentive just think about it for five minutes he set the bottle on her desk then rose come on outside i got something for you i havent finished in here woman do you have to argue about every damn thing it wears me out to solve the problem he took her hand pulled her to the door and through she might have taken a stand just on principle but there were two carpenters in the shop which meant two sets of eyes and ears there would be less for them to talk about if she calmly stepped outside with cade i liked the look of these he began gesturing toward the pots while he continued to pull her down the sidewalk to his truck if you dont you can exchange them at clampetts same goes for these i suppose he stopped took one flat out of the truck bed but i think they suit well enough suit what you your place consider them a kind of good luck gift even though you have to pot them yourself he pushed the first flat into her hand took out the second and the bag of soil she stood there baffled and touched shed wanted flowers she remembered flowers in pots for the front of the shop shed thought of petunias but these were prettier and every bit as friendly this was kind of you and thoughtful thank you could you look at me he waited until she shifted her gaze met his eyes youre welcome where do you want them well just set them out front ill pot them as they started up the sidewalk together she gave him one sidelong glance oh hell you could come by around six i wouldnt mind the pizza if we get through that all right we can talk about the movie fine he set the flowers and soil down in front of her display window ill be back yes i know she murmured when he strolled off maybe people didnt actually die of boredom faith decided but she didnt know how the hell they lived with it either when shed been a child and complained she had nothing to do the words had fallen on unsympathetic adult ears and chores had been assigned shed hated chores nearly as much as shed hated boredom but some lessons are hardlearned theres nothing to do around here faith lounged at the kitchen table picking at a breakfast biscuit it was after eleven but she hadnt bothered to dress she wore the silk robe shed bought on a trip to savannah in april she was already bored with that too everythings the same around here day after day month after month i swear its a wonder every blessed one of us doesnt run screaming into the night got yourself a case of ennui do you miss faith lilahs roughassandstone voice cruised over the french pronunciation she used it partly because her grandmother had been creole but mostly because it just tickled her nothing ever happens around here every mornings the same as the one before and the whole day stretches out in a long thin line of more nothing lilah continued to scrub at the counter the truth was shed had the kitchen tidied up for more than an hour but shed known faith would wander in shed been lying in wait i guess youre hankering for some activity she sent faith a soft look out of guileless brown eyes as guile was something lilah had in spades this look had taken some practice but she knew her target shed looked after miss faith since the day the girl had been bornвђborn lilah recalled with some affection wailing and waving bunched fists at the world lilah herself had been part of the lavelle household since her own twentieth year when shed been hired on to help with the cleaning while mrs lavelle had been carrying mr cade her hair had been black then instead of the saltandpepper it was now her hips had been a mite more narrow but she hadnt let herself go shed matured she liked to think into a fine figure of a woman her skin was the color of the dark caramels she melted to coat apples every halloween she liked to set it off with a good strong red lipstick and carried a tube in her apron pocket shed never married not that she hadnt had the opportunity lilah jackson had had plenty of beaux in her day and since her day was far from over she still enjoyed getting herself gussied up to go on the town with a goodlooking man but marrying one well that was a different kettle she preferred things just as they were and that meant having a man come calling at the door and escorting her where she liked to go if he expected to escort her again hed best remember to bring along a nice box of chocolates or some posies and open doors for her like a gentleman marry one and you spent your life picking up after him watching him fart and scratch and god knew what while you sweated to make the paycheck stretch to keep body and soul together and buy a few pretty things of your own no this way she had a fine houseвђas tell the truth and shame the devil beaux reves was as much hers as anyones shed raised three babies and grieved her heart sick over the lost one and had to her way of thinking all the benefits of male companions without any of the problems she didnt mind a good snuggle now and again either if the good lord hadnt meant for his children to snuggle he wouldnt have put the need for it inside them now miss faith she mused was just packed full of needs and had yet to figure out how to meet them without causing herself grief that meant the girl was equally full of problems most of her own making some chicks lilah knew just took longer to find their way around the barnyard maybe you could take yourself a nice long drive lilah suggested to where faith sipped her coffee without interest everything looks the same any direction lilah took out her lipstick touched it up in the chrome reflection of the toaster i know what perks me up when i got the blues a good spurt of shopping i suppose faith sighed and toyed with the idea of driving down to charleston nothing better to do thats fine then you go on shopping and brighten up your spirits heres the list faith blinked then stared at the shopping list lilah waved in front of her face groceries im not going shopping for groceries you got nothing better to do and said so yourself you make sure those tomatoes are ripe you hear and you get the floor cleaner i got written down the tv commercial made me laugh and thats worth giving it a try she turned back to the sink to rinse her dish rag and had to hold in a cackle at the way her girls mouth was hanging open then you go on by the drugstore and get me some of my oil of olay the kind in the jar not the bottle and the bath bubbles the milkandhoney ones on the way back you stop by the dry cleaners and pick up all the stuff i hauled down there last week mostly yours anyway god knows what you need with half a hundred silk blouses faith narrowed her eyes anything else she said sweetly its all written down there plain as day give you something to do with your bored self for a couple hours now go get some clothes on its going on noon sinful just sinful to be lazing around in your robe half the damn day go on get lilah made shooing motions then snatched up faiths plate and cup i havent finished my breakfast i didnt see you eating it picking and poutings what you were doing now out of my kitchen and make yourself useful for a change lilah folded her arms angled her head and stared she had a way of staring that could wither the bravest soul faith shoved back from the table sniffed and stalked out ill be back when im back she called out with a shake of her head and a chuckle lilah finished off faiths coffee herself some chicks they just never learn who rules the roost it had taken wade three years and eighteen pups to convince dottie betrum to have her oversexed labretriever mix spayed the last litter of six were just weaned and while their mama slept off the effects of the surgery he gave each of the cheerfully barking puppies the necessary shots i just cant look at the needles wade makes me lightheaded you dont need to look mrs betrum why dont you go on out and wait well be done here in just a few minutes oh her hands butterflied up to her cheeks and her myopic eyes shone with distress behind the thick lenses of her glasses i feel like i should stay doesnt seem right to just she trailed off when wade slid the needle under fur maxine take mrs betrum on out to the waiting room he gave his assistant a quick wink i can handle this handle it better he thought as maxine helped the staggering woman out of the room without sweet little old ladies fainting on the floor here you go little guy wade rubbed the puppys belly to soothe it and completed the inoculations he weighed scratched the ears checked for parasites and filled out charts while yips and barks echoed off the walls mrs betrumвђs sadie slept peacefully in postop old mr klingles cat silvester hissed and squalled in his cage and speedy petey progress elementaryвђs thirdgrade hamster mascot raced on his wheel proving he was recovered from a mild bladder infection it was for dr wade mooney his own little paradise he finished up the last pup while the siblings tumbled over each other tugged at his shoelaces or piddled on the floor mrs betrum had assured him shed found good homes for five of the puppies already he had as always gently declined her offer to take one for himself but he had an idea just where the last of the lot could make his home doc wade maxine peeked back in all done here lets gather up the troops theyre so cute her dark eyes danced i thought you were going to give in am take one of this batch once you start youll never stop but his dimples deepened as a pup wormed am wiggled in his hands wish i could take one maxine picked up a puppy cuddling while it licked her face with desperate love and speed she adored animals which is why the opportunity to work for doc wade had been heavensent there were already two dogs at home and she knew better than to think she could talk her parents into indulging her with another shed been born in the holler and her parents had worked their fingers raw lifting themselves their daughter and their two young sons out of it money was still tight she reminded herself as she cuddled and pined for the puppy and money would stay tight awhile longer she thought with a sigh she was the first of her family to get into college and every penny had to be saved theyre so sweet doc wade but between work and school i wouldnt have time to give it enough attention she set the pup down again besides the fact my daddyd kill me wade only grinned maxineвђs father adored her classes going all right she rolled her eyes she was in her second year of college and time was as tight as money if it hadnt been for doc wade giving her the most flexible of hours and letting her study when things were quiet shed never have made it this far he was her hero and shed once had a wonderfully painful crush on him now she only hoped to one day be as good and clever a veterinarian as he was finals coming up i got so much in my head it feels like its going to burst ill take these babies out doc wade she hefted the basket full of puppies what should i tell miz betrum about sadie she can pick her up later this afternoon tell her around four oh and ask her not to give that last pup away ive got a line on someone will do is it all right if i take lunch now were clear for an hour and i thought id go study some in the park go ahead he turned to the sink to scrub his hands take the full hour maxine lets see how much more you can fit in that brain of yours thanks he was going to be sorry to lose her which wade imagined he would as soon as she had a degree hot in her hand it wasnt going to be easy to find someone as competent as willing or as good with the animals who could also type deal with frantic pet owners and answer the phone but life moved on he started toward the back to check on sadie just as faith came in the rear door dr mooney just who i was looking for im easy to find this time of dayвђќ well me im just passing through he cocked an eyebrow thats quite a dress for just passing through oh she ran a finger down the soft cotton fabric of the thinstrapped fully skirted number in bold poppy red like it im in a red kind of mood she shook her hair back sent out seductive clouds of scent stepping forward she skimmed her hands up his chest over his shoulders guess what ive got on under it every time he thought like a finger snap just one look at her had him ready to beg why dont you give me a hint youre such a smart man got that college degree and those letters after your name she took his hand and covered with hers trailed it up her thigh i bet you could find out right quick jesus his blood took a violent panthers leap you go walking around town with next to nothing on and you and me were the only ones who know she leaned forward her eyes bright on his and nipped his lower lip вђњwhatcha gonna do about it wade come upstairs too far with a throaty laugh she nudged the door open behind him i want you now and i want you fast the dog slept quietly her breathing regular the room smelled of canine and antiseptic the old chair where he spent many hours watching over patients was pricked with hair shed from countless dogs and cats вђњi havenвђt locked upвђќ lets live dangerously she flipped open the button of his jeans dragged down the zipper why look what i found she wrapped her hand around him watched his melted chocolate eyes go blurry before he crushed his mouth on hers the sly excitement shed felt when dressing when driving into town knowing shed go to him seduce him turned into something tangled and needy nearly painful take me someplace she arched back while his mouth fed on her throat take me someplace hot and dark and wild i need to go hurry and take me there the jagged edge of her desperation knifed through his blood leaving him raw there was nothing tame between them when they came together like this nothing soft nothing sweet when she was panting his name and her hands were on him he forgot he wanted the soft and sweet all he wanted was faith he tossed up the red skirts gripped her hips she was hot and she was wet and seemed to clamp over him like a greedy jaw when he drove himself into her she wrapped one leg around his waist and moaned long and deep he filled the empty places it didnt matter if it was only for the moment if the emptiness came back he filled them and no one else ever had harsh animal pants the solid rhythmic thud of body against body bodies against wood and the slick strong feel of him pounding into her she let go with a small strangled cry in her throat as the orgasm sprang free she always came fast and hard with wade such a surprise such a lovely little shock to the system then it would start again slower deeper a long and gradual rip that opened something inside her to him and because it was him she could cling she could surrender to it she could hold on and know hed be there with her when she fell the phone was ringing or his ears were every breath he took was ripe with her she moved with him thrust for thrust never stopping never slowing there were times when he could think about her sanely and when he wondered why the two of them didnt just devour each other until nothing was left she was saying his name over and over punctuating the word with gasps and whimpers and he saw just before he emptied into her her eyes close as if in prayer god she shuddered once let her head rest back against the door kept her eyes shut god i feel wonderful like gold inside and out she opened her eyes stretching lazily how about you he knew what she expected so resisted burying his face in her hair murmuring words she wouldnt believe words that hadnt mattered to her years before where hed been foolish enough to say them that was a lot more appetizing than the blt i planned for lunch it made her laugh and hook her arms around his neck in a manner that was as friendly as it was intimate there are some parts of me you didnt nibble on so ifвђ wade wade honey you upstairs jesus the part of him that was still nestled cozily inside faith shriveled my mother well isnt this interesting even as faith snorted out a laugh wade was clamping his hand over her mouth hush christ jesus this is all i need eyes dancing faith muttered against his hand while her body shook with laughter its not funny he hissed it out but had to struggle back a laugh of his own he could hear his mother wandering around cheerfully calling him in the same chirpy singsong sheвђd used to call him for supper when heвђd been ten just be quiet he whispered to faith and stay here stay right in here and dont make a sound he eased back slowly eyes narrowed as faith bit her lip and snickered wade honey she said when he reached for the door then she squeezed her own mouth shut with her fingers when he turned to snarl at her not a sound he repeated okay but i just thought you might want to put that away he glanced down swore and hurriedly stuffed himself back into his jeans and zipped mama he shot faith one last warning look then stepped outside firmly closing the door behind him im down here i was just checking on a patient he sprinted up the steps grateful his mother had gone up to search him out there you are my baby i was just going to leave you a little love note boots mooney was a package of contradictions she was a tall woman but everyone thought of her as little she had a voice like a cartoon kitten and a will of iron shed been the cotton queen her senior year of high school and had gone on to reign as miss georgetown county her looks wholesome rosy and candy pretty had served her well she preserved them religiously not out of vanity but out of a spirit of obligation her husband was an important man and she would never allow him to be seen with less than he deserved boots enjoyed pretty things including herself she threw her arms open for wade as if it had been two years rather than two days since shed seen him when he bent toward her she kissed both his cheeks then quickly drew back honey youre flushed are you feverish no to his credit he didnt wince when she laid the back of her hand on his brow no im fine i wasвђin postop itвђs a little warm in thereвђќ distracting her was imperative and he knew the surefire way look at you he took her hands spread her arms and gave her a long approving onceover dont you look pretty today oh now she laughed but pinked up with pleasure i just had my hair done is all you shouldve seen me before lori got done with me i looked like a ragpicker impossible youre just biased i had a fistful of errands to do and couldnt go home until id seen my baby she gave his cheek a pat then immediately turned toward the kitchen i bet you havent had lunch im just going to fix you something mama i have a patient miss dotties sadie oh dear whats wrong with her why dottied just be lost without that dog nothings wrong shes just been fixed if nothings wrong what needed to be fixed wade dragged a hand through his hair while his mother poked in his refrigerator fixed so shed stop having a litter of puppies every year oh wade you dont have enough food in this house to keep body and soul together im just going to pick a few things up for you at the market mamaвђ dont mama me you dont eat right since you left home and you cant tell me different wish youd come home for supper more often im going to bring you over a nice tuna casserole tomorrow thats your favorite he hated tuna casserole loathed it but hed never been able to convince her of it id appreciate that maybe ill take one out to little tory too i just stopped over to see her she looks so grownup boots put three eggs on to boil that shop of hers is coming along so fast i dont know where that girl gets the energy god knows her mother never had any i could see and her daddy well its best not to speak if you cant speak kind boots folded her lips and hunted up a jar of pickles always had a soft spot for that child though for one reason or another i never could get close to her poor little lamb i used to wish i could just gather her up and bring her on home with me love wade thought made you helpless wherever however it came he walked over wrapped his arms around boots and rested his cheek on her newly lacquered hair i love you mama why honey i love you too thats why im going to make you a nice egg salad here so i dont have to stand around watching my only son starve to death youre getting too thin i havent lost an ounce then you were too thin to start with he had to laugh why dont you put another egg on mama so therell be enough for both of us ill just go down and see to sadie and ill come back and well have lunch together thatd be nice you take your time she slid another egg into the water and glanced over her shoulder as he went out boots was well aware her son was a grown man but he was still her baby and a mother never stopped worrying about or looking out for her own men she thought with a sigh were such delicate such oblivious creatures and women well certain women could take advantage of that the doors of the old building werent as thick as her son might believe and a woman didnt reach the age of fiftythree without recognizing certain sounds for what they were she had a pretty good idea just whod been on the other side of that door with her boy shed reserve judgment on that matter she told herself as she sliced up pickles but shed be watching faith lavelle like a hawk she was gone wade realized he should have figured she would be shed stuck a postit to the door drawn a heart on it and had pressed her lips to the center leaving a sexy red kiss for him he peeled it off and though he told himself he was an idiot tucked it into a drawer for safekeeping shed come back when she was in the mood and hed let her hed let her until he came to despise himself or if he was lucky until his heart was whole and his again and she was just an interesting diversion he stroked a hand over sadies head then checked her vitals her incision and stitches because she was awake now her deep brown eyes glassy and confused he picked her up carefully hed take her upstairs with him so she wouldnt be alone sex made her thirsty in a much happier frame of mind than shed been in faith decided to wander up to hansons and buy herself a bottle of something cold and sweet to enjoy on the way to the market she glanced back at the vets office then up at wades apartment windows blew him a mental kiss she thought she might just give him a call later and see how he felt about taking a drive that evening maybe they could head over to georgetown and find some pretty spot near the water it was nice being with wade comfortable on one hand exciting on the other he was as dependable as sunrise always there when she needed him memories of a longago summer when hed spoken so easily of love and marriage of houses and children tried to wind through her mind through her heart she cast them out and set her mind on the thrill of fast secret sex instead thats what she wanted and luckily so did he shed oblige them both later shed borrow cades convertible then theyd take that drive toward the coast theyd park somewhere and neck like teenagers shed parked her own car several storefronts up from wades office no point in giving tongues an excuse to wag though god knew they wagged anyway over everything and nothing she was about to slide in when she spotted tory walk out of her shop door then just stand back on the sidewalk and stare theres an odd duck who never did grow out of her funny feathers faith thought but curiosity had her crossing the street this one of your trances tory jerked then deliberately relaxed the shoulders that had tensed i was just seeing how the window looks the sign painter finished not long ago вђњhmmвђќ faith planted a hand on her hip and took a long look herself the black scrolled letters looked fresh and classy southern comfort is that what youre selling yes because her pleasure in the moment had been dulled tory walked back to the door you sure arent very friendly to a potential customer tory glanced back eyes mild faith looked gorgeous she thought sharp smug and satisfied and she wasnt in the mood for it im not open yet annoyed faith grabbed the door before it could shut in her face and squeezed inside you dont look near ready to me she commented scanning the nearly empty shelves closer than it looks i have work to do faith oh dont mind me you go on and do whatever faith wagged a hand and as much out of stubbornness as interest began to wander the place was clean as a whistle she had to admit the glass sparkled on the displays dwights men had built the wood was polished to a gleam even the storage boxes were neatly stacked and a large plastic bag held the styrofoam bits used for packing there was a laptop computer and a clipboard on the counter you got enough stuff to fill all this space i will have resigned to the intrusion tory continued to unpack stock if she knew faith lavelle her companion would shortly be bored and wander out again if youre interested i plan to open next saturday selected stock will be ten percent off that day only faith shrugged a shoulder im usually busy over the weekends she roamed by a waisthigh counter with a glass top inside on a drape of white satin were examples of handcrafted jewelryвђsilver and beads and colored stones artistically scattered designed to catch the eye and the imagination forgetting herself she started to lift the top found it locked and swore under her breath she shot a cautious look toward tory glad the other woman hadnt noticed you got some pretty enough baubles here she wanted the silver dangle earrings with the little lapis balls and wanted them immediately i didnt think you went in for baubles hardly ever wear any yourself i have three artists right now for baubles tory added dryly i particularly like the brooch in the center section the wires sterling and the stones are garnet citrine and carnelian i see it theyre all scattered on the wire like stars like one of those sparklers the kids light on the fourth of july yes very like that its nice enough i suppose but im not much for pins and brooches she bit her lip but avarice won over pride i like these earrings here come back saturday i might be busy and she wanted them now why dont you sell them to me make yourself an early sale thats what youre in business for isnt it to make sales tory set a pottery oil lamp on the shelf she was careful to wipe the smile off her face before she turned im not open for business yet but she started toward the display for old times sake we never had any old times i suppose youre right she unhooked the keys that dangled from her belt loop which one caught your eye that one those she tapped the glass the silver and lapis yes theyre lovely they suit you tory took them off the satin held them to the light before passing them to faith you can use one of the mirrors if you want to try them on the artist lives outside of charleston she does beautiful work as faith walked to a trio of mirrors framed in bronze and copper tory slipped a long pendant out of the case why make one sale if you could make two this is one of my favorite pieces of hers вђњitвђd go well with those trying not to be overly interested faith glanced down the pendant was a thick barrel of lapis clasped in silver hands unusual she switched her earrings for the new ones then gave in and took the necklace you wont see this walking back at you down the street no tory allowed herself a smile i plan to offer the unique i suppose i should have both havent treated myself in ages seems like everything you see around progress is the same as the other quietly tory closed the top of the display not anymore lips pursed faith swiveled the chain around to look at the tag some people will say youre outpricing yourself she skimmed her finger down the chain as she looked back at tory theyd be wrong this is fair enough fact is you could charge more if you were in charleston but im not ill get your boxes dont bother ill just wear them out she opened her purse dropped her other earrings carelessly inside you just cut the tags off for me and ring it up add it up tory corrected i dont have the cash register set up yet whatever she slipped off the necklace the tagged earring ill write you a check faith lifted her eyebrows when tory held out a hand i cant write it until you give me the total no give me your other earrings thats no way to treat them ill give you a box with a short laugh faith dug them out again all right little mother sex and shopping faith thought as she wandered again there couldnt be a better way to spend the day and from the looks of torys shop whod have thought little spookeyed tory bodeen would grow into such fine taste and learn how to use it so cleverly вђњmustвђve been a powerful lot of work to hunt up the right things to find the people who made those things to calculate what to charge for them to design the space to display them likely more to it than that faith mused bookkeeping and that kind of nasty thing she found herself impressed and a little envious by the idea of having the gumption and the skill to create a business from nothing not that shed want any part of such an undertaking and all that responsibility herself a shop like this would tie you down tighter than a coil of hemp but wasnt it nice the shop was so convenient to wade maybe life in progress was about to pick up for a while you ought to tip this bowl up on a stand she stopped tipped the big serving bowl herself so people can see the inside design from across the room tory had intended to once shed unpacked her stands adding figures she barely glanced up want a job ive got your total here tax included but you should check my math you always got better grades there than i did she started over and the shop door opened faith would have sworn she heard tory groan вђњlissyвђs squeal was in torys opinion only one of her annoying habits among the others were her tendency to douse herself in lilyofthevalley scent that entered the room before she did and remained in it long after shed left as both the scent and the squeal entered her shop tory gritted her teeth in what she hoped would be mistaken for a smile oh isnt this fun i just got my hair done and was walking on down to the office when i saw yвђall in here as lissy clapped her hands together and took a turn around tory shot faith a single deadly look it was answered by a lightning grin of perfect understanding and a coy flutter of lashes i happened along just after torys sign was finished and it looks just fine too everythings coming right along isnt it with one hand on the weight of her belly lissy turned back to scan the shelves its all looking so pretty tory why you mustve worked like six mules to get so much done in so little time and didnt my dwight do a fine job yes i couldnt be happier with the work course not hes the best there is oh isnt this dearвђќ she snatched the oil lamp tory had just placed on the shelf i just love things that sit around the house dust catchers dwight calls them but its those touches that make a home isnt it tory took a deep breath just one more of those annoying traits was lissys habit of turning every sentence into an exclamation yes i think so if dust doesnt have someplace to catch itll just fall on an empty table why thats so true discreetly lissy turned the price tag over then rounded her mouth into an o of surprise my its dear isnt it its handcrafted and signed tory began but faith rolled right over her you get what you pay for dont you lissy and dwight makes enough to indulge you especially since youre about to pop with another baby i swear if i ever carried a weight around for nine months the man who planted it there would have to buy me the moon and the stars not entirely sure if she was being complimented or insulted lissy frowned dwight just spoils me rotten course he does i just bought me these earrings she gave the one still in her ear a spin with a fingertip and a pendant too torys giving me a little jump on her saturday opening really lissys eyes went sharp and narrow as faith knew she wasnt one to tolerate anyone getting ahead of her she clutched the lamp greedily to her breasts tory you just have to let me have this now my hearts just set on it i dont know if i can get in here first thing on saturday and somebody else might snap it up be a doll wont you and let me buy it today tory circled faiths total so that she could begin calculating itll have to be cash or check lissy im not set up for credit cards today but id be happy to set it aside for you ifвђ no no i can write you a check maybe since im here and all i could just poke about for a bit its just like playing store yeah tory took the lamp set it on the counter it looked like she was open for business after all oh are these mirrors for sale everythings for sale tory got a small navy blue box from under the counter placed faiths earrings inside im going to put the artists card in with your old earrings fine you dont have to thank me she added under her breath im debating whether you did it to be helpful or to irritate me tory said equably or irritate her but she noted down the price of the lamp a sales a sale so i will thank you you knew just which button to push on that one faith glanced over to where lissy was oohing and aahing and chattering shes as simple as they come she buys one of those mirrors and she can be my new best friend well i like that enjoying herself more than shed imagined faith pulled out her checkbook i get shoved aside and after i gave you your first sale too i just have to have this mirror tory the oval one with the lilies going up the side ive just never seen anything like it itll look so sweet in my little sitting room torys eyes met faiths over the counter gleamed sorry she just outbought you to lissy she called out ill get the box out of the back room i appreciate that i swear theres just so much to choose from already and i guess youre not half set up i was telling dwight just the other night that i dont see where you find the time between moving into the house setting things up here handling deliveries and spending evenings with cade you mustve found yourself a twentysixhour day cade the name popped simultaneously from torys and faiths lips that man moved faster than i gave him credit for lissy wandered back i have to say i never pictured the two of you together as a couple but you know what they say about still waters yes no tory held up a hand i dont know what youre talking about cade and i arent together oh theres no need to be coy when its just us girls dwight told me all about it explained youd probably want to keep it quiet awhile i havent told a soul dont you worry theres nothing to tell absolutely nothing to tell we just she saw two pair of eyes sharpen and felt her tongue go thick nothing dwights mistaken ill go get the box dont know why shes so hellbent to keep it secret lissy commented when tory rushed into the storeroom after all its not like either of thems married or anything of course she added with a smirk i guess the idea shes rolling on the sheets with cade after being back here less than a month doesnt go with that quiet properlady attitude shes painting herself with oh cades business was cades business faith told herself but shed be damned if shed let this little cat claw at him dont quiet proper ladies have sex with a viciously bright smile she tapped a finger on lissys belly i guess that bump you got theres from eating too much chocolate im a married woman you werent when you and dwight were bouncing around in the backseat of the secondhand camaro his daddy bought him when he lettered in track oh for heavens sake faith you did plenty of bouncing of your own back then exactly thats why im damned careful where i aim my stone if i get an urge to throw one she signed her check with a flourish then picked up the mate to her earring all im saying is that for somebody whos barely back in progress and whos been doing god knows what all these years she sure has latched on to a lavelle mighty fast nobody latches on to a lavelle until we want them to but she was going to think about this she was going to think about it good and hard tory was tempted to close up as soon as she nudged her two unexpected customers out the door but that would have thrown her off schedule and given lissys foolish gossip too much importance she worked on her stock another three hours systematically pricing logging and arranging the manual labor and the tedium of paperwork kept her from brooding but the drive home gave her ample opportunity this was not the way she intended to establish herself in progress again she wasnt going to tolerate not for one minute being the focus of town gossip the way to quash it she told herself was to ignore it to rise above it and to keep her distance from cade none of that would cause her any problem at all she was used to ignoring wagging tongues and over matters a great deal more vital than some trumpedup romance she certainly didnt have to spend any time with cade lavelle she barely had in any case a couple of meals a movie or two maybe a drive all harmless occupations where theyd just happened to go together from now on shed just go alone and that she thought was that it might have been if she hadnt spotted his truck at the edge of a field she told herself to drive by really there was no point in stopping no reason to discuss it it would be much more sensible to continue home and let the entire foolish matter die a natural death and she kept seeing the hungry predatory gleam in lissys eyes she jerked the wheel pulled to the side of the road where the grass was choppy and thick she was just going to mention it that was all just mention that cade should shut the hell up and stop talking about her with his idiot buddies this wasnt high school damn it piney cobb took a long contemplative drag from the last marlboro in his pack hed watched the station wagon swerve to the shoulder watched the womanвђdamn if it wasnt the little bodeen girl all grown upвђstart her march to the field and he kept watching as she aimed her feet between the rows and kept on coming beside him cade stood studying the days work and the progress of the crop boy had funny ideas if you asked him but those funny ideas were working it was none of his never mind anyway he got paid all the same whether he sprayed hell out of the crop or babied it with cow shit and ladybugs could use another good rain like we had the other night cade mused could piney scratched his grizzled chin pursed his lips what you got heres a good three inches higher than the traditional fields organic cotton grows faster cade said absently chemicals stunt growth yeah so youve said and so despite pineys doubts it had been proven true it made him think maybe all in all college educations werent all bullshit not that hed say so right out loud but it was something to mull on boss piney took a last pull on his cigarette then carefully tramped it out underfoot you got female problems since his mind was full of work it took cade a minute excuse me see myself ive kept pretty clear of females but i been around this world long enough to recognize a woman getting up a head of steam he shifted his gaze squinting against the sun and nodded lazily to where tory was plowing her way up the rows theres one now from the look of things youre dead in her sights i got no problems id say youre wrong about that one piney muttered and eased a step back so as not to be hit with the fallout cade it was a pleasure to see her a simple easy pleasure tory this is a nice surprise really well see about that i need to talk to you all right alone ill just mosey along tory sucked in her breath remembered her manners i beg your pardon mr cobbвђќ no need for that didnt think youd remember me she hadnt or hadnt consciously shed said his name without thinking about it now for a moment her temper was coated with an old image of a scrawny thinchested man with wheatcolored hair who smelled most usually of liquor and snuck her little peppermint drops he was still scrawny she noted but age and drink had ravaged his face it was red and worn and saggy and the wheatcolored hair if he still owned it was thin enough to be covered completely by an old gray cap i remember you used to give me candy and you worked the field next to my fathers did his lips stretched out in a smile revealing teeth as tilted and gapped as an old picket fence work for the college boy now pays better ill just be getting on see you in the morning boss man he tipped his cap then took a peppermint out of his pocket and handed it to tory as i recollect you always favored these i still do thank you it pleased him that you remembered cade said as piney walked across the field toward the road my father used to shout at him about the evils of whiskey then about once a month theyd get drunk together next pineyd be out in the field working as usual and my fatherd go back to shouting at him across the rows she shook her head turned to face cade i didnt stop for a trip down memory lane just what do you mean telling your friend dwight that were seeing each other im not sureвђ were not seeing each other cade arched a brow slipped off his sunglasses hooked them on his shirt well now tory yes we are im standing here seeing you right now you know very well what i mean were not dating he didnt smile but he wanted to he settled for scratching his head instead and looking bemused seems to me were doing something pretty close to that weve gone out what four times in the last ten days or so to my thinking when a man and a woman go out to dinner and such its a date your thinkings wrong were not dating so just get that straight вђњyesвђmвђќ dont grin at me a trio of crows cawed by sleek and shiny and even if you had that idea in your head you had no business no right to tell dwight we were involved he went right off and told lissy and now shes got it in her peabrained head weвђre having some sort of wild sexual affair i do not want or intend for people around hen to assume im your latest fling my latest he hooked his thumbs in his pockets rocked back on the worn heels of his work boots as far as entertainment went he considered this the days highlight just how many flings do you think ive had i have no interest youre the one who brought it up he pointed out just for the pleasure of seeing her snarl the point is you told dwight we were involved no i didnt but i dont see it came back to him oh yeahвђќ there with a kind of triumph jabbed a finger at him youre a grown man and should have gotten over the locker room talk it was a misunderstanding and a fascinating one in his opinion lissy keeps trying to set me up cant appear to stand having a single man running loose its pain in the ass last time it came up i told dwight to get her off my back to tell her was having a hot affair or something with me she wondered steam didnt stream from her ears why of all theвђ i didnt say you cade broke in i imagine dwight just picked you out as we were in your place at the time of the conversation you want to jump somebody jump him but personally i dont see what youre all het up about were both single were seeing each otherвђnow we are tory he added before she could argue the point and if lissy wants to think things between us have progressed to what would be a natural stage wheres the harm she wasnt sure she could speak he was amused she could see it in his eyes hear it in his voice you think this is funny not so much funny as anecdotal he decided makes for an amusing little anecdote anecdotal my butt lissyll have this spread all over the county if she hasnt already the crows came back circling oh well now theres a tragedy maybe we should issue a press release denying all she made a sound something perilously close to a growl when she whirled away he took her arm held her in place just simmer down victoria dont you tell me to simmer down im trying to establish a business a home here and i dont want to be the subject of back fence gossip back fence gossips the fuel that powers up small towns youve lived in the city too long if youve forgotten that and if people are talking people are going to stroll into your shop to get a closeup look wheres the harm in that he made it sound gentle reasonable i dont like being gawked at ive had enough of being gawked at you knew thereвђd be some of that before you came back here and if people want to gawk a bit at the woman whos caught cade lavelles eye all theyll have to do is look at you to see why youre turning this around she wasnt entirely sure how but she knew she wasnt on solid ground any longer faith was in the shop when lissy made her announcement he did wince which gave her some satisfaction there not so cheerful about it now are you if faiths going to poke at me about it and she wont be able to resist its about time i got something out of it he tightened his grip on her arm tossed his sunglasses on the ground beside them then brought her a step closer alarm bells shrilled and her hand slapped against his chest what are you doing no need to jump out of your skin with his free hand he cupped the back of her neck im just going to taste you dont but his lips were already skimming over hers wont hurt promise he kept his word it didnt hurt it soothed and aroused it eased and it stirred up those needs shed locked so carefully away but it didnt hurt his mouth was soft gentle coaxing hers to taste as he was warmth spread into her belly even as ropes of tension and awareness tangled together and as that mix rose up toward her heart he eased back i had a feeling he murmured his hand continued to rub and stroke the back of her neck had it the first time i saw you again her head was spinning it wasnt a sensation she enjoyed this is a mistake i dontвђ she stepped back in defense and felt something crunch under her heel damn second pair this week cade only shook his head over the broken sunglasses lifes full of mistakes he went on and kissed her again lightly this doesnt feel like one but were just going to have to see it through to find out cade im no good at this sort of thing which sort the kissing sort no her own laugh came as a surprise how could he make her laugh when she was terrified the manwoman thing the relationship thing then youll just have to practice i dont want to practice she could do nothing but sigh when he pressed his lips to her forehead cade theres so much you dont know about me that goes both ways so lets find out its a nice evening he slid his hand down to hers why dont we go for a drive this isnt dealing with the issue we can stop and get something to eat when the mood strikes he turned her rather elegantly bent down to pick up his ruined glasses he began to walk with the young cotton between them one step at a time tory he said quietly im a patient man you look around here pay attention you can see how patient it took me three seasons to turn the farm around to where i wanted it to what i believed in and i did that against a couple of generations of tradition there are people who still point and snicker or grumble and curse all because i didnt go the way most are comfortable with that most understand and what people dont understand usually scares them she looked at him then away the charmingly careless man whod chuckled at her temper had a line of steel running through him it wouldnt be wise she mused to forget it i know that i live with that so why dont we just consider ourselves two misfits and see where that takes us i dont know what youre talking about no lavelles a misfit in progress you think that because ive yet to bore you senseless with the wonders of organic farming and the beauty of green cotton casually he lifted her hand kissed the back of it but i will as i havent had a new victim in months tell you what you go on home i need to clean up some ill come by and get you in about an hour i have things to do god knows there isnt a day goes by there arent things to do he opened her car door ill be by in an hour he told her as she slid behind the wheel and tory just so theres no confusion this is a date he closed the door then tucking his hands in his pockets strolled over to his truck oh dont be mean cade im just asking one little favor faith stretched out across her brothers bed her chin on her fists and aimed her most winsome look shed developed the habit of coming into his room for company after hope had died and being alone was unbearable now she most often dropped in when she wanted something they both knew it and he didnt seem to mind youre wasting those eyes on me stripped to the waist his hair still damp from his shower cade pulled a fresh shirt from his closet im using the car tonight you can use it anytime she tried a pout thats right i can and im using it night he gave her the smug smile reserved for irritating siblings im the one who did the marketing for the food you stuffed in your mouth she scrambled up to kneel on the bed and went to the dry cleaners to pick up your stupid clothes and all im asking is to borrow your damn car for one evening but youre too selfish he slipped on his shirt began to button it with that same satisfied smile on his face and your point would be i hate you she yanked up a pillow heaved it and missed by a good foot and a half shed never had decent aim i hope you wreck the goddamn car and end up trapped in a heap of twisting burning metal the next pillow sailed over his head he didnt even bother to duck i hope glass gets in your eyes and you go blind and if you do ill laugh when you walk into walls he turned away from her a deliberate and calculated insult well then i guess you wont want to borrow whats left of the car tomorrow night i want it now faith my treasure he tucked the shirt in picked up his watch from the bureau you want everything now unable to resist he picked up the keys dangled them but you cant have it she screamed a primal war cry and launched herself off the bed he could have sidestepped but it was more entertaining to brace and catch her arms before she could use those pretty lethal nails on his face besides if hed nipped out of her way shed have plowed straight blind with temper into his dresser youre going to hurt yourself he warned dancing with her as he held her trembling arms high no im going to kill you im going to rip your eyes right out of your head youve got a real obsession with me going blind tonight you rip my eyes out how can i see how pretty you are let me go you bastard fight like a man if i fought like a man id just coldcock you and be done with it to infuriate her he leaned down to give her a quick kiss вђњitвђd take less energy she slumped eyes tearing up in defeat oh just let go i dont want your ugly old car anyway those wont work either tears come too easy to you but he kissed her cheek you can have the car tomorrow all day and half the night if you want he gave her arms an affectionate squeeze started to step back and saw stars when she kicked his shin goddamn it jesus christ he shoved her aside tried to pace off the pain you sneaky bitch be glad i didnt go with my first instinct and use my knee it was a near thing when he leaned over to rub at the sting she made a leap for the keys still in his hand she nearly had them then he pivoted and her forward motion shot her past him and down onto the floor with a thud вђњkincade faith ellen the voice was a whip snapping on satin margaret stood in the doorway body rigid face pale instantly all movement stopped mama cade cleared his throat i could hear the shouting and the swearing all the way downstairs as could judge purcell whom i am entertaining this evening as could lilah and the day maid and the young man whos just come to take her home she waited a full beat for the weight of the impropriety to lie heavy on the shoulders of her children perhaps you feel this sort of behavior is acceptable but i do not and do not wish to have guests servants and strangers come to believe that i have raised two hyenas in this house i apologize make him apologize to me faith demanded sulking as she rubbed her jarred elbow he pushed me down i certainly did not you tripped over your own feet he was being cruel and unreasonable she had one shot left faith calculated and meant to take it all i did was ask and ask politely to borrow his car for the evening and he started calling me names and pushing me around she winced gingerly touching her arm i have bruises i suspect there was more than a little provocation but there is no excuse for laying your hands on your sister no maam cade acknowledged this with a stiff nod and the regret that a foolish interlude could be pressed into such cold implacable lines youre right on both counts i apologize very well margaret shifted her gaze to faiths cades property is his to use or lend as he pleases now let that be an end to it i just want to get out of this house for a few hours temper spiked spilling out of her mouth he can use the truck just as easy as anything else all he wants to do is drive someplace dark and quiet so he can grope tory bodeen thats pretty talk faith cade murmured very attractive well its true everyone in town knows the two of you are at each other margaret took two steps forward before her control snapped back are youвђdo you intend to see victoria bodeen tonight yes could you be unaware of my feelings about her no mama im not unaware of them obviously those feelings dont matter the fact that she played a part in your sisters death the fact that she is a constant reminder of that loss mean nothing to you i dont blame her for hopes death im sorry that you do and sorrier that my friendship with her causes you any pain or distress save your sorries margaret said coldly sorry is nothing but an excuse for poor behavior you may choose to bring that woman into your life but you will keep her out of mine is that understood yes maam his voice iced in a direct reflection of hers its well understood without another word she turned and walked away her footsteps measured and slow cade stared after her wishing he hadnt seen that one quick flash of grief in her eyes wishing he didnt feel responsible for it to cut at the guilt he shot faith one violent look very nice job as always be sure to enjoy your evening she squeezed her eyes shut as he strode out there was a hole in her stomach burned there by her own thoughtlessness for a moment she indulged herself sat and rocked then she leaped up dashed toward the stairs and heard the front door slam im sorry she murmured and sat on the landing i didnt think i didnt mean it dont hate me she dropped her head on her knees i already hate myself i hope youll pardon the behavior of my children gerald margaret swept back in the main drawing room where her old friend waited there would have been no such outburst in his house when his children lived under his roof but then he thought his daughters had been raised to behave as ladies at such times still he offered margaret a sympathetic and affectionate smile no margaret no need to apologize just high spirits he took the glass of sherry shed set down before going upstairs and offered it back her there was music playing on low bach a favorite of both of them hed brought roses as he always did and lilah had already put them into the baccarat vase on the broad sweep of the piano the room with its deep blue divans and old polished wood was perfect peaceful and precisely as margaret demanded the piano was rarely played but kept in tune just the same it had been her wish that her daughters become accomplished on that instrument but there she had been disappointed there were no family photos in this room every memento had been carefully selected for how it would fit into the scheme so the heirlooms blended seamlessly with her own acquisitions it was not a room where a man would prop his boots on a table or a child would scatter toys on the rug high spirits she repeated its kind of you to say so she paced over to the window watched cades car roar down the drive dissatisfaction scratched her skin like wool im afraid its a great deal more and less than high spirits our children grow up margaret some of them do he said nothing for a moment he knew the subject of hope was never an easy one for her and as he preferred things easy would let it drift by as if it had never been said hed known her for thirtyfive years and had once briefly courted her himself she had chosen jasper lavelle who had been wealthier and with bluer blood it hadnt put more than a hitch in geralds stride or so he liked to think hed had ambitions even then as a young lawyer he had married well himself raised two children and had been comfortably widowed for five years like his old friend he preferred his widowed status to marriage so much less demanding of time and energies he was a tall and strapping sixty with the dramatic features of enormous black eyebrows that winged up like ruffled feathers on his otherwise dignified square face he had made the law all the ins and slippery outs of it his life prospered and carved out a respected niche in the community he enjoyed margarets company their discussions of art and literature and was her usual escort at events and affairs they had never exchanged more than a cool sociable kiss on the cheek for sex he enjoyed the favors of young prostitutes who exchanged sexual fantasies for cash and remained nameless he was a staunch republican a devout baptist he considered his sexual adventures a kind of hobby after all he didnt golf i dont know that im good company tonight gerald he was also a creature of habit it was their night for a quiet dinner at beaux reves a dinner that would be followed by coffee and a pleasant thirty minutes in the gardens im too old a friend for you to worry about that i suppose i could use a friend im upset gerald victoria bodeen i had hoped i could resolve myself to her coming back to progress but now ive learned that cade is seeing her socially hes a grown man margaret he is my son she turned back then her face hard as stone i wont have it he nearly sighed it seems to me that if you press the matter with him youll make it and her too important i dont intend to press it with him no she knew what needed to be done and would see to it he should have married your deborah gerald it was a mutual regret mild on his part and made him smile sadly we might have had grandchildren together what a thought margaret murmured and decided she could use another sherry tory was waiting for him to drive up she had it all figured out it always took a bit of time and distance for her to realize cade had maneuvered her he did so very smoothly very quietly and very skillfully but it was still maneuvering shed been in charge of her life for too long now to allow anyone a turn at the wheel he was a nice man and she couldnt deny she enjoyed his company she was proud of how calm and mature that sounded when she practiced it in front of her mirror just as she was pleased with the rest of the little speech she intended to make she was simply too involved with setting up her new business establishing herself in reacquainting herself with the area to put any time or effort into a relationship with him or anyone else naturally she was flattered he was interested in her but it would be best all around if they simply stepped back now she hoped theyd continue to be friends but that was all they could be now or ever she scraped her teeth over her bottom lip she could bring his taste back she was good at bringing tastes back even when she didnt want to be the hot sweet flavor of the windfall peaches under the twisted old tree by the river outside of town bees drunk on the fermented juice swarmed the fallen fruit and buzzed cozily she hadnt expected his taste to be as hot and sweet or as potent she hadnt expected to be linked so perfectly with him for that moment as if he were one of the missing pieces of the puzzle of her life that was romanticizing the casual she reminded herself it was foolish to pretend she hadnt imagined what it would be like to kiss him she was human after all she was normal but when shed imagined it everything had been rather mild and pleasant and simple the reality of it hadnt really been a kiss at all but more of a sample and she supposed hed done that on purpose just to intrigue her clever of him she decided he was a clever man but it wasnt going to work she was ready for him now and her mind was set there was no temper or embarrassment to blur her senses shed walk outside when he pulled up in that way shed block him from coming inside and having any opportunity to confuse the issue again shed make her tidy speech wish him well then go back inside and close the door and stay where it was safe the plan put her at ease again in control again so when she heard him drive up she gave a little sigh of relief everything was about to be put back in order again then she stepped out saw his face he sat in the pretty convertible his streaked mass of hair already windblown his hands resting on the wheel he gave her an easy smile but behind it she saw anger and frustration most of all she saw bitter unhappiness no maneuver he could have devised no plan he could have calculated could have hit her weakness more effectively thats one of the things i like best about you tory youre prompt he got out started to round the hood to open the passenger door she didnt touch him the connection tended to become too close with physical contact tell me whats wrong wrong he glanced down started to make light of it then the shield went up he stepped back went around to his own side as she climbed in do you just crack open a mind and take a peek at whats inside her head snapped back as one would from a blow then she folded her hands in her lap it was better this way it would have happened eventually anyway she reminded herself better to get it over with quick and early no that would be rude he laughed dropped back behind the wheel oh i see theres an etiquette to mind reading i dont read minds she gripped her fingers togetherвђtaut wires white at the stress points she let out a breath to relieve the pressure in her chest and stared straight ahead its more a reading of feelings ive learned to block it out as its not pleasant whatever you might think to have other peoples emotions pounding at you its fairly easy to filter it but now and again if im not paying attention something particularly strong emotions slide through i apologize for intruding on your privacy he said nothing for a moment just sat with his head back and his eyes closed no im sorry that was nasty im feeling nasty as you picked up on i guess i needed to take a swipe at somebody and you were elected i understand that its uncomfortable to be with someone you cant trust someone you feel can and will take advantage of your own thoughts and feelings use them to control you or hurt you or direct your life thats one of the reasons i tried to explain to you why im not good at relationships why i dont want to be involved in one its perfectly understandable to have questions and doubts and for those questions and doubts to lead to resentment and distrust she fell silent used the silence to gear herself up for the rest that cade said mildly is an amazing pile of bullshit mind if i ask whose words you just put in my mouth they were your own words she shifted leaning on her own crutch of bitterness to face him i am what i am and i cant change it i know how to cope and how to get by i dont want or expect anyone to stand with me i dont need anyone to ive learned to accept my life just the way it is and i dont give a damn if you or anyone else doesnt youd better watch out for gopher holes tory thats a very high horse youre sitting on when she reached for the door handle he just lifted an eyebrow coward her fingers tightened on it then released bastard thats right i was for taking out a pisspoor mood on you i was told tonight that sorries are just excuses for bad behavior but im sorry anyway you however are dumping opinions on me that i havent expressed and dont have i cant give them to you as i havent finished making them yet when somethings important i like to take the time to study on it you seem to be important he leaned over instinctively she pressed back into the seat you know thats something that irritates me right down to the bone calmly he drew her seat belt over hooked it and its a challenge at the same time you see im just bound and determined to keep touching you to keep getting closer until you stop pulling back he started the engine tossed an arm over the seat let his gaze rest on hers before he backed the car up the lane you can chalk it up to pride and ego if you like i dont mind a bit he swung onto the road punched the gas ive never hit a woman he said it conversationally but she heard the viciously controlled anger beneath i wont start with you id like to have my hands on you i damn well intend to have them on you eventually but i wont hurt you i dont think every man uses his fists on women she looked out the window gathering her composure the way she gathered bricks for her wall i worked that and several other issues out in therapy good he said it simply then i wont have to worry every move i make comes off as a threat to you i dont mind making you nervous but i do mind scaring you if i were afraid of you i wouldnt be here the wind flowed over her face through her hair im not a pushover cade or anyones doormat not anymore he waited a beat if you were i wouldnt want you here she turned her head just a little studied him with a sidelong glance that was a very smart thing to say maybe the best thing that could be said even better i believe you mean it im one of those peculiar creatures who tries to mean what they say i believe that too she took a deep breath i wasnt going to come tonight i was going to walk out of the house tell you i wasnt coming explain how things were going to be and here i am you felt sorry for me he shot her a glance that was your first mistake she gave a short laugh i suppose where are we going no place special good she settled back surprised at how quickly how easily she relaxed thats a fine spot he drove farther than hed intended choosing back roads at random but always winding his way east toward the sea the sun dipped lower behind them shooting streaks of red across the sky that seemed to bleed down into the fields pour through the stands of trees drip into the snaking curve of the river he let her choose the music and though mozart blasted out rather than the rock he would have selected it seemed to suit the oncoming twilight he found a little waterside restaurant well south of the crowds that flocked to myrtle beach it was warm enough to sit outside at a little table where a squat white candle sputtered in a glass globe and the conversation around them was muted under the steady rise and slap of the surf on the beach children chased the bugeyed sand crabs into their holes or threw bread crumbs into the air for the crying gulls a group of young people thrashed in the surf and sent out the squeals and shouts that were caught between mating calls and childhood in a sky still deep blue with the last gasp of day the first star winked to life and shone like a single diamond the tension and temper of the day melted out of her mind she didnt think she was hungry her appetite was never particularly keen but she poked at her salad while he began to tell her of his work when you feel your eyes begin to glaze over just stop me i dont bore that easy and i know something about organic cotton the gift shop where i worked in charleston sold organic cotton shirts we got them from california they were pricy but sold well for us give me the name of the shop lavelle cotton started manufacturing organic last year i can guarantee well beat the price from california thats part of what i havent been able to get across as well as id like growing organically after youre established competes headon with chemical methods and the product commands a premium in the marketplace which equals more profit exactly he buttered a roll passed it to her people listen to profit more than they listen to environmental concerns i can talk about pesticide drift the effect on wildlife and edge speciesвђ edge species quail and other birds that nest in the grass along the fields hunters shoot the quail eat the quail and consume the pesticide then theres insecticide sure they kill off the pests but they also kill off the good bugs infect birds reduce the food chain a chick eats a dead or dying insect after spraying then the chicks infected its a cycle you cant break until you try another method odd she thought to realize shed carried her fathers view of farming inside her where nature was the enemy to be fought day after day with the government running a close second you love it farming yes why wouldnt i she shook her head a great many people make a living doing things they dont enjoy and have no real talent for i was supposed to go on and work at the tool and dye factory after high school i took business courses in secret rather than argue about it so i suppose i know what its like to go against the grain to do what you want to do how did you know what you wanted to do i just wanted to be smart to escape she thought but steered the conversation back to him the organic methods sensible and certainly forwardthinking but if you dont spray youve got weeds and disease and pests youve got a sick crop cottons been cultivated over four thousand years what do you think people did up until sixty seventy years ago before we started using aldicarb and methyl parathion and trifluralin it intrigued her interested her to see him getting worked up to feel the passion for his work vibrating out of him they had slaves and after that field hands they could work obscene hours for slave wages thats just one of the reasons in case you were wondering why the south lost the war between the states we can discuss history another time he leaned forward needing to make his point organically grown cotton can and does use more hand labor but it also makes use of natural resources animal manure compost instead of chemical fertilizers that can pollute groundwater cover crops to help control weeds and pests and add to revenue and the basic soil conservation of rotation good bugsвђladybugs mantis and so onвђto feed on the cotton pests instead of exposing farm workers neighbors children to pesticide drift we let the plants die naturally instead of using a defoliant he sat back as their entrees were served topped off the wine in their glasses but he was on a roll we keep up the process through the ginning we clear the gin of residue from conventional cotton thats federal regulation so when its sold its pure free of chemicals not everyone thinks that such a big deal for a shirt or your jockey shorts but cottons seed as well as fiber and cottonseeds in a whole lot of prepared food how much pesticide do you figure youre taking in every time you eat a bag of potato chips i dont think i want to know but she remembered her father coming home cursing the land she remembered watching the crop dusters dropping their clouds and how the filaments would linger and drift toward the house she remembered the stench of it and the burn in the air how did you get interested in the whole organic method first year of college i started reading about it and well the fact is there was this girl ah amused tory cut into her trout now we see the picture form her name was lorilinda dorset from mill valley california my tongue fell onto my toes the first time i saw her a long lanky brunette in tight jeans he gave a sigh at the memory sweet with distance and a cardcarrying member of peta greenpeace the nature conservancy and god knows what all so of course to impress her i read up on animal rights and natural farming and whatnot gave up meat for two months she lifted a brow at the steak on his plate must have been love for a few bright shiny weeks it was i let her drag me to a seminar on organic farming and she let me get her out of those tight jeans his smile was slow and wicked of course eventually my desperate need for a hamburger outweighed my devotion and lorilinda turned in disgust from the carnivore what else could she do exactly but i kept thinking about what id heard in that seminar and what i read in those books and it made more and more sense to me i saw how it could be done and why it should be so when beaux reves came to me i started the long and not entirely without conflict process lorilinda would be proud no shell never forgive me for the cheeseburger it was a serious breech of faith for months afterward i could barely choke one down over the guilt men are bastards i know it he also knew that she might actually eat a full meal if he kept her mind engaged but forgiving that genetic flaw how would you feel about being progresss exclusive outlet for lavelles green cotton products you want me to sell your shirts in my shop she asked surprised not necessarily shirts if that doesnt fit the ambiance but linens tablecloths napkins that sort of thing well caught offguard she shifted gears to business id want to see some samples of course but as the product would be produced here in the state it should fit in with my stock well need to discuss cost and supply and quality and style of course im keeping clear of assemblyline type products im providing the unique and celebrating south carolinas impressive variety of artists and craftsmen she paused to sip her wine and think organic cotton linens she murmured from field to display to table all within georgetown county that could be very appealing good he lifted his glass tapped hers well find a way to make it work for both of us to make it all work he added the evening was certainly ending on a much nicer note than it had begun with a full moon riding overhead and a lovely fog of wine in the brain she hadnt meant to drink she did so rarely but it had been so pleasant to sit by the water and sip at wine so pleasant that shed had two glasses instead of one and was now comfortably sleepy the car ran smooth and fast and the wind that blew over her smelled of the approaching summer it made her think of honeysuckle and overblown roses the smell of tar melting in se sun and the lazy hum of bees courting the magnolia blossoms in the marsh wishing to god itвђd get a little cooler now that the sunвђd gone down if a ride didnвђt come along soon she could hook her thumb around end up walking all the way to the goddamn beach вђcourse it was marcieвђs fault the bitch ditching her so she could go off and make it with that asshole tim well she didnвђt give a flying fuck about marcie shed hitch her way up to myrtle beach and have a fine time all she needed was a fricking ride come on sweetheart stop the car there you go hot damn tory reared up in the seat eyes wide sucking at air like a swimmer surfacing from a long lungbursting dive she got in the car she tossed her pack in the back and got in the car tory cade pulled to the side of the road shifted to take her shoulders its all right you just fell asleep for a minute no she shoved at him sick and desperate and yanked at her seat belt there were hands squeezing her heart so it beat in hitchy strikes no she wrenched open the door leaped out and began a stumbling run along the shoulder shes hitchhiking to the beach he picked her up back there somewhere back there wait hold on he caught up with her had to drag her around honey youre shaking he took her it was sliding into her head images and shapes sounds and scents there was a burn in her throat a smokers rasp from pulling deep on one too many cigarettes he took her pulled off the road pulled off and into the trees and he hit her with something she doesnt see what it is she only feels the pain and shes dazed whats happening whats the matter she pushes at him but hes dragging her out of the car who she shook her head fighting to find herself in the confusion in the pain in the terror that way just up that way all right her eyes were huge unfocused and her skin had gone clammy under his hands you want to walk up there a little ways i have to leave me alone no he wrapped an arm firmly around her that i wont well walk im right here you can feel me right here i dont want this i dont want it but she began to walk she opened herself overriding her instinct for selfpreservation she didnt struggle when the images shifted solidified the stars wheeled overhead blindingly bright heat closed around her like a fist she wanted to go to the beach she couldnt get a ride she was angry at her friend marcie a friend named marcie they were supposed to drive together spend the weekend now shes going to hitchhike because by god shes not going to let that stupid bitch ruin her trip he comes along and shes happy shes tired and shes thirsty and he says hes going all the way to myrtle its less than an hour by car she stopped held up a hand her head lolled back but her eyes stayed open wide open he gives you a bottle jack black blackjack you take a drink a long one to kill your thirst and because its so cool to be riding along and drinking whiskey it mustve been the bottle he hit you with mustve been because you passed it back to him and were laughing then something crashed into the side of your head christ it hurts she staggered and her hand flew to her cheek the taste of blood filled her mouth no dont cade pulled her against him surprised she didnt slide out of his arms like smoke i cant see cant theres nothing in him just blank wait wait with her hands fisted her breath in rags she pushed sickness rolled in her stomach but she slipped through and saw he took her in there she began to rock i cant i just cant you dont have to its all right now come on back to the car he took her in there pity and grief overwhelmed everything else he rapes her now she closed her eyes let it come let it burn you fight for a while hes hurting you and youre so scared so you fight he hits you again twice hard in the face oh it hurts it hurts it hurts you dont want to be here you want your mother you just cry while he grunts and pants and finishes you smell his sweat and his sex and your own blood and you cant fight anymore tory lifted her hands ran them over her own face she needed to feel the lines of her own cheeks nose mouth she needed to remember who she was i cant see him its dark and hes just a thing theres nothing from him for me to feel that seems real she doesnt see him either not really not even when he uses his hands to strangle her it doesnt take long because shes barely conscious anyway and hardly struggles she hasnt been with him more than half an hour and shes dead lying naked in the shadow of the trees thats where he leaves her heвђhe was whistling on his way back to the car she stepped back from cade then in that deliberate way of hers all he could see was her face pale as the moon with those eyes swirling smoke she was only sixteen a pretty girl with long blond hair and long legs her name was alice but she didnt like it so everyone called her ally the strain and the sorrow swallowed her up cade caught her lifted her she was limp as the dead shaken as much by her utter stillness as the story shed told he carried her away quickly he thought hoped if he got her away from that spot that place shed be better even as he bent to lay her back in the car she stirred when her eyes opened they were dark and glazed its all right youre all right im going to get you home i just need a minute the queasiness came on and the chill but they would pass the horror would take longer im sorry she shrugged helplessly im sorry for what he skirted the hood got back behind the wheel then just sat i dont know what to do for you there ought to be something i could do im going to get you home then ill come back and ill find her confused tory stared at him she isnt there now it happened a long time ago years ago he started to speak then stopped himself alice shed said a young blond girl named alice it stirred his memory and a kind of sickness in his gut does it always come on you like that out of nowhere sometimes it hurts you no it wears you out makes you a little sick but it doesnt hurt it hurts you he said again and reached down to turn the key cade tentatively she touched a hand to his it was im sorry to bring this back to you but you have to know it was like hope thats why it came so strong it was like hope i know it no you dont understand the man who killed that poor girl left her there in the trees it was the same man who killed hopeвђќ progress would you realize what revolution is call it progress and would you realize what progress is call it tomorrow вђ victor hugo i didnt want to believe it there wereвђareвђdozens of rational logical reasons why tory is wrong small points and major ones that make her claim about the teenager killed along the roadside impossible the girl couldnt have been murdered by the same monster who killed my sister little hope with her flyaway hair and eyes full of fun and secrets i can list those reasons here in a straightforward manner the way i couldnt seem to relate to tory last night i know i let her down i know by the way she looked at me by the way she slipped back behind that barricaded silence of hers i know i hurt her by the way i turned aside her claim the way i suggested no insisted that she let it alone but what she told me what she let me see through her eyes the horror she relived right in front of me and later spoke of with such quiet restraint brought it all back brought me back to that longago summer when everything in the world changed maybe itll help more to write of hope than of that doomed young girl i never knew as i sit here at my fathers desk it will forever be my fathers desk in everyones mind including my ownвђi can turn back the days and months and years until im twelve again still innocent enough to be careless with people i love still seeing my friends as superior in every way to family still dreaming of the day when im old enough to drive or to drink or to do any of the magical things that belong to the coveted world of adulthood id done my chores that morning as always my father had been a stickler for responsibilities and for hammering what was expected of me into my head at least he was before we lost hope id gone out with him midmorning to look over the fields i remember standing looking over that ocean of cotton my father stuck mostly with cotton even when many of the neighboring farms turned heavily to soybeans or tomatoes or tobacco beaux reves was cotton and i was never to forget it i never did and that day it was so simple to see why to stand and look out over that vast space to see the magic of the bolls burst open by the straining lint to watch the stalks bend with the weightвђsome of them carrying what must have been a hundred bolls all cracked open like eggs and that late in the year with the fields so rich with it the very air smelled of cotton the hot smell of summer dying it was to be a good harvest that year the cotton would spill into the fields be picked and bagged and processed beaux reves would go on even with those who lived in it little more than ghosts i was free shortly after noon while my father expected me to work to learn to sweat he also expected me to be a boy he was a good man a good father and for the first twelve years of my life he was everything solid and warm and fine i missed him long before he died but when he cut me loose that day i took my bike the streamlined twelvespeed id been given for christmas and drove through the thick hot wall of air all the way to wades we had a tree house back of wadeвђs yard up in an old sycamore dwight and wade were already there drinking lemonade and reading comic books it was too damn hot to do much else even if we were twelve but wades mama never could leave us be she was forever coming out and calling up asking didnt we want this or why didnt we come in and have a nice cold drink and a tuna fish sandwich miss boots always did have a sweet heart but she was a royal pain in our collective asses that summer we were on the cusp of manhood or so we considered ourselves and it was more than mortifying to be offered tuna fish and pepsicola by a mother wearing a starched apron and an indulgent smile that turned us back into children again we escaped headed down to the river for a swim i believe out of duty we made rude and to us brilliantly clever insults regarding dwights plump white ass he in turn retaliated by comparing our male parts to various unattractive vegetables naturally such activities kept us all in hysterics for an hour it was very easy being twelve we discussed important matters would the rebel alliance come back and defeat darth vader and the evil empire who was coolerвђsuperman or batman how would we con one of our parents into taking us to see the latest friday the thirteenth movie we would never be able to face our schoolmates if we hadnt seen the insane jason slaughter his annual quota of teenagers such were the vital questions of our lives at the moment sometime after four i suppose it was after wed made ourselves half sick on waspstung peaches and underripe pears dwight had to get home his aunt charlotte was coming in from lexington for a visit and he was expected to be clean and on time for supper dwightвђs parents were strict and it would not pay him to be late we knew he would be forced to wear pressed shorts and a bow tie for the evening and with the generosity of friends we waited until he was out of earshot to snicker about it wade and i left soon after parting ways on the road he for town and me for beaux reves i passed tory on the way she didnt have a bike she was walking home toward me i imagine shed been up playing with hope her feet were bare and dusty and her shirt was too small i didnt really notice any of that at the time but i remember now just how she looked that heavy brown hair pulled back from her face those big gray eyes that stared right into mine as i zoomed by without a word i could hardly have taken a moment to speak to a girl and maintain my manly dignity but i recall glancing back and seeing her walking away on strong legs tanned with summer the next time i saw her legs there were fresh welts scoring them hope was on the veranda when i got there playing jacks i wonder if young girls still play jacks hope was a terror at it and could whoop at anyone she persuaded to challenge her she tried to get me to play even promised to give me a handicap which of course insulted me beyond bearing i think i told her jacks were for babies and i had more important things to do her laugh and the sound of the ball bouncing followed me inside i would give a year of my life to go back to that moment and sit on the veranda while she beat me at jacks the evening passed as others had lilah shooed me upstairs to bathe saying i smelled of river skunk mama was in the front parlor i knew because the music she liked was playing i didnt go in as i knew from experience she didnt care much for smelly sweaty boys in the front parlor its funny looking back i see how much we were wade dwight and i ruled by our mothers wades with her fluttery hands and warm eyes dwights with her bags of cookies and candy and mine with her unbending notions of what was tolerable and what was not i never realized that before and dont suppose it matters at this point it might have mattered then if wed understood it on this evening what mattered was avoiding my mothers disapproval so i headed straight up the stairs faith was in her room putting some fancy dress on one of her pack of barbie dolls i know because i took the time and trouble to stop at her door and sneer i had a shower as i had shortly before decided baths were for girls and old wrinkled men im sure i put my dirty clothes in the hamper as lilah would have twisted the lobe of my ear if id done otherwise i put on clean clothes combed my hair likely took a few moments to flex my biceps and study the results in the mirror then i went downstairs we had chicken for supper roast chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy and the peas that were fresh from the garden faith didnt care for peas and refused to eat hers which might have been tolerated but she made an issue of it as faith often did and ended up sassing mama and being sent from the table in disgrace i believe chauncy papas faithful old hound who died the next winter got what was left on her plate after supper i poked around outside devising a way i would talk papa into letting me build a fort thus far my efforts in this area had been a dismal failure but i thought if i could locate the right spot one that would conceal the proposed structure so that it wouldnt be the eyesore papa imagined i would succeed it was during this reconnoiter that i found hopes bike where shed hidden it behind the camellias i never thought of tattling it just wasnt the way we worked as siblings unless temper or selfinterest outweighed loyalty it didnt even concern me though i imagined she planned to sneak out and meet tory somewhere that night as they were thick as thieves all that summer i knew shed done so before and didnt blame her mama was much more strict on her daughters than she was on her son so i said nothing about the bike and set my mind on the fort one word from me and her plans would have been shattered shed have shot me one of her hot angry looks under her lashes and likely have refused to speak to me for a day two if she could hold out and shed have been alive instead i went back into the house around dusk and planted myself in front of the tv as was my right on a long summer night being twelve i had a powerful appetite and eventually wandered out to hunt up some appropriate snack i ate potato chips and watched hill street blues and wondered what it was like to be a policeman by the time i went to bed with a full stomach and tired eyes my sister was already dead hed thought he could write more but he couldnt manage it hed intended to write down what he knew about his sisters murder and the murder of a young girl named alice but his thoughts had veered away from the facts and the logic and had left him steeped in memories and grief he hadnt realized how completely she would come alive for him if he wrote of her how the pictures of that night and the horrible images of the next morning would run through his mind like a film was that he wondered how it was for tory like a movie playing in the mind that would not be stopped no it was more did she know that when shed been caught in that vision the night before shed spoken to the girl rather than about her perhaps the girl alice had spoken through her what kind of strength did it take to face that to survive it and build a life he picked up what hed written started to lock it in a drawer of the old desk instead he folded the pages sealed them in an envelope he would need to see tory again need to speak with her again hed been right on that first day when hed told her the ghost of his sister stood right there between them there would be no going forward or back until theyd each come to terms with what theyd lost he heard the old grandfather clock call the hour with its hollow echoing bongs two lonely beats he would be up again in four hours dressing in the pale light eating the breakfast lilah would insist on fixing then driving from field to field eyeing the crops with all the faith and fatalism every farmer was born with checking for pests studying the sky despite or perhaps because of all the science he studied and implemented cades beaux reves was more plantation than the farm of his father he hired more laborers stuck with more handwork than the generation before him he put more effort and more of the profits into the ginning and the compression and storage and processing than his father and his grandfather had been willing to do it made beaux reves a selfcontained antebellum plantation and at the same time a kind of busy diversified factory and still with his charts and his science and his careful business plans he would stand and study the sky and hope nature cooperated in the end he thought as he picked up the envelope it all came down to fate he switched off the desk lamp and used the moonlight spilling through the windows to guide him down the curving stairs and out of the tower office hed need those four hours sleep he told himself as after the morning work he had afternoons at the plant he reminded himself to pick up some samples for tory and work up a proposal if he could pull all that together he could go see her the next night as he stepped into his room he weighed the envelope in his hand then switched on the light and tucked the envelope into the briefcase that sat beside his field boots he was unbuttoning his shirt when the faint breeze and the drift of smoke it carried had him glancing toward his terrace doors he stepped over noted they were open a chink and through the glass saw the red glow of a burning cigarette i wondered if youd ever come down faith turned she was wearing the robe she favored these days and spreading her arms on the stone struck a kind of pose вђњwhy dont you smoke out your own window i dont have this fine terrace like the master of the house that had been another bone of contention and though he agreed that shed have made more of the master suite than he it hadnt been worth fighting their mother over her insistence he take it after his fathers death she lifted the cigarette drew slowly youre still mad at me i dont blame you that was a lousy thing to do i just dont think when my tempers up if thats an apology fine now go on and let me go to bed im sleeping with wade jesus cade pressed his fingers to his eyes and wondered why they didnt just bore through his brain you figure thats something i need to know i found out one of your secrets so im telling you one of mine well be even ill make a note to take an ad on it out in the paper wade he dropped down into the iron chair on the terrace slumped goddamn it oh dont be that way were getting along just fine until you chew him up and spit him outвђќ i dont plan to then she gave a short humorless laugh i never plan to it just happens she sent the butt of the cigarette sailing over the rail never thinking that her mother would find it and be annoyed he makes me feel good why does something have to be wrong with that it doesnt its your business the way you and tory is yours she stepped over crouched down so their eyes were level i am sorry cade it was mean and spiteful of me to say what i did and i wish i could take it back you always do no i might say i do but half the time i dont mean it this time i do since there was more fatigue than anger in his eyes she reached up to dance her fingers in his hair shed always envied the weight and the curl of his hair but you dont pay any attention to mama shes got no business telling you what to do even if shes probably right he caught a drift of his mothers jasmine the night bloomer shes not right well im the last one to give advice on romantic entanglementsвђ exactly she arched a brow ouch that was a quick little stab but as i was going to say before i started bleeding this family is screwed up enough on its own without adding a strange element like tory bodeen to the mix shes a part of what happened that night oh lord cade we were screwed up long before hope died he looked so frustrated at that statement and so tired she nearly backed off made some joke out of the whole thing but shed been doing a lot of thinking since tory had come back to town it was time to say it you think about it anger with him and more than a little selfloathing made her voice sharp as honed tacks we were made the minute we were born all three of us and mama and papa before us you think their marriage was some sort of love match you might like to look at the pretty side of things but you know better than that they had a good marriage faith untilвђ a good marriage with a sound of disgust she pushed to her feet dragged her cigarettes from her robe pocket what the hell does that mean a good marriage that they were suited for each other that it was smart and convenient for the heir of the countys biggest and richest plantation to marry the welltodo debutante fine it was a good marriage maybe they even had feelings for each other for a while anyway they did their duty she said bitterly and snapped on her lighter they made us they did their best cade said wearily you never wanted to see that maybe their best was never good enough not for me and i dont see why it was for you what choice did they ever give you cade all your life you were expected and groomed to be the master of beaux reves what if youd wanted to be a plumber for gods sake that always was my secret lifes ambition i often fix a leaky faucet just to give myself a thrill she laughed and the roughest edge of her anger smoothed you know very well what i mean you might have wanted to be an engineer or a writer or a doctor or something but you werent given the chance to choose you were the oldest son the only son and your path was set youre right and i dont know what might have happened if id wanted to be any of those things but the point is faith i didnt well how could you growing up and hearing when cade runs beaux reves and when cades in charge you never got to be anything else never got to say im going to play guitar in a rockandroll band this time he laughed and she sighed and leaned back against the rail it reminded her why she so often came to his room so often sought out his company with cade she could say what she needed to hed let her hed listen dont you see cade they made us what we are and maybe you got what you wanted in the end im glad you did and i mean that i know you do that still doesnt make it right you were expected to be smart to know things to figure things and while you were off learning your lifes work i was here being told to behave to speak softly not to run in the house you can take comfort that you rarely listened i mightve she murmured i mightve if i hadnt already figured out that this house was a training ground for a good wife a good marriage just like mamaвђd made before me no one ever asked me if i wanted something more something else and when i questioned i was shushed let your father worry about that or your brother practice your piano faith read a good book so that you can discuss it intelligently but not too intelligently wouldnt want some man to think you might be smarter than he is when you marry itll be your job to make a pleasant home she stared at the tip of her cigarette a pleasant home that was to be the sum total of my ambitions according to the rules of lavelles so of course being me i was bound and determined to do just the opposite i wasnt going to discover myself some driedup repressed woman at thirty no indeed i made sure that wouldnt happen to me ran off with the first slicktalking wildeyed boy who asked me one who was everything i wasnt supposed to want married and divorced before i was twenty that showed them didnt it cade murmured yes it did as did my next foray into marriage and divorce marriage was all id been trained for after all not mamas kind of marriage i twisted that around and strangled myself doing it now here i am twentysix years old and two strikes against me and no place to go but here here you are cade commented twentysix years old beautiful smart and experienced enough to know better than to repeat your mistakes you never asked for any part in the farm or the plant if you want to learn if you want workвђ the look she sent him stopped the words it was so quietly indulgent you really are too good for the rest of us christ knows how you manage it its too late for that cade im a product of my upbringing and my own rebellion against it im lazy and i like it one of these days ill find me a rich and doddering old man and charm him into marrying me ill take good care of him of course and spend his money like water i might even be faithful too i was with the others for all the good it did me then with luck and time ill be a rich widow and that i think will suit me best the way it suits mama she thought bitterly bitterly youre more than you think you are faith a hell of a lot more no honey its likely im a great deal less maybe it wouldve all turned out different just a few shades different anyway if hope had lived you see she never even had the chance to live thats no ones fault but the bastard who killed her you think not faith said quietly i wonder would she have gone out that night gone off to have her adventure with tory if she hadnt felt as closedin here as i did would she have climbed out that window if shed known that shed be free to do as she pleased with whom she pleased the next morning i knew her better than anyone else in this house thats the way of twins shed have made something of herself cade because shed have quietly chipped away at the bars but she never got the chance and when she died the illusion of balance in this house went with her they loved her best you know faith pressed her lips together heaved the cigarette over the rail better than you or me i cant count the times afterward one of them would look at me me who shared her face and id see in their eyes what they were thinking why hadnt it been me out there in the swamp instead of hope dont he got to his feet thats not true no one ever thought that i did and its what i felt from them and i was a constant reminder that shed died i was not to be forgiven for that no he touched her face saw the woman and the child whod been that shed lived but i couldnt be her cade the tears that sheened her eyes shone in the dim light made them he thought so brutally alive she was something they shared the way they couldnt share anything or anyone else but they couldnt share the loss of her no they couldnt so papa built his shrine to her and found his solace in the bed of another woman and mama got colder and harder you and me we just went the way wed already been directed so here we are in the middle of the night with no one to call our own and we still have nobody who loves us best it hurt to hear it and know it was true we dont have to stay that way cade we are that way she leaned against him rested her head when his arms came around her neither one of us has ever loved anyone not enough to put that balance back maybe we loved hope enough maybe even back then we knew she was the one who held it all steady we cant change what happened any of it only what we do about it now thats it isnt it i just dont want to do anything about anything i hate tory bodeen for coming back here for making me remember hope miss her grieve for her again shes not to blame faith maybe not she closed her eyes but ive got to blame someone the matter had to be dealt with and as quickly and efficiently as possible money margaret knew spoke to a certain class of people it bought their silence their loyalty and what passed for their honor she dressed carefully for the meeting but then she always dressed carefully she wore a crisp suit in dignified navy and her grandmothers singlestrand pearls at her throat shed sat as she did every morning at her vanity not so much disguising the signs of age as she considered age an advantage but using them to show her character and her station character and station were both sword and shield she left the house at precisely eightfifty telling lilah that she had an early appointment and would then be attending a luncheon in charleston she could be expected back at threethirty she would of course be on time margaret calculated the business she had to attend to before making the drive south would take no more than thirty minutes she had allowed fortyfive which would still give her time to tend to her short list of errands before the lunch she could have hired a driver even kept one on staff she could have assigned the errands to a servant these were indulgences and therefore weaknesses she would not permit the mistress of beaux reves was required in her opinion to be visible in town to patronize certain shops and maintain the proper relationship with the right merchants and civil servants this civic responsibility was never to be shrugged aside for convenience margaret did more than write generous checks to her selected charities she held positions on committees the local art council and the historical society might have been personal interests but that bent did not negate the time energy and funds she funneled into them in more than thirtytwo years as mistress of beaux reves she had never once failed in her duties she did not intend to fail today she didnt wince when she drove past the stand of mossdraped trees that cloaked the entrance to the swamp nor did she slow down or speed up she didnt notice that the planks on the little bridge had been replaced and the sumac hacked down she drove steadily past the site of her daughters death if there was a pang it would not have shown on her face it had not shown the day that child had been buried even when her own heart lay ripped open and bleeding out her face remained set and composed as she turned in to the narrow lane that led to the marsh house she parked behind torys station wagon retrieved her purse she didnt take one last look at herself in the rearview mirror that would have been vain and it would have been weak she stepped out of the car closed the door locked it she hadnt been to the marsh house in sixteen years she knew there had been work done on it work cade had arranged and paid for over her silent disapproval as far as she was concerned fresh paint and flowering bushes didnt change what it was a shanty a slum better bulldozed into the ground than lived in there had been a time in the swarm of her grief when shed wanted to burn it to set fire to the swamp to see it all scorched to hell but that of course was foolish and she was not a foolish woman it was lavelle property and despite everything must be maintained and passed on to the next generation she climbed the steps ignoring the charm of the long clay troth full of spilling flowers and vines and knocked briskly on the wooden frame of the screen door inside tory paused in the act of reaching for a cup she was running behind and didnt much give a damn tired to the bone shed slept late had yet to dress she was trying to gear herself up for a lecture on responsibility to scold herself for selfindulgence she hoped the coffee would help snap her system to life so she could work up the enthusiasm it would take to go into the shop and finish preparing for her opening the interruption wasnt just unwelcome it was almost intolerable there was no one she wanted to see no words she wanted to exchange she wanted more than anything to go back to bed and fight her way into the dreamless sleep that had eluded her through the night but she answered the knock because to ignore it would have been weak that at least margaret would have understood faced with hopes mother tory felt immediately guilty frazzled and embarrassed mrs lavelle victoria margaret skimmed her iceedged gaze up from torys bare feet over the rumpled robe to the top of her tousled hair this sloth she told herself with cold satisfaction was no more or less than what shed expected from a bodeen i beg your pardon i assumed you would be up by nine and preparing for the day yes yes i should be miserably selfconscious tory tugged at the belt of her robe i was im afraid i overslept i need a few moments of your time if i might come in yes of course with all her carefully learned layers of composure shredded tory fumbled with the screen door im sorry the house isnt much more presentable than i am shed found a chair shed liked a big overstuffed wingback in soft faded blue that and the little piecrust table she planned to refinish eventually were the sum total of her living room furniture there was no rug no curtains no lamp neither was there dirt or dust but tory stepped back feeling as though she were inviting a queen into a hovel her voice echoed uncomfortably in the nearempty room as margaret stood taking a silent and damning assessment ive been concentrating on setting up my shop and havent tory caught herself clutching her hands together deliberately unlaced her fingers damn it she wasnt eight years old any longer a child to be mortified and awed by the regal disapproval of a friends mother ive just made coffee she said rigidly polite would you like some is there a seat yes it seems i live primarily in the kitchen and the bedroom and will until i have my business up and running smoothly babbling tory told herself as she led the way stop babbling youve nothing to apologize for everything to apologize for please sit down at least shed bought a good solid kitchen table and chairs she thought and the kitchen was clean nearly cheerful with the little herbs shed potted on the windowsill and the darkly glazed bowl from her own stock on the table it helped to pour the coffee to set the sugar bowl out but when she opened the refrigerator fresh mortification reared up and bit pink into her cheeks im afraid i dont have any cream or milk this will do margaret nudged her cup aside a bare inch a subtle and deliberate slap if you would sit down please margaret let the silence hang a moment she knew the value of silences and of timing when tory was seated margaret folded her hands on the edge of the table and with her eyes mild and level began it has come to my attention that you have become involved with my son another beat of silence while she watched surprise flicker over torys face smalltown gossip is as unattractive as it is unavoidable mrs lavelleвђ please margaret cut her off with the lift of one finger youve been away for a number of years though you do have family connections in progress you are virtually a newcomer a stranger virtually margaret repeated but not entirely for whatever reason youve decided to return to establish a business here are you here to ask me my reasons mrs lavelle they hold no interest for me i will be frank and tell you i did not approve of my son renting you space for your business or renting you this house however cade is the head of the family and as such business decisions are his alone when those decisions and their results affect our family position it becomes a different matter the longer margaret spoke in that soft implacable tone the easier it was for tory to settle her stomach continued to jump but when she spoke her voice was equally soft and equally implacable and how mrs lavelle do my business and my choice of residence affect your family position вђњthat alone would have been difficult enough to tolerate the circumstances are inconvenient as im sure youre aware but this personal element is not in any way acceptable so while you will tolerate for now my business association with your family youre asking me not to see cade in a personal manner is that correct yes who was this cooleyed woman who remained so still so composed margaret wondered where was the spindly child whod slunk away or stared out from shadows that is problematic seeing as hes the landlord of both my home and business and seems to take those responsibilities seriously im prepared to compensate you for the time and effort it takes to relocate perhaps back to charleston or to florence where you again have family compensate me i see with deadly calm tory picked up her coffee would it be crass for me to ask just what form of compensation you had in mind she smiled a little and saw margarets jaw tighten like a bow pulled after all im a businesswoman the entire matter is crass and deplorable to me i see no choice but to sink to your level in order to preserve my family and its reputation she opened the purse on her lap im willing to write you a check for fifty thousand dollars upon your agreement to sever ties with cade and with progress i will give you half that amount today and the rest will be sent to you upon your relocation i will give you two weeks to remove yourself tory said nothing she also knew the weapon of silence that amount margaret continued with her voice sharpening will allow you to live quite comfortably during your transition oh undoubtedly tory sipped her coffee again then set the cup neatly back in its saucer i do have a question i wonder mrs lavelle what makes you think that i would be in any way receptive to the insult of a bribe dont pretend a sensibility you dont possess i know you margaret said leaning forward i know where and who you come from you may think you can hide behind a quiet manner behind the mask of some borrowed respectability but i know you you think you do but i can promise you im not feeling quiet or respectable right at this moment it was margarets composure that unraveled that had to be gathered back tightly rewound like a ball of yarn your parents were trash and let you run wild as a cat sidling down the road to push yourself on my child luring her away from her family and finally to her death you cost me one child and you wont cost me another youll take my money victoria just as your father did she was shaken now down to the heart but she held on what do you mean as my father did it only took five thousand for them five thousand for them to take you out of my sight my husband wouldnt turn them out though i begged him to do so her lips trembled open then firmed it had been the first and last time she had begged him for anything had begged anyone for anything finally it was up to me to see to it just as it is now youll go youll take the life you should have lost that night instead of her and live it somewhere else and youll stay away from my son you paid him to leave five thousand tory mused that wouldve been a lot of money for us i wonder why we never saw it i wonder what he did with it well it doesnt matter im sorry to disappoint you mrs lavelle but im not my father nothing he ever did to me could make me like him and your money wont change that im staying because i need to stay itвђd be easier not to you wont understand that but itd be easier as for cade she remembered how distant hed been how removed after her episode the night before theres not as much between us as you seem to think hes been kind to me thats all because he is a kind man i dont intend to repay that kindness by breaking a friendship or by telling him of this conversation if you go against my wishes in this ill ruin you youll lose everything as you did before when you killed that child in new york tory went white and for the first time her hands shook i didnt kill jonah mansfield she gulped in air let it out in a broken sigh i just didnt save him here was the chink margaret dug her fingers into it the family held you responsible and the police and the press a second child dead because of you if you stay here there will be talk about that talk about the part you played ugly talk how foolish tory thought to have believed no one would connect her with the woman shed been in new york with the life shed built and destroyed there nothing could be done to change it nothing could be done but face it mrs lavelle ive lived with ugly talk all my life but ive learned i dont have to tolerate it in my own home tory got to her feet youll have to leave now i will not make this offer again no i dont suppose you will ill see you outвђќ tightlipped margaret rose picked up her bag i know the way tory waited until the length of the living room separated them mrs lavelle she said quietly cade is so much more than you believe him to be so was hope rigid with pain and with fury margaret gripped the doorknob you would dare speak to me of my children yes tory murmured as the door snapped shut and left her alone in the house i would she locked the door the click was like a symbol nothing she didnt allow in would get in and nothing she told herself that was already inside would hurt her now she walked to the bathroom and stripped couldnt get her nightclothes off fast enough she ran the shower hot almost too hot to bear and stepped into the vicious heat and steam there she let herself weep not an indulgence she told herself but because as the water beat on her skin to make her feel clean again the tears washed away the scum of bitterness inside her memories of another dead child and her helplessness she cried until she was empty and the water ran cool then she turned her face up to the chilling spray and let it soothe when she was dry she used the towel to wipe the steam from the mirror without compassion without excuses she studied her face fear denial evasion they were all there she admitted had been there shed come back then shed buried herself hidden herself in work and routine and details not once had she opened herself to hope not once had she gone beyond the trees and visited the place theyd made there not once had she gone to the grave of her only real friend not once had she faced the true reason she was here was that any different from running away she wondered was it any different from taking the money that had been offered and running anywhere that wasnt here coward cade had called her a coward and he had been right she put on her robe again and went back into the kitchen to look up the number dialed waited good morning biddle lawrence and wheeler victoria bodeen calling is ms lawrence available one moment please ms bodeen it took no more than that for abigail to come on the line tory how nice to hear from you how are you are you settling in yes thanks ill be opening the store on saturday so soon you mustвђve been working night and day well im just going to have to take a trip up your way sometime soon i hope you do abigail i have a favor to ask name it i owe you a big one for my mamas ring what oh id forgotten i doubt id have come across it for years if then hardly ever use those old files what can i do for you tory i im hoping you might have some contact with the police someone who could get you information on an old case i dontвђi think youll understand that i dont want to contact the police myself i know some people ill do what i can it was a sexual homicide unconsciously tory began to press and rub her right temple a young girl sixteen her name was alice the last nameвђ she pressed harder im not completely sure lowell or powell i think she was hitchhiking on ah heading east on her way to myrtle beach she was taken off the road into the trees raped and strangled manual strangulation she let out a huge breath relieved the pressure in her chest i havent heard anything about this on the news no its not recent i dont know exactly when not exactly im sorry ten years ago maybe less maybe more in the summer sometime in the summer it was very hot even at night it was very hot im not giving you very much no thats quite a bit let me see what i can find out thank you thanks so much ill be home for only a little while longer ill give you the number here and at the store anything you can tell me anything at all would help she kept herself busy and had nearly five uninterrupted hours and still abigail didnt call back people stopped by the window off and on during the day and admired the display shed created out of old crate boxes homespun cloth and cannily selected samples of pottery handblown glass and iron work she filled her shelves and cabinets hung wind chimes and watercolors she arranged pointofpurchase items on the checkout counter then changed her mind and chose different ones willing the phone to ring she organized boxes and shopping bags when someone rapped on the door she was almost relieved until she saw faith on the other side of the glass couldnt the lavelles leave her be for one damn day i need a gift faith said the minute tory wrenched open the door and would have pushed past if tory hadnt shifted and blocked im not open oh hell you werent open yesterday either were you i only need one thing and ten minutes i forgot my aunt rosies birthday and she just called to say shes coming to visit i cant hurt her feelings now can i faith tried a pleading smile shes half crazy anyway and this might push her over the edge buy her something on saturday but shes going to be here tomorrow and if she likes her present shell come on down on saturday herself aunt rosies loaded ill buy something very expensive see that you do grudgingly tory gave way all right help me out here faith swirled in spun around what does she like oh she likes everything i could make her a paper hat and shed be pleased as punch lord youve got a lot more in here than i imagined faith reached up sent a metal wind chime whirling and tinkling nothing practical i mean i dont want to get her a set of salad bowls or that kind of thing i have some nice trinket boxes trinkets thats aunt rosies middle name then she should have the big one in the interest of getting it over and done tory walked over and chose a large beveled glass box the panels were mullioned in diamond shapes and handpainted with tiny violets and pink roses does it play music or anything no it doesnt just as well shed have it going all day and half the night and drive us all mad shell probably fill it with old buttons or rusted screws but shell love it faith flipped over the tag whistled well i see im keeping my word the panels are handcut and painted there are no two alike satisfied tory carried it to the counter ill box it for you and throw in the gift tag and ribbon very generous faith took out her checkbook seems to me youre ready for business why wait till saturday there are a few stray details yet and saturdays the day after tomorrow time does fly she glanced at the amount tory had totaled and dashed off the check while the present was boxed вђњpick out a gift tag from the display there and write what you want ill loop it on the cord вђњhmmвђќ faith chose one with a little rose in the center scrawled off a birthday greeting and added xxxвђs and oooвђs after her name perfect ill be top of her list for months now she watched tory secure the box with shiny white ribbon slide on the card then twist and loop the business into an elegant bow i hope she enjoys it she passed the box over just as the phone rang if youll excuse me sure something in torys eyes had faith stalling just let me enter that figure in my checkbook im always forgetting the phone rang a second time you just go ahead and get that ill toddle on out in just a second trapped tory picked up the phone good afternoon southern comfort вђњtory im sorry it took me so long to get back to you no thats all right i appreciate it were you able to get the information yes i think i have what youre looking for would you hold on a moment ill get the door for you faith with a little shrug faith picked up the box but as she walked out she wondered who was on the phone and why the call had made torys quick and clever hands tremble im sorry i had someone in the shop not a problem the victims name was alice barbara powell white female sixteen her body wasnt discovered until five days after the murder she wasnt reported missing for three days as her parents thought she was at the beach with friends the remains well tory the animals had been at her by then im told it wasnt pretty did they catch him she already knew the answer but she had to hear it no the case is still open but inactive its been ten years what was the date the exact date of the murder i have that here just a minute it was august twentythird вђќ god a chill ran through her into heart and bone tory what is it what can i do i cant explain not right now i have to ask you abigail if you can use your contact again if theres a way you can find out if theres any like crime in the six years before and the ten years after if you can find out if there were any other victims of that kind of murder on that date or right near that date in august all right tory ill ask but when i out one way or the other im going to need you to tell me why i need the answer first im sorry abigail i need the answer i have to go im sorryвђќ she hung up quickly then simply sat down on the floor oh august hope had been dead exactly eight years she would have been sixteen years old that summer the living brought flowers for the dead elegant lilies or simple daisies but flowers died quickly when laid on the earth tory had never understood the symbolism of leaving what would fade and wither on the grave of a loved one she supposed they brought comfort to those left behind she brought no flowers to hope instead she brought one of the few keepsakes shed allowed herself inside the small globe a winged horse flew and when it was shaken silver stars sparkled it had been a gift the last birthday gift from a lost friend she carried it across the long sloping field where generations of lavelles generations of the people of progress were laid to rest there were markers simple as a brick of stone elaborate as the rearing horse and rider cast in bronze hope had called the horseman uncle clyde and indeed he was the likeness of one of her ancestors a cavalry officer whod died in the war of northern aggression once hope had dared her to climb up behind uncle clyde and ride his great steed tory remembered hitching herself up sliding over the sunbaked metal that reddened her skin and wondering if god would strike her dead with a handy bolt of lightning for blasphemy he hadnt and for a moment clinging to the cast bronze the world spread out in greens and browns beneath her the sun beating on her head like a dull hammer shed felt invincible the towers of beaux reves had seemed closer approachable shed shouted down to hope that she and the horse would fly to them land on the top turret shed nearly broken her neck on the way down and had been lucky to land on her butt instead of her head but the bruised tailbone had been nothing compared to that moment so high on the rearing horse for her next birthday her eighth hope had given her the globe it was the only thing tory had kept from that year of her life now as they had then live oaks and fragrant magnolia guarded the stones and bones and offered shade in dapples of light and shadows they also provided a screen between that testament to mortality and the regal house that had outlasted its many owners and occupants it was a pleasant enough walk from the cemetery to the family home she and hope had walked it countless times in blistering summer in rainy winter hope had liked to look at the names carved in the stone to say them out loud for luck shed said now tory walked to the grave and the marble angel that serenaded it with a harp and said the name out loud hope angelica lavelle hello hope she knelt on the soft grass sat back on her heels the breeze was soft and warm and carried the sweet perfume of the pink baby rose bushes that flanked the angel im sorry i didnt come before i kept putting it off but ive thought of you so often over the years ive never had another friend like you someone i could tell everything to i was so lucky to have you as she closed her eyes opened herself to the memories someone watched from the shelter of trees someone with fists clenched to white bone someone who knew what it was to crave the unspeakable to live year after year with the desire for it hidden in a heart that thundered now with both that craving and with the knowledge it could feed sixteen years and shed come back hed waited and hed watched always knowing there was a chance some day she could circle around despite everything and come back here where it had all begun what a pretty picture theyd made hope and tory tory and hope the dark and the bright the pampered and the damaged nothing hed done before nothing hed done after that night in august had brought him the same thrill hed tried to recapture it when the pressure built so high and hot inside him hed reconstruct that night and its sheer speechless glory nothing had matched it now it was tory who was a threat he could deal with her quickly easily but then he would lose this fresh excitement of living on the edge maybe maybe this was just what hed been waiting for all this time for her to come back for him to have her in place again he would have to wait until august if he could a hot night in august when everything would be as it had been eighteen years before he could have dealt with her any time over the years finished her but he was a man who believed in symbols in grand pictures it had to be here where it began he thought and watching her imagining her stroked himself to climax as he had other times when in secret hed watched tory hope and tory tory and hope where it all began he thought again where it would end a shudder ran through her a chilly finger from nape to the base of her spine even as tory glanced uneasily over her shoulder she dismissed it as a product of the atmosphere and her own thoughts after all she was trespassing here an intruder among the dead and beloved the light was going fat gray clouds rolling in from the east to smother the sun there would be a farmers rain that night she wouldnt linger much longer im so sorry i didnt come that night i should have even after the beating hed never have considered that i would defy him and leave the house no one would have checked on me i could never explain to you back then what it was like when he took his belt to me the way every lash stripped away my courage stripped away my self until there was nothing left but fear and humiliation if id found the courage and gone out the window that night i might have saved us both ill never know birds were singing trills and chorus it was a bright insistent sound that should have been out of place and was instead perfect birds the hum of bees going lazy in the roses and the strong living scent of the roses themselves overhead the sky was brooding turgid with the storm clouds pushed by the wind that stayed high too high to cool the air where she knelt when she breathed it was like breathing in water it felt like drowning she lifted the globe again and sent the silver stars shimmering вђњbut iвђm back for whatever itвђs worth iвђm back and iвђll do whatever i can to make it up i never told you what you meant to me how just by being my friend you opened up something inside me and how when i lost you i let it close again for too long iвђm going to try to unlock it to be what i was when you were hereвђќ she glanced back again toward the screen of trees and the towers of beaux reves that rose behind them could they see her from there in the stone tower was someone standing closed behind the glass and watching it felt that way as if eyes and mind and heart shut behind glass watched waited let them watch she thought let them wait she looked back at the angel looked down at the stone вђњthey never found him the man who did this to you if i can i willвђќ she turned the globe then lay it under the angel so the horse could fly and the stars sparkle and leaving it there she walked away the rain was coming down strong and cool when cade swung away from town and took the road toward home it was a good rain a soaker that wouldnвђt pound the young crops if his luck was in the rain would last most of the night and leave the fields wet and satisfied he wanted to get samples of the soil from several of his fields and compare the success of his various cover crops heвђd put in fava beans the year before as they added the nitrogen his cotton was so greedy for heвђd test it the next day after the rain then compare and study the last four years of charts the fava bean crop had done reasonably well but it hadnвђt produced a solid profit if he was going to try them again he had to be able to justify it to himself cade thought no one else paid attention to his charts even piney who could usually be depended on to at least pretend an interest had glazed over when presented with the graphics didnвђt matter cade decided no one had to understand them but himself and if he was honest heвђd admit that he wasnвђt all that interested in them at the moment either he was using them to keep his mind off tory and what had happened the night before so it was best to deal with her with all of it to clear the decks before he went home and washed off the dayвђs work cadeвђs brows drew together as the red mustang convertible hed been following took the turn into torys lane he swung in behind it and those brows arched up as jr climbed out well what do you think grinning ear to ear jr patted the bright fender as cade walked over yours just picked her up this morning boots says im going through a midlife crisis woman watches too many talk shows if you ask me i say if it feels good and you can afвford it whats wrong with that shes a beauty all right with the rain streaming down both men walked to the hood so jr could pop it they stood hands on hips admiring the engine loaded too cade nodded in admiraвtion whatll she do between you me and the gatepost i had her up to ninetyfive and she stays smooth as glass handles the curves like a champ too i went on over to brodericks yesterday time to trade in my sedan planned to get another one then i saw this baby on the lot jr grinned and ran his fingers over his thick silver mustache love at first sight fourspeed cade strolled around to peer into the cockpit bet your ass four on the floor havent had me one of them since hell since i was younger than you didnt know until i popped the clutch how much ive missed it hated having to put the top up when the rain started you pop the clutch and drive around at ninety youre going to be stacking up tickets like cordwood itll be worth it jr gave the car anвother affectionate pat then glanced toward the house you stopping by to see tory thought i might good i got some news to give her she might not take well just as soon she have a friend around when i do whats wrong whats happened its nothing dire cade but itll trouble her lets just get it said all at once he stepped up on the porch knocked feels funny knocking on familys door but i got into the habit with my sister she wasnt one for leaving the door open for company theres my girl he said it heartily when tory opened the door uncle jimmy cade though her stomach did a quick pitch and jolt at seeing both of them on her porch she stepped back come in out of the wet ran into cade here seeing as both of us had in mind to stop by i was just showing off my new car obligingly tory looked out thats quite a she started to say toy and realized that was likely to hurt his feelings a machine purrs like a big old cat ill take you for a spin first fine day id like that but just now she had two big wet men in her living room one chair and a nagging headache why dont yall come out to the kitchen theres a place to sit and i just made some hot tea to chase the damp away sounds good but i dont want to track through the house dont worry about it she led the way hoping the aspirin shed taken would kick in without the tenminute nap shed planned to go with it the house smelled of the rain of the ripe wet scent of the marsh any other time she would have enjoyed it but now it made her feel closed in ive got some cookies theyre storebought but better than i could make dont you go to any trouble now honey ive got to get back home here directly but since she was already putting cookies on a plate he reached for one boots wont buy sweets these days shes on a diet and that means i am too aunt boots looks wonderful tory got out cups so do you now thats what i tell her but she fusses over the scale every blessed morning youd think gaining a pound here and there was the end of the world till shes satisfied ill be on rabbit food he took another cookie surprised my nose doesnt start to twitch he waited while she poured the tea sat heard your stores coming right along havent had a minute to get down and see for myself i hope youll make it in on saturday wouldnt miss that on a bet he sipped his tea shifted in his chair sighed tory i hate coming over here with something that might upset you but seems to me you ought to know whats what itll be easier if you tell me straight out im not sure i can exactly i had a call from your mother just a bit ago just as boots and i were finishing up our supper shes in a state or i guess you know she wouldnt have called me we dont teleвphone regular is she ill no not as what youd call sick he blew out a breath it has to do with your father seems like he got in some trouble a little while back damn it jr pushed his cup around its saucer then raised his eyes to torys appears he assaulted a woman in her mind tory heard the snakeslither of the thick leather belt the three harsh snaps her fingers jerked once then settled steady assaulted your mother said it was all a mistake and i had to pry what i got out of her with both hands what she told me is some woman claimed your father ah roughed her up tried to ah molest her he tried to rape a woman miserable jr shifted in his chair again well sari she wasnt real clear on the deвtails but whatever happened it got han arвrested hes been drinking again sarabeth didnt want to tell me that part but i pushed it out of her he got probation conвtingent on his going to alcohol rehab and such i dont figure he took it well but he didnt have much choice he picked up the tea to wet his dry throat then a couple weeks ago he lit out lit out hasnt been home sarabeth said she hadnt seen him in moren two weeks now and hes violated his probation when they pick him up hell theyll put him in jail yes i suppose shed always been surвprised in a mild distant way that hed never found himself on the wrong side of iron bars before god provided she thought sarabeth shes frantic without thinking jr dunked his cookie in his tea a habit his wife despaired over shes running low on money and shes worrying herвself sick im going to drive up and see her tomorrow see if i can get a clearer picture of things you think i should come with you now honey thats up to you no reason i cant handle this on my own and no reason you should ill go with you if thats what you want id be pleased to have the company i thought to leave bright and early you be ready round seven yes of course good thats good fine awkward now he got to his feet well get this all straightened out youll see ill come round and get you in the morning no you just sit still and drink your tea he patted her head before she could rise ill let myself out hes embarrassed tory murmured as she heard the front door open for himвself for me for my mother he told me while you were here because hed have heard the gossip lissy fraziers passing around and thought id be better with you than alone cade kept his eyes on her face she hadnt shown any reaction he marveled at her control even while it frustrated him is he right i dont know im more used to being alone are you wondering why im not particularly concerned about my father or my mother no im wondering what happened beвtween you so that youre not particularly concerned or why youre determined not to be or show that youre upset by what jr just told you whats the point in being upset whats dones already been done my mother chooses to believe my father didnt do what he was arrested for doing but of course he did if hed been drinking he wouldnt have been as careful to keep the violence inside his own doors did he abuse your mother a corner of torys mouth twitched into a parody of a smile not while i was around he didnt need to cade nodded hed known a part of him had known since the morning shed come to his door to tell them all about hope beвcause you were the easier target he hasnt been able to aim at me for quite some time ive made sure of that why are you blaming yourself im not because his eyes were steady she closed hers habit i know he used her for his punching bag after i was gone i never tried to do anything to change that not that either of them would have let me but i never tried ive only seen him twice since i was eighteen once when i was living in new york when i was happy i had this notion that we could mend the things that were broken or at least some of them they were living in a trailer then near the georgia border they moved around a lot after we left progress she sat like that with her eyes closed in the quiet while the rain pattered on the roof daddy couldnt keep a job for long someone was always in for him so he said or there was a better job another place i lost track of how many other places there wereвђdifferent schools different rooms different faces i never made any real friends so it didnt matter so much i was just biding time until i could get away save up money on the sly and wait until the law said i could leave home if id left before hedve made me come back and hedve made me pay couldnt you have gone for help your grandmother hed have hurt her tory opened her eyes looked straight into cades he was afraid of her the same as he was afraid of me and hed have done something to her and my mother wouldve sided with him she always did thats why i didnt go to her when i left if hed found out that wouldnt have set right with him i cant exвplain it to you i could never explain it to anyone the way a fear can live inside you the way it dictates how you think and how you act what you say what you dont dare say you just did she opened her mouth then closed it again before something leaped out she hadnt thought through do you want more tea sit ill get it he rose before she could and put the kettle back on to boil tell me tell me the rest i didnt tell them i was leaving home though id planned every step of what i would do where i would go i packed and ran off in the middle of the night walked into town to the bus station and bought a ticket to new york city when the sun came up i was miles away and i never inвtended to come back again but she lifted her laced fingers then closed them again like a prayer i went to see them that time she said carefully id just turned twenty been gone two years i had a job working at a store downtown a store with lovely things i made a good salary and i had my own place it wasnt much bigger than a closet but it was mine i had my vacation coming and i took the bus all the way to the georgia border to see them well maybe part of it was to show them that id made something of myself two years id been away and inside of two minutes it was like id never left he nodded hed gone away to college become a man he supposed during those four years and when hed come back the rhythm was the same but for him it had been the right rhythm one keenly missed nothing i did she went on had done could do was right look how id tarted myself up he knew the kind of life i was living up north he figured id just come home because i was pregnant from one of the men id let get at me i was still a virgin but to him i was a whore id gotten some spine in those two years just enough steel that i stood up to him the first time in my life i dared to stand up to him it took the rest of my vacation week for the bruises on my face to heal enough that i could cover them with makeup and go back to work christ tory he only hit me once but god he had big hands big hard hands and they bunched so easily into fists absently she lifted her hand to her face traced the slightly crooked line of her nose knocked me right off my feet and into the counter of that grubby little kitchen i didnt realize my nose was broken the pain was so familiar you see under the table cades own hands curled into fists that felt useless and late when he came at me again i grabbed the knife out of the sink a big blackhandled kitchen knife i didnt even think about it she said in that calm thoughtful voice it was just in my hand he mustve seen in my face that id have used it that id have loved to use it he stormed out of the trailer with my mother running after him begging him not to go he flung her off like a gnat right into the dirt and still she called after him god she crawled after him on her goddamn hands and knees ill never forget that never cade walked back to the stove to the spitting kettle to give her time to settle in silence he measured tea poured the hot water he sat again and waited you have a gift for listening finish it out get rid of it all right calm now tory opened her eyes if there had been pity in his the words might not have come but what she saw was patience i felt sorry for her i was disgusted with her and i hated her in that moment i think i hated her more than him i put down the knife and picked up my bag i hadnt even unpacked hadnt been there an hour when i walked out she was still sitting in the dirt and crying but she looked at me so much anger in her eyes whyd you have to go and make him mad you always caused nothing but trouble she sat in the dirt with her lip bleeding either from where he hit her or from biting it when she fell i just kept walking never said a word to her i havent spoken to her since my own mother and i havent had a word with her since i was twenty its not your fault no its not my fault ive had years of therapy so i can say that with assurance it was none of it my fault but i was still the cause he i think he fed on punishing me for being born for being born the way i was up till the time i showed that i was difвferent he left me pretty much alone i was my mothers problem and he rarely took time for more than an absent swat after that i dont think a week ever went by without him abusing me not sexually she said when she saw cades face he never laid hands on me that way he wanted to god he wanted to and that frightened him more so he beat me more and got twisted pleasure from it sex and violence are wrapped up tight inside him whatever they said he did to that woman he did not rape at least not that could be proved or theyd never have given him probation so easily but rapes only one way a man can hurt and humiliate a woman i know it he got up to fetch the pot and pour her tea you said youd seen them twiceвђќ not them him three years ago he came to charleston he came to my house he followed me home from work hed found out where i worked and he followed me home he caught me as i was walking from the car i was scared to death didnt have much of that steel id forged in new york left in me he said my mother was sick and they needed money i didnt believe him hed been drinking i could smell it on him she could smell it now if she let herself the stale hot stench like a bad taste in the air she lifted her cup breathed in the steam instead he had his hand around my arm i could see what he wanted to do to twist my arm to snap the bone and he was aroused by the images in his own head i wrote him a check for five hundred dollars wrote it on the spot i didnt let him into the house i would not let him into my home i told him if he hurt me or tried to get in the house that if he came to where i worked any of those things id stop payment on the check and thered never be any more money but if he took it and left and he never came back id send a hundred dollars every month she let out a short laugh he was so surprised at the idea he let me go hed always liked money just the having of it he liked to lecture about rich men and eyes of needles but he liked having money i got into the house and locked the door all that night i sat up with the phone and the fireplace poker in my lap but he didnt try to get in not then not ever a hundred dollars a month bought me a kind of peace of mind not a bad price for it she drank now a long drink of tea that was too hot and too strong and nonetheless bolstered her unable to sit she rose to stare out at the steady rain so there you have it just some of the ugly secrets of the bodeen family the lavelles have some ugly secrets of their own he got up to walk to her ran his hand down the length of the tidy braid that hung down her back you still had your steel tory you had what you needed he couldnt break it he couldnt even bend it he brushed his lips on the top of her head pleased when she didnt step aside as she usually did have you eaten what probably not sit down ill scramble some eggs what are you talking about im hungry and if youre not you should be well have some eggs she turned jerked once when he slid his arms around her tears swam into her eyes quick and stinging to be blinked ruthlessly away cade this cant go anywhere you and me tory he cupped the back of her neck until her head settled on his shoulder its already gone somewhere why dont we stay there awhile see how we like it it felt so good so steady to be held this way this easy and familiar way i dont have any eggs she drew back met his eyes ill make soup sometimes food was only a prop she was using it now cade thought maybe they both were as she stirred canned soup on the stove and he put together the makings for grilled cheese sandwiches a nice homey meal for a rainy evening the kind a couple might share with light conversation and for the hell of it a good bottle of wine he could have used an evening like that he thought instead here he was slathering butter on bread the way lilah had taught him and trying to out the way through torys thin and prickly shield you could do better than soup and a sandwich down at beaux reves i could he set the skillet on the stove and stood beside her close but not close enough to touch but i like the company here then somethings wrong with you she said it so dryly it took him a minute with a laugh he laid the two sandwiches on the heated skillet youre likely right about that after all im a hell of a catch you know healthy not overly hard on the eyes got me a big house good land and money enough to keep the wolf from the door and in addition to that and my subtle charm i make a terrific cheese sandwich all that being the case why hasnt some smart woman snatched you up thousands have tried вђњslippery are you agile he flipped the sandwiches i like to think of it as agile i was engaged once were you she said it casually as she reached for bowls but her focus had sharpened вђњumhmmвђќ he knew human nature well enough to be certain leaving it at that would swell her curiosity until she either burst or surrendered she held until theyd set plates and bowls on the table sat you think youre clever dont you darling a man in my position has to be cozy in here with the rain and all isnt it all right damn it what happened about what the way her eyes narrowed delighted him oh about deborah the woman i was on the point of vowing to love honor and cherish until death and so on judge purcells daughter you might remember the judge except i dont think he was a judge yet when you left вђњno i dont remember him i doubt the bodeens moved in his social sphere in any case he has a lovely daughter and she loved me for a while then decided she didnt want to be a farmers wife after all at least not one who actually worked at it im sorry it wasnt a tragedy i didnt love her liked her considerably cade mused as he sampled the soup she was lovely to look at interesting to talk to and well say we were compatible in certain vital areas but one we just didnt want the same thing we discovered that much to our mutual embarrassment a few months after we were engaged we broke things off amicably enough which goes to show there was considerable relief on both sides and she went off to live in london for a few months how could youвђ she broke off filled her mouth with sandwich go on you can ask i just wondered how you could ask someone to marry you that you could let go again without a qualm he considered it kicking back to chew the sandwich as if he were also chewing his thoughts i suppose there were some minor qualms but the fact is in hindsight i was twentyfive and there was a bit of family pressure my mother and the judge are good friends and he was a friend of my fathers as well time to settle down and make myself an heir or two was the idea thats awfully coldblooded not entirely i was attracted to her we knew a lot of the same people her daddy was mines lawyer for years it was easy to slide into an arrangement one that pleased both our families then as time got closer i for one began to feel like you do when your ties just a mite too tight so you cant quite get a good gulp of air so i asked myself what would my life be like without her and what would it be like with her in five years he took another bite of his sandwich shrugged turned out i liked the answer to the first part a whole lot better than i did the second and as luck would have it so did she the only ones who were truly upset were our families he paused watching her eat and we just cant live our lives around what our parents want or dont want for us can we tory no but we do live our lives carrying around the weight of it anyway mine could never accept me for who and what i was for a long time i tried to be someone and something else she lifted her gaze i cant i like who you are last night you had trouble with it some he admitted you worried me you were frantic he added laying a hand over hers before she could pull away then fragile made me feel clumsy i didnt know what to do and im used to knowing you didnt believe me i dont doubt what you saw or felt but i have to think part of it could be mixed up with coming here with remembering what happened to hope she thought about the call from abigail about the dates of both murders but she held back shed trusted before shared before and had lost everything it is all mixed up with me coming here and with hope if it wasnt for hope you wouldnt be sitting here now on more even ground again he sat back continued to eat if id seen you for the first time four five weeks ago if wed met before and thereвђd been nothing between us till then id damn well have figured out how to get myself sitting here now fact is if wed started weeks ago instead o years i do believe id already have you in that very interesting bed he smiled slow and easy when she se the spoon back down in her soup with a little plop i figure its time we got that out in the open so you can think about it the drive was pleasant enough and reminded her of all shed missed by not staying close to jr there was such a hugeness to him in his voice his laugh his gestures twice shed had to dodge his arm as hed thrown it toward her to point out something along the highway he seemed to swallow you up with his simple joy of being he sat in the little car his knees all but up to his chin his big wide hand clutching the gearshift the way shed seen some young boys clutch a joystick during a video game for the fun and competition the way he dived into the day they might have been racing to some mad picnic rather than a painful family duty living in the now she thought that was his gift and a skill shed struggled to master all her life he got such a kick out of his new car zipping and roaring up the interstate with his cds of clint black and garth brooks blasting and a natty glen plaid cap snugged down on his lambs wool mat of gingercolored hair he lost the cap just past the exit for sumter when a frisky tail of wind caught it and flipped it toward the ramp and under the wheels of a dodge minivan jr never slowed down and laughed like a lunatic with the top down and the music up conversation was exchanged in shouts but jr still managed to hold one with his topics of interest bouncing like a big rubber ball from torys store politics fatfree ice cream and the stock market as they approached the exit to florence he allowed as he hoped theyd have just a bit of time to slip by and visit his mother it was the first time since hed picked her up that he mentioned family tory shouted out that shed love to stop and see her grandmother then she thought of cecil and wondered if jr knew about the new arrangements thinking about that kept her mind occupied and entertained until they bypassed florence and headed northeast shed never been to her parents place outside of hartsville she had no idea what either of them did now for a living or how they spent their time together or apart shed never asked her grandmother and iris never brought it up nearly there jr shifted in his seat tory felt his mood shift as well last i heard han he was doing some factory work they ah leased a patch of land and were raising chickens i see jr cleared his throat as if about to speak again then fell silent until he turned off the main road onto a shoulderless twist of pitted asphalt i havent been up to see their place ah sarabeth gave me the directions when i said id come to see what was what its all right uncle jimmy dont fret about me we both know what to expect the scatter of houses that could be seen were small and skeletal yellowed bones stuck on overgrown yards or dust bowl lots a rusted pickup with its windshield cracked like an eggshell tilted on cinder blocks an ugly black dog leaped on its chain and barked viciously while less than a foot away a child wearing nothing but grayed cotton underwear and a tangle of dark hair sat on an old dented washing machine abandoned in a scrubgrass yard she sucked her thumb and stared vacantly as the spiffy convertible drove by yes tory thought they knew what to expect the road turned climbed a little then veered off in a fork jr switched off the music and slowed to a crawl to navigate the dirt and gravel path вђњyour county taxes at work he said with an attempt at a joke then only sighed and eased his car into the hardpack driveway that butted up to the house no not a house tory corrected a shack you couldnt call such a thing a house and never a home the roof sagged and like an old mans smile showed gaps where shingles had blown away or fallen off the ancient speckled gray siding was torn and ragged one of the windows was plugged with cardboard the yard such as it was choked with weeds dandelion and thistle grew in nasty abundance an black fistsized hole in the bowl beside and back from the housemetal building gray with grime and spotted with bloodcolored rust a wire fence spilled out from its side and in this enclosure a dozen or so scrawny chickens pecked at the dirt and complained the stench of them stung the air jesus jesus christ jr muttered didnt think it would be this bad you never think itll be this bad no call for this no call for it to come to this she knows were here tory said dully and pushed the car door open shes been waiting jr slammed his own door then as they walked toward the house lay his hand on torys shoulder she wondered if he was giving her support or asking for it the woman who appeared had gray hair stone gray that was scraped back pitilessly from a thin face the skin seemed to be scraped back as well so that the bones jutted out like knobs the lines that bracketed her mouth might have been carved with a knife and the deep gouge of them pulled the lips down into misery she wore a wrinkled cotton dress too big for her and a small silver cross between her lifeless breasts her eyes rimmed red as fire glanced at tory then away fast as if a look could burn you didnt say you were bringing her вђњhello mama you didnt say you were bringing her sarabeth said again then pushed open the screen havent i got worries enough jr gave torys shoulder a squeeze were here to do what we can to help sari with his hand still on torys shoulder jr stepped inside the air stank of garbage gone over of stale sweat of hopelessness i dont know what you can do less you can get that woman that lying slut down to hartsville to tell the truth she pulled a tattered tissue out of her dress pocket and blew her nose im at my wits end jr i think something awfuls happened to my han hes never stayed away so long as this why dont we sit down he transferred his hand from tory to his sister then scanned the room his stomach clenched there was a sagging sofa draped in a din yellow slipcover and a vile green recliner patched with duct tape the tables were littered with paper plates plastic cups and what he supposed was the remains of last nights dinner a woodstove streaked with soot stood in the corner hobbled on three legs with a block of wood for the fourth there was a picture of a jesus his mournful exposing his sacred heart inside a cheap wire frame as his sisters face was still buried in tissue jr led her to the sofa and sent pleading look at tory why dont i make some coffee got some instant left sarabeth lower the tissue and stared at the wall rather the look at her daughter i havent felt much like going to the store didnt want to go from home in case han saying nothing tory turned away t house was shotgun style so she walked straight back into the kitchen dishes we piled in the sink and the splatters on t stove were old and crusted her shoes stuck to the torn linoleum floor during torys childhood sarabeth to cleaned like a tornado chasing dust and grime whirling through them as though sins against the soul as tory filled the kettle she wondered when her mother had given up this nervous habit when poverty and disinterest had outweighed the illusion that she was making a home or that god would come into it as long as the floor was swept then she stopped wondering stopped thinking blocked everything out but the mechanical chore of heating water and hacking a spoon at coffee grains gone to brown concrete in a little glass jar the milk was sour and there was no sugar to be found she carried two mugs of dismallooking liquid back to the living room her stomach would have rejected even the appearance of drinking that woman sarabeth was saying she tried to lure my han she played on his weaknesses tempted him but he resisted he told me all about it i dont know where she got herself beat up probably some pervert she sold herself to but she said it was han to pay him back for refusing her thats what happened вђњall right sari jr sat on the sofa beside her patted her hand we wont worry about that part of it right now okay do you have any notion any notion at all where han might go вђњnoвђќ she shouted it jerking away from him and nearly upending the coffee tory put on the table you think i wouldnt go to him if i knew a woman cleaves to her husband i told the cops the same thing told them just what im telling you i donвђt expect a bunch of corrupt godforsaken cops to take my word but id think my own flesh and blood would believe me i do course i do he picked up a mug of coffee and gently pushed it into her hands i just thought maybe something occurred to you that maybe you remembered a couple of places that he went when he went off before its not like he went off sarabeths lip trembled as she sipped he just needs to get away and think sometimes is all men got a lot of pressure providing and sometimes han he just needs to be off by himself to think things through to pray on them but hes been gone too long now iвђm thinking maybe hes hurt tears spurted into her eyes again вђњthat woman lying about him getting him in all that trouble it was weighing heavy on his mind now the police are talking like hes fugitive they just dont understand was he going to the alcohol rehab program i guess he was she sniffed вђњhan didnt need no program he wasnt a drunk just now and then he took a bit to relaxвђќ jesus drank wine didnt he jesus tory thought hadnt made a habit of downing the best part of a bottle of wild turkey and stomping hell out of the womenfolk but her mother wouldnt see the difference theyre always on his back at work you know pushing at him cause they know hes smarter than they are and the chickens cost more to keep than we figured that bastard down at the feed and grain raised his prices so he can keep his ontheside chickie in perfume han told me how it was honey you have to face the fact that by leaving this way han broke his probation he broke the law well the laws wrong what am i going to do jr im just frantic over it and everybodys wanting money and theres nothing coming in except what i get for eggs ive been to the bank but those thieving sneaking liars took what we got in there and said how han withdrew the funds withdrew the funds they said with their prissy lying mouths ill take care of the bills he had done you dont worry about that heres what i think we should do i think you should get some things together and come on home on home with me you can stay with me and boots until everythings straight out i cant leave han could come back any minute you can leave him a note thatd just make him mad her eyes began to dart around wary birds looking for a safe place to light away from her husbands righteous fury a mans got a right to expect his wife to be home when he gets there for her to be waiting under the roof he puts over her head вђњyour roof has holes in it mama tory said quietly and earned a searing whip of stare nothing was ever good enough for was it no matter how hard your daddy worked and i sweated it was never enough always wanting more i never asked for more you were smart enough not to say it loud but i saw it saw it in your eyes sneakys what you were sneaky and sneaky and slyвђќ sarabeth said with a violent twist of her mouth and didnt you run off first chance you got never looked back either never honored your father and mother you were obliged to pay back what we sacrificed for you but you were too selfish we had a decent life in progress still would if you hadnвђt ruined itвђќ sarabeth helplessly jr gave her hand quick light pats thats not fair an thats not true she brought shame on us brought it the minute she was born we were happy before she came along she began to cry again harsh racking sobs that shook her shoulders at a loss jr put an arm around her and made shushing noises with her face and mind blank tory bent down and began to clear the litter from the table sarabeth was up like a thunderbolt what do you think youre doing since youre determined to stay i thought id clean this up for you i dont need you criticizing me she slapped the plates to the floor i dont need you coming here with your hoitytoity ways and your fancy clothes trying to make me look bad you turned your back on me years ago and as far as im concerned you can keep on walking you turned yours on me the first time you sat quiet while he beat me bloody god made man master of his own house you never got licked you didnt deserve it licked tory thought such a friendly word for horror is that how you sleep at night dont you sass me dont you disrespect your daddy you tell me where he is damn you you know you can see you tell me where he is so i can go take care of him i wont look for him if i stumbled over him bleeding in a ditch id leave him there her head snapped back when sarabeth slapped her and the raw red print stained her cheek but she barely flinched вђњsarabeth god almighty sari jr grabbed her pinned her arms while she struggled and sobbed and screamed i was going to say i hope hes dead tory spoke quietly but i dont i hope he comes back to you mama i dearly hope he comes back and gives you the life you seem to want she opened her purse took out the hundreddollar bill shed put in it that morning if and when he does you tell him this is the last payment hell ever get from me you tell him im living back in progress that im making a life there for myself if he wants to come and raise his hand to me again then he better make it last he better beat me dead this time because if he doesnt finish me i will him she closed her purse ill be in the car she said to jr and walked out her legs didnt start to shake until she sat down and pulled the door closed then the trembling started at her knees and worked up so that she crossed her arms over her torso pressed hard and with her eyes closed waited for it to pass she could hear the weeping rolling like lava out of the house and the monotonous cluck and squawk of the chickens hunting for food from somewhere close by was the deepthroated angry bark of a dog and still she thought over it all the birds sang in determinedly cheerful notes she concentrated on that sound and willed her mind away oddly unexpectedly she found herself standing in her kitchen her head on cades shoulder his lips brushing her hair resting there she didnt hear her uncle until he settled in the seat beside her and closed his door he said nothing as he pulled away from the house nothing when he stopped a half mile away and just sat his hands resting on the wheel and his eyes staring away at empty space i shouldnt have let you come he said at last i thoughtвђi dont know what i was thinking but i guess i had some idea that shed want to see you that the two of you might be able to make some of it up with han gone off this way im not part of her life except to blame for things he is her life thats the way she wants it why for gods sake tory why would she want to live like this live with a man whos never given her any joy she loves him thats not love he spat the words out along with anger and disgust thats a sickness you heard the way she made excuses for him how she put it off on everybody but him the woman he attacked the police even the goddamn bank she wants to believe it she needs toвђќ seeing he was more upset than shed realized tory laid a hand on his arm вђњyou did all you couldвђќ вђњall i could gave her money and left her there in that hovel and iвђll tell you the truth tory iвђm thanking god right now she didnвђt want to come home with me that i donвђt have to bring that sickness into my house iвђm ashamed of itвђќ his voice broke and he dropped his forehead to the wheel because he needed it tory unsnapped her seat belt and leaned into him her head on his arm her hand rubbing circles on his wide back theres no shame in that uncle jimmy no shame in wanting to protect your home and aunt boots to keep all of this away i couldve done what she asked me to do i could have given her that but i didnt and i wont im not going to be ashamed of it he nodded and struggling for composure sat back again hell of a family arent we baby gently very gently he touched his fingertips to the raw spot on her cheek then he shifted back into first eased on the gas tory if its all the same to you i dont have the heart to go by and see your gran just now neither do i lets just go home when her uncle dropped her off tory didnt go into her house but transferred to her own car and drove directly to her shop she had hours to make up for and was grateful the work and rush would keep her mind off how shed spent her morning her first call was to the florist clearing them to deliver the ficus and the flower arrangement shed ordered the week before her next was to the bakery to confirm the cookies and petits fours shed selected would be ready for her to pick up first thing in the morning it was late into the day before shed satisfied herself that all the arrangements were in the most attractive spots for a celebrational touch she began to string fairy lights through the graceful branches of the ficus the little bell on her door rang reminding her shed forgotten to lock it after the last delivery saw you as i was passing by dwight stepped in scanned the shop then gave a low whistle i was going to see if everything worked out for you and if you needed any lastminute help but seems like youve got it under control i think so she straightened standing with the end of the string of lights still in her hand your crew did a wonderful job dwight i couldnt be happier with the work just make sure you mention fraziers if anyone compliments your carpentry you can count on it oh now this is nice work he walked over to a cutting board fashioned of narrow strips of various tones of wood and sanded smooth as glass beautiful work i do some woodworking in my hobby room but nothing as nice as this almost too pretty to use form and function thats the key here lissys happy with that candle thing she bought in here and shows off the mirror every chance she gets said it wouldnt hurt her feelings if i took a look at the jewelry and found her something to brighten her mood isnt she feeling well oh shes fineвђќ dwight waved at the question as he wandered the shop gets the baby blues now and then thats all he tucked his thumbs in his front pockets and gave her a sheepish grin while im here i guess i ought to apologize oh since he appeared to be staying awhile longer tory continued to thread the lights through the branches for for letting lissy think you and cade were enjoying each others company i dont mind cades company now i dont know whether youre letting me off the hook or stringing me like you are those little lights the thing is well lissy just gets the bit between her teeth on some things she keeps trying to match cade up with someone and if its not him its wade shes got some wild hair about getting my friends married off cade just wanted to wiggle out of her last matchmaking attempt and told me to tell her he was he flushed now as tory simply studied him silently that he was what you could say involved with someone i told her how it was you figuring since youd pretty much just gotten back to town shed believe it and let things alone for a while uhhuh finished tory plugged the lights in then stepped back to gauge the results i shouldve known better dwight went on frantically digging the hole deeper god knows im not deaf and know lissy tends to talk by the time cade got back to me to ring a peel over my head id already heard from six different people the two of you were half near engaged and planning a nursery it mightve been simpler just to tell her the truth that cade wasnt interested in being fixed up now i wouldnt say simpler his handsome white teeth flashed again quick charming and male i tell her that she wants to know why i say something like some men arent looking for marriage she comes back and says its good enough for you isnt it or are you wishing you were footloose and fancyfree like your two best pals i say no honeybunch but by then ive got one foot in the doghouse trying to look pitiful he scratched his head i tell you tory marriage is a walk on a greasedup tightrope and any man who tells you he wouldnt sacrifice a friend to keep from slipping offвђs a damn liar besides the way i hear it you and cadeve been seen around together a few times are you making a statement or asking a question he shook his head i shouldve said dealing with a womans like a walk on that tightrope better quit while i can still make it to safe ground good idea well lissys having herself a hen party a womans gettogether he corrected quickly seeing torys brows shoot up im going to wander over to wades see if he wants to grab some supper and keep me company till its safe to go home ill stop by tomorrow maybe you can help me pick out some earrings or something ill be happy to he walked to the door paused it looks nice in here tory classy this place is going to be good for the town she hoped so she thought as she went behind him to lock up but more she hoped the town was going to be good for her dwight walked down to cross at the light as mayor it was important to set a good example hed given up jaywalking and drinking more than two beers a night in a bar and driving over the posted limit small sacrifices he thought but every now and again he had the urge to shake off the restraints came from being a late bloomer he supposed and gave a quick salute toward the beep of a horn as betsy gluck drove by he hadnt started to hit his stride until his middle teens then hed been so dazzled that girls actually wanted to talk to him hed stumbled straight into the backseat of his first car with lissyвђwell a few others then lissyвђfound himself going steady with the prettiest and most popular girl in school before he knew it he was renting a tux for his wedding not that he regretted it not for a minute lissy was just what he wanted she was still as pretty as shed been in high school maybe she fussed and pouted some but name him a woman who didnt they had a fine house a beautiful son and another baby on the way a damn good life and he was mayor of the town in which hed once been a joke a man had to appreciate the irony of that if now and again he got an itch it was natural enough but the fact was he didnt want to be married to anyone but his lissy didnt want to live anywhere but progress and wanted his life to keep right on going just as it was he opened the door to wades waiting room in time to be all but bowled over by a frantic sheepdog bent on escape sorry oh mongo the blonde struggling to hold the leash was both pretty and unfamiliar she sent dwight an apologetic look out of soft green eyes even while her kewpiedoll lips turned up in a quick smile he just got his shots and hes feeling betrayed cant say i blame him since doing otherwise would compromise his manhood dwight risked his fingers and patted the dog through the mop of gray and white hair dont recall seeing you or mongo around town before weve only been here a few weeks just moved down from dillon i teach english at the high schoolвђwell ill be teaching summer classes then ill start fulltime in the fall mongo sit with a toss of her hair she offered a hand sherry bellows and you can blame me for the dog hair covering your jeans dwight frazier nice to meet you im the town mayor so im the one you come to if youve got any complaints oh everythings been just fine but ill keep that in mind she turned her head back toward the examining room everyones been very friendly and helpful id better get mongo in the car before he breaks the leash and you have to give me a citationвђќ need a hand no ive got him she laughed as she and the dog lunged out the door barely nice to have met you mayor frazier bye likewise he murmured then rolled his eyes toward maxine at reception didnt have english teachers like that when i was in progress high mightve taken me a few more years to graduate you men maxine chuckled as she took her handbag out of the bottom drawer so predictable mongo was our last patient mayor doc wades washing up in the back you mind telling him im running off to make my evening lecture go right on have a nice night now he wandered back to find wade straightening the drug cabinet got any good stuffвђќ got me some steroids thatll put hair on your chest you never did grow any cause you used it all on your ass dwight said easily so how about that blonde вђњhmmвђќ jesus wade you been hitting that cabinet for doggie downers the blonde with the big dog who just left english teacher oh mongo well i see its too late dwight shook his head boosted himself up to sit on the padded table when you start missing pretty blondes who fill out their skinny jeans the way that one did and remember a big sloppy dog youre too far gone even for lissy to fix up im not going on another blind date and i noticed the blonde id say she noticed you too you hit on her jesus dwight shes a patient the dogs the patient youre missing a golden opportunity here son get your mind off my sex life you dont have one dwight leaned back on his elbows grinned now if i was single and only half ugly like you id have talked the blonde onto this table instead of her big hairy dog maybe i did in your dreams ah but theyre my dreams arent they why arent you home washing your hands for supper like a good boy lissys got a bunch of women coming over to look at tupperware or something im steering clear its makeup wade closed the cabinet door my mothers going whatever the hell christ knows the woman doesnt need any more face paint or plastic bowls but she gets bored to death when shes this pregnant so how about we have a beer and something to eat like the old days ive got some things to do around here faith could come by he thought come on wade a couple hours he started to refuse again what the hell was wrong with him locking himself in his apartment waiting for faith to call it was as bad as a teenage girl mooning after the football star worse youre buying shit cheered dwight pushed off the table lets give cade a call get him to meet us then well make him pay for it thats a plan she hadnt expected to be nervous she was prepared shed checked and rechecked every detail down to the color and weight of the cord used to secure her boxes she had experience and knew every piece of her merchandise almost as well as the craftsmen who created it she had gone through every step and stage of the creation of her shop with a calm and often cool eye and a steady hand there were no mistakes no gaps no flaws the shop itself looked perfect warm and welcoming and bright she herself looked casually professional and efficient she should as shed spent the hour between three and four that morning agonizing over her choice of outfit before settling on the navy slacks and white linen shirt now she worried it was too much like a uniform now she worried about everything less than an hour before opening and all the nerves and doubts and fears shed managed to ignore for months tumbled down on her like broken bricks she sat in her storeroom at her desk with her head between her knees the sick giddiness insulted her shamed her even as she went limp with dizziness she berated herself she was stronger than this she had to be she couldnt come so far work so hard then collapse inches from the goal they would come she wasnt worried about drawing in people they would come and they would gawk and shoot her the quick curious glances she was already used to seeing aimed at her around town the bodeen girl you remember her spooky little thing she couldnt let it matter but oh it mattered shed been insane to come back here where everyone knew her where no secret was ever truly kept why hadnt she stayed in charleston where it was safe where her life had been quiet and her privacy complete sitting there skin clammy stomach rolling she wished desperately for her pretty familiar house her tidy garden the routine of her demanding but impersonal job in someone elses shop sitting there she wished for the anonymity shed cloaked herself in for four steady years she should never have come back she should never have risked herself her savings her peace of mind what had she been thinking of hope she admitted and slowly raised her head shed been thinking of hope foolish reckless she thought hope was dead and gone and there was nothing she could do to change it now everything shed worked for was on the line and to preserve it she would have to face the stares and the whispers when she heard the knock on the shop door her first instinct was to crawl under the desk curl up and slap her hands over her ears the fact that she nearly did could actually see herself huddled there pushed her to her feet she had thirty minutes until opening thirty precious minutes to pull herself together whoever was out there would just have to go away she straightened her shoulders ran a hand over her hair to smooth it then started out to tell the early arrival to come back at ten she saw her grandmothers face on the other side of the glass and sprinted to the door oh gran oh she flung her arms around iris and clung like a woman dangling off a cliff clings to a rock im so glad to see you i didnt think you were coming im so glad youre here not come for your grand opening why i couldnt wait to get here gently she nudged tory into the shop i drove cecil crazy badgering him to push a little more speed out of his truck thats cecil behind the corn plant and boots behind the mountain of him tory sniffled then managed a laugh when cecil poked his head around the long bladelike leaves its wonderful and so are you all of you lets put itвђќ she turned around calculating space and impact right over there at the end of the display along the wall its just what i needed doesnt look to me like you needed a thing iris commented tory this place looks spiffy as a june bride all these lovely things she hooked her arm around torys shoulder studying the shop as cecil grunted the ornamental tree into place you always had an eye i just cant wait to buy something boots polished as a new penny in her yellow sundress clapped her hands like a girl i want to be your very first sale today and i warned jr i was going to have his credit card smoking before i was done ive got a fire extinguisher tory laughed and turned to hug her and lots of breakables mindful of them cecil put his hands safely in his pockets makes me feel clumsy you break it you bought it iris said with a wink all right honeypot what can we do just be here tory let out a long breath theres nothing left really im as ready as im going to be nervous terrified i just need to put out the tea and cookies keep my hands busy for the next little while thenвђ she turned as the door jangled delivery for you miz bodeen the young boy from the florist carried a gloss white box thank you my mas coming over later today said she wanted to see how her arrangement looks look but i expect she wants to see what you gotвђќ ill look forward to seeing her sure got a lot of stuff he craned his neck to look around while tory took dollar out of the cash drawer i expect peoplell be coming in soon everybody talking about it i hope so he stuffed the bill tory handed him in his pocket thanks see ya later tory set the box on the counter and took off the lid it was full of gerber daisies bright cheerful colors and fat sassy sunny flowers arent they pretty iris leaned over her shoulder for a better look and just exact right roses wouldnt go with your pottery and wood somebody knew enough to send you nice friendly flowers yes shed already opened the card somebody always seems to know the right thing oooh arent they sweet arent they pretty boots fluttered her hands over the flowers tory honey youll drive me crazy if you dont tell me who sent them boots snatched the card tory offered good luck on your first day cade awww head cocked iris pursed her lips would that be kincade lavelle yes yes it would вђњhmmmвђќ dont hmmm hes just being thoughtful man sends a woman flowers the right flowers hes got a woman on his mind right cecil seems to me thoughtfuls a plant flowers are romance вђњnow there see why i love this man iris tugged on his shirt to bring him down for a kiss and made boots beam daisies and sunflowers are friendly tory corrected but she had to struggle not to sigh over them вђњflowers are flowers boots said firmly вђњman sends them means hes thinking about a woman and she dearly loved the notion of cade lavelle thinking about her niece now you go on and fuss with them and ill put your cookies out nothing i love moreвђn getting ready for a party вђњwould you mind ive got one of the raku pots in the storeroom its perfect for these and theyll add a nice splash to the counter go on then iris waved her away you just point us in the direction things need to be done well get this show on the road the first customers walked in at ten fifteen headed by lissy tory decided to take back every unkind thought shed ever had about the former prom queen as lissy proceeded to escort her friends around the shop and coo over merchandise by eleven she had fifteen customers browsing and debating and had already rung up four sales by lunchtime she was too busy to be nervous there were stares and there were whispers her eye or ear caught more than one but she coated steel over the prickles of discomfort and boxed up the choices of the curious you used to be friends with the little lavelle girl didnt you tory continued to wrap the iron candlesticks in brown paper yes terrible shame what happened to her the woman with her sharp eagle eyes fixed on torys face leaned closer hardly more than a baby was you who found her wasnt it her father found her would you like a box or a bag for these a box theyre for my sisters girl getting married next month seems you went to school with her kelly anne frisk i dont remember many of the people i went to school with tory lied with a pleasant smile as she boxed the purchase it was so long ago would you like this giftwrapped ill do that honeypot youve got other customers iris stepped in so kelly annes getting married i believe i remember her quite well thatd be marshas oldest girl wouldnt it my where do the years go kelly anne had nightmares for a month after the lavelle girl the woman said it with a quiet satisfaction that rang in torys ears as she walked away tory was tempted to slip into the back just to breathe until her heart stopped pounding instead she turned to a tall brunette who was debating over the selections of serving bowls can i help you with anything its hard to make up your mind with so many nice choices jobeth hardyвђkelly annes aunt there shes a very disagreeable woman and you can hardly say anything that you always were a careful composed creature you wonвђt remember meвђќ the brunette held out a hand вђњ no im sorry well i was considerably younger then and you werent in my class i taught still teach second grade at progress elemental marietta singleton oh miss singleton i do remember i sorry its nice to see you again ive been looking forward to your opening ive wondered about you off and on over the years you might not have known was friendly with your mother once yes before you were born of course its a old world yes it is sometimes a little too close for comfort she glanced toward the door as faith walked in the two of them locked eyes and that contact sparked before marietta turned back to study the bowls again but its all we have to live with i think ill take this one here the blue on whites very charming why dont you put it behind the counter for me while i wander around little more id be happy to ill get you one out the stockroom victoria marietta lowered her voice brushed her hand over the back of toryвђs вђњyou were very brave to come back here you always were very brave she moved away while tory stood puzzled and surprised by the wave of grief that had flowed off the woman and into the air she stepped into the stockroom to clear her mind and fetch the bowl and was annoyed when faith marched in behind her what did that woman want i beg your pardon this is employees only what did she want marietta coolly tory reached on the shelf for the bowl this a number of people who come here want merchandise thats why i call it a store what did she say to you and why would that be your business faith hissed between her teeth and dug a pack of cigarettes out of her purse no smoking damn it she shoved them back in and began to pace that woman has no business flouncing around town that woman seemed perfectly nice to me and i donвђtвђ have time for you snits or your gossipвђќ though she couldnt deny her was peaked now unless youd like help me replace stock or refill the iced tea pitcher ill need you to step back outвђќ вђњyou wouldnt think she was so nice if shed been fucking your daddy with that one snarling outburst faith whirled for the door tory remembered faiths temper very well and anticipating her mood tory shifted the bowl and slapped a hand on the door before faith could wrench it open dont you make a scene dont you bring your family troubles into my place you want to have a catfight then you just go somewhere else i wont make a scene but she was vibrating i have no intention of giving the people around here anything to snicker about and you just forget what i said i shouldnt have said it weve gone to considerable trouble to keep my fathers association with that woman quiet so if i any talk ill know you started it dont threaten me the day you push me around is long past so you pull in your claws around here nowadays i fight back she would have left it at that was angry enough to but faiths lip trembled one small quiver of emotion and tory saw hope why dont you stay in here a minute go on sit down until youвђre calm again you walk out looking like that and you wonвђt have to make a scene to set people talking besides right now theyвђre having a fine time talking about me she opened the door glanced over вђњno smoking she repeated and closed the door behind her faith dropped into a chair and glaring at the door pulled her cigarettes out again she stuffed them guiltily back into her purse when the door swung back open but instead of tory it was boots who slipped into the room just because she was having a high time flitting around the store didnt mean she was blind to subtleties shed seen the hot rage on faiths face just as she saw the embarrassed misery on it now we sure are hopping out there she spoke cheerfully and waved a hand in front of her face i needed me a minute out of the crowd and thought it the perfect opportunity to corner the woman who had wade wrapped in knots why dont you sit down miss boots faith got quickly to her feet i was just going back out oh keep me company a minute wont you honey dont you look pretty today then you always doвђќ вђњthanks i can say the same for you now that she was standing faith wished she had something to do with her hands вђњah you must be very proud of tory todayвђќ вђњiвђve always been proud of her and howвђs your mama doingвђќ вђњsheвђs wellвђќ never known her to be otherwise for long you be sure to give her my best now wont you smiling easily boots wandered over to the bakery box selected a cookie havent seen wade today have you i expect hell be over no i havent seen him today yet boy works so hard she sighed nibbled on the little frosted cookie i wish hed settle down find a woman whod help make a home with him ah вђњhmmmвђќ oh now no point in being flustered sweetie boots kept nibbling and her eyes were sharp enough to pin even a clever butterfly like faith hes a grown man and youre a beautiful woman why shouldnt you be attracted to each other i know my boy has sex well faith thought there you have it but youd prefer he didnt have it with me now i dont believe i said any such thing she selected another cookie held it out to faith were private here faith and both of us women that means we know just how to draw a man into doing what we want him to at least most of the time you got a wild streak i dont mind that could be id pictured some other kind of woman for my wade but he pictures you i love him so i want for him what he wants for himself that appears to be you its not like that between us mrs mooney the formal title amused boots if she wasnt mistaken the use of it meant faith was intimidated isnt it you keep coming back to him dont you ever ask yourself why no she said lifting a finger tipped with pearly pink polish maybe you should just think about that i want you to know ive got an affection for you always have that surprises you stupefied her yes i suppose it shouldnt youre a smart and clever young woman and havent had it as easy as some like to think i like you fine faith but if you hurt my wade this time around why ill just have to snap that lovely neck of yours like a twig thats all well faith bit into the cookie narrowed her eyes that clears everything up suddenly bootss face was soft again and her eyes mild and dreamy as always she let out a light trilling laugh and to faiths confusion wrapped her in a hug kissed her cheek i do like you with her thumb she wiped the imprint of her lipstick from faiths cheek now you sit down and eat your cookie till you feel a little better since im feeling just fine i believe ill go out and buy something else theres nothing like shopping is there she added as she pranced out the door jesus speechless faith sat down and ate her cookie tory kept busy but saw faith go out ten minutes later just as she saw cade come in his aunt rosie in tow during the first lull of the afternoon it was impossible not to recognize rosie sikes larue decater smith at sixtyfour the woman made just as much of a statement as she had at her debutante ball when shed shocked society by doing an exuberant barefoot jitterbug on the tennis court of the country club shed married henry larue of the savannah larues when shed been seventeen and lost him to korea before their first anniversary shed grieved for six months then had opted to play the merry widow flaunted a hotblooded affair with a struggling artist and suspected communist whom shed married for the hell of it at twenty she and the artist both espoused free love and held what many considered orgies at their estate on jekyll island she buried husband number two there after nineteen tumultuous years when he tumbled from a thirdstory window after spending the evening with a bottle of napoleon brandy and a twentythreeyearold model some said foul play was involved but nothing had been proved at the ripe age of fiftyeight she married a longtime admirer more out of pity than love he died two years later on their second anniversary after being gored and partially devoured by a rogue lion during their second honeymoon trip to africa burying three husbands and an untold number of lovers hadnt dimmed rosies style she wore a wig at least tory assumed it was a wig of platinum blond a flowing floorlength dress striped like a redandwhite awning and enough jewelry to topple a lesser woman tory spotted the gleam of diamonds among the plastic beads toys she said in her rusty squeak of a voice and rubbed her hands together stand back boy im in a shopping mood she made a beeline for the display of blownglass paperweights and began tucking them into the crook of her arm torn between amusement and alarm tory hurried over may i help you with those miss rosie need six of them the prettiest six yes of course ah for gifts gifts hell for me she clanked glass carelessly together and made torys heart stop why dont i put these up on the counter for you good theyre heavy rosies eyes weighed down by false eyelashes that disconcertingly resembled spiders finally fixed on torys face youre the girl who used to play with little hope yes maam got a way about you i recollect i had my palm read once by a gypsy in transylvania said how id have myself four husbands but damned if i want another rosie stuck out a hand crowded with rings and bracelets what do you say im sorry instead of feeling awkward tory was marvelously entertained i dont read palms tea leaves then or some such one of my lovers young fellow from boston claimed he was lord byron in another life dont expect to hear that kind of thing from a yankee do you cade get on over here and hold on to these glass things whats the point in having a man around if you cant use him as a pack mule she said to tory with a wink i have no idea would you like some iced tea miss rosie some cookies ill just work up an appetite first now what the blue hell is this thing she picked up a polished wooden stand with a hole in it its a wine rest dont that beat all why anybodyd want to give a decent bottle of wine time to rest is beyond me wrap me up two of those lucy talbott she shouted across the room to another customer whatre you buying there and was off like a rocket red and white stripes flapping we just cant break aunt rosie out of her shell cade said with a smile and hows your day going very well thank you for the flowers theyre lovely im glad you liked them im hoping youll let me take you out to dinner tonight to celebrate your first day iвђ she already begged off the evening at her uncles switching that to a sunday family dinner the following day she was going to be tired and wired she reminded herself not fit company id like that ill come by your place around seventhirty that work for you yes thatll be perfect cade does your aunt really want all these things i dont know what anyone could want with six glass paperweights shell enjoy them then shell forget where she bought them and make up some story about how she found them in a dusty little shop in beirut or claim she stole them from her lover the breton count when she left him then shell give them away to the paperboy or the next jehovahs witness who comes to her door oh well youll want to keep an eye on her she tends to slip things in her pockets absentmindedly he continued when torys eyes went wide you just keep track of what goes in and add it to her bill at the end butвђ even as she glanced over she saw rosie slide a spoon rest into the wide slit pocket of her dress oh for heavens sakes tory rushed over leaving cade chuckling rosie hasnt changed any iris commented no maam not a whit bless her for it how are you miz mooney fiddle fit youre looking fit yourself grew into your feet well enough hows your family theyre well thank you i was sorry to hear about your daddy he was a good man and an interesting one you dont always get both in one i suppose you dont he always spoke highly of you he gave me a chance to earn a decent living after i lost my husband to put food on my table for my children i dont forget that you got something of him around your eyes are you a fair man like he was now that youre fullgrown kincade i try to be as rosie let out a cackle and batted at the wind chimes to send them singing cade glanced over met torys exasperated eyes torys got her hands full she can deal with it shes good at dealing with things sometimes maybe a little too good she gets her back up when you want to help she can iris agreed from where im standing i dont think the only thing you want to do about tory is help her id say theres something more basic on your mind along with that and as i hope im correct in that assumption id like to give you something everyone needs from time to time and no one likes to take he adjusted the balance of the paperweights he still carried and that would be advice she beamed at him youre a smart boy always thought so advice it is just one little bit of it dont drag your feet if theres one thing every woman deserves at least once in her life its to be swept off hers now give me some of those things before they get banged together and cracked shes not sure of me yet cade transferred two of the paperweights and carried the other four to the counter she needs some time she tell you that more or less iris just rolled her eyes men dont you know a woman who says thats either one of three things shes not really interested shes being coy or shes been hurt before toryd tell you straight out if she wasnt interested there isnt a coy bone in her body so that leaves number three you see that man over there baffled cade glanced over to where cecil was arranging fresh cookies on a plate with hands the size of whole smoked hams yes maam you hurt my baby and ill send that big old bear after you with a pipe wrench but since i dont think youre going to do that id suggest you show her that there are some men worth trusting im working on that since my girl is trying to convince herself that the two of you are no more than friendly acquaintances id say work faster chew on that iris mused then moved off to try to prod another customer into a sale she put five napkin rings into her pocket at sixten with the door locked and cecil nodding off in the stockroom tory plopped on her counter stool and threw up her hands five now i could see in a twisted way taking four or six but what kind of person takes five napkin rings dont imagine she was thinking of them as a set add two spoon rests three wine toppers and a pair of salad tongs she put those in her pocket while i was standing right there talking to her put them in her pocket smiled then took off her pink plastic beads and gave them to me still bemused tory fingered the beads around her neck she likes you rosies always giving things to people she takes a shine to i dont feel right charging her for all those things she might not even have wanted them lord gran she spent over a thousand dollars a thousand she repeated and pressed a hand to her stomach i think i might be sick after all no you wont youll be happy soon as you let yourself be now im going to go give cecil a shake and move him along so you have a chance to catch your breath you come on by jrs around one tomorrow its too long since we had the family together ill be there gran i dont know how to thank you for staying all day you must be tired my feet are smarting some and im ready to put them up and let boots give me a glass of wine she leaned over to kiss torys cheek you celebrate you hear celebrate tory thought after shed made her notes tidied and locked up she could barely think much less celebrate shed gotten through the day more than gotten through it she told herself on the dazed drive home shed proven that she was back to stay back to make a mark not just survival this time but success some might look at her and see the small holloweyed girl in handmedowns but it wasnt going to matter more would look and see just what shed made herself what she wanted to be she would make that matter she wasnt going to fail and she wasnt going to run this time finally she was going to win the wonder of that began to set in as she turned into her lane as she saw the house as it had been and as it was herself as she had been as she was unable to fight them back any longer she laid her head on the steering wheel and let the tears come she was sitting on the ground trying not to cry only babies cried and she was not a crybaby but the tears leaked out despite her shed skinned her knees and her elbow and the heel of her hand when shed fallen off the bike the scraped skin burned and seeped blood she wanted to go to lilah and be hugged and petted and soothed lilah would give her a cookie and make it all better she didnt care about learning how to ride a stupid bike anyway she hated the stupid bike it lay beside her a downed soldier with one wheel still spinning in a mocking whirl as she lay her head on her folded arms and sniffled she was just six hope what the heck are you doing cade rushed down the lane his nikes bulleting on the gravel his father had dropped him off at the entrance to beaux reves giving him his freedom for the rest of the saturday morning his whole world had been wrapped around how quickly he could get his bike and ride to the swamp to meet up with wade and dwight and here was his old and beloved threespeed crashed with his baby sister sprawled beside it he wasnt sure which he wanted to do more yell at her or croon to his wounded bike oh man look at this you ruined the paint damn it he hissed the last he was just beginning to try out swear words in secret you got no business taking my bike you got your own its a baby bike she lifted her face and tears streaked through the fine layer of dirt on her cheeks mama wont let daddy take off the training wheels well jeez guess why disgusted he righted his bike and sent her a superior look go on inside and get lilah to wash you up and keep your sticky fingers off my stuffвђќ i just want to learn she swiped a hand under her nose and through the tears shone a light of defiance i could ride as good as you if somebodyd teach me yeah right he snorted swung a leg over the bar youre just a little girl she sprang to her feet then thin chest heaving with insult ill get bigger she said between her teeth ill get bigger and ill ride faster than you or anybody then youll be sorry oh now im shaking the amusement was coming back sliding into his deep blue eyes crinkling them at the corners if a guy was going to be saddled with a couple of little sisters the least he could do was tease them ill always be bigger ill always be older ill always be faster her bottom lip trembled a sure sign more tears wanted to come he sneered at her shrugged and began to pedal up the lane popping a quick wheelie just to prove his superior talents when he glanced back grin wide to make sure shed witnessed his prowess he saw her head was bent her tangled hair hanging forward in a curtain a thin trickle of blood slid down her shin he stopped rolled his eyes shook his head his friends were waiting there were a zillion things to do half of saturday was already gone he didnt have time to waste on girls especially sisters but he heaved a weighty sigh and rode the bike back as annoyed with himself as with her now he hopped off get on damn it she sniffled again knuckled her eyes and peered at him really yeah yeah come on i havent got all day joy sprang into her rushing her heartbeat as she climbed onto the seat as her hands clutched the rubber tips of the handlebars she giggled pay attention this is serious business he glanced back toward the house and hoped to god his mother didnt chance to look out shed have them both skinned for supper no you gotta like center your body it embarrassed him to say body though he couldnt say why and keep looking forward she looked up at him all trust her smile bright as the sunlight that streamed through the new spring leaves вђњokayвђќ he remembered the way his father had taught him to ride and kept his hand on the back of the seat jogging lightly as she began to pedal the bike wobbled comically they made it three yards before she went down she didnt cry didnt hesitate to get back on he had to give her points for it they pedaled and jogged together up the lane and down again past the big oaks the sunnyfaced daffodils the young tulips while late morning waned away to afternoon her skin was slicked with sweat now and her heart kept bumping bumping bumping more than once she bit her bottom lip hard to hold back a squeal as the bike tipped she heard his breath near her ear felt his hand reach to steady her and was filled with love for him more than for herself now it was for him she was determined to succeed i can do it i can do it she whispered to herself as the bike tipped and was righted her eyes narrowed in the fierce concentration of a child with only one goal one world one path her legs trembled and the muscles in her arms were tight as drums the bike wobbled under her but didnt fall and suddenly cade was jogging along beside her a grin splitting his face youre doing it keep going youre doing it im riding under her the bike became a majestic steed with her face lifted she rode like the wind tory woke on the ground beside her car her muscles trembling her pulse pounding with an ache of joy and joys lost in her heart shed forgotten about dinner until minutes before cade knocked thered barely been time to wash her face and repair the damage from the crying jag and what had followed it and no time at all to think of an acceptable excuse to send him away she couldnt get her mind around it the bout with tears had left her hollow head and body the swing back into hopes past brought both uneasiness and sorrow and a thrill that was the oddest part of it she admitted this lingering thrill of that first solo ride the sheer delight of wobbling down that lovely shadedappled lane with cade running beside her the way his eyes so blue so bright laughed into hers the love shed felt for him the innocent love of a sister still shimmered through her and mixed dangerously she knew with her own emotions that were very adult and had nothing to do with kinship the combination made her vulnerable to herself and to him better wiser to be alone until it passed shed tell him she was exhausted too tired to eat that at least would be the truth he was a reasonable man almost too reasonable she told herself hed understand and let her be when she opened the door he was standing there holding a casserole dish neighbors she thought brought food for death well she was dead on her feet so it seemed appropriate enough вђњlilah sent this he stepped in handed it over she said anyone who worked as hard as you shouldnt have to cook on top of it youre instructed to put this in the freezer and pull it out the next time you come home and just need to sit and put your feet up which he added as he continued to study her face looks like tonight yes she thought almost too reasonable i hadnt realized how geared up i was about today now that its over im limp youve been crying delayed reaction relief she carried the dish into the kitchen to put it away then wondered what to do next im sorry about tonight it was a nice idea going out to celebrate maybe in a couple of days we couldвђ she turned all but bumped into him then backed hard against the counter there was a roughandready jolt of lust from her from him she couldnt be sure you had a lot to deal with today he didnt give her room he figured hed already given her plenty he simply laid his palms on the counter on either side of her caged her in he saw her awareness of the move in her eyes the wariness вђњa lot of people and the memories they bring along with them yes she started to shift realized there wasnt anywhere to go it was her blood that was hot she thought with some embarrassment running hot fast and greedy it seemed like memories were shooting out like pebbles from a slingshot and had ultimately taken her down all of them painful no oh god dont touch me but even as she thought it his hands were on her shoulders running down her arms everything inside her body began to pulse it was wonderful to see lilah and will hanson he looks just like his father now when i was a girl mr hansonвђold mr hanson used to give me grape nehi on credit if i was a few pennies short i often was cade his name was almost a plea she couldnt have said for what she was trembling the little jumps under his palms were wonderfully arousing i liked the way you looked today all tidy and crisp all calm and cool on the outside always makes me wonder whats going on under the surface i was nervous it didnt show not the way its showing now defenses down tory i want them down im going to take advantage of it cade ive got nothing in me then why are you trembling he tugged the band from her hair heard the quick catch in her breathing his eyes stayed on hers watching the irises darken as he combed his spread fingers through her hair and unwound the neat braid why arent you stopping me i was that her knees going weak shed forgotten that could be such a lovely sensation surrender wasnt always weakness im thinking about it he smiled then a lazy slide of amusement with power at the edges you just keep right on thinking ill keep right on taking advantage he undid the first button of her shirt then the second hed taught hope to ride a bike she thought hed only been ten years old and already man enough to care hed sent flowers today the right flowers because hed known theyd please her now he was touching her as she hadnt been touched in so long im out of practice he flipped the third button open thinking no her breath came out on a shaky laugh im very good at thinking most of the time then think about this he gave her shirt a little tug to pull it from the waistband of her slacks i want to touch you i want to feel your skin under my hands like this he skimmed them up her sides down her stomach quivered when he unhooked her slacks no keep your eyes open he leaned forward caught her chin in his teeth a brief nip that shot an ache down the center of her body since youre out of practice ill just guide you through and i want you looking at me when i touch you look straight ahead hed told hope and had steadied her i want to look at you she told him he lowered the zipper slowly knuckles grazing against her her own low moan echoed like thunder in her ears it had been so long since a man had wanted her since a man had made her want she wanted to tense go rigid at the thought of the invasion of privacy of self but her body was already yearning step out he murmured when her slacks pooled at her feet as she blinked opened her mouth to speak he simply covered it with his gentle and warm somehow reassuring even as the edge of something reckless shimmered at the edges then his arms were around her sliding and skimming over her back as he circled her a kind of seductive waltz toward the doorway nerves chased after the heat that rose to her skin cade i want to take you in the light she was already his no barrier of doubt would stop him so i can see you when youre under me when im inside you at the door of the bedroom he lifted her there are all manner of things ive imagined doing to you in this bed let me the sun streamed rich and gold with the spring evening it washed over the bed over her face as he laid her down the mattress gave under his weight and he linked his fingers with hers restraint and unity and watching her always watching her he took her mouth slowly at first and sweetly until her hands relaxed under his until her lips softened parted invited he felt her heartbeat begin to slow begin to thicken and as she opened for him he changed the texture and set to ravage the sudden demand stabbed into her shocking the senses scraping the nerves she arched as heat balled in her belly and the groan strangled in her throat he aroused her to shudders with his mouth he didnt want her to anticipate wanted all her senses stunned and her mind empty of all but pleasure she would think of him only of him he would see to it when she was steeped in him finally he would have her her body was slender the muscles surprisingly firm almost tough with delicate skin a delightful contrast he indulged himself in the taste of it while part of him calculated how to exploit those nerves and destroy every barrier he dragged her up hands rough grip near to bruising ripping another gasp from her as her head fell back her hair tumbled then he used his fingertip to nudge the straps of her bra over each shoulder he danced his fingers lightly over the swell with his thumb circled her nipples through the cotton is it coming back to you yet her head was so heavy her skin so hot what good he unhooked her bra drew it aside but when she reached for him he pressed her hands flat on the bed sliding them back until her elbows locked i want you to take this time take until you cant take any more then youll let go and youll give everything his mouth all but savaged hers ripping down to her gut with one jagged and panicked thrill she wanted to resist to push him back before he dragged her over a line shed sworn never to cross again but then his mouth was on hers again the scrape of teeth the flick of tongue whipping hot points of pleasure into her her back arched willful invitation and her hips began to rock little cries and whimpers she couldnt bite them back her arms trembled from the strain even as her body gloried in it something frantic was clawing inside her fighting to break free a hard fast orgasm shocked her eyes wide left her stunned and embarrassed then he was pulling her against him wrapping her close let go he rolled her back on the bed tugging off his shirt her eyes were blurred now her breath as ragged as his this time when she reached for him he slid into her arms his mouth was urgent his hands impatient as they molded and pressed and stroked she dragged at his trousers desperate now that nerves had been swallowed by needs he stripped them aside then sent her flying when he yanked up her hips and used his mouth on her her hands locked around the rungs of the bed as hed once imagined her head whipped to the side as sensations dark delights swamped her his taste his scent flooded her senses swelled them until there was nothing else her breath sobbed out an instant before her long mindless cry of release even as her hands went limp he locked his around them his heart was pounding a rage of blood the last lights of day and the dying breeze of evening brushed over her face her hair was a wild mass over the pillows her cheeks flushed he would remember this always and so he promised himself would she open your eyes tory look at me when her lids fluttered up he clung to the last link of control bent his head kissed her long deep say my name the pressure had built again the terrible glorious heat of it cade say it again her fingers flexed under his she wanted to weep or scream cade again and plunged into her her mind went brilliant she moved with him matching each slow smooth stroke absorbing him feeding on each individual sensation until they became one glorious feast cade hot and hard inside her the weight of him solid strong the spread soft and smooth on her back the iron slick against her hands and the last rays of light going gray with dusk when the rhythm quickened she was ready she was eager and enraptured by the way his eyes the stunning blue of them remained fixed on hers stay with me he was lost in her now drowning in her now his heart beat brutally against hers as he buried his face in her hair with their hands still gripped they let go shed never been taken over so completely not by anyone not even the man shed loved tory imagined she should be worried about it but at the moment she couldnt work up the energy for concerns and calculations she lay under him while the air in the room softened in the twilight for the first time in much much too long to remember she felt completely relaxed body and mind she had a hand tangled in his hair it seemed all right to leave it there when he turned his head and his lips brushed the side of her breast she smiled at the lazy pleasure of it i guess we celebrated after all she murmured and wondered if it would be terribly rude to slide into sleep just like this well be sure to find a lot more to celebrate from now on ive been wanting to get you here since i helped you cart this bed in i know her eyes were nearly closed but she felt him move his head again felt him look at her you werent all that subtle about it a lot more subtle than i wanted to be he thought of how hed imagined gilding their first time with music and candlelight we did fine without them she said sleepily without what without the music and her eyes flew open filled with horror and met his considering ones im sorry im sorry she tried to push up push away but the weight of him held her in place what are you sorry for i didnt mean to she pressed her hands into the bed gripped the spread and was already beginning to shake it wont happen again im so sorry i didnt mean toвђќ read my mind he shifted so that he could brace on his elbows and frame her face in his hands stop it i will im terribly sorry no damn it tory stop pulling in stop anticipating my reactions and goddamn it stop wondering if and when im going to take a crack at you he shifted to sit up then lifted her to face him her cheeks had lost that rosy contented glow and were pale her eyes looked strained near to terrified he hated it did it ever occur to you that there might be times a man wouldnt mind having a woman read his mind its an inexcusable breach of privacy yeah yeah to her shock he rolled over and pulled her with him so she was sprawled over his chest seems to me a few minutes back the two of us breached each others privacy pretty damn effectively you want to snatch a stray thought out of my head ill let you know if it pisses me off i dont understand you you ought to have a pretty good clue since im lying here naked in your bed he kept his voice deliberately careless if that doesnt do it take another look inside see what you find she didnt know whether to be insulted or horrified its not like that no tell me what its like then when she shook her head he cupped the back of her neck and began to rub tell me what its like i dont read minds it doesnt happen by accident or hardly ever its just that we were very closely connected physically i cant argue with that and i was nearly asleep sometimes it can sneak up on you when youre drifting like that you had an image in your head it was a very clear distinct thought and it just came through candlelight music playing the two of us standing by the bed i saw it in mine so what were you wearing when her head snapped up he shrugged never mind i can think that one through for myself you get images pictures of thoughts sometimes he looked so relaxed so at ease where was his anger god you confuse me good itll keep you on your toes is that the way it always works no no because if you have any decency you dont go poking into someone elses private thoughts i block them out its simple enough as they only come through with effort anyway or if theres a great deal of emotion on either side or if im very tired all right then id say the next time we make love and youre drifting off to sleep id better keep any fantasies about meg ryan out of my head meg baffled tory sat up again automatically crossing an arm over her breasts meg ryan wholesome sexy smart cade opened his eyes seems to be my type he cocked his head studied her just trying to picture you as a blonde it could work im not going to be a party to some prurient fantasy youve cooked up about a hollywood actress miffed she started to climb off the bed and found herself flat on her back again and under him oh come on darling just this once no god you giggled meg shes got this sexy little giggle he nipped torys shoulder now im excited get off me you idiot i cant he rushed wild kisses over her face foolish and sweet as a puppy im a victim of my own helpless fantasies giggle again im begging you no but she did dont dont you even think aboutвђjesus her laughing struggles stopped as he slid silkily inside her her hips arched up and her hands gripped his hips dont you dare call me meg he lowered his head chuckling as he took her they ate lilahs casserole and washed it down with wine and tumbled back into bed with the eagerness and energy that fuels new lovers they made love at moonrise with the light shining silver over their joined bodies then slept with the windows open to a fitful breeze and the ripe green scents of the marsh hes coming back hope sat crosslegged on the porch of the marsh house the porch that hadnt been there when shed been alive she tossed her handful of silver jacks then began bouncing the little red ball while her hand darted deft and quick plucking the starshaped metal hes watching вђњwho who is he watching tory was eight again her thin face wary her legs bruised he likes to hurt girls she scooped up the last jack tossed them again it makes him feel big important twosies in that same steady rhythm she began snatching up pairs he hurt other girls too not just you not just me hope agreed you already know threesies jacks clattered the ball thumped methodically on wood a light breeze danced by twined up with the scent of rambling roses and honeysuckle you already know like when you saw the little boys picture that time you knew i cant do that anymore inside the childs chest torys heart began to swell and bump i dont want to do that anymore you came hope said simply and moved onto foursies you have to be careful not to go too fast not to go too slow she continued as she swiped a set of four and nipped the ball on the bounce or you lose your turn tell me who he is hope tell me where to find him i cant she swept for another set and knocked a finger against another jack sent it spinning oops she looked over at tory with clear eyes its your turn now be careful torys eyes shot open her heart was knocking against her ribs and her hand was curled into a tight fist so tight she was nearly surprised that a little red ball didnt roll out when she spread her aching fingers it was full dark now the moon had set and left the world black and thick the little breeze had gone with it so the air was still hushed she heard an owl and the shrill bell sound of peepers she heard cades steady breathing in the dark beside her and realized shed moved to the edge of the bed as far from him as was possible no contact in sleep she thought the mind was too vulnerable then to permit the luxury of casual snuggling she slipped out of bed and tiptoed into the kitchen at the sink she ran water until it chilled then filled a tumbler the dream had given her a desperate thirst and had reminded her why she had no business sleeping with kincade lavelle his sister was dead and if she wasnt responsible she was obligated shed felt obligated before and had followed through the path shed taken had brought her great joy and shattering grief shed slept with another man then given herself out of careless and innocent love when shed lost him lost everything shed promised herself shed never make those choices those mistakes again yet here she was opening herself to all that pain a second time cade was the kind of man women fell in love with the kind she could fall in love with once that step was taken it colored everything you thought everything you did and felt in the bold hues of joy in the drowning grays of despair so the step couldnt be taken not again she would have to be sensible enough to accept the physical attraction enjoy the results of it and keep her emotions separate and controlled what else had she done nearly all of her life love was a reckless dangerous thing there was always something lurking in the shadows greedy and spiteful just waiting to snatch it away she lifted the glass to her lips and saw beyond the window beyond the dark in the shadows she thought dully waiting and the glass slipped from her fingers to shatter in the sink tory cade shot out of sleep out of bed and stumbled in the dark cursing he rushed toward the kitchen she stood under the harsh light both hands at her throat staring staring at the window someones in the dark tory he saw the sparkle of broken glass that had jumped from the sink to the floor he grabbed her hands are you cut someones in the dark she said again in a voice much like a child watching from the dark hes been here before and hell come back again her eyes stared into cades through them and all she saw were shadows silhouettes what she felt was cold so much cold hell have to kill me im not the one but hell have to because im here its my fault really anybody could see that if id come with her that night hed have just watched like hed done before hed have just watched and imagined doing it just imagined until he got hard and used his hand so he could feel like a man her knees went out from under her but she protested as cade swept her up im all right i just need to sit down lie down he corrected when he put her back on the bed he hunted up his trousers you stay in here where are you going the sudden terror of being left alone brought strength back to her knees she leaped up you said someone was outside im going to go look no now the fear was all for him its not your turn what she held up both hands and sank down onto the mattress im sorry my minds confused hes gone cade hes not out there now he was watching earlier i think earlier when we were вђќ it made her queasy when we were making love he watched grimly cade nodded ill look anyway you wont find him she murmured as cade strode out but he wanted to he wanted to find someone and use his fists use his fury he switched on the outside lights scanned the area washed in pale yellow he walked to his truck got a flashlight out of his toolbox and the knife he kept there armed he circled the house sweeping the light over the ground into the shadows near the bedroom window where the grass needed trimming he crouched beside a flattened area where a man might have stood son of a bitch he hissed it between his teeth and his hand tightened on the hilt of the knife he straightened spun around to stalk into the marsh he stood on the verge and strained against impotence he could go in thrash around work off some of his anger and by doing so leave tory alone instead he went back inside left the knife and flashlight on the kitchen table she still sat there her fists bunched on her knees she lifted her head when he came in but said nothing she didnt have to what we did together in here was ours cade said he doesnt change that he sat beside her took her hand he cant if we dont let him he made it dirty for him not for us not for us tory he murmured and turned her face to his she sighed once touched the back of his hand with her fingers youre so angry how do you tie it up that way i kicked my truck a couple of times he pressed his lips to her hair will you tell me what you saw his anger blacker than yours ever could be but not i dont know how to explain not substantial not real and a kind of pride i dont know maybe its more a satisfaction i cant see itвђsee him im not the one he wants but he cant let me stay he cant trust me this close to hope i dont know if those are my thoughts or his she squeezed her eyes shut shook her head i cant get him clear its as if somethings missing in him or in me i dont know but i cant see him it wasnt a drifter who killed her the way we thought all these years no she opened her eyes again turned away from her own grief and toward his it was someone who knew her who watched her us i think i knew that even back then but i was so afraid i closed it up if id gone back the morning after if id had the courage to go in with you and your father instead of telling you where she was i might have seen i cant be sure but i mightвђve then it wouldve been over we dont know that but we can start to end it now well call the police cade the police her throat wanted to close its very rare that even the most forwardthinking openminded cop listens to someone like me i dont expect to find that particular breed here in progress chief russ might take some convincing but hell listen to you cade would make sure of it why dont you get dressed youre going to call him now at four in the morning yeah cade picked up the bedside phone thats what he gets paid for police chief carl d russ wasnt a big man hed reached the height of fivefeetsixandaquarter when he was sixteen and had stayed plugged there he wasnt a handsome man his face was wide and pitted with his ears stuck on either side like oversized cup handles his hair was as grizzled as a usedup scouring pad he had a scrawny build and topped the scale at one thirty fully dressed and soaking wet his ancestors had been slaves fieldworkers later theyd been sharecroppers eking out stingy livings on another mans land his mother had wanted more for him and had pushed prodded harangued and browbeat until mostly out of selfdefense he aimed for more carl ds mother enjoyed the fact that her boy was police chief nearly as much as he did he wasnt a brilliant man information cruised into his brain meandering about taking winding paths and detours until it settled down into complete thoughts he tended to be plodding he also tended to be thorough but above all carl d was affable he didnt bitch and moan about being awakened at four in the morning hed simply gotten up and dressed in the dark so as not to disturb his wife hed left her a note on the kitchen board and had tucked her latest honeydo list in his pocket on the way out what he thought about kincade lavelle being at victoria bodeens house at four in the morning he kept to himself cade met him at the door thanks for coming chief oh well thats all right carl d chewed contentedly on the stick of big red gum he was never without since his wife had nagged him into quitting smoking had yourself a prowler did you we had something lets take a look around the side see what you think hows your family doing theyre fine thanks heard your aunt rosie was down for a visit you be sure to give her my best now ill do that cade shone his flashlight on the grass under the bedroom window waited while carl d did the same and pondered well could be yвђall had somebody standing there playing peeping tom mightve been an animal he scanned with his light chewed contemplatively its a quiet spot off the road a ways dont see that anybodyd have good cause to be wandering round out here guess they could come across from the road or out through the swamp you get any kind of a look no i didnt see anything tory did guess ill talk to her first then do some poking around anybody was out heres hightailed it by now he got creakily to his feet and swept his light over the darker shadows where the live oaks and tupelos closed in the swamp yeah this heres a quiet spot all right couldnt pay me to live out thisaway bet you hear frogs and owls and such all blessed night long you get used to them cade said as they walked around to the back door you dont really hear them i guess thats the way you get sos you dont hear the usual sounds anymore and something thats not usual gives you a kind of jolt would you say that i suppose i would and no i didnt hear anything me im what you call a light sleeper least little thing pops my eyes open now idamae she wont stir if a bomb goes off he stepped into the kitchen blinked at the bright lights then politely removed his cap morning miz bodeen chief russ im sorry for the trouble dont you worry about that would that be coffee i smell yes i just made it let me pour you a cup sure would appreciate that heard you had a nice turnout at your store today my wife sure enjoyed herself got one of those wind chimes fussed about it the minute i got in the door nothing would do but i hang it up right off the bat makes a pretty sound yes they do what would you like in your coffee oh a half a pound of sugars all he winked at her you dont mind well sit down here and you can tell me about this prowler of yours tory shot cade a look before she set out the coffee and sat someone was at the window the bedroom window while cade and i were carl d took out his notepad and one of the three chewedup pencils in his pocket i know this is a mite awkward for you miz bodeen you try to relax now did you get a look at the person at the window no no not really i woke up and came into the kitchen for a drink of water while i was standing at the sink i he was watching the house watching me us he doesnt want me here hes stirred up that i came back who the same man who killed hope lavelle carl d set his pencil down and tucking his gum in the pocket of his cheek picked up his coffee to sip how do you know that miz bodeen oh his tone was mild she thought but his eyes were the cool flat eyes of a cop she knew cops eyes intimately the same way i knew where to find hope the morning after she was killed you were there she knew her voice was belligerent her posture defensive she couldnt help it you werent chief then no ive only been chief for going on six years chief tate he retired moved on down to naples florida got himself a motorboat does a lot of fishing chief tate he always was one for fishing russ paused i was a deputy the summer little hope lavelle was murdered terrible thing worst thing ever happened around these parts chief tate he figured it was a drifter did what was done to that little girl never found any evidence to the contrary you never found anything tory corrected whoever killed her knew her just like he knows me and you and cade he knows progress he knows the swamp tonight he came up to the window of my house but you didnt see him not in the way you mean carl d sat back pursed his lips considered my wifes granny on her mas side holds whole conversations with dead relatives now im not saying thats the true case or that its not as im not the one having those chats but in my job miz bodeen it comes around to facts the fact is i knew what had happened to hope and where she could be found the man who killed her knows that chief tate didnt believe me he decided id been out there with her then had run off when i got scared left her there or that i found her after she was dead and just went home and hid until morning there was kindness in carl ds eyes hed raised two girls of his own you were hardly more than a baby yourself im grown up now and im telling you the man who killed hope was out there tonight hes killed others at least one other a young girl he picked up hitchhiking on the way to myrtle beach hes already targeted someone else not me im not the one he wants you can tell me all this but you cant tell me who he is no i cant i can tell you what he is a sociopath who feels he has the right to do what he does because he needs it needs the excitement and the power of it a misogynist who believes women are here to be used by men a serial killer who has no intention of stopping or being stopped hes had a run of eighteen years she said quietly why should he stop i didnt handle that very well cade closed the back door sat back down at the table he and carl d had walked the property scouted the edges of the swamp theyd found nothing no fresh footprints no handy torn swatch of material on a tree branch you told him what you know he doesnt believe me whether he does or not hell do his job like they did their job eighteen years ago he said nothing for a moment the reminder of that morning was always a quick sharp jab to the gut who are you blaming tory the cops or yourself both no one believed me and couldnt explain myself i was afraid to i knew id be punished and the more i said the worse the punishment in the end i did what i could to save myself didnt we all he pushed away from the table went to the stove to pour coffee he didnt want i knew she was out of the house that night knew she planned to sneak out i didnt say anything not then not the next day not ever about seeing her bike hidden that night i considered it the code you dont tattle unless youre going to get something out of it so what if she wanted to ride off for a couple of hours he turned back to see tory watching him the next day when we found her i didnt say anything that was selfpreservation theyd blame me as much as i blamed myself after a while there just didnt seem to be a point we were all missing a piece and could never get it back but i can go back to that night replay it in my head only this time i tell my father how hopes stashed her bike and he locks it up and gives her one hell of a talkingto the next morning she wakes up safe in her bed im sorry oh tory so am i ive been sorry for eighteen years and over that time ive watched the sister i have left do whatever she could to ruin her life i saw my father pull away from all of us as if being with us hurt more than he could stand and my mother coat herself with layer on layer of bitterness and propriety all because i was more interested in my own affairs than seeing to it hope stayed in bed where she belonged cade there would have been another night there wouldnt have been that one i cant fix it tory and neither can you i can find him sooner or later iвђll find him or hell find me she thought hes already found me i have no intention of standing by this time while someone else i care about takes foolish risks he set the coffee aside you need to pack some things go stay with your aunt and uncle i cant do that i have to stay here i cant explain it to you except to say i have to stay here if im wrong there is no risk if im right it wont matter where i am he wouldnt waste time simply arguing heвђd find a way to arrange it as he thought best then ill pack a few things of my own excuse me im going to be spending a lot of time here itll be more convenient to have what i need close at hand dont look so surprised one night in bed doesnt make us lovers but that he said pulling her to her feet is what were going to be youre taking a lot for granted cadeвђќ i dont think so he caught her face in his hands kissed her sliding her closer until her lips softened warmed beneath his i dont think im taking a thing for granted most particularly you lets just say you get your feelings about things tory things you know without being able to explain them so do i ive had one of those feelings about you and im going to stick close until i can explain it attraction and sex arent such a puzzle cade they are when you havent found and fit in all the connecting pieces you let me in tory you wont get me out again half as easy its a clever trick how you manage to be annoying and comforting at the same time she drew away and im not sure i let you in at all you just pretty much go where you please true enough and he wouldnt bother to deny it going to try to kick me out it doesnt look like it good that saves us an argument well since were up and dressed why dont we do some business business ive got those samples out in the truck ill bring them in and we can negotiate tory glanced at the clock it was still shy of seven why not this time you make the coffee faith waited until half past ten when she was certain both her mother and lilah had left for church her mother had long since given up expecting faith to attend sunday services but lilah was bullheaded about god and often considered herself his drill sergeant whipping the troops out of bed and into church with threats of eternal damnation whenever she was home faith was careful to hide and hide well on sunday mornings she made up for it by occasionally putting on a demure dress and presenting herself in the kitchen so lilah could shuffle her off toward redemption but this particular sunday she wasnt in the mood to be obliging or to sit on a hard pew and listen to a sermon she wanted to sulk over a breakfast bowl of chocolate ice cream and remind herself what bastards men were when she thought of all the trouble shed gone through for wade mooney she could just spit hadnt she slathered herself all over with perfumed cream slithered into the sexiest lingerie money could buyвђand would have been perfectly willing for him to rip those bits of satin and lace right off her body too shed dug out fourinch heels and had strapped herself in an excuse for a little black dress that shouted i want to sin shed raided the wine cellar for two bottles that cost more than a college education and when cade found out he was going to skin her for it and when shed arrived at wades primed polished and perfumed he hadnt had the decency to be home bastard worse shed waited for him shed tidied up his bedroom like a little hausfrau had lighted candles put on music then had damn near nodded off during the vigil shed waited another hour till almost one in the morning primed for a different purpose oh how shed wanted him to walk in the door so she could have kicked his inconsiderate ass all the way back down the steps it was his fault that shed gotten half drunk on the wine and certainly his that due to the alcohol content in her blood shed misjudged the turn through the gates and had scraped the side of her car so it was absolutely his fault that she was sitting there on a sunday morning miserably hung over and stuffing ice cream in her face she never wanted to see him again in fact she thought she would just give up men altogether they werent worth the time and trouble they drained out of a woman shed just cut them out of her life and find other areas of interest cade walked in the door as faith was digging her spoon back into the halfgallon carton and since he knew what mood dictated that particular behavior tried to slip right out again but he wasnt quite quick enough oh sit down im not going to bite you she lighted a cigarette then proceeded to smoke with one hand and eat with the other everybodys gone off to church to save their immortal souls aunt rosie went with lilah i think she likes to go to lilahs church more than she does mamas i caught a glimpse of them as they were leaving aunt rosie had a hat on big as a turkey platter and limegreen tennis shoes so she couldnt be going with mama sorry i missed it he got a spoon sat and scooped out some ice cream so whats wrong why should anything be wrong im just as content as a goose with a nest of golden eggs she blew out smoke narrowed her eyes against it and took a good look at him his hair was a little damp so the gilt edges of it stood out that meant a recent shower since cade never bothered to do more than rub a towel over his hair to dry it off after one his eyes blue as her own were lazily content his lips quirked in a halfassed smile she knew just what sort of activity put that look on a mans face you havent changed clothes since yesterday havent been home have you well well well i guess somebody got lucky last night cade licked his spoon studied her in turn and i guess somebody didnt im not going to sit here and discuss my sex life over your breakfast ice cream you and tory bodeen isnt that just perfect i like it cade scraped out another spoonful dont get in the way of this faith why should i what do i care just dont know what you see in her is all shes pretty enough but shes got a coolness around her sooner or later shell freeze you out shes not made the way the rest of us are youd find out differently if you took time to get to know her she could use a friend faith well dont look at me i make a lousy friend you can ask anyone and i dont even much like her you want to bang her a few times thats your business hey she looked up full of surprised insult when he grabbed her wrist thumped their joined hands to the table its not like that his voice had gone soft as silk and there was the warning gleam of temper in his eyes sex isnt a casual pastime to everyone youre hurting me no youre hurting yourself he let her go then rose to toss his spoon in the sink thoughtfully faith rubbed her wrist what im doing is making damn sure im not hurt you want to lay your heart out so somebody can stomp on it thats fine for you but ill tell you one thing i know for sure you dont want to be falling in love with tory thats something thats never going to work i dont know whether i want to or not i dont know whether itll work or not he turned back what you dont seem to know faith is how much youre like her the two of you barricaded against your own feelings in case just on the off chance that something might sting she does it by closing in and you do it by acting out but its the same damn thing im nothing like her she shouted it at him as he walked from the room im nothing like anybody but myself furious she heaved her spoon across the room and leaving the ice cream melting on the table stormed upstairs to dress she had to take it out on somebody and since through the maze of her thinking it all stemmed back to wade he was elected she dressed for this bout too she had her pride and wanted to look stunning when she skewered him straight through the heart ripped him into little pieces then dumped him and danced away singing a happy tune she wore silk tailored and trim in a deep blue to bring out her eyes and make him remember them she started to shove open the door to his apartment stopped herself and knocked formally she heard yips and whines on the other side and rolled her eyes hed brought one of his sick mutts upstairs how had she ever let herself get to this stage with a man who thought more of a stray dog than he did of a woman willing to jump his bones thank god shed come to her senses then he opened the door rumpled sleepyeyed wearing only jeans he hadnt bothered to button and she remembered how shed gotten to this stage with this particular man her juices wanted to rise and churn but she ignored them and grabbing his hand slapped the key into it what thats for starters i have a few things to say to you then ill take my leave she shoved him aside and strode in shed worn heels that showed off her legs in the short dress just to torment him what time is it she gritted her teeth he was simply destroying her timing its nearly noon oh christ it cant be i have to be at my mothers in an hour he sank into a chair buried his head in his hands ill probably be dead in an hour you will if i have anything to do with it she leaned down sniffed reared back you smell like the inside of a cheap bottle of bourbon it was an expensive bottle of bourbon and im not inside it its inside me his stomach rolled uneasily for the moment so she slapped her hands on her hips you were out getting drunk and tomcatting around half the night i hope you enjoyed yourself im not entirely sure i think i started out that way because she continued furious at the interruption thats how you can spend every saturday night from now on as far as im concerned jealousy veered in and cut pride off at the pass who the hell was she who he took a chance and let go of his head he was vaguely disappointed when it didnt roll off his shoulders who was who the little slut you think you can twotime me with and live she picked up the closest thing at handвђa small lampвђyanked the cord free and heaved it the resulting crash had howls coming from the bedroom and brought wade unsteadily to his feet you son of a bitch is she still here who what the hells wrong with you you broke my lamp ill break your neck before im done she whirled raced into the bedroom intending to rake the eyes out of the woman whod usurped her place on the bed stood a small black puppy barking wildly and cowering against the pillows where is she who wade threw up his hands his hair was standing on end and there was a kickboxer working out behind each of his eyes where is who what the hell are you talking about faith the bitch youre sleeping with the only bitch ive slept with recently besides you is that one he gestured toward the bed and shes only been here a couple of hours really she means nothing to me you think you can joke about this just where were you last night i was out goddamn it he stalked to the bathroom shoving bottles and tubes aside as he searched for aspirin in the medicine chest you were out all right i came by at nine and stayed till nearly oneвђ damn it she hadnt meant to tell him shed waited so long you never showed up ready to whimper he shook out four pills swallowed them with tepid tap water i dont recall us having plans for last night you dont like to make plans ties you down takes the excitement out of things he leaned back on the sink stared at her balefully well this is exciting it was saturday night you had to know id come by no faith i dont have to know anything you dont want me to know anything she tossed her head they were getting off the subject i want to know where you were and who you were with thats a lot of demands from someone who doesnt want any strings his eyes might have throbbed like drums but they could still go hard straight sex fun and games arent those the ground rules i dont cheat she said with some dignity when im with a man i dont go off with another i expect the same consideration i wasnt with another woman i was with dwight oh thats just a bullshit lie dwight fraziers a married man and he wasnt out half the night drinking and carousing with you i dont know where he was after about ten home tucked in with lissy i expect they went to the movies and i tagged along his voice had gone flat his eyes cold and dull they went home i bought a bottle i went for a drive i got drunk i came home if id done anything else with anyone else id have been free to do so same as you are thats the way you wanted itвђќ вђњi never said that you never said different im saying different now you cant have it all your way faith you want to change things you want it to be you and me then we start adding some of my rules i didnt say anything about rules he was twisting things just like a man im speaking of common courtesy and that means i sit around here and wait until youre in the mood for my company i dont think so we both come and go as we please unless were pleased to be together or we make this a relationship no more sneaking in here or off to some motel no more pretending were not involved were either a couple or were not youre making ultimatums her voice snapped at the end a whiplash of shock youre making them to me after you kept me waiting here half the night frustrating isnt it the waiting pisses you off he pushed away from the sink and walked toward her makes you feel used and sorry and hurt i know stymied she pushed a hand through her hair you never said anything about that youd have taken off like a shot thats your style faith sometime last night while i was sitting down at the river with a bottle for company it occurred to me that i didnt like that about you and i didnt like it about myself that i let you be that way with me so im telling you now we try to make this work like people who give two damns about each other or we walk away you know i care about you wade what do you take me for it was more he thought what she took herself for there was a time id have taken you no matter what that times over i want more now faith if you cant give it to me or wont ill live with it but im not settling for crumbs anymore i dont understand this shaken she sat on the edge of the bed the puppy crawled toward her on her belly sniffing i dont see how you can turn this around on me not on you on us i want there to be an us faith im in love with you what are you crazy she leaped up again panic in every pore dont say that ive said it before but you never listened it didnt matter enough this time itll have to matter or i wont say it again im in love with you he caught her shoulders thats the way it is whatever you do about it what am i supposed to do about it there was a loose and fluttery sensation in her stomach she recognized as pure panic oh this is just a mess your usual response to me telling you i love you is to run off and marry somebody else he lifted his brow as her mouth fell open thats notвђi dontвђ oh god he was right she did we could try something new this time out we could try dealing with this like normal people and see where it goes we could spend time with each other do more together than jump into bed theres more between us than sex she sniffled how do you know he laughed a little brushed at her hair all right lets say i want to find out if theres more between us than sex what if there isnt what if there is what if there isnt he sighed then i guess well end up spending a lot of time in bed if theres anything left of it he added and stepped over to tug away the pillow the puppy was trying to chew to bits he was so solid so smart and kind and handsome and he loved her but no one ever loved her for long lighten it up faith ordered herself at least until her heart stopped jumping i dont know about a relationship with a man who sleeps with little mongrel dogs miss dottie dropped her off this morning on her way to church i was too hung over to do anything but plop us both in bed whats wrong with her who oh the puppy nothing he leaned over ruffled fur scratched ears brighteyed and healthy had all her shots and took them like a champ then what are you doing with her keeping her for you for me faith took a full step back i dont want a dog sure you do he plucked the puppy from the bed then pushed her into faiths arms look she likes you puppies like everybody faith protested as she twisted her head to try to avoid the pups cheerful tongue exactly with the dimples flickering in his cheeks wade slipped his arms around faiths waist sandwiching the puppy between them and everybody likes puppies shell depend on you entertain you keep you company and love you no matter what shell pee on the rug shell chew my shoes some shell need discipline and training and patience shell need you theyd known each other most of their lives just because theyd spent most of their time together between the sheets didnt mean she didnt have clues as to how his mind worked is this a dog or a life lesson youre giving me both he leaned over to kiss faiths cheek give it a try if it doesnt work out ill take her back the puppy was warm and trying desperately to snuggle in the curve of faiths neck and shoulder what was going on it seemed everyone was hammering at her all at once first boots then cade and now wade youve got my head spinning i cant keep up with you today and thats the only reason im agreeing to this to us or to the puppy a little bit of both thats a good enough start for me theres puppy food in the kitchen why dont you go feed her while i get a shower im going to be late for dinner at my folks why dont you come with me thanks but im not ready for family dinners quite yet she remembered all too well the cool clear gleam in his mothers eyes go on and shower you stink worse than a litter of puppies she frowned as she carried the puppy into the kitchen she wasnt sure if she was ready for any of this any of it at all tory had barely unlocked the door on monday morning when it chimed open morning im sherry bellows i tied my dog to your bench outside hope thats all right tory glanced out saw a hairy mountain sitting docilely on the sidewalk its fine hes big isnt he and beautiful hes a doll baby we just got back from a morning run in the park and i thought id stop in i was here saturday for a little while you had quite a crowd yes it kept me busy is there something i can show you or would you just like to browse actually i wondered if you were thinking of taking on any help sherry flipped back her ponytail lifted her arms im not exactly dressed for job hunting she said with a smile and tugged the damp tshirt down over her running shorts but i just followed impulse i teach at the high school will teach summer classes starting middle of june then fulltime in the fall it doesnt sound like you need a job ive got the next couple of weeks then saturdays and half days through september id enjoy working in a place like yours and the extra money a parttime job would bring in i put myself through college working retail so i know the ropes i can give you references and i dont have a problem working for minimum wage to tell you the truth sherry i havent really thought about hiring at least not until i see how the business goes for the first few weeks it cant be easy to run the place solo if there was one thing sherry had learned while pursuing her teaching degree it was persistence no breaks no time to do paperwork or check inventory or make your orders since youre open six days a week that doesnt give you much opportunity to run errands do your banking your shopping i imagine you ship dont you well yesвђ youd have to close the shop every time you needed to scoot down to the post office or wait to ship orders until the next morning before you opened that adds extra hours to your day anybody who can put together a business like this on her own knows her time is worth money tory took another good look sherry was young pretty damp from jogging and very direct and she had a point tory had been in the shop since eight boxing orders for shipping doing paperwork rushing to the bank and the post office not that she didnt enjoy it it gave her a lovely flush of satisfaction but it would become more and more demanding as time went on at the same time she wasnt sure she wanted to share her shop with anyone even parttime there was a deep pleasure in having it all to herself and that she admitted was indulgent and impractical вђњyouвђve caught me off guard why dont you write down your address and phone number and those references tory walked behind the counter for her clipboard give me some time to think about itвђќ terrific sherry took the pen tory offered tapped it on the clipboard and i come with a partner a twoforone deal she nodded toward the window where two women had stopped to admire mongo hes so precious people cant help but want to give him a good pet since theyre standing there theyll just have to look at your display i bet they come in clever tory lifted a brow maybe i should just buy a dog sherry laughed and began to write oh youd never find another like my mongo and as good as he is he cant ring up sales good point and good call she added quietly when the two women stepped into the shop is that your dog hes mine sherry turned beaming i hope he didnt bother you why hes the sweetest thing just a great big ball of fur gentle as a lamb sherry assured them we just had to stop in and see all the pretty things in here isnt this a wonderful place very nice i dont recall seeing it before we just opened saturday tory told her i havent been down this part of town for quite a while the woman glanced around her friend was already wandering i do like those candle stands in the window weve just moved into a new house and im doing some redecorating ill get them out for you tory glanced at sherry excuse me oh you go right on take your time sherry watched as tory assisted the customers lowkey she noted well she could do lowkey let the merchandise sell itself but she didnt think it would hurt if she chatted it was so hard for her not to and she thought it might be a nice balance against torys quiet class shed get the job sherry determined as she continued to write and keep one eye on the procedure she was good at talking people into things and she really could use the extra money to gild the lily a bit she enthused over the customers choices drew them into friendly conversation while tory boxed and wrapped they left happy and well loaded down that was nice but i think you could have talked sally into those garden plaques if she wants them shell be back amused tory filed the credit card receipts and im banking on her friend talking her into it over lunch youre good with people do you know anything about crafts im a very fast learner and since i admire your taste in merchandise itll be an easy lesson i can start right away tory was on the point of agreeing something about sherry hit all the right notes then the door opened and her mind emptied of everything but terrorized shock hello there tory hannibal spread his lips in a wide wide smile been a while he shifted his eyes spread that bright look over sherry that your dog out there missy yes thats mongo i hope you didnt mind him oh no indeed looks to be as friendly as a sunday social mighty big dog for a little thing like you saw you running with him in the park a while ago couldnt tell who was leading who sherry felt a quick ripple of unease but managed a laugh oh he lets me think im in charge a good dogs a faithful friend more faithful than people mostly tory arent you going to introduce me to your friend here hannibal bodeen he said before tory could speak and held out the big hand hed so often used to silence her im victorias daddy its nice to meet you relaxed again sherry gave his hand a warm shake you must be so proud of your daughter and what shes done here hardly a day goes by i dont think of it his eyes pinned tory again and her tory shoved at the edges of shock if he was here she had to deal with him and deal with him alone sherry i appreciate your coming in ill look this over and call you soon i appreciate that im trying to talk your daughter into hiring me maybe you could put in a good word nice to have met you mr bodeen ill wait to hear from you tory she walked out crouched by the dog tory could hear her delighted laughter and the dogs welcoming bark through the closed door well now he put his hands on his hips and turned to study the shop this is quite a place youve got here looks like youre doing pretty well for yourself he hadnt changed why hadnt he changed did he look older he didnt seem to he hadnt lost his girth or his hair or that dark gleam in his eyes time didnt seem to touch him and when he turned back she felt herself shrinking she felt the years and all the effort shed put into remaking herself slipping away what do you want real well for yourself he stepped up to the counter closing the distance and she saw shed been wrong at least partially wrong there was some age on his face carved into deep lines around his mouth sagging in his jowls scored across his brow like whiplashes you come back here to flaunt that in your old hometown pride goeth before a fall victoria how did you know i was here did mama tell you a fathers a father all of his life ive kept my eye on you did you come back here to boast and to shame me i came back here for myself it has nothing to do with you lies lies lies it was here you set the town talking had them pointing fingers it was here you defied me and the lord for the first time the shame of what you did and what you were drove me from here margaret lavelles money in your pocket drove you from here a muscle jumped in his cheek a warning so people are talking already i dont care for that a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue theyll talk more if you spend any time around here and those who are looking for you are bound to find you ive been to see mama shes worried about you got no cause to im head of my own house a man comes and goes as he sees fit runs you ran after you were caught and arrested and charged for assaulting that woman you lit out and left mama alone and when they catch you this time there wont be probation theyll put you behind bars you mind your mouth his hand shot out she was prepared for a blow was braced for it but he grabbed her shirtfront and hauled her half over the counter you show me respect you owe me your life it was my seed started you into this world to my everlasting regret she thought of the scissors under the counter imagined them in her hand as he dragged her over another inch and wondered as she looked into the terrible and familiar rage in his face if she was capable of using them if you lay a hand on me i swear ill go straight to the police you hit me and ill tell them and ill tell them of all the times you left me bruised and battered when im doneвђ she gasped fought not to cry out when he yanked her hair back with his free hand and the rough edge of his fingers scraped like a burn over the side of her throat tears of pain leaked out of her eyes and made her voice rasp when im done theyll nut more bars around you i swear it now you let me go and you walk out of here ill forget i ever saw you you would dare to threaten me its not a threat its a fact the fury and hate rolling out of him almost smothered her she could feel her throat closing against it her chest clogging she wouldnt be able to hold out much longer let me go she kept her eyes on his as she slid her hand under the counter feeling for the scissors let me go before someone comes through and sees you emotions lit over his face fear added to the mix of violence pumping from him her fingers brushed the cool metal handles and he jerked her to the side all but rammed her into the cash register i need money you give me what youve got in there you owe me for every breath youve ever taken there isnt much it wont take you far she opened the cash drawer pulled out money with both hands anything to get him out anything to get him away that lying whore back in hartsville will burn in hell he kept his hand on her hair as he stuffed the money in his pocket and so will you youll already be there she didnt know why she did it she couldnt foresee future events she couldnt predict that was one small blessing but she focused her eyes on his and spoke as if ripe with visions you wont live the year out and youll die in pain and fear and fire youll die screaming for mercy the mercy you never gave me he went white and shoved her away from him so that her back hit the wall and supplies tumbled he lifted an arm pointing thou shalt not suffer a witch to live you remember that you tell anyone you saw me here today ill come back for you and do what should have been done the minute you were born born with a cowl over your face devils mark youre already damned he shoved out the door ducked his head and hurried away tory simply slid down to the floor already damned she stared blankly at the scissors teetering on the edge of the under counter shed nearly had them in her hand very nearly one of them would have been in hell if shed firmed her grip on them she wasnt sure she would have cared which one of them at least it wouldve been over she brought her knees up pressed her face into them and curled into a ball as shed done so often as a child thats how faith found her when she came in with a wriggling puppy under her arm jesus tory with one glance she took in the open and empty register the scatter of supplies and the woman trembling on the floor god are you hurt she set the puppy down and as it scampered joyfully away rushed behind the counter lets have a look let me have a look at you im all right its nothing getting robbed in broad daylight in this town is something youre shaking all over did they have a gun a knife no no its okay i dont see any blood well ouch youre a little raw back here on the neck ill call the police you want a doctor no no police no doctor no police i just saw some big brute of a man skulking out of here walk in and see your cash register open empty and you sprawled behind the counter and you dont want the police what do they do in the big city when they get robbed make cupcakes i wasnt robbed exhausted she let her head fall back and rest against the wall i gave him the money under a hundred dollars the money doesnt matter then you want to give me some while youre at it cause if thats how you plan to run your business you wont be here very long im going to be here im going to stay here nothings going to make me run away again nothing no one not ever again faith didnt have much experience with hysteria unless it was her own but she thought she recognized it in the rise of torys voice the sudden wildness in her eyes thats the spirit why dont we just get up off the floor here go on in the back a minute i said im all right then youre stupid or a liar either way lets go tory tried to push her away tried to stand on her own but her legs wouldnt manage it they buckled as faith pulled her up and left her no choice but to lean well just go on back im going to leave the puppy out here the what dont you worry about him hes about half housebroken you got anything back here to drink thats got a bite to it no that figures tidy tory wouldnt have herself a bottle of jim beam in the drawer now sit down catch your breath then tell me why im not calling the police it would just make it worse because because it was my father you saw leaving the store i gave the money to him so hed go away he put that mark on you when tory simply stared faith drew a deep breath in and out guess its not the first time oh hope didnt tell me i imagine you swore her to secrecy but i had eyes i saw you with bruises and welts plenty of times always had a story about falling down or running into something but the funny thing was i never noticed you being clumsy as i recall you had a number of those welts and bruises the morning you came to tell us about hope faith walked over to the minifridge found a bottle of water opened it is that why you didnt meet her that night because hed walloped you she held out the water gauging torys silence i guess ive been focusing my blame on what happened back then on the wrong person tory took the water soothed her throat the person to blame is the one who killed her we dont know who that is its more of a comfort to put blame on a face and a name you can pick up that phone call the police and bring charges chief russll go after him i just want him gone i dont expect you to understand people never do but surprise considering tory faith eased a hip onto the desk my papa rarely raised a hand to me i think i got a swat on the butt from time to time and shame the devil less often than i deserved it but he sure knew how to shout and how to strike terror in a young girls heart oh god she missed him it catapulted into her the longing for her father not because i thought hed take a strap to me she said quietly now but because he let me know every time i let him down i was afraid to let him down thats not the same thing as this i know it but im asking myself if hed been a different kind of father a different kind of man and i spent my life being afraid what would i do youd call the police and have him thrown in jail damn right but that doesnt mean i dont understand why you arent when papa was cheating with that woman i never told my mother for a while i actually believed she didnt know but i didnt tell her i thought maybe it would all go away i was wrong but thinking it gave me some peace of mind steadier tory set the bottle of water on the desk why are you being nice to me i have no idea never did like you much but that was mostly because hope did and i was contrary right now youre sleeping with my brother and it occurs to me that he means more to me than i realized it makes sense to get to know you so i can see how i feel about all that so youre being nice to me because im having sex with cade the dry way it was phrased tickled faiths humor in a roundabout way and ill tell you this because itll piss you off i feel sorry for you youre right tory got to her feet grateful the trembling had stopped it pisses me off figured you dont like sympathy but the fact is no one should be afraid of her own father and no man has the right blood kin or not to leave bruises and scars on a child now id better go see what kind of trouble that puppys gotten herself into out there puppy torys eyes went wide what puppy my puppy havent named her yet faith strolled out and let out a hoot of laughter isnt that the cutest thing shes just a little darling the little darling had found the tissue paper and was currently waging a war on it casualties were many and scattered like snow over the floor shed managed to find a roll of ribbon as well and most of that was wound around her chubby torso oh for gods sake dont take on so cant be more than five dollars worth of supplies ill pay for them theres my baby the pup barked joyfully tripped over a tail of ribbon and sprawled adoringly at faiths feet i swear i never thought a little bit of a thing like this could make me laugh so much look at you mamas baby doll all wrapped up like christmas she lifted the puppy high and made cooing noises youre acting like an idiot i know but isnt she sweet she just loves me to death too mamas got to clean up this mess now before the mean lady scolds my baby already on her hands and knees tory looked up you set that shop wrecker down in here again ill bite your ankle ive been teaching her to sit shes smart as a new hat just watch despite the threat faith set the pup down kept one hand on its rump sit be a good girl now sit for mama the puppy leaped forward slapped its tongue against torys face then chased its own tail some new hat isnt she precious downright adorable but she doesnt belong in here gathering up the bulk of the ruined supplies tory rose go take her for a walk or whatever we were going to buy a nice pretty set of bowls for her food and water not my bowls you are not buying handcrafted pottery bowls designed by artisans for puppy chow what do you care what i use it for as long as i pay the price only more determined faith marched over scooped up the pup and picked out two matching bowls of royal blue with bold emerald swirls we like these dont we darling dont we sweetumsвђќ thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard a sales a sale isnt it faith crossed to the counter set the bowls down ring me up and dont forget to add the cost of the supplies forget the supplies behind the counter tory dumped the tissue in the wastebasket then dealt with the transaction thats fiftythree dollars and twentysix cents for puppy bowls fine ill pay cash here hold her a minute faith pushed the pup at tory so she could dig into her purse charmed despite herself tory gave the puppy a nuzzle youre going to be eating like a queen arent you a regular queen bee queen bee why thats just perfect faith laid the money on the counter and snatched the puppy back thats who you are queen bee im going to get you a fancy collar that sparkles tory shook her head as she made change im seeing a whole new side of you faith so am i i kinda like it come on bee weve got places to go and people to see she gathered up the shopping bag i dont think i can get the door ill get it tory opened it and after a minutes hesitation touched faiths arm faith thank you youre welcome your makeup could use a little freshening she added and left she didnt intend to get involved the way faith looked at it other peoples personal lives were fascinating to speculate about to gossip about but all from a safe and smug distance but she kept seeing the way tory had looked curled up behind the counter with ribbon and tape and silver cords scattered around her she kept seeing that ugly red mark on torys neck thereвђd been marks on hope she hadnt seen them no one had let her see them but shed known she didnt hold with a man pushing a woman around thats all there was to it when it was kin you didnt run to the police but there were other ways to make things right she bent to kiss bees head then walked straight to the bank to tell jr what had happened to his niece he didnt waste time jr canceled his next appointment told his assistant manager he had to leave on personal business and set out for torys shop at such a brisk pace his shirt was damp with sweat by the time he got there she had customers a young couple who were debating over a blue and white serving platter tory was giving them room staying on the other side of the shop replacing the candle stands shed sold that morning uncle jimmy is it heating up out there youre flushed can i get you something cold noвђyesвђќ he decided it would give him time to compose himself whatever youve got handy honey ill just be a minute she went into the back then leaned on the door and cursed shed seen it in his eyes faith mustve made a beeline to the bank so much for trust tory thought wrenching open the refrigerator so much for understanding then drawing a cleansing breath she carried the can of ginger ale out to her uncle thanks honey he took a good long swig ah why dont i buy you lunch its not even noon and i brought something from home i dont want to close the shop in the middle of the day but thanks gran and cecil get off all right this morning first thing boots tried to talk them into staying a few days but you know your gran she likes to be in her own always itchy when shes away from home the young couple started out with the woman glancing back wistfully well come back i hope you do enjoy your day all right now let me see the door had hardly closed when jr set down the ginger ale and took torys shoulders he studied the raw skin on the side of her neck oh sweetie that bastard why didnt you call me because there was nothing you could do because it was over and because there wasnt a point in worrying you which is all faiths done by running down and telling you now you stop that she did exactly what was right and im beholden to her for it you didnt want to call the police and maybe well maybe its easier on your mother if we dont but im family i know she let him draw her into a hug hes gone now all he wanted was money hes scared running scared theyll catch him before long i just want it to be away from here away from me i cant help it of course you cant i want a promise from you gently jr held her out at arms length if you see him around again even if he doesnt try to get near you i want you to promise youll tell me right off all right but dont worry he got what he came for hes miles away by now she needed to believe it she believed it for the rest of the day she covered herself with the thin battlescarred armor of that belief through the long afternoon and though she knew it was foolish she opened one of the candles wrapped and ribboned on display and set it on the counter she hoped the light and scent of it would help dispel some of the ugly film her fathers visit had smeared on the air at six she locked up then caught herself scanning the street as she had done for weeks when shed escaped to new york it angered her that he could put that cautious anxiety back in her step that jolt back in her heart had she really stood in the ruin of her mothers house and claimed she could and would face down her father and all that fear if he dared slither into her life again where was her courage now all she could do was promise herself she would find it again but she locked the car doors the minute she was inside and her pulse jittered as she constantly shifted her glance from the road ahead to the rearview mirror on the drive home she passed cars even stirred herself to wave at piney as his pickup rumbled by with a quick toot of the horn fieldwork would be done for the day she thought hands would be heading home and so would the boss so it was with an irritating bump of disappointment that she turned into her lane and found it empty she hadnt realized shed been expecting cade to be there anticipating it true she hadnt greeted his statement that he was basically moving in with any real enthusiasm but the more she thought of it the easier it had been to accept and once accepted enjoyed it had been a very long time since shed wanted companionship someone to share the day with to talk over inconsequential things with to find little things to laugh over complain about to have someone there when the night seemed too full of sound and movement and memories and what was she giving back resistance arguments irritable and unstated agreement just general bitchiness she murmured as she climbed out of the car that at least she could stop she could do what women traditionally did to make up for petty crimes she could fix him a nice dinner and seduce him the idea lifted her mood wouldnt he be surprised when she made the moves for a change she hoped she remembered how because it was about time she took back a little control by doing so shed take some of the responsibility for whatever was going on between them off his shoulders shed tried to please jack that way and then no she pushed that train of thought firmly away as she unlocked her front door cade wasnt jack and she wasnt the same woman shed been in new york past and present didnt have to connect when she entered she knew that was just one more delusion she knew hed been there inside what shed tried to make her own home her father thered been little for him to destroy and she didnt think hed put much effort into it he hadnt come in to break her few pieces of furniture or punch holes in the walls though he had done some of both her chair was overturned and hed taken something sharp to the underside the lamp she bought only days before was shattered the table shed hoped to refinish tossed into the corner with one of its legs snapped like a twig she recognized the size and shape of the dents in the wallboard it was his signature mark left when for whatever reason he chose to use fists on inanimate objects instead of his daughter she left the door open an escape route in case her instincts were off and he was still in the house but the bedroom was empty hed yanked off the bedclothes ripped at the mattress she supposed the iron bed frame had been more trouble to him than it was worth as hed left it be the drawers of her dressers were pulled out her clothes heaped in piles no he hadnt really wanted to destroy her things she mused or hed have taken that sharp tool to her clothing as well hed done that before to teach her a lesson about dressing appropriately hed been looking for more money or for things he could easily sell for cash if hed been drinking it would have been worse if hed been drinking hed have waited for her as it was she bent down to pick up a rumpled blouse then let out a cry of despair when she saw the small carved wooden box she used to hold her jewelry she pounced on it sinking down when she found it empty most of what shed owned had been trinkets really good trinkets carefully selected but easily replaced but among them had been the garnet and gold earrings her grandmother had given her when shed turned twentyone earrings that had been her own greatgrandmothers her only heirloom priceless irreplaceable lost tory the alarm in cades voice the rush of footsteps brought her quickly to her feet im all right im here he burst into the room had her pinned against him before she could say another word tangled waves of fear and release pumped from him over and into her im all right she repeated i just got here minutes ago he was already gone i saw your car from the living room i thoughtвђ he tightened his grip pressed his face into her hair just hold on a second he knew what it was to have terror dig slick claws into his throat hed never thought hed feel it again thank god youre all right i meant to be here before you but i got hung up well call the police then youre coming to beaux reves i should have taken you there this morning cade theres no point in all that it was my father she drew away set the box down on the dresser he came to the shop this morning we had words this is just his way of letting me know he can still punish me did he hurt you no the denial was quick and automatic but his gaze had already landed on the side of her neck he said nothing he didnt have to his eyes went dark narrowed into slits as violenceвђshe knew how to recognize violenceвђswam into them then he turned away and found the phone cade wait please i dont want to call the police his head snapped up and that same narrowed rage snapped out at her you dont always get what you want sherry bellows celebrated her potential job by opening a bottle of wine turning up her sheryl crow cd as loud as her neighbors would tolerate and dancing around her apartment everything was working out perfectly she loved progress it was exactly the sort of small closeknit town she wanted to be a part of the stars she thought had been well aligned when shed followed instinct and applied for the position at progress high she liked the other teachers though sherry didnt know all her associates very well as yet that would all change in the fall when she started fulltime she was going to be a wonderful teacher someone her students could come to with their problems and their questions her classes were going to be fun and shed inspire her students to read to enjoy to seek out books for pleasure planting the seeds for a lifelong love affair with literature oh shed make them work and work hard but she had so many ideas so many fresh and wonderful notions on how to make the work interesting even entertaining years from now when her students looked back theyd remember her fondly miss bellows theyd say she made a difference in my life it was all shed ever wanted wanted it enough she thought now to study like a demon to work long and hard to subsidize her scholarship it had been worth every penny she had the bills to prove it but that was only money and shed found a way to deal with that working at southern comfort was going to be a delight it would help ease the burden of those student loans give her a little financial breathing room but more it would provide her with one more access to the community shed meet people make friends and before long shed be a familiar face in progress she was already widening her circle her neighbors in the building maxine at the vets and she planned to cement that connection by giving a party a kind of potluck gettogether sometime in june a summer kickoff she mused that wouldnt conflict with anyones plans shed invite tory too of course and dr hunk the dreamily dimpled vet shed definitely like to get to know him better she decided as she poured a second glass of wine shed ask the mooneys mr mooney at the bank had been so helpful when shed set up her new accounts then there was lissy at the realtors a tongue wagger sherry admitted but it was always good to have the town gossip in your camp you found out such interesting things and she was married to the mayor another looker sherry remembered with a great smile and a superior butt a bit of a flirt too it was a good thing shed found out he was married she wondered if it would be presumptuous to invite the lavelles they were after all the vipвђs of progress still kincade lavelle had been very nice very friendly whenever theyd bumped into each other around town and talk about gorgeous she could make the invitation very casual it couldnt do any harm she wanted lots and lots of people shed keep the patio doors open as she always did let guests spill outside she loved her pretty little garden apartment and she could buy another lounge chair to sit outside the one she had looked lonely out there and she didnt intend to be lonely one day shed meet the right man and theyd fall in love over warm nights and marry in the spring start a life together she just wasnt meant to stay single she wanted a family not that shed give up teaching of course a teacher was what she was but there was no reason she couldnt be a wife and mother too she wanted it all and the sooner the better humming to the music she stepped out onto the patio where mongo was dozing he stirred enough to thump his tail and rolled over in case she wanted to scratch his belly obliging she crouched down giving him a good rub as she sipped and glanced idly around her patio opened up to a nice grassy area that was bordered by the trees of the park on one side and a quiet residential avenue on the other shed chosen the apartment first because they allowed pets and where she went mongo went as a bonus it was convenient for their morning runs in the park the apartment was small but she didnt need much room as long as mongo had a place to exercise and in a town like progress housing didnt cost an arm and two legs as it did in charleston or columbia this is the right place for us mongo this is home for us straightening she wandered back inside into the small galley kitchen as she sang along with sheryl about her favorite mistake shed continue her celebration by fixing herself a huge salad for dinner life she thought as she chopped and diced was good twilight was edging closer by the time she finished made too much again she thought that was one of the problems with living alone still mongo liked his carrots and celery too so shed add them to his evening meal theyd have it on the patio and shed treat herself to one more glass of wine get a little tipsy then theyd take a nice long walk she decided as she squatted down to scoop mongos kibble out of the plastic bin maybe get some ice cream she lifted the bowl a movement at the corner of her eye had her heart wheeling into her throat the bowl flew out of her hands and she managed one short scream then a hand clamped over her mouth the knife shed used to make her dinner pricked at her throat be quiet be very very quiet and i wont cut you understand her eyes were already circling wildly wings of fear beat in her belly had her skin going hot and damp but confusion rode over it she couldnt see his face but thought she recognized the voice it made no sense no sense at all his hand slid slowly away from her mouth to grip her chin dont hurt me please dont hurt me вђњnow why would i do that her hair smelled sweet a whores blond hair lets go in the bedroom where we can be comfortable dont she gasped as the edge of the knife teased along her throat tipped up her chin the scream was inside her desperate to burst out but the knife turned it into silent tears as he pushed her out of the kitchen her patio doors were closed now the blinds shut mongo what did you do with mongo you dont think id hurt a nice friendly dog like that do you the power of the moment cruised through him spread made him hard and hot and invincible hes just taking a quiet nap donвђt you worry about a thing this is going to be just what you wantвђќ he shoved her belly down on the bed put his knee in the small of her back and added weight hed brought precautions a man had to be prepared even for a whore especially for a whore after a while they screamed no matter what and he didnt want to use the knife not when he was so good with his hands he took the bandanna from his pocket gagged her when she began to stir when she began to struggle he was in heaven she wasnt weak she kept the body she liked to flaunt and tease men with in good shape it only excited him to have her struggle the first time he hit her the thrill of it slammed into him like sex he hit her again so they both understood who was in charge he tied her hands behind her back he couldnt afford those nails with their sluttish pink polish scraping any of his skin quietly he walked over to shut the curtain and close them into the dark she was moaning against the gag dazed from the blows the sound of it made him tremble so that he nicked her skin a little as he used the knife to cut her clothes away she tried to roll tried to buck but when he put the point of the blade just under her eye pressed she went very still this is what you want he unzipped then flipped her onto her back and straddled her its what you asked for what you all ask for when it was done he wept tears of selfpity ran down his face she wasnt the one but what else could he do shed put herself in his path shed given him no choice it wasnt perfect hed done everything hed wanted and still it wasnt perfect her eyes were glazed and empty as he took off the gag kissed her cheeks he cut the cord from her wrists stuffed it back in his pockets he turned her music off and left the way hed come in i cant come to beaux reves tory sat on the front porch in the soft night air she couldnt face going back inside quite yet wasnt yet prepared to deal with the mess left by her father and compounded by the police cade contemplated the cigar hed lighted to ease his own nerves wished fleetingly he had a whiskey to go with it youre going to have to tell me why staying here the way things are doesnt make any sense and youre a sensible woman most of the time she agreed being sensible cuts down on complications and saves energy you were right about calling the police i realize that now i wasnt being sensible it was pure raw emotion he frightens me and embarrasses me by trying to keep it contained as always i thought id limit the fear and humiliation its hateful to be a victim cade makes you feel exposed and angry and somehow guilty at the same time i wont argue with that even though youre smart enough to know that guilt has no part in what you should be feeling smart enough to know it but not clever enough to figure out how not to feel it itll be easier once i put the house back to rights and get rid of what he left behind in it but ill still remember the way chief russ sat writing in his little book and watching my face how my father intimidated me today how hes done so all my life theres no cause for your pride to be wounded over this tory pride goeth before a fall my father reminded me of that this morning he does love to use the bible to hammer his point home theyll find him there are police in two counties looking for him now the worlds a lot bigger than two counties hell south carolinas a lot bigger than two counties swamps and mountains and glades lots and lots of places to hide she rocked restlessly needing movement if he finds a way to contact my mother shell help him out of love and out of duty that being the case it just makes my point about you coming with me to beaux reves i cant do that why a number of reasons first your mother would object my mother has nothing to say about it oh dont say that cade she pushed out of her chair walked to the end of the porch was he out there she wondered watching waiting you dont mean it or you shouldnt thats her home and she has a right in saying who comes into it why should she object especially after i explain it to her explain what she turned back that youre installing your lover in her house because your lovers daddy is a crazy man he drew on his cigar took his time about it i wouldnt choose those particular words but more or less and im sure shell greet me with fresh flowers and a box of fine chocolates oh dont be such a man about this she said with a wave of her hand before he could speak whatever it says on the damn deed cade the house belongs to the woman in it and i will not intrude on your mothers home shes a difficult woman at times most of the time he admitted but she isnt heartless no and her heart will not accept the woman she holds responsible for a beloved daughters death dont argue with me about that torys voice shook nearly broke it hurts me all right he tossed the cigar aside with one violent gesture but his hands were gentle enough as he laid them on torys shoulders if you wont or cant come with me then ill take you to your uncles and there we come to the second part of the problem she lifted her hands to his irrational bullheaded illogical ill admit all that now so you dont have to feel obliged to point it out to me i have to make a stand here cade this isnt a strategic hill on a field for me its very much like that i never thought about it quite that way she said with a quiet laugh but yes this is very much my hill on my own personal field ive retreated so often you once called me a coward to get my dander up but the fact is ive been one most of my life ive had small spurts of courage and that makes it only worse when i see myself fall back yet again i cant do it this time how does staying here make you brave instead of stupid not brave and yes maybe stupid but whole i want so much to be whole again i think id risk anything not to have this empty place in me i cant let him run me out she gazed toward the marsh that grew thicker deeper greener with encroaching summer mosquitoes whined in there breeding in the dark water alligators slid through it silent death it was a place where snakes could slither and bogs could suck the shoe right off your foot and it was a place she thought that went bright and beautiful with the twinkling of fireflies where wildflowers thrived in the shade and the stingy light where an eagle could soar like a king there was no beauty without risk no life without it when i was a child i lived scared in this house it was a way of life she said and you got used to it the way you get used to certain smells i suppose when i came back i made it mine shaking out all those bad memories like dust from a rug airing out that smell cade now hes tried to bring the fear back i cant let him i wont let him she added shifting until her eyes met his again thats what i did this morning dont tell anyone keep it quiet one more dirty little secret if you hadnt pushed me thats what id have done here too im staying im cleaning him out of this place and staying i hope he knows it i wish i didnt admire you for it he ran a hand down the sleek tail of her hair make it easier to bully you into doing things my way you dont have much bully in you maybe it was relief maybe it was something else that made her stroke her hand over his cheek you maneuver you dont push well it speaks well for the future of our relationship that youve figured that out and can live with it he drew her in laid his lips on the top of her head you matter to me no dont go stiff on me ill just have to maneuver you you matter tory more than id planned for you to matter when she remained silent he let frustration lead sometimes it was the most honest way give me something back damn it he jerked her back then up crushing his mouth to hers she tasted the demand the heat the little licks of rage hed concealed so well and it was that shot of pure unfiltered emotion from him that turned another bolt inside her god she didnt want to be loved or needed didnt want to have those same feelings stirred to life again inside her but he was here and just by being made her feel again ive already given you more than i thought i had i dont know how much more there is she held on to him burrowed into him theres so much happening inside me i cant keep up with it it all circles back to you isnt that enough yeah he eased her back to kiss her again softly this time yeah thats enough for now as long as you make room for more he skimmed his thumbs over her cheeks had a hell of a day havent you i cant say its been one of my best so far lets finish it right then well get started on what he opened the screen door you wanted to clean him out lets do it they worked together for two hours he turned on music she wouldnt have thought of it would have stayed focused on the details kept her mind channeled down those strict lines but the music drifted through the house into her head just distracting enough to keep her from brooding she wanted to burn the clothes hed touched could visualize carrying them outside heaping them up striking a match but she couldnt afford the indulgence instead she washed folded put away they turned the damaged mattress over it would have to be replaced but it would do for now and with fresh linens you hardly noticed he talked about his work in a way that had his voice drifting pleasantly through her mind like the music they dealt with the wreckage of the kitchen ate sandwiches and she told him that she was considering hiring on help its a good idea he helped himself to a beer quietly pleased that shed stocked some for him youll enjoy your business more if it doesnt strangle all your time sherry bellows thats the new high school teacher isnt it i met her and her dog a few weeks ago out at the minimart seems like a bundle of energy that was my impression in a very attractive package he grinned and sipped his beer when tory merely lifted her brows just thinking of you darling an attractive clerk is a business asset you think shell wear those little shorts no tory said firmly i dont bound to draw a lot of male customers if you let that be her uniform thats a girl with very nice pins pins hmmm well she and her pins depend on how her references check out but i imagine they will tory swept up the last of the debris dumped it in the trash that seems to be the best that can be done feel better yes she crossed the room to put away the broom and dustpan considerably and im very grateful for the help im always open to gratitude she took the pitcher from the refrigerator poured herself a glass of iced tea the bedroom closets not very big but i made some room and theres an empty drawer in the dresser he said nothing only drank his beer waited you wanted to be able to have some of your things here didnt you thats right so so were not living together she set down her glass ive never lived with anyone and thats not what this is all right but if youre going to be spending so much time here you might as well have a place for some of your things very practical oh go to hell but there wasnt any heat in the response youre not supposed to smile when you say that he set his beer aside then slid his arms around her what do you think youre doing dancing i never took you dancing its something people who arent really living together ought to do now and then it was an old shuffling number with a boy asking a girl to stand by him when the land was dark are you trying to be charming i dont have to try its just part of my makeup he dipped her made her laugh very smooth all those miserable hours of cotillion had to pay off poor little rich boy she rested her head on his shoulder and let herself enjoy the dance the feel of him against her the scent of him thanks youre welcome when i was driving home tonight i was thinking of you i like the sound of that and i was thinking so far hes made all the moves i let him because i wasnt sure if i really wanted to make any of my own or counter any of his it was sort of easy to be maneuvered i suppose and i was thinking i just wonder how kincade lavelle would react if i got home and i fixed us a nice supper hed have appreciated that yes well some other time that part of the thought process didnt pan out but there was this second part which was she lifted her head from his shoulder met his eyes how would kincade lavelle react if after that once we were all relaxed and quiet just what would he do if i set out to seduce him well was all he could manage as she pressed closer ran her hands intimately down his hips the stirring in his blood was a notsoquiet delight i think the least i can do as a gentleman is let you find out this time it was she who unfastened buttons his shirt then her own she laid her lips over his heart on the warm skin and vibrant beat ive had your taste with me since the first time you kissed me while her lips played over him she eased the shirt away i can bring tastes back and ive done that with yours so many times already she trailed her hands over his chest his bellyвђa quiverвђup to his shoulders such broad tough shoulders i like the feel of you long hard muscles it excites me and your hands roughened from work riding over me she peeled her shirt open and let it fall to the floor to join his watching him she unhooked her bra let it slide away touch me now he cupped her breasts in his hands the warm soft weight of them skimmed the nipples with the edges of his thumbs yes like that her head fell back as heat balled in her belly exactly like that my insides go liquid when you touch me can you see it her eyes long and dark met his i want tell me she moistened her lips reached for the button of his jeans his hands flexed on her one hard caress i want to feel what you feel i want whats inside you inside me ive never tried that with anyone else never wanted to will you let me he bent his head rubbed his lips over hers take what you want it was a risk she would be open gaping so much more defenseless than he but she wanted it all of it and that exquisite bond of trust once more she lay her lips on him and opened mind heart body it was a bolt a lightning strike the power of those coupled needs images his desire layered and tangled inside her with her own it slashed through her dark bright swollen with energy her head snapped back from the punch of it and she came in one long erotic gush god god wait no hed never experienced anything like it the twisted bonds of unity only knotted tighter in a bold and beautiful mass of arousal more he set his teeth on her shoulder craving flesh again now she couldnt stop it it lashed through her like a storm full of fury and brilliance it was she who dragged him to the floor she who panted out pleas demands threats as they tore at clothes she clawed at him nipped as they rolled over the floor his pulse was inside her a savage beat that crashed against her own the taste of him the taste of herself brewed together to saturate her when he plunged into her she felt the urgent pumping of his blood the desperate maze of his thoughts lost she cried out once twice they were both lost she heard her name his voice calling it inside her mind seconds before it burst from his lips when he came inside her dragged her with him the glory of it made her weep wade had his hands fullвђwhat was left of them after the ornery tabby badly misnamed fluffy mangled them during her shots maxine was deep into finals and hed given her the day off which meant he had only two hands to pit against four claws and a number of very sharp teeth hed concluded an hour before that hed made a mistake of horrendous proportions by springing maxine hed started the day with an emergency that required a house call and put him solidly behind add the minor war in the waiting area set off by a personality clash between a setter and a bichon the olsons baby goat whod managed to eat the best part of malibu barbie until her arm became lodged in his throat and fluffys vile temper and hed had a pisser of a morning he was cursing sweating bleeding when faith rushed in through the back wade honey can you take a look at bee for me i think shes feeling poorly take a number itll only take a minute i havent got a minute oh now goodness what happened to your hands faith watched as wade narrowly avoided another swipe and tucked the cat firmly under his arm did that mean old pussycat scratch you darling kiss my ass was his best response did she get you there too faith called out as he marched into the waiting area its all right baby she nuzzled the puppy daddys going to take good care of you in just a minute he came back in to scrub up and dug out antiseptic shes been whimpering and sort of moaning all morning and her nose is a little warm she doesnt want to play just lies there see faith set bee down and the pup squatted by wades feet looked up at him pitifully then proceeded to throw up on his shoes oh oh for goodness sake mustve been something she ate lilah said i shouldnt give her all those cookies faith bit her lip but couldnt quite hold in the giggle wade simply stood staring at her antiseptic in one hand a thin trickle of blood on the other and puppy vomit on his shoes were awfully sorry bee dont you eat that thats just nasty she scooped up the puppy i bet you feel so much better now dont you sweetheart there see that wade shes wagging her tail again i just knew if i brought her in to you everything would be fineвђќ is that how it looks to you like everythings fineвђќ well bees sicked up what was worrying her and i dont imagine its the first time youve had a little doggie puke on you ive got a waiting room full of patients my hands are scratched to shit and now my shoes are going to stink for the rest of the day well go on up and change them then she stepped back when he made one of his hands into a claw she loved the light that came into his eyes when his dander was up now wade he bunched the claw into a fist then punched it lightly between his own eyes im going to go ditch these shoes and when i come back i want you to have cleaned this up clean it up myself thats right put your dog back in surgery get a mop and bucket and deal with it i dont have time for this he reached down pulled off the ruined shoes at the heels and make it fast im behind schedule daddys a little cross this morning she murmured to bee as wade strode out to the garbage she looked at the floor grimaced well at least you got the best part of it on his shoes its not so bad when he came back she was dutifully if inexpertly mopping there were suds gliding across the linoleum on little waves of water it almost seemed to him they had a current but he didnt have the heart to complain almost done here bees in the back playing with her squeaky bone shes brighteyed and frisky again faith dumped the mop in the bucket sloshed more water i guess this needs to dry off some as an alternative to screaming he rubbed his hands over his face and laughed faith you are unique of course i am she stepped back as he picked up the bucket emptied it rinsed off the mop then began to slop up suds and water oh well i suppose that works too do me a favor go on out there and tell mrs jenkins to bring mitch on back thats the beagle whos been howling the last half hour and if you can find a way to maintain some sort of order out there for the next twenty minutes ill buy you a fancy dinner at your choice of restaurants champagne a magnum lets just see what i can do he got his twenty minutes barely when he heard the urgent cry wade wade come quick he bolted out saw piney cobb staggering under the weight of mongo ran out into the road right in front of me god almighty hes bleeding pretty bad bring him in the back he moved fast the dogs breathing was labored his pupils fixed and dilated his thick fur was matted with blood and more was dripping on the floor here on the table i hit the brakes piney muttered and stood back swerved but i clipped him anyway i was heading into the hardware for some parts and he come barreling out of the park right into the street do you know if you ran over him dont think i did with trembling hands he pulled out a faded red bandanna and wiped his sweaty face knocked himвђs what i think but it happened fast okay wade grabbed toweling and since faith was standing beside him he simply took her hands pushed them onto the cloth press down hard i want that bleeding under control hes in shock he yanked open the drug cabinet grabbed a bottle to prepare a hypo you just hang in there boy just hang on he murmured as the dog began to stir and whimper keep the pressure firm he ordered faith im giving him a sedative i need to check for internal injuries her hands had shaken when hed pressed them to the wound she thought shed seen straight down to the bone in the gash gaping down the dogs back leg and her stomach had flipped over she wanted to snatch her hands away from all that blood to rush out of the room why couldnt piney do it why couldnt someone else be here she started to say so the words jumping into her throat she could smell the blood the antiseptic and the sour stench of pineys panic sweat but her gaze landed on wades face cool composed strong his eyes were flat with concentration his mouth firmed into one determined line she stared at him breathing through her teeth watching him work the quick efficiency of it the focus calmed her even as the dog went still again beneath her hands no broken ribs i dont think the wheel went over him might have a bruised kidney well deal with that later head wounds pretty superficial no blood in the ears the legs the worst of it and that he thought was bad enough saving it and the dog was going to be tricky i need to move him into surgery he glanced back saw that piney had dropped into the chair and had his head on his knees i need your hands faith im going to lift and carry him you have to stay with me keep the pressure firm hes lost too much blood ready oh but wade iвђ lets go she did what she was told because he left her no choice she jogged beside him fumbling for the door with her free hand bee sent up a joyful bark and ran between her feet sit wade said so sharply bees butt plopped obediently to the floor the minute hed laid the sedated dog down he grabbed a thick apron tossed it to faith put that on ive got to get pictures pictures x rays go to his head hold him steady as you can the apron weighed like lead but she dragged it on did what she was told mongos eyes were slitted but it seemed to her he was watching her pleading with her to help its going to be all right baby wades going to make everything all right youll see the sound of her voice had bee whining and scooting over to huddle by her feet get rid of the apron now while he waited for the film to develop wade shot out orders come back here and apply pressure again keep talking to him just let him hear your voice okay all right urn swallowing what tasted like bile she pressed the thick padding over the gash wades going to fix you up just fine again you you have to look both ways before you cross the street you remember that next time oh wade is he going to die not if i can help it he slapped the x rays onto a lighted panel nodded grimly not if i can help it he said again and started gathering instruments sharp silver tools glinted in the hard overhead light her head seemed to circle in time with her stomach youre going to operate now just like that i have to try to save the leg save it you meanвђ just do what i say and dont think when he peeled back the compress her stomach gave a nasty lurch but he didnt give her time to be sick you hold this press this button here when i tell you i need suction you can do that onehanded when i need an instrument ill describe it give it to me handle first im going to knock him out now he lowered the light cleaned the field all faith could hear now was the slurping noises of her hose when he demanded suction the click and clatter of tools she averted her eyes wanted to keep them that way but he kept snapping out orders that required her to look before long it was like a movie wades head was bent his eyes cool and calm though she saw beads of sweat pearling on his forehead it seemed to her his hands were like magic moving so delicately through blood flesh and bone she didnt even blink when he slid the protruding bone back into place none of it was real she watched him suture impossibly tiny stitches inside the gash the raw yellow of the sterile wash hed used stained his hands mixed with the blood until it was all the color of an aging bruise i need you to check his heart rate manually just use your hand gauge his heartbeat for me its kind of slow she said when she pressed down but it seems steady like bump bump bump good take a look at his eyes pupils are awfully big any blood in the whites no i dont think so okay he needs some pins in this leg bone shattered more than broke once thats done ill close it then well set the legвђќ is he going to be all right hes healthy wade used his forearm to wipe his brow and hes young hes got a good chance to keep the leg he worried about the bone chips had he gotten them all thered been muscle damage some badly ripped tendons but he felt confident hed repaired the worst of it all this ran through one part of his mind while the rest was focused on securing bone with steel ill know better in a day or two i need gauze and tape that cabinet there once hed closed the wound wade bandaged and set the leg then checked the dogs vitals himself he treated the raw scrape on the muzzle behind the left ear he held up wade murmured then for the first time in over an hour looked directly at faith so did you yeah well i was a little queasy at first then she lifted her hands started to gesture they were streaked with blood as was her blouse oh oh my was all she managed before her eyes rolled back he caught her barely then stretched her out on the floor she was already coming around when he lifted her head and brought a paper cup of water to her lips what happened you fainted gracefully and at a convenient moment he brushed his lips over her cheek ill take you upstairs you can clean up and lie down for a bit im all right but when he helped her stand her legs wobbled okay maybe not i might be better off flat out for a while longer she dropped her head on his shoulder half floating as he carried her up i dont think im cut out to be a nurse you did great no you did i never thought never understood why you do what you do always figured it as giving out shots and cleaning up dog poop theres a lot of that he carried her into the bathroom where he could brace her on the sink and run warm water in the bowl just put your hands in here youll feel better when theyre clean theres a lot more wade to what you do and to you her eyes met his in the mirror i havent been paying attention havent bothered to look close enough you saved a life today youre a hero i did what i was trained to do i know what i saw and what i saw was heroic she turned kissed him now if you dont mind im going to strip to the skin and get in the shower you steady enough yeah im fine you go check on your patient i love you faith i think you do she said quietly and its nicer than i expected go on now my heads still light enough for me to say something ill regret later ill be back up when i can he checked on mongo first then cleaned up before stepping out into the examining room piney was still in the chair and now bee was curled sleeping in his lap wade had forgotten about both of them that dog gonna make it it looks good oh jesus wade im just sick about it ive been going over it in my head and if id been paying more attention i was just driving along and my mind was wandering and next thing i knew that dog jumped right out in the road couldve been a kid it wasnt your fault hit me a deer a time or two dont know why it didnt bother me like this mostly id just get pissed off deer can do a hell of a number on a truck some kids gonna come home from school looking for that dog i know the owner ill give her a call you getting him here fast made a big difference thats what you ought to remember yeah well he sighed hugely this little gals right cute he said stroking bees head she came out here looking for trouble chewed on my bootlaces for a bit then she conked right out i appreciate your looking out for her wade reached down and picked her up bee yawned hugely then licked at the cat scratches on his hand вђњare you going to be all right yeah tell the gods truth im going to go get me a drink cades probably sent out the marines for me by now but thats just gonna have to wait he got to his feet you let me know how that dog goes on now will you sure he slapped pineys shoulder as they walked out the waiting room was clear wade imagined most of his patients got tired of the delay and left he could only be grateful for the quiet he set bee down with one of the dog treats maxine kept in her desk drawer then looked up sherry bellowss number in his files the answering machine picked up so he left a message shed be out looking for her dog he supposed more than likely shed run into someone whod seen the accident he left it at that and went back in to mongo minutes after wade talked to sherrys machine tory listened to the same cheery voice announcing she wasnt able to come to the phone sherry this is tory at southern comfort id like you to call or come by when you get a chance if youre still interested youve got a job the decision felt good tory thought as she replaced the receiver not only had sherrys references been glowing but it might even be fun to have a bright face and willing hands around the shop for a few hours a week business was slow today but she wasnt discouraged it took time to establish yourself to become part of peoples routines and shed had a handful of browsers that morning she used the downtime to work out an affordable schedule for her new employee she got out the forms shed need to fill out for tax records and added the list of store policies shed typed she toyed with the wording for an ad in the sunday paper that would include the linens shed decided to carry when her bells chimed she looked up quickly with the same bump in the heart shed experienced at the sound all day but the sight of abigail lawrence made her set down her pen and smile what a nice surprise told you id find my way here tory this is just lovely you have beautiful things we have some very talented artists and you know just how to display their work abigail held out a hand as tory came around the counter im going to have a wonderful time spending money here dont let me stop you can i get you anything a cold drink a cup of tea no not a thing oh is that batik abigail crossed over to admire a framed portrait of a young woman standing on a garden path she does wonderful work i have a few of her scarves in stock as well ill have to take a look i want to see everything but i can tell you i want this batik its perfect for my husband to give me for our anniversary amused tory turned to lift it from the wall and does he want it gift wrapped naturally how long have you been married abigail cocked her head as tory carried the batik to the counter in all the time shed been torys lawyer she never remembered her asking a personal question twentysix years so you were married at ten abigail beamed examined a box of polished burl wood shopkeeping agrees with you she carried the box to the counter herself i think this town does too youre at home here yes this is home abigail did you really come up from charleston to shop that and to see you and to talk to you tory nodded if you found out more about the girl who was murdered you dont have to ease me into it i didnt learn any more about her but i did ask my friend to do that check on like crimes crimes that had taken place during the last two weeks of august there are others you already knew no felt feared how many more three that fit the profile and time frame a twelveyearold girl who went missing during a family trip to hilton head in august a nineteenyearold coed taking summer classes at the university in charleston in august and a twentysixyearold woman whod been camping with friends in sumter national forest august so many tory whispered all were sexual homicides raped and strangled there was no semen there was some physical violence particularly in the facial area that escalates with each victim because their faces arent right their faces arent hers hopes i dont understand tory wished she didnt wished the sickness of it wasnt so horribly clear they were all blondes werent they pretty slim builds yes he keeps killing her once wasnt enough abigail shook her head a little concerned at the way torys eyes went vague and dark its possible they were killed by the same man butвђ they were killed by the same man the length of time between the murders deviates from the typical serialkiller profile so many years between now im not a criminal lawyer and im not a psychologist but i have done some studying up on this subject in the last week or two the ages of the victims dont fit the standard profile this isnt standard abigail tory opened the burl box closed it again it isnt typical there has to be a basis your friend and the twelveyearold indicate a pedophile it appears to me a man who chooses children as victims doesnt switch to young women but hes not switching anything their ages have everything to do with it every one was the age hope would have been if shed lived thats the pattern yes i agree with you though neither of us is experts in this area i suppose i felt obligated to point out the flaws there may be more thats being investigated as well though at this point my contact assures me none has been found the fbi is looking into it abigails pretty mouth firmed tory my contact wanted to know why i was interested how id learned of the hitchhiker i didnt tell him thank you you could help i dont know that i can even if theyd let me i dont know if im capable it freezes me up inside it was never easy always wrenching and now i dont want to face that again to put myself through that again i cant help them this is for the police if thats really how you feel then why did you ask me to find out i had to know toryвђ please dont please i dont want to go back there again im not sure id come out whole again this time to keep her hands busy she began shifting items on a shelf вђњthe police the fbi theyre the experts here this is their job not mine i dont want the faces of all those people in my head what happened to them inside my head i already have hope coward the voice whispered the taunt in her ear throughout the rest of the day she didnt ignore it she accepted it and she was going to learn how to live with it she knew what she needed to know whoever had killed hope was still killing selectively efficiently and it was the job of the police or the fbi or some special task force to hunt him down and stop him it was not up to her and if her deepest and most personal fears were realized and that killer had her fathers face could she live with that they would find hannibal bodeen soon then she would decide when she locked up for the day she thought it might do her good to walk around town through the park she could drop by sherrys and speak with her instead of her answering machine take care of business tory reminded herself take care of yourself traffic was light most would already be home from work sitting down to supper children had already been called in to wash up and the evening long and bright would stretch out with television and porch sitting homework and dirty dishes normal everyday precious for its simple monotony and she wanted it for herself with a quiet desperation she cut through the park roses were blooming and pools of wax begonias spread in crimson and white trees cast long shadows and welcome shade and a few people sat or stretched under them young people tory noted not yet stoneset in the tradition of fivethirty supper theyd go out for pizza later or a burger then flock somewhere with others like them to listen to music or their own voices shed done the same once briefly but it seemed like decades ago it seemed like another woman entirely who had elbowed her way into a crowded club to dance to laugh to be young shed already lost all that once she would not lose the new life shed just begun deep in thought she came out of the line of trees and started across the green slope that led to the apartment building bee shot across the lawn like a bullet yapping insanely you sure get around dont you charmed tory crouched and let herself be attacked shes been inside most of the day faith strolled up pleased when her pup deserted tory to leap on her shes got a lot of energy so i see tory glanced up pursed her lips as she straightened thats not your usual look she commented studying the overlarge tshirt over faiths linen slacks still works for me doesnt it i spilled something on my blouse earlier borrowed this from wade i see yes i suppose you do you have a problem with that why should i wades a big boy i could say something crude about that but ill let it pass faith skimmed her sleek hair behind her ear smiled broadly tired of the solitude of the marsh going apartment hunting no i like my house im just dropping by to see a potential employee sherry bellows well thats a coincidence im here to see her myself wades still tied up at his office and he hasnt been able to reach her all day her dog was hit by a car late this morning oh no instantly the reserve fled shell be heartbroken hes doing all right wade went right to work on him saved his life it was said with such pride tory could only stare hes not sure how well the dogs leg will heal but im betting itll be right as rain im glad to hear it hes a beautiful dog and she seems to love him so much i cant believe shed go off for the day and leave him running loose you just never know about people her apartments there faith pointed i was around front but she didnt answer the knock so i thought id poke back here her neighbor said she uses this door more than the front blinds are closed maybe the doors open we can slip in and leave her a note anyway wade really wants to get ahold of her she crossed the patio reached for the handle of the sliding glass door dont tory gripped her shoulder jerked her back what in the hells wrong with you its not breaking and entering for christs sake im just going to poke my head in dont go in there dont go in torys fingers dug into faiths shoulder shed already seen it had slapped in front of her face jumped there almost gleefully and the copper penny taste of blood and fear pooled in her mouth its too late hes been here what are you talking about faith gave her arm an impatient jerk would you please let go shes dead tory said flatly we have to call the police hope hope is the thing with feathersвђthat perches in the soulвђand sings the tune without the wordsвђand never stopsвђat allвђ вђ emily dickinson she couldnt go in she couldnt make herself leave the deputy whod answered the call had been both skeptical and annoyed but he hadnt been able to hold out against what he considered two overreacting females hed hitched at his belt tugged on his cap then had knocked loudly on the glass panel of the door tory could have told him sherry was incapable of answering but he wouldnt have listened or understood but two minutes after hed stepped inside he was back out again and the irritated smirk was no longer on his face it didnt take long to get the wheels rolling when chief russ arrived the scene was closed off with yellow police tape and those who moved in and out carried the tools of their trade and their badges tory sat on the ground and waited i called wade since there was nothing else to do faith sat down beside her he has to wait until maxine comes to look after mongo but hes coming theres nothing for him to do theres nothing for any of us to do faith stared at the tape the door the shadows of men moving around behind the blinds how did you know she was dead sherry or hope faith clutched the puppy to her breast rubbed her cheek against warm fur for comfort ive never seen anything like this they wouldnt let me near where hope was i was too young you saw it yes you saw it all not quite all she pressed her palms together squeezed her hands between her knees as if they were very cold i knew when we got to the door theres a darkness about death violent death especially and he left something of himself behind maybe just the madness of it its the same as before hes the same she closed her eyes i thought he would come for meвђi never considered i never imagined this and that was the guilt she would live with now youre saying whoever did this to sherry killed hope after all these years tory started to speak then shook her head i cant be sure i havent been sure of anything in a long time she glanced over as she heard faiths name called wade ran across the grass toward them it surprised her when faith leaped up it was rare to see faith bother to move quickly then she watched them take each other one long hard embrace he loves her tory realized shes the center of things for him how odd youre all right he put his hands on faiths face cupped it there i dont know what i am she had been all right everything had seemed to hold at a distance far enough away not to touch her now her hands wanted to shake and her stomach jump the same way shed reacted after the surgery when there had been blood on her hands i think i need to sit down again here when she lowered to the grass he knelt his hand still clutching faiths while he studied torys face too calm he decided too controlled it only meant when she broke shed shatter why dont yall come back with me you need to get away from here i cant but you should take faith so you can see it through and i cant i dont think so faith said its not a competition between you and me its always been theres dwight people had started to gather in small pockets of murmurs and curiosity word traveled lightning fast in progress tory thought dully she watched dwight move through the gatherings and head straight for sherrys door maybe you can talk to him wade faith gestured in dwights direction maybe hell be able to tell us something ill see he touched torys knee before he rose cades on his way why because i called him just wait here there was no need for that tory said frowning at wades back as he slipped through the crowd of onlookers oh shut up annoyed faith dug in her purse for a chewy bone to keep bee occupied youre no more iron woman than i am it doesnt make us less to lean on a man i dont intend to lean on cade for christs sake if hes good enough to sleep with hes good enough to hold on to at a time like this i swear you just hunt up things to be bitchy about why dont we all go out on a double date later we can go dancing faiths smile was scalpel sharp youre a real pain in the ass tory im starting to like that about you well shit theres billy clampett and hes spotted me that just makes it perfect i was nearly pissed off enough and drunk enough one night a thousand years ago to have sex with him fortunately i came to my senses in time but hes never stopped trying to finish things off tory watched billy stroll toward them thumbs tucked in his front pockets fingers beating out a tune on either side of his zipper there couldnt be enough liquor in the county for that finally a point of agreement billy ladies he crouched down heard there was some excitement round here some girl went and got herself killed careless of her faith didnt shift away wouldnt give him the satisfaction though she could smell his evening beer on his breath heard it was sherry bellows shes the one who runs around town with that big shaggy dog wears little shorts and lowcut tops sort of advertising the wares he took a cigarette out of the pack he had rolled in the sleeve of his tshirt he thought the effect made him look like james dean sold her some annuals a couple weeks back she was mighty friendly if you catch my meaning tell me billy do you practice being disgusting or is it just a gift it took him a minute but his smile went sour as old milk as he struck a match and puffed the cigarette to life arent you miss high and mighty all of a sudden nothing sudden about it ive always been high and mighty isnt that right tory ive never known you to be otherwise its a bit like a birthmark exactly delighted faith slapped a hand on torys thigh she took out a cigarette of her own we lavelles she began lighting it and blowing smoke coolly into billys face are destined to be superior its just stamped on our dna you werent so superior that night behind grogans when i had your tits in my hands oh faith smiled blew more smoke was that you ever since you grew tits youve been a slut you better watch yourself he glanced deliberately at sherrys door sluts end up getting just what they ask for i remember you now tory said quietly you used to tie firecrackers to cats tails and light them and then youd go home and masturbate is that still how you spend your leisure time he jerked back there was no smile on his face now and fear had replaced the sneer in his eyes we dont need you around here we dont need your kind he might have left it at that he was frightened enough to but bee decided his pant leg was more interesting than her bone billy sent her flying with the back of his hand with a cry of outrage faith scrambled to her feet to scoop up the whining dog you yellowbellied beersoaked halfpeckered asshole no wonder your wifes shopping for a new man you cant get it up with your own fist he started to lunge at faith tory didnt know how it happened and it seemed to be happening to someone else but her fist popped out of her lap and connected with his eye the force and shock of the blow knocked him on his ass dimly she heard shouts and squeals and running feet but as billy leaped up so did she all of her rage rolled into one hot ball inside her she could already taste the blood fucking bitch when he charged she planted her feet she wanted violence welcomed it even as he swung back he went sprawling try me cade suggested and hauled him to his feet stay out of it he snapped as people rushed up to interfere come on billy lets see how you handle me instead of a woman half your size youve had this coming for years the sneer was back he crouched burning with the need to restore himself in front of the town desperate to pound his bunched fists into the haughty face of one of the lavelles when im done with you im going to have some fun with your whore sister and your cunt he came in hard cade simply sidestepped it only took two blows an uppercut that snapped billys head back and a fast vicious jab to the gut cade bent down and pressing his thumb on billys windpipe whispered in his ear if you ever touch my sister or my woman if you ever speak to them ever look at them ill wrap your balls around your throat and choke you with them he dropped billys head back to the ground and walked toward tory without a backward glance this isnt the place for you now she couldnt find her voice shed never seen fury burst then retreat so easily almost elegantly she thought hed battered a man to the ground without breaking a sweat and now he was speaking to her gently and his eyes were cold as winter come on away with me now i have to stay no you dont sorry to say she does carl d walked up turned his gaze down at billy rubbed his chin in a thoughtful manner have some trouble out here billy clampett made insulting remarks instantly soft tears swam into faiths eyes and turned them the color of dewdrenched bluebells he wasвђwell i cant even begin but he was very offensive to me and to tory then he she sniffled delicately then he struck my poor little bee here and when tory tried to stop him he if it hadnt been for cade i dont know what might have happened she turned to tory sobbing quietly you couldve taken him she murmured fat pussfaced asshole carl d tucked his tongue in his cheek after what hed seen inside this little comedy was an entertaining relief that about how it was he asked cade more or less ill have him taken in sos he cools off some he glanced around making eye contact with faces in the crowd as he gently chewed his gum dont think anybody wants to press charges here no well let it lay good enough im gonna need to talk to tory here and faith too we can be a little more private down at the station chief wade joined them stepping so casually over the halfconscious billy faith had to disguise a snort of laughter with a wet sniffle my place is closer i think itd be more comfortable for the ladies we might could do that for a start anyway im going to have one of my deputies take you on over ill be along directly ill take them wade said you and cade know most of these people id appreciate if youd give me a hand getting them to go on home one of my menll see to the ladies here i need to get their statements he said before cade could object thats police business we can get there by ourselves well now miss faith ill just send one of my men along with you its procedure he signaled and set the wheels in motion jesus how does something like this happen in the middle of town dwight rubbed at the tension in the back of his neck theyd managed to nudge most of the curious away from the building now it was darkness that gathered as he stood with his two oldest friends on the quiet lawn outside the apartment where death wore the symbol of yellow police tape how much do you know wade asked him no more than anyone else i expect carl d didnt let me past the edges and i only got that far because im mayor it looks like somebody broke into her place sometime yesterday maybe it was a robbery he pinched the bridge of his nose shook his head doesnt seem like it didnt look to me like she had a lot howd they get by the dog wade wondered dog dwight looked blank a moment then nodded oh yeah i dont know maybe it was someone she knew that makes more sense doesnt it maybe it was someone she knew and they had an argument that got out of hand she was in the bedroom he added on a sigh that much i know theвђwell the bits and pieces i heard said she was raped how was she killed cade asked him i dont know carl d was keeping a tight lid on most of it jesus wade we were just talking about her the other night remember i ran into her coming out of your place yeah i remember he got a picture of her bubbling over flirting while he examined mongo there were some murmurs in there dwight jerked his head toward the sealed door about tory bodeen edgy talk he added i figure youd want to know he sighed again this shouldnt happen in the middle of damn town people ought to be safe in their own houses this is going to worry lissy sick therell be a run on the hardware store and gun shop tomorrow cade predicted locks and ammo oh christ id best call a town meeting see if i can calm people down i hope to god carl d has something on this by tomorrow ive got to get back to lissy shell be in a state by now he shot one last look at the door this shouldnt have happened here he repeated and walked away i only met her once just yesterday tory sat on wades sofa with her hands neatly folded in her lap she knew it was important to be calm and clear when talking to the police they picked at emotion used weaknesses as levers to pry out more than you wanted to say then they made you ridiculous then they betrayed you you only met her the once carl d nodded made his notes hed asked faith to wait downstairs he wanted his interviews and the facts he gleaned from them on separate pages whyd you happen to go by her place today she applied for a job at my store that so he cocked a brow i thought she had herself a job teaching at the high school yes so she told me answer the questions exactly she reminded herself dont add dont elaborate not fulltime until fall though and she wanted something parttime to supplement her income and to keep her busy i think she seemed to have a lot of energy uhhuh so you went on and hired her no not immediately she gave me references wrote them down she remembered along with her address on the clipboard the clipboard that shed left on the counter when her father had come in oh god oh god well thats a sensible thing didnt know you were hiring at your place i hadnt really thought about it until she came in she was persuasive i took some time to go over my budget and decided i could afford light parttime help i checked her references this morning then i called her i got her machine and left a message umhmm hed already heard her message and the ones from wades office the one from her upstairs neighbor the one from lissy frazier sherry bellows had been a popular lady then you decided to go on over in person after i closed for the day i wanted a walk i decided id take one through the park and drop by her apartment that way if she was in i could discuss the job with her you went over there with faith lavelle no i went over alone i ran into faith outside the building the back of the building she said sherrys dog had been injured earlier in the day hed been hit by a car and wade had treated him shed come over as a favor to wade as theyd been unable to reach her so you got there at the same time yes more or less that would have been around sixthirty as i closed up and left the shop about sixten or sixfifteen and when miss bellows didnt answer you went on in looking for her no neither of us went inside but you saw something that worried you he looked up from his pad she sat perfectly still kept her eyes on his and said nothing you were worried enough to call the police she didnt return my call though she appeared to be very eager for the job she didnt return wades though it was obvious to me from our one and only meeting that she adored her dog her blinds were shut the door was closed i called the police neither faith nor i went inside neither of us saw anything so i cant tell you anything he sat back gnawed on his pencil did you try the door no it wasnt locked he let the silence hang filled the time by getting out his pack of gum offering it to tory when she shook her head he took out a stick unwrapped it carefully folded the wrapper torys heart began to dance in her chest so carl d folded the gum as carefully as he had its wrapper slipped it into his mouth you two had gone over now knowing faith lavelle id say shed have poked her head inвђcuriosity if nothing else whats this new teacher got in her place that kind of thing she didnt you knocked called out no weвђ she broke off fell silent you just stopped there at the door and decided to call the police he let out a sigh youre going to make me pull some teeth here now im a simple man got simple ways and ive been a cop moren twenty years cops got instincts gets hunches in the gut cant always explain them they just are could be you got like a hunch today outside the door of sherry bellowss apartment its possible some people tend toward hunches you might say you had one eighteen years ago when you led us to hope lavelle you had more of them up in new york a lot of people were glad you did his voice was kind a soft roll of words but his eyes she noted were watchful what happened in new york has nothing to do with this it has to do with you six kids got back home because you had hunches and one didnt six did carl d repeated i cant tell you any more than ive told you maybe you cant strikes me as more that you wont i was there eighteen years ago when you led us to that little girl im a simple man with simple ways but i was there and i was there today looking down at that young woman and what had been done to her it took me back i was at both those places saw both those things and so did you i didnt go in but you saw no she surged to her feet i didnt i felt i didnt see and i didnt look there was nothing i could do she was dead and there was nothing i could do for her or for hope or any of them i dont want that inside me again ive told you everything i know exactly as it happened why isnt that enough all right now all right miss tory why dont you sit down there try to relax while i go down and talk to faith id like to go home now you just sit down and catch your breath a little well see you get home soon enough he chewed over his thoughts on her and her reaction to his questions as he walked downstairs the girl he decided was a basket of troubles he could be sorry for it but that wouldnt stop him from using her if it suited his purposes he had a murder in his town it wasnt the first but it was damn near the ugliest in a good many years and he was a man who had hunches his gut told him tory bodeen was the key he found cade pacing at the bottom of the stairs you can go on up to her i expect she could use a shoulder your sister around shes in the back with wade hes checking on the dog too bad that dog cant talk was piney clipped him wasnt it so im told yeah too bad that dog cant talk he patted his notebook pocket and wandered into the back cade found tory still sitting on the sofa i should have just walked away or better smarter i should have let faith go in the way she wanted to faith would have found her wed have called the police and thered have been no questions he moved over to sit beside her why didnt you i didnt want her to see what was in there i didnt want to see it either and now chief russ expects me to go into a trance and give him the name of the killer it was professor plum in the conservatory with the candlestick im not a goddamn board game he took her hand youve every right to be angry with him with the situation why are you angry with yourself im not why would i be she looked down at their joined hands you bruised your knuckles hurts like a son of a bitch really it didnt seem like it when you hit him it didnt seem like you felt anything but mild annoyance i really must swat this pesky fly then get back to my book he grinned at that brought her hand to his lips as a lavelle one must maintain ones dignity bull i said thats what it seemed like but that wasnt the reality of it rage and disgust were the reality and you enjoyed flattening him i know she said with a sigh because thats what i was feeling hes an ugly man and hell try to find another way to hurt you now but hell come at your back because hes afraid of you and no thats just good sense and a reasonable understanding of human nature not my fabulous psychic powers clampett doesnt worry me he rubbed his bruised knuckles over her cheek dont let him worry you i wish i could she got to her feet i wish i could worry about him so it would occupy my mind why should i feel guilty i dont know tory why should you i barely knew sherry bellows i spent less than an hour with her no more than a brush on my life im sorry for what happened to her but does that mean i have to get involved no it wont change what happened to her nothing i do will change what happened so whats the point even if chief russ pretends hes open to whatever i could do m the end hell be just like the others why should i put myself in the middle of it only to be laughed at and dismissed she rounded on him dont you have anything to say im waiting for you to come around to it you think youre smart dont you you think you know me so well you don t know me at all i didnt come back here to right wrongs or avenge a dead friend i came back here to live my life and run my business all right dont say all right to me in that patient tone when your eyes are telling me iвђm a liar because her breath was starting to hitch he rose and went to her ill go with you she stared at him another moment then just went into his arms god oh god well go on down and tell the chief ill stay with you she nodded held on another minute and she accepted that after she was done in sherrys apartment he might never want to hold her again you need anything before we go in tory was still fighting to calm her nerves but met carl ds gaze levelly what like a crystal ball a pack of tarot cards hed gone in the front as shed requested and unlocked the patio door from the inside cut the seal and stepped out where she waited with cade there was less chance of being seen going in through the rear the killer had known that too now carl d pushed back his hat to scratch his wide brow guess youre a mite putout with me you pushed where i dont like to be pushed this isnt going to be pleasant for me and could very well be useless to you miss tory i got a young woman about your age lying on a table down at the funeral parlor county mes got his job to do on her her familys coming down tomorrow morning wouldnt call any of that pleasant for anybody hed wanted her to have that picture in her head tory acknowledged it with a nod youre a harder man than i remember youre a harder woman i guess we both got reason dont talk to me she opened the door herself stepped inside shed braced herself and concentrated on the light first the light in the room as hed flicked the switch the light sherry had permeated through the air it was a long time before she spoke a long time while what was left in the room slid inside her she liked music she liked noise being alone just wasnt natural to her she liked to have people over voices movement theyre all so fascinating to her she loved to talk there was fingerprint dust on the phone she didnt notice that it smeared her own fingers as she trailed them over it who was sherry bellows that had to come first conversations were like food to her shed have starved to death without them she liked to find out about people to listen to them talk about themselves she was very happy here she paused letting her fingers brush over picture frames the arm of a chair most people dont really want to hear what people say but she did her questions werent a ploy to wheedle an opening to talk about herself she had such plans teaching was an adventure to her all those minds to feed she walked past cade and carl d though she was aware of them they were becoming less important to her their presence less real she loved to read tory spoke quietly as she wandered toward a cheap brassplated shelf filled with books images floated through her mind of a pretty young woman tucking books on the shelf taking them out curled up with them on the chair on the patio with a big shaggy dog snoring at her feet it was easy to blend into those images to open to them become part of them she tasted saltвђpotato chipsвђon her tongue and felt a lovely wave of contentment but thats just another way to be with people you slide into the book you become a character your favorite character you experience the dog gets up on the sofa with you or in the bed he leaves hair everywhere you swear you could make a coat out of the hair he sheds but hes such a sweetheart so you run the vacuum most every day turn the music up so you can hear it over the motor music pulsed inside her head loud cheerfully loud her foot tapped to it mr rice next door he complained about that but you bake him some cookies and bring him around everyones so nice in this town its just where you wanted to be she turned from the bookshelf her eyes were blurry blank but she was smiling cades heart skipped a beat as her smoky gaze passed over him passed through him jerry the little boy from upstairs hes just crazy about mongo jerrys just as cute as a bug and twice as pesky one day you want a little boy just like him all eyes and grins and sticky fingers she turned in a circle her lips curved her eyes blind sometimes in the afternoon after school theyll go out and run around together or hell throw mongo tennis balls fuzzy yellow balls that get all wet and messy its fun to sit on the patio and watch them jerry has to go in his mother called him in to do his chores before supper mongos just plain worn out so hell sleep out on the patio you want the music on loud as you can without bothering mr rice because youre feeling so happy so hopeful a glass of wine white wine not really good wine but you cant afford better still its nice enough and you can sip and listen to the music and plan she walked to the patio doors looked out instead of dark she saw early twilight the big dog spread out on the concrete like a shaggy welcome mat and snoring lightly lots to think about so many plans so much to do you feel so good about things and just cant wait to get started you want to have a party have the rooms crowded with people and flirt with that gorgeous vet and that slicklooking cade lavelle my my they sure grow them handsome in progress but now you should make a meal you have to feed the dog maybe another glass of wine while youre putting it together she strolled into the kitchen humming the tune she heard in her head sheryl crow a salad a nice big salad with extra carrots because mongo likes them youll mix them in with his kibble she reached down brushed her fingers over the handle of the cupboard then let out a gasp stumbled back instinctively cade moved toward her but carl d gripped his arm dont he spoke in a whisper as though in church let her be he was there just there torys breathing came in quick short bursts now she had both hands fisted at her throat you didnt hear him you cant see him theres a knife he has a knife oh god oh god oh god his hands over your mouth squeezing the knifes at your throat youre so scared so scared you wont scream you wont youll do anything if he doesnt hurt you his voice is at your ear soft quiet what did he do with mongo did he hurt him its all tumbling in your head its not real it cant be real but the knifes so sharp he pushes you and youre afraid youll stumble and the knife she shuffled out of the kitchen braced a hand on the wall when she swayed the blinds are drawn no one can see no one can help he wants you in the bedroom and you know what hes going to do if you could only get away away from the knife tory froze at the door to the bedroom nausea rolled into her in short choppy waves i cant i cant she turned her face to the wall struggling to find herself through all the fear and violence i dont want to see this he killed her here why do i have to see it thats enough cade shoved away carl ds restraining hand goddamn it thats enough but when he reached for tory she stumbled away its in my head ill never get it out of my head dont talk to me dont touch me she pressed her hands to her face trapping her own breath and let it claw back inside her oh oh he pushes you on the bed facedown and hes on top of you hes already hard and feeling him feeling him pressing against you you struggle the fears wild inside you huge choking theres a heat to it fear burns she moaned went down to her knees beside the bed he hits you hard the back of the neck the pains so sharp it rushes through you stuns you he hits you again the side of your face explodes with it you taste blood your own blood blood tastes the same as terror the same he yanks your arms behind your back and the pain of thats just another layer tentacles of that pain slithered and groped inside her tangled with a horror so huge it seemed the mass of it all would burst out of her brain she pressed her face to the side of the mattress dug her fingers into it its dark the rooms dark and the musics playing and you cant think over the pain youre crying you try to plead with him but hes tied a cloth over your mouth he hits you again and you start sliding away somewhere half conscious you hardly feel it when he cuts your clothes away the knife nicks you but its worse so much worse when he uses his hands on you tory doubled over wrapped her arms around her belly and began to rock it hurts it hurts you cant even cry when hes raping you just let it be over but he keeps beating himself into you and you have to go away you have to be somewhere else you have to go away exhausted tory laid her head on the side of the bed closed her eyes it was like being smothered she thought dimly like being buried alive so the blood rings in your ears like a thousand bells and the sweat that coats your body is cold so viciously cold she had to fight her way back into the air back into self when he was finished with her he strangled her with his hands she couldnt fight anymore she cried or he did i cant tell but he cut the rope from around her wrists he took it with him he didnt want to leave any of himself behind but he did like an ice rime on glass i cant stay here please get me out of here please get me away from here its all right cade bent down to gather her into his arms her skin was cold slicked with sweat its all right baby im sick i cant breathe in here she lay her head on his shoulder and let herself drop away he drove her home she didnt speak didnt move throughout the drive she sat like a ghost pale and silent while the wind through the open windows of the truck blew over her face and hair there was an anger in him that had lashed out at carl d when the chief said he would follow them back but shed said to let him come that was the last thing shed said so his anger had no target or release and built steadily inside him his silence was like a bruise gathering dark and full of violence he pulled up to the marsh house and she was out of the truck before he could come around to help her you dont have to talk to him his voice was clipped his eyes brutally cold yes i do you cant see what i see then not do whatever you can she shifted her exhausted eyes toward the police cruiser he knew that and used it theres no need for you to stay dont be stupid he snapped and turned to wait for carl d as she walked to the door you watch your step cade faced the chief the minute he was out of his cruiser you be very very careful with her or ill use whatever comes to hand to make you pay for it i expect youre upset upset cade took a fistful of carl ds shirt he felt he could break the man in half one quick snap you put her through that and so did i he said dropping his hand in disgust and for what i dont know not yet fact is im a bit shaken by this but i gotta use whatever comes to hand too and right now thats tory im feeling my way here cade there was regret in his voice in his eyes a veneer over duty i dont want to hurt that girl if it makes you feel any better im going to be careful as careful as i know how and im going to remember probably the rest of my life the way she looked back there so will i cade said and turned away she was making tea an herbal blend she hoped would soothe her stomach and stop her hands from trembling she said nothing when the two men walked in but got out a bottle of bourbon set it on the counter then sat i could use a shot of that aint supposed to on duty but we got extenuating circumstances cade got out two glasses poured doubles he came in through the back tory began you know that youll already know a great deal that i can tell you i appreciate it carl d scraped back a chair you just tell me how it feels best to you and take your time she was alone in the apartment she had a couple of glasses of wine she felt good excited hopeful she had music playing she was in the kitchen when he came in fixing a salad for dinner getting ready to feed the dog he took her from behind used the knife shed set aside when she pulled out the dog food torys voice was flat dull her face expressionless she lifted her tea sipped set it down she didnt see him he kept behind her kept the knife to her throat hed closed the blinds to the patio i think he locked the door but it doesnt matter she didnt try to run she was too afraid of the knife absently she lifted her hand to her throat skimmed her fingers along her windpipe as if nursing a sting i dont know what he said to her everything she felt was so much stronger than what he felt he didnt particularly want her what was left of him there was rage and confusion and a kind of horrible pride she was a substitute a handy outlet for a a need he doesnt even understand he took her into the bedroom kept her facedown on the bed he struck her several times the back of the neck the face he tied her hands behind her back good strong rope he closed the curtains so that they could be private so that it would be dark he didnt want her to see his face but more i think more he didnt want to see hers he sees another face when he rapes her he uses the knife to cut off her clothes hes very careful but he still nicks her on the back and up by her shoulder carl d nodded took a long drink thats right she had two shallow cuts and there were ligature marks on her wrists but we didnt find any rope he took it with him hes never done this inside before its always been outofdoors and theres something exciting about doing these things to her in bed when he hits her it gives him pleasure he likes to hurt women but more than pleasure it provides him with a kind of relief for this pentup hunger in him this need to prove himself a man hes a man when he makes a woman bend to his will while he rapes her hes happier someone stronger inside himself than he is any other time he celebrates his manhood this way in a way he cant in any other trying to see him to crawl inside him hurt her head she rubbed at her temple pushed harder it is sexual for him and he believes she was meant to be taken to be dominated hes convinced himself of that and still hes careful he uses a condom how does he know who shes fucked shes a whore like all the others a man has to look out for himself you said he didnt want to leave any of himself behind yes he wont leave his seed inside her she doesnt deserve it iвђthis isnt what i feel from him i feel almost nothing from him her fingers drilled at her throbbing temple there are blanks and dead ends turns in him i dont know how to tell you thats fine carl d told her go ahead this isnt an act of procreation but of punishment for her and ego for him during the process she ceases to exist for him shes nothing so its easy to kill her when its over hes proud but hes angry too its never exactly what he hoped it would be it never completely purges him her fault of course the next time will be better he cuts the rope he turns off her music and he leaves her in the dark who is he i dont see his face i can see some of his thoughts some of the more desperate of his emotions but i dont see him he knew her hed seen her i think hes spoken to her he knew enough to know about the dog tory closed her eyes a moment tried to focus he drugged the dog i think he drugged the dog burger laced with something risky this was all very risky and that added to the excitement someone might have seen him all the other times there was no one to see what other times the first was hope her voice broke she lifted her tea again calmed herself there were four others that i know of i had a friend look into it she found out thereve been five over the last eighteen years all of them killed in late august all of them young blondes each one was the age hope would have been if shed lived i think sherry was younger but she wasnt the one he wanted a serial killer over eighteen years you can verify it with the fbi she looked at cade then for the first time since theyd sat down hes still killing hope im sorry im so sorry she rose and her cup clattered in the saucer as she carried it to the counter im afraid it could be my father why cade kept his eyes on her face why would you believe that he hasвђwhen he hurt me it aroused him the shame of it sliced through her shards of glass jagged and edged with bitter heat he never touched me sexually but it aroused him to hurt me i think looking back i cant be sure he didnt know of my plans to meet hope that night when he came in for supper he was in a good mood a rare one it was as if he was waiting for me to make a mistake to open the door so that he could pounce when i did when i told my mother she could find the canning wax up in the top of the cupboardвђsuch a stupid mistakeвђhe had me he didnt always beat me that bad but that night when he was finished he could be sure i wasnt going anywhere she came back to the table sherry was in the store when he came in yesterday he asked her about her dog and shed just filled out an application for a job i had the paper on the counter her name her address her phone number he would have been certain of me certain id be too afraid to tell anyone id seen him he wouldnt have expected me to go to the police but he couldnt have been sure of her you believe hannibal bodeen killed sherry bellows because shed seen him it would have been his excuse his justification for what he wanted to do i only know hes capable of it i cant tell you any more im sorry im not feeling well she walked away from the table and closed herself in the bathroom she couldnt fight off the sickness anymore and let it come let it empty her out afterward she lay on the floor on the cool tiles and waited for the weakness to abate the quiet seemed to echo in her ears along with her own heartbeat when she could she got to her feet and turned the shower to blistering hot she was chilled to the bone it seemed nothing could warm her but the water helped her imagine all the ugliness the smear of it being washed off her skin if not out of her mind steadier she wrapped herself in a towel dosed herself with three aspirin and stepped out prepared to curl into bed and lose herself in sleep cade was standing by the window looking out over the moonwashed dark hed left the lights off so that silvered glow silhouetted him there she could hear the flutter of night beyond the screen the wings and whines that were the music of the marsh her heart ached for everything she couldnt stop herself from loving i thought youd gone she walked to the closet for her robe he didnt turn are you feeling any better yes im fine hardly that i just want to know if youre any better yes decisively she belted the robe im better thank you youre under no obligation here cade i know what to do for myself good he turned but his face remained in shadows she couldnt read it refused to try to see anything else tell me what to do for you nothing im grateful you went with me and that you brought me home its more than you had to do more than can be expected of anyone now back off or is that just what you expect for me to go to leave you alone to take myself off to a nice comfortable distance comfortable for whom you or me both i imagine you dont think any more of me than that any more of us im awfully tired her voice wavered shaming her im sure you are too it couldnt have been pleasant for you he stepped toward her then and she saw what shed known she would see anger black waves of it so she shut her eyes for gods sake tory his hand brushed over her cheek back into the wet tangle of her hair has everyone always let you down she didnt speak couldnt a tear slid down her cheek and lay glistening on his thumb she went biddable as a child as he led her to the bed lifted her onto his lap just rest he murmured im not going anywhere she pressed her face into his shoulder here was comfort and strength and above all the solidity no one had ever offered her he asked no questions so neither would she instead she curled into him lifted her mouth to his touch me please i need to feel gently so gently he ran his hands over her he could give her the comfort of his body take his own in hers trembling she reached for him her lips parting under his and going warm slowly so slowly he loosened the tie of the robe slipped it from her laid his hand on her heart it beat frantically and her breathing still caught on sobs she fought back think of me he murmured and lay her on the bed look at me he touched his lips to her throat her shoulders skimming his hands through her hair when she reached up to unbutton his shirt i need to feel she repeated i need to feel you she put her palms against his chest youre warm youre real make me real cade she sank into him when his mouth came back to hers sank deep into the tenderness of it the kindness that erased the horror shed seen the calm came first the understanding that this brush and slide of flesh this meeting of bodies had nothing to do with pain or fear his mouth on her breast feeding arousing sped the beat of her blood his hands strong patient washed her mind clear of everything but the need to join she sighed out his name as he danced over the first peak she was fluid and open rising toward him sliding against him when she rolled he found her mouth again then let her set the pace she rose over him her hair like wet ropes gleaming over her shoulders her face was flushed with life damp with tears she took him into her bowing back her breath catching releasing her fingers locking with his as she began to move there was nothing in his world now but her the heat of her surrounding him the steady rise and fall of her hips as she rode him the dark smoke of her eyes stayed wide and fixed on his even as her breath began to tear he saw her come watched the force of it ripple through her god she brought their joined hands to her breasts more again touch me touch me touch me he took her breasts in his hands reared up and took them into his mouth so that she arched back when she gripped his hair he drove deeper filling her taking her taking himself they stayed wrapped around each other even when he shifted to lie with her they remained tangled and close she breathed him in you should sleep now he murmured im afraid to sleep ill be right here i thought you would go i know you were so angry i thought no she needed another minute courage didnt come without effort would you get me some water all right he shifted and rising pulled on his jeans before he went out into the kitchen she heard him open a cupboard for a glass close it again and when he came back she was sitting on the side of the bed in her robe thank you tory are you always sick afterward no her hand tightened on the glass ive never done anything like i cant talk about that yet but i need to talk i need to tell you about something else about when i was in new york i know what happened it wasnt your fault you only know parts and pieces what you heard in the news i need to explain because shed tightened up again he combed his fingers through her hair you wore your hair differently there youd lightened it cut it shorter she managed a laugh my attempt at a new me i like it better this way i changed a lot more than my hair when i went there escaped there i was only eighteen terrified but exhilarated they couldnt make me go back and even if he came after me he couldnt make me go back i was free id saved some money ive always been good at saving money and gran gave me two thousand dollars i suppose it saved my life i was able to afford a little apartment well a room it was on the west side this cramped little space i loved it it was all mine she could remember could bring back inside her the sheer joy of standing in that empty box of a room of hugging herself as she stared out the window at the dour brick face of the next building she could hear the riot of noise from the street below as new york shoved its way toward the business of the day she could remember the absolute bliss of being free i got a job at a souvenir shop sold a lot of empire state building paperweights and tshirts after a couple of months i found a better job at a classy gift shop it was a longer commute but the pay was a little better and it was so nice to be around all those lovely things i was good at it i dont doubt it the first year i was so happy i was promoted to assistant manager and i made some friends dated it was so blessedly normal id forget for long periods that i hadnt always lived there then someone would comment on my accent and it would bring me back here but that was all right id gotten away i was exactly where i wanted to be who i wanted to be she looked at him then i didnt think of hope i didnt let myself think of her you had a right to your own life tory thats what i told myself god knows thats what i wanted more than anything else in the world my own id gone back to see my parents during that period partly out of obligation partly too because things never seem as bad as they were when youre away from them i suppose i thought that since i felt so normal that i could have a normal relationship with them she paused shut her eyes but mostly i went back because i wanted to show them what id made of myself despite them look at me i have nice clothes a good job a happy life so there she gave a weak laugh i failed on all three levels no they did doesnt matter i guess i was a little off balance because of the visit even after i got back to new york then one day after work not long after that i went by the market picked up a few things i dont even remember exactly but i took my bag home and started to put everything away she looked down at her water clear water in a clear glass then i was standing there in that tiny kitchen with the refrigerator open and a carton of milk in my hand a carton of milk she repeated her voice hardly a whisper with a picture of a little girl on the side karen anne wilcox age four missing but i wasnt seeing the picture i was seeing her little karen only she didnt have blond hair like in the picture it was brown and cut nearly short as a boys she was sitting in a room by herself playing with dolls it was february but i could see the sky out her window pretty blue sky and could hear the water the sea why karen annes in florida i thought shes at the beach and when i came back to myself the milk carton was on the floor with the milk spilling out of it she drank again then set the glass aside i was so angry what business of it was mine i didnt know this girl or her parents i didnt want to know them how dare they interfere with my life that way why should i have to be involved then i thought of hope she rose walked to the window i couldnt stop thinking about her about the little girl i went to the police they thought i was just one more lunatic passed me off rolled their eyes while they spoke very slowly as if i were stupid as well as crazy i was embarrassed and angry but i couldnt get the child out of my head while two of the detectives were interviewing me i lost my temper i said something to one of them about how if he werent so damned closedminded hed listen instead of worrying how much the mechanic was going to hose him for over the transmission job that got their attention turned out the older one detective michaels had his car in the shop they still didnt believe me but now i worried them the interview turned into more of a grilling they kept pushing and pushing and my nerves were fraying the younger one i guess he was playing good cop he went out and got me a coke he brought back this plastic bag evidence bag inside were mittens bright red mittens theyd found them on the floor of macys where shed been snatched while her mother was shopping at christmas shed been missing since december he tossed them on the table like a dare she remembered his eyes jacks eyes the hardness in the beautiful green brilliance of jacks eyes i wasnt going to pick them up i was so angry and ashamed but i couldnt help it i picked up the bag and i saw her so clear in her little red coat all the people crowded in trying to buy presents the noise her mama was right there at the counter working on picking out a sweater but she wasnt paying attention and the little girl wandered off just a few feet then the woman came and scooped her right up she bundled her close so close and tight and pushed through people and right out the door no one paid any attention everyone was busy she told karen to be very quiet because she was taking her to see santa claus and she walked very fast down the avenue very fast and there was a car waiting a white chevrolet with a dented right fender and new york plates she let out a sigh shook her head i even had the plate number god it was all so clear i could feel the bite of the wind as it whipped down the street i told them all that told them what the woman looked like after she took off the black wig she had light brown hair and pale blue eyes and she was slim shed worn a big bulky coat with padding under it tory glanced over her shoulder cade sat on the bed watching listening shed planned this for weeks she wanted a little girl a pretty little girl and shed picked karen out when shed seen her mama walk her to day care so she took her thats all and she and her husband drove straight through to florida they cut her hair and dyed it and didnt let her go outside they said she was a little boy named robbie she blinked turned back they found her it took a while because i couldnt see just where but they worked with the police in florida and within a couple of weeks they found her in a trailer park in fort lauderdale the people who had her didnt hurt her they bought her toys and fed her they were sure shed just forget people think children forget but they dont she sighed outside an owl began to hoot in long bass notes that echoed through the marsh and into the room where she stood so karen was the first for me her parents came to see me after to thank me they cried both of them i thought maybe this is a gift maybe im meant to help people like this i began to open myself to it to explore it even celebrate it i read everything i could i submitted to tests and i began to see jackвђdetective jack krentz the younger of the two cops whod investigated the kidnapping i fell in love with him she came back for the water drained the glass there were others after karen i thought id found the reason i was what i was i thought i had everything i was wildly in love with a man i believed loved me and considered me a kind of partner now and again hed bring something home ask me to hold it i was thrilled to be able to help in his work we did it quietly i didnt want any credit or any notoriety but my work with missing children leaked so i began to get both in that area and with it the letters the calls the pleas that haunt you night and day still i wanted so much to help she set the empty glass aside wandered away toward the window i didnt notice the way jack was starting to watch me that cooleyed stare of his i thought it was just his way he was the first man id been with and we were togetherвђwe were loversвђfor over a year when it started to fall apart he was seeing someone else she was there in his mind her smell in his senses when he came to me i was betrayed and furious and i confronted him well he was more betrayed more furious and much better at it i had spied on his thoughts i was worse than a freak how could he have a relationship with a woman who couldnt respect his privacy who invaded his mind he managed to turn that one around on you he cheats and youre wrong cade shook his head you didnt buy that i wasnt quite twentytwo years old he was my first and only lover more i loved him and i had however unintentionally spied on his thoughts so i took the blame but it wasnt enough he began to berate me to accuse me of trying to take the credit for the good hard work he put into cases whatever hed felt for me in the beginning had turned into something else and it hurt both of us and as things were falling apart between us there was jonah jonah mansfield she pressed a hand to her chest squeezed her eyes shut a minute oh it still breaks my heart he was eight and had been kidnapped by his parents former housekeeper the police knew that there was a ransom demand of two million dollars jack was assigned to the team working the case he didnt bring it to me the mansfields did they asked me for help i told them what i could the boy was being held in some sort of basement i didnt know if it was a home or a building but it was across the river jack was furious id gone around him behind his back he wouldnt listen to me they hadnt hurt the boy and they were prepared to give him back if the ransom was paid and if it was delivered exactly as theyd outlined was i willing to risk a childs life so i could prove what a wonder i was thats what he asked me and he had so eroded my confidence that i wasnt sure she let out a shaky breath im still not really sure what the answer to that question is but i could see the boy and i could see the woman she was going to let him go it was only money to her and petty revenge against the mansfields for firing her i told them he was being treated well he was scared but he was all right i told them to pay the ransom to do what she said and get their son back safe really no more or less than what the police wanted them to do but what i didnt see what i didnt see because i was so devastated by jack was that the men working with her werent as coolheaded as she her voice cracked oh yes she thought it still breaks the heart i told jack there were two men but the investigation indicated there was only one the woman and one accomplice i was muddying the waters getting in the way when the money was paid they did what theyd planned to do what i hadnt seen all along they killed jonah and the woman she took a deep breath i didnt know about it till i heard it on the news until the reporters started calling me id pulled back curled up in my own little ball of misery because jack had turned away from me i dont know how they expected to get away they had a van and it seemed they planned to just drive off but they hadnt really planned anything it was the woman whod laid it all out whod calculated the steps but in the end they didnt want to share the money with her they figured theyd just drive west but the police had trailed the money and were waiting for them two police officers were shot and one of the kidnappers was fatally wounded i hadnt seen any of that what id persuaded the parents to do resulted in the death of their child no the kidnapping resulted in the death of their child circumstances greed fear i couldnt have saved him ive learned to live with that the same way ive learned to live with not saving hope but it left me broken i spent weeks in the hospital years in therapy but i never really got it all back not all some of the blame was mine cade because i was so distracted so distraught about jack that i didnt focus i didnt pay enough attention my life was falling apart and i was desperate to keep him part of it part of me even when he denounced me helped smear me in the press i didnt blame him for a long long time i didnt blame him part of me still doesnt he was more concerned about his ego than you more concerned about his ego than that child i dont know that it was a difficult time he was unhappy in our relationship and wary of me so he left you twisting in the wind on a rope he helped make is that what you expect from me tory its what i expected she said calmly at this point i dont know what to expect from you i just want you to know i understand what its like for you no i dont think you understand anything he wasnt in love with you i am she made a sound part gasp part sob but stayed exactly where she was so he got to his feet what are you going to do about it iвђ her throat closed not fear she realized as she stared at him it wasnt fear filling her it was hope flying on it she leaped into his arms as horrible as murder was it was still interesting a nights distance from it made it more like a movie than real life faith wasnt about to stay cooped up at beaux reves when she could poke around in town and be in the center of the reel lilah had seen through her of course and loaded her down with errands if she was going to gossip lilah told her when shed handed over her list she might as well be productive too and she shouldnt forget to report all the details when she got home again there was plenty of gossip to be found at the drugstore odds were in favor of an old boyfriend whod come to town to convince sherry to mend things and then had gone crazy when shed refused after all shed only been in town a few weeks a young pretty girl like that was bound to have left a boyfriend or two back home at the post office there was little doubt the killer had been sherrys secret lover and the sex had gotten out of hand no one named any likely candidates for the secret lover position but it was a consensus over the stamp buying and certifiedletter sending that shed had one a woman who looked like that was bound to have a lover and it was a sure bet he was married else why had nobody known about him this led to the theory that sherry had threatened to go to his wife and the ensuing argument had led to violence the smart money picked up this theory and ran with it putting every married man in the area between twenty and sixty on the list of suspects with the odds favoring a teacher or administrator from progress high but faith remembered what tory had said while theyd sat on the grass outside sherrys apartment and she remembered hope it wouldnt hurt to stop by southern comfort and see what tory had to say about things today she stopped by the market first and soberly contemplated the bananas a few feet away maxine loaded a bag with apples and sniffled faith edged a little closer and picked a bunch of bananas at random well hi there maxine you all right honey maxine shook her head blinked back fresh tears that swam into her eyes i just cant seem to function wade gave me the day off because i was feeling so sad but i couldnt stay home maxine sweetie faith cursed her faulty internal radar when boots mooney guided her shopping cart into produce she wasnt in the mood to tangle with wades mother again the three carts bumped each other facetoface boots made cooing noises and handed maxine a hankie it just keeps hitting me over and over maxine dabbed at her eyes i told ma id do the grocery shopping and now i cant think boots nodded i guess were all upset about poor sherry bellows i just dont know how it could happen i dont understand it its not supposed to happen here i know you shouldnt be scared sympathetic faith rubbed maxines shoulder most people think it was a boyfriend who went crazy she didnt have a boyfriend maxine fumbled in her pocket pulled out a tattered tissue she wasnt seeing anybody at all but she had a little thing for wade wade faiths hand froze as did the expression of compassion on her face over maxines bent head her eyes locked with bootss she liked to come in and flirt with him started out pumping me for information about him not obnoxious like maxine added with another sniffle but friendly interested you know was he married was he seeing someone that kind of thing faith dropped her comforting hand i see hes so goodlooking you know i had a crush on him myself a while back so i couldnt blame her remembering herself maxine flushed and peeked above the hankie toward boots beg your pardon miss boots wade he neverвђ of course not boots gave maxines back a quick pat why id think there was something wrong with a young woman if she didnt get herself a crush on my wade her gaze drifted to faith again narrowed hes a wonderful man yesm he is so you couldnt blame sherry for having an eye for him really faith thought couldnt you really and we got to be friends sherry and me maxine went on comforted by the two sympathetic pairs of ears she helped me study sometimes and we were going to go out and celebrate when the semester was over drive down to charleston we thought and go to some clubs said she was mandeprived just now didnt mind so much while shed been getting her degree and starting her career but she was looking to start dating again maxine wiped her eyes again she wanted to get married one day have a family we talked about it im sorry boots answered i didnt know you were close she was just so nice and she was smart and we had a lot of things in common shed worked through college just like i am we could talk about clothes and guys and just anything we both loved dogs i dont know whats going to happen to her poor dog now id take him but i just cant she began to weep then as much for the dog as for her lost friend dont take on so maxine faiths radar was working now well enough for her to sense the other shoppers nudging closer to try to catch a few words wadell find him a good home and the chief figure all this out i feel so sick inside just yesterday she was laughing and excited we had lunch together in the park she was going to work for tory bodeen at the new shop least she hoped to she was making all these plans its just that she was so alive one minute and the next im just so sad and confused about it i understand faith knew very well what it was like to be left behind after death honey you should just go on home want me to take you no thanks no i think ill just walk i keep expecting to see her coining down the street with mongo i just keep expecting that maxine murmured and scrubbing at tears walked toward the exit i know faith said quietly and turned blindly away she couldnt explain how much worse it was when you did see the dead every time you looked in the mirror here boots held out a second hankie youre prepared annoyed with herself faith took it long enough to stop any damage to her mascara im heartsick about that girl and barely knew her to give faith a moment to recover boots began to select apples i came out myself today because i couldnt think about anything else at home poor little maxine how much harder is it on her it was kind of you to offer to take her home it wouldve gotten me out of marketing duty boots laid a hand on faiths arm until faith looked at her it was kind of you she repeated its a comfort to me to see kindness in the woman my son is in love with just as it was to see that little flash of jealousy all in all im glad i decided to give myself and jr a break from our diet and make apple cobbler tonight you give my best to your mother and lilah wont you boots glided away with her apples leaving faith frowning after her pretty sharp arent you miss boots for all your fluttering faith mumbled pretty goddamn sharp irritated faith pushed her cart through produce plucking up lilahs items and wishing shed skipped the damn market altogether she had been jealous damn it had wade flirted back she scowled at the boxes of butter in dairy of course he had he was a man very likely hed considered doing more than flirting the bastard how many times had he imagined sherry naked fantasized about getting her that way and then good christ what was she doing working herself up into a mad on wade over a dead woman how petty how shallow how horrible could she be faith what she snapped it out whirled with a box of land o lakes in her hand and a killing glare on her face dwight held up a hand for peace whoa sorry no im sorry my mind was on something making the effort she put a bright smile on her face and bent down to the toddler riding in the basket seat and arent you the handsomest thing you and daddy doing the marketing today luke held up an open box of oreos got cookies he announced and as his face was already smeared with black hed been enjoying them so i see his mamas going to scalp me if i dont clean him up before she sees him faces wash but faith moved strategically out of the reach of chocolategunked fingers lissy got you doing the shopping today shes not feeling well got herself in a state about what happened yesterday she says shes afraid to set foot outside the house and had me checking locks six times last night and wasnt it just like lissy frazier to make it all about her faith thought but nodded sympathetically i guess it makes us all a little edgy shes a bundle of nerves right now im that worried about her faith seeing as shes got another month or so before the baby comes her mothers over there staying with her awhile i figure the champ and meвђ he paused to ruffle lukes hair wed take ourselves off for a while give her some peace and quiet arent you the good daddy have you heard any more about where things stand carl ds investigating and he isnt sharing a lot i guess its too soon for that i guess theyll get the autopsy results soon carl ds a good man dont mean to say otherwise but this sort of thing he trailed off shook his head its not what hes used to dealing with none of us is its not the first time its happened he glanced back looking blank for a minute then his eyes clouded im sorry faith i wasnt thinking this must bring back bad memories for you the memories are always there i just hope they catch this one catch him and hang him by his toes and cut off hisвђ ahвђ lips twisted into a pained smile dwight squeezed her arm and rolled his eyes toward his son little ears sorry she said as luke decorated his dandelion puff hair with the best part of an oreo honey lissys going to stomp you into the ground till your ears bleed if you bring her boy home in that shape i oughta get points for bringing home groceries you get minor points for that were talking major here for major try jewelry well youd know dwight scratched his head actually i was thinking of hunting her up a present take her mind off her worries thought id stop by the drugstore and find some perfume they havent got anything special in there oldlady scents mostly you go by torys place and youll find what youre looking for put a smile back on lissys face dwight took a good look at luke who was now happily coating the red plastic handle of the cart with black oreo goo you think im taking this bull calf in that china shop you got a point there the plan that formulated in her mind pleased her very much ill tell you what well do dwight you give me the money and ill go on in and find something thatll make you a hero when youre done marketing and scrape a few layers of cookie off your luke you just come by and ill run it out to you really you wouldnt mind i was going by anyway besides what are friends for she held out her hand palm up good thing i just went to the bank i got cash delighted he took out his wallet counted bills into her hand when he stopped she simply stared balefully at him cough it up dwight you cant be a hero for under two hundred two hundred jesus faith youll take all but my last dollar here looks like youll have to go by the bank again she snatched the bills out of his wallet while he winced thatll give me more time to find just the right thing what about your groceries here he called after her oh she waved dismissively ill come back later on dwight blew out breath put his nearly empty wallet back in his pocket i think he told his son weve just been hosed it was perfect faith decided she could go in pick torys brain and do a good deed then it was only a hop and skip down to wades office shed have time to decide whether to punish him for making her imagine him imagining sex with sherry bellows it couldnt have worked out better this time she took bee out of the car snuggling cooing now youre going to be a good girl arent you so mean old tory wont complain you sit like a sweetheart and give you a nice chewy bone thats mamas baby dont you bring that dog in here again instantly tory was out from behind the counter ready to block faith as she came in oh stop being so pissy shes going to sit right here like a doll baby arent you bee honey she lifted one of the puppys paws waved it while they both stared at faith with equally innocent expressions damn it faith shes just good as gold you watch she dug out the bone first as insurance then set bee down pressing her rump until it hit the floor besides what kind of welcome is that when i have a mission and cash she said pulling out the wad of bills if that dog pees on my floorвђ shes got too much dignity for that im doing dwight a little favor lissys feeling poorly and he wants to cheer her up with a nice present tory blew out a breath but she calculated the number of bills faith was cheerfully waving house or body decoration body lets have a look good thing dwight ran into me men dont have a clue about such things most of the time and lissys taste is all in her mouth and its not so keen there faith paused at the display case lifted her eyebrows was that a snicker i have too much dignity for that you ask me youve got too much dignity for your own good lets see that necklace there the one with the pink topaz and moonstones you know your rocks you bet your ass a woman wants to know if some mans trying to pass off a peridot as an emerald this is nice she held it up let the light play over it but i think its too much metal for her really more my style is this how you accomplish a mission i can do more than one thing at a time lets just put this aside here so i can think about it she wandered down the case you doing all right yes well dont actually try to have a conversation and spoil your record tory opened her mouth shut it again blew out a breath im all right a little shaky inside i guess but all right how about you faith glanced up smiled thinly see your tongue didnt turn black and fall out or anything im well enough been gathering the gossip as i go and dont bother to look down your nose youre as interested in what people are saying as i am ive heard what theyre saying ive had considerable traffic in here today people love to come in and get a look at me then flap about it all its different for you faith youre one of them im not i dont know why i thought i ever could be i cant understand why youd want to be but if you do you just have to stick with it people get used to you around here theyd get used to a oneeyed midget with a limp if he lived here long enough thats comforting lets see this bracelet cade seems to have gotten used to you mighty fast pink and blue topaz in silver lobsterclaw clasp very nice very lissy those earrings there shed want them to match she doesnt have the imagination for otherwise seems odd you taking the time to pick out gifts for her when you dont appear to like her oh i dont dislike her faith pursed her lips and considered the earrings shes too silly for me to work up the energy to dislike always was she makes dwight happy and i like him box these up and wrap them up pretty dwightll owe me big i think ill take this necklace for myself cheer up my mood youre turning into my best customer tory carried the jewelry to her counter hard to figure you have things i admire in here bee had fallen asleep with the bone in her mouth faith stopped long enough to beam at her in adoration plus you seem to be making cade happy and i like him even more than i like dwight she leaned on the counter while tory boxed lissys gifts fact is youre sleeping with my brother im sleeping with your cousin that practically makes us lovers faith blinked snorted then threw back her head and laughed christ thats a frightening thought and here i was wondering if i should consider us being friends another frightening thought isnt it still it occurred to me yesterday when we were sitting out there that you and were probably feeling the same thing thinking the same thing remembering the same thing thats a powerful connection tory tied the cord very carefully very precisely it was very considerate of you to stay with me i tell myself often that its better to be alone but its difficult sometimes its very difficult i hate to be alone more than anything else in the world i am so often irritated by my own company she caught herself laughed well listen to us having almost an intimate conversation im going to give you dwights nice fresh cash for lissys but ill charge mine before she could reach into her purse tory reached out laid a hand on hers odd how it had become easier to touch to be touched since shed come back to progress in my life i never had another friend like hope i dont know as any of us ever have friends the way we do as children but i could use a friend flustered faith stared at her i dont know that i make a particularly good one i know i havent not since hope so that starts us on level ground i think im in love with your brother she let out a long shaky breath moved her hand to keep it busy if it turns out i am i think it would be nice for everyone if you and i could be friends i know i love my brother though he is a regular pain in my ass life has some awfully screwy angles faith laid dwights money down took out her credit card you close up at six dont you thats right why dont you meet me after work well have us a drink all right where faiths eyes glittered oh i think hope memorial would be appropriate im sorry in the swamp you know where for gods sake faith havent been there yet have you well its time id say and it strikes me as a good spot to see if you and i turn a corner got the belly for it tory snapped up the credit card i do if you do she hauled groceries home and met lilahs complaint about her late arrival with just enough bitchiness at being given the chore in the first place to satisfy them both and dont start yapping that the tomatoes are too soft or the bananas too green or next time i wont be your errand girl you eat dont you dont do another damn thing around here i can see so you can haul the food in once in a blue moon the moon turns blue around here more than it used to faith got out the iced tea two glasses then settled down to relay the gossip so lilah sat down shifted comfortably what are they saying all manner of things most of which are as farfetched as a liberal republican lot of people are saying it mustve been an old boyfriend or a lover a new married lover but i ran into maxine in produce and it turns out she was friends with sherry and she says sherry didnt have a boyfriend just now dont mean some idiot man didnt think he should be lilah took out her lipstick twirling the tube up and down i heard she let him in though cause her dog didnt send up a racket and there wasnt no breakin like people thought at first letting a man into your house doesnt mean you want him to rape you didnt say so lilah colored her lips rubbed them together just saying a womans got to be careful you open a door for a man you better be ready to boot his ass right back out again youre such a romantic lilah i got plenty of romance in me miss faith i just balance it with good hard sense something youre missing when it comes to men maybe that poor girl was missing it too ive been sensible enough to kick plenty of them out on their ass had to go and marry two of them first though didnt you faith took out a cigarette smiled blandly i could have married more than two least im not a spinster lilah met the smile equably marriage was all its cracked up to be itd last longer that girl she didnt have an exhusband did she no i dont think so faith margaret stood in the doorway her face rigid i need to speak with you in the parlor all right faith rolled her eyes at lilah crushed out her cigarette i shouldve found more to do in town you show your mama some respect it would certainly be a shock to the system if she did the same for me she took her time wandering to the parlor stopped once to check her manicure another to smooth her hair in the hall mirror when she walked in her mother was sitting stiff as dry plaster i dont approve of you gossiping with the servants i wasnt i was gossiping with lilah dont take that tone with me lilah may be a valued member of this household but its inappropriate for you to sit in the kitchen and gossip is it appropriate for you to eavesdrop faith slumped into a chair im twentysix years old mama its a long time since it would do you a lick of good to lecture me on behavior it never did any good im told that you were with victoria bodeen yesterday that you were together and were responsible for contacting the police thats right its distressing enough that you have any connection with a situation as unseemly as this but its intolerable that you are now linked with that woman that woman being tory rather than the one who was raped and murdered faiths spine stiffened but she remained lazily slumped i will not have it i will not have you associating with victoria bodeen or faith waited a beat you see there arent any ors at this point in our lives mama i come and go when i please and with whom i always did but now you really have nothing to say about it i would think out of respect for your sister you would sever any connection however tenuous it is with the person i hold responsible for her death maybe its out of respect for my sister that ive made this connection you never could stand her faith said conversationally i took your lead there i suppose you would have forbidden hope to associate with her but you could never really bring yourself to forbid hope in anything and if you did she got around you she was infinitely more clever than i in that area dont speak of my daughter in that manner yes your daughter now the brittle tone reflected in her eyes something i never quite managed to be heres something you may never have considered tory isnt responsible for what happened to hope but she may very well be the key to it it might bring you comfort to remember hope as a bright light as a life cut off before it really lived it would bring me more comfort to finally know why and know who you wont find your comfort or your answers with that woman youll only find lies her whole life is a lie well then with a bright smile faith got to her feet just gives us one more thing in common doesnt it she walked away putting a swagger in her step margaret got immediately to her feet walked quickly out and into the library with its towers of books and ornately plastered ceiling she made the call first tugging on the strings of friendship to request that gerald purcell come to her as soon as possible assured he would make the trip within the hour she walked to the safe secreted behind an oil painting of beaux reves and took out two folders she would use the hour to study the paperwork and prepare shortly she ordered tea to be served on the south terrace along with scones and the frosted cakes she knew gerald had a weakness for she enjoyed the ritual in the afternoons when she was at home the china the silver the precisely cut wedges of lemon the mix of brown and white sugar cubes in the bowl as long as she was mistress of this house she thought it was a ritual that would be preserved beaux reves and all it stood for would be preserved it was warm for tea alfresco but the white umbrella offered shade and the gardens provided what margaret considered the appropriate backdrop the tree roses that flanked the brick in their giant white pots were heavy with bloom and her hibiscus added an exotic touch with their crimson trumpets she sat at the rippled glass table hands folded and looked out over what was hers she had worked for it nurtured it and now as always she would protect it she glanced over as gerald came through the terrace doors hed roast in the suit and tie she thought idly as she lifted a hand to his i appreciate your coming so quickly youll have some tea that would be lovely you sounded troubled margaret i am troubled but her hand was rock steady as she lifted the wedgwood teapot and poured it concerns my children and beaux reves itself you were jaspers attorney so you understand the disposition of the farm the properties the interests of this family as well as any of us better perhaps of course he sat beside her pleased that she remembered he preferred lemon to milk controlling interest in the farm was passed to kincade seventy percent that holds true for the factories the mill as well i hold twenty percent and faith ten thats correct the profits are divided and dispersed annually im aware of that the properties such as our interest in the apartment buildings the houses that are rented including the marsh house are in all three names equally is that also correct yes and in your opinion what impact would it have on cades changes to the farm his new operating system if i withdrew my support used my twenty percent and my influence with the board to sway them back toward more traditional methods it would cause him considerable difficulty margaret but his weight is heavier than yours and the profits add to his end of the scale the board has no say in the farm in any case just the mill and the factories she nodded and the mill the factories help keep the farm running if i were able to persuade faith to add her interest to mine that would give you more ammunition certainly he sipped his tea pondered might i ask as your friend and your lawyer if youre dissatisfied with cades performance at beaux reves i am dissatisfied with my son and i believe he needs to put his mind and energies back into his inheritance without having it diverted into less worthy channels simply she said as she buttered a scone i want victoria bodeen out of the marsh house out of progress at the moment faith is being difficult but she will come around shes always been a creature of the moment i believe i can persuade her to sell me her interest in the properties that would give me a twothirds control i would assume that the bodeen girl has a years lease on the house and on the building on market i want those leases broken margaret he patted her hand you would be wise to let this lay i will not tolerate her association with my son i will do whatever is necessary to end it i want you to draw up a new will for me cutting both cade and faith off he thought of the scandal the legal tangles the vicious amount of work margaret please dont be rash i wont implement the will unless i have no choice but i will use it to show faith just how serious i am margarets mouth thinned i have no doubt that when she realizes she stands to lose such a large sum of money she will become very cooperative i want my house back in order gerald it would be a great favor to me if you looked over those leases and found the simplest way to break them you risk turning your son against you better that than watching him drag down the family name i have not since childhood kept a diary or a journal or written down my secret thoughts it seems appropriate since my childhood is so on my mind to do so now and to do so here where hope lost her life her childhood my papa our papa made this place for her with its pretty statue and its sweetsmelling flowers it is more hers than the grave where he buried her on that steamy and sickskied summer morning i never shared this place with her i chose not to out of spite certainly but it gave me great satisfaction at the time what did i want with her silly games and her odd and unkempt friend i wanted them so desperately i refused to take them when they were offered i am a difficult person sometimes i like myself that way in any case it is my nature to be contrary so i of all people must live with it it might have been different for me for all of us if that night had never happened if when id woken in the morning hope had been in the next room i would still have been sulking over my disgrace the night before that had been a minor combat over peas which i despised then and despise now i would have sulked because i found some pleasure in that activity particularly when someone put in the effort to win me out of my pouts i enjoyed the attention most any kind of attention i could manage i knew even then that in the pecking order of siblings i came in a lowly third out of three cade was the heir apparent he after all possessed a penis and i did not this i suppose was no fault of his but i did indeed envy him that member for a short time in my youth until of course i learned that it was more than possible for a woman to possess as many of those interesting appendages as she liked and in such a pleasant variety of ways i discovered sex early and have enjoyed it without apology in any case at eight the sexual connotations of men and women were still a foggy area for me i only knew that cade was the masterintraining of beaux reves because he was a boy and this did not sit well with me he was afforded privileges i was denied again because of his gender and i suppose to be fair the fouryear difference in our ages my father looked on him with such pride certainly he demanded quite a bit from cade but the look in papas eyes the tone of his voice the very posture of his body was a study in pride father for son i could never be his son nor could i be as hope was his angel he adored her he had love for me and he was a fair man but it was painfully obvious that it was hope who held his heart even as cade held well his hopes i was a kind of bonus i imagine the twin who came in tow with his angel with my mother cade was also i think a source of pride she had produced the son as was expected of her the lavelle name would carry on because she had conceived and birthed a male she was happy enough to give the dealing with him over to my father for the most part what did she know of boys after all i wonder if cade felt this smooth and easy distance i imagine he did but somehow he became a whole and admirable man despite it because of it naturally mama schooled him in manners saw to his cleanliness but his education his time his lot in life were my fathers bailiwick i dont remember ever hearing her question papa about cade hope was her reward for a job well done the daughter she could polish and mold the child she would see from babyhood through to a proper marriage she loved hope for her sweetness and her quiet acquiescence and she never saw never the rebel inside had hope lived i believe she would have done precisely what she pleased and somehow have convinced mama it was mamas own idea she got around her with tory she could get around her with anything god i miss her i miss that half of me that was bright and fun and eager i miss her outrageously myself i was a trial to mama how often i have heard her say so therefore it must be true i had none of hopes sweetness nor her quiet acquiescence i questioned and i fought bitterly over things i didnt even care about notice me damn you all notice me how sad and pitiful hope became friends with tory a year before that summer they were simply drawn together as some souls are even i could see the recognition between them that click of connection and they were almost from the first inseparable more twins than my sister and i had ever been for that reason alone i disliked victoria bodeen intensely i turned my nose up at her and her dirty feet and poor grammar at her big watchful eyes and whitetrash parents but it was her closeness with hope that was at the root of it i made fun of her as often as i possibly could and ignored her the rest of the time pretended to ignore her in fact i watched her and hope with hawklike concentration looking for a fissure for some crack in their bond that i could pry wider so that their affection for each other shattered they played together on the day she died at our house as hope was strictly forbidden to go to torys she did so of course in secret but they spent most of their time together in and around beaux reves or in the swamp mama didnt know about the swamp she would not have approved but we all wandered there played there papa knew it and only asked that we not go in after dark before supper hope played jacks on the veranda i was punishing her by not playing with her when this didnt appear to spoil her pleasure in the game i went to my room to sulk and didnt come down until i was called to supper i wasnt hungry and i was still in a vile mood over hopes blithe acceptance of my anger with her i took it out on myself by making an issue of the peasвђthough i continue to contend i had a right thereвђthen ended up sassing my mother and being sent from the table i hated being sent from the table not that i cared overmuch about the food but it was banishment i imagine a therapist would say that this tactic proved to me that i was not a part of the family as my brother and sister were i was the outsider who on one hand reveled in my independence of them and on the other wanted desperately to be part of the picture i went to my room as if thats where i wanted to be in the first place i was determined they would think so and not suspect that i was as mortified as i was angry a small hill of peas was more important than i was i laid on the bed stared at the ceiling and surrounded myself with resentment one day i thought one day i would be free to do as i liked when i liked no one would stop me least of all the family who so easily dismissed me i would be rich and famous and beautiful i had no clear idea how i would accomplish these things but they were my goal i saw money and glory and beauty as a kind of prize i would win while the rest of them stayed steeped in the traditions and the restrictions of beaux reves i considered running away perhaps landing on my aunt rosies doorstep that i knew would hit my mother where she lived as she considered her sister rosie nothing more than an embarrassment somewhat like me but i didnt want to leave i wanted them to love me and that urgent and frustrated desire was my prison later on i heard my mothers music she would have been in her sitting room writing letters answering invitations planning the next days menus schedules and whatever else she did as mistress of the house my father would have been in his tower office seeing to the business of the farm and having a quiet glass of bourbon lilah snuck me in some supper minus the peas she didnt coax and cuddle but simply by that one small act stroked me bless her she has always been there steady as a rock and warm as toast i ate because shed brought it to me and because it was a rebellion both of us shared in secret after i lay there as the room grew dark i imagined mama brushing hopes hair as she did every night after bath time she would have brushed mine as well to be fair but i wouldnt sit still for it she would have gone up to papa after hope would to say good night and all the while she was doing what was expected of her she was planning her own secret rebellion i heard her walk down the hallway and pause at my room i wishвђit does no good to wish but i wish i had gotten up opened the door and browbeat her into coming in to keep me company it might have made a difference she would have felt sorry for me and she might have told me what she was going to do in my state of mind i might have gone along with her just to thumb my nose at mama she wouldnt have been alone but i stayed grimly stubborn in my bed and listened to her walk away i didnt know she left the house i might have looked out my window any time and seen her but i didnt instead i scowled into the dark until i slept and while i slept she died i didnt feel as its often said twins do a break in the thread between us i didnt experience a premonition or dream of disaster i didnt feel her pain or her fear i slept on as i expect most children do deeply and carelessly while the person who shared womb and birth with me died alone it was tory who felt that break that pain and fear i didnt believe it then didnt choose to hope was my sister not hers and how dare she claim to have been such an intimate part of what was mine i preferred to believe as many others did that tory had indeed been in the swamp that night and had run away and left hope to face terror i believed this even though i saw her the next morning she came limping down our lane early in the morning she walked like an old woman as if each step was an effort of courage it was cade who opened the door for her but i had tiptoed out to the top of the stairs her face was pale as death itself her eyes huge she said hopes in the swamp she couldnt get away and he hurt her you have to help i think he asked her in politely but she wouldnt come across the threshold so he left her there and as i raced back to my own room he went to look into hopes it all happened quickly then cade running back down calling for papa mama ran down everyone was talking at once and paid no mind to me mama took torys shoulder shook her shouted at her all the while tory just stood a rag doll well used to i supposed being kicked it was papa who pulled mama off who told her to call the police right away it was he who questioned tory in a voice that wasnt quite steady she told him of their plans the night before and how she hadnt gone because shed fallen and hurt herself but hope had gone and someone had come after her she said all this in a dull and calm voice an adults voice and she kept her eyes on papas face the whole time and told him she could take him to hope i learned later thats exactly what she did led papa and cade then the police who followed through the swamp to hope life was forever altered for all of us faith lowered the pad leaned back on the bench she could hear the twitter of birds now and smell the perfume of dark earth and ripe flowers slivers of sunlight shimmered through the tangled canopy of branches and moss to dapple on the ground in pretty patterns and turn the green light into something that just hinted of gold the marble statue stayed silent forever smiling forever young it was so like papa she thought to cover the hideous with the lovely a pretense perhaps but a statement as well hope had lived she imagined him thinking and she was mine had he brought his woman here she wondered had the woman hed turned to when hed turned from his family sat here with him while he reminisced and remembered and grieved why her instead of me why had it never been me faith set the notepad aside took out a cigarette the tears came as a complete surprise she had no idea they were in there burning to be shed shed for hope for her father for herself for the waste of lives and dreams for the waste of love tory stopped at the edge of a bank of impatiens the quiet flowerstrewn park was enough of a shock her mind slid the image of how it had been green and wild and dark over the one in front of her eyes they tangled refused to merge so she blinked the memory away there was hope trapped forever in stone and there was faith weeping her stomach muscles danced uneasily but she made herself walk forward shivering as images of what had happened there eighteen years before fought to take over she sat she waited i dont come here faith dug a tissue out of her purse blew her nose i suppose this is why i dont know if this is a horrible place or a beautiful one i can never make up my mind it takes courage to take something ugly and make it peaceful courage faith stuffed the tissue back in her purse then lighted her cigarette in one sharp motion you think this was brave i do braver than i could be your father was a good man he was always very kind to me even after she pressed her lips together even after he was nothing but kind to me it couldnt have been easy to be kind he deserted us emotionally the psychologists would say i expect he abandoned us for his dead daughter i dont know what to say to you neither of us has ever dealt with the loss of a child we cant know how we would cope with it or what we would do to survive that loss i lost a sister so did i tory said quietly i resent your saying that i resent more knowing its true do you expect me to blame you for that i dont know what i expect from you on a sigh she reached down for the cooler shed set beside the bench what i have here is a nice big jug of margaritas a good drink on a warm evening she poured the limegreen liquid into two plastic cups offered one i did say wed have a drink so you did to hope then faith touched her glass to torys it seems appropriate it has more bite than the lemonade wed usually drink here she liked her lemonade lilah would make it for her fresh plenty of pulp and sugar she had a bottle of coke that night gone warm in her adventure kit and she tory trailed off shivered again do you see it that clear still yes id appreciate it if you didnt ask me i didnt come here in all the weeks ive been back i havent come i havent had the courage for it as much as i dislike being a coward i have to survive too people put too much emphasis too many demands on courage and they all put their own standards on it anyway i wouldnt call you a coward but i do keep my personal standards low tory let out a half laugh drank again why well then i can meet them cant i without undo effort take my marriages though god knows i wish i hadnt she gestured grandly with her cup some would say id failed in them but i say i triumphed by getting out of them as unscathed as i did were you in love which time either both neither i was in heavy lust the first time around god almighty that boy could fuck like a rabbit as sex has been for some time a priority pleasure for me he certainly fulfilled that part of the bargain he was dangerously handsome full of charm and fast talk and a complete asshole she toasted him absently almost affectionately however he fit the bill of being exactly what my mother despised how could i not marry him you couldve just had sex i did but then marriage was a real slap in her face take this mama faith tipped her head back and laughed christ what an idiot now the second time it was more impulse well and there was that sex angle again it was still perfectly inappropriate as he was much too old for me and married when we began our affair i suppose that one was a little shot at my father you enjoyed adultery well so can i now an illicit affair is one thing but marriage to a philanderer is another i believe he was faithful enough for the first little while but my god i was bored and then i suppose he was just as bored and thought hed follow his song lyrics by cheating on me drinking himself blind he had made a bit of a mark in the music scene the first time he decided to take a swing at me i swung harder then i walked i got a nice chunk of money out of the divorce and earned every penny she and hope had sat here tory thought and talked about things theyd done wanted to do simpler things childhood things but no less vital no less intimate than what faith spoke of now why wade i dont know faith let out a breath sipped from her plastic glass thats the puzzle and the worry its not for gain or spite hes pretty to look at and we do have amazing sex but the town vet that was never in my plans now he has to complicate everything by being in love with me ill ruin his life she chugged the margarita poured a second im bound to that would be his problem struck faith turned her head and stared now that is the last thing i expected you to say hes a grown man who knows his own mind and his own heart it appears to me hes always done what he wanted and gotten what he wanted could be he knows you better than you think then again i dont understand men oh thats easy she topped off torys glass half the time they think with their dicks and the other half theyre thinking of their toys thats not very kind from a woman with a brother and a lover nothing unkind about it i love men some would say ive loved entirely too many there was a wicked gleam of humor in her eyes and no apology whatsoever tory found herself enjoying it envying it ive always preferred men for company faith added women are so much more sly than men and tend to view other women as rivals men look at other men as competitors which is entirely different you however are not sly its taken too much effort i realize to dislike and resent you and thats the basis for this moratorium you have a better one faith lifted a shoulder then picked up the notepad i had an urge to write some things down and i rarely ignore my urges why dont you read this all right faith pushed to her feet wandered with her drink and her smoke she imagined shed done more serious thinking that day than she had in a very long time honest and serious thinking she hadnt solved anything but she felt stronger for it wouldnt it be odd if torys coming back to progress had started her on the road to finding contentment in her own life she paused by the statue of her sister looked at the face they had once shared wouldnt it be she mused the ultimate irony if she found herself now just when she realized shed been looking all along she glanced back at toryвђso cool she thought so calm on the surface with all those violent ripples and jolts underneath it was admirable really the way tory maintained that shield and didnt turn brittle behind it spooky faith thought with a little smile but not brittle brittle she thought was what her own mother had become and brittle was what she herself had been on the edge of becoming how strange and somehow apt that it was tory whod given her just enough of a jolt to break her stride before shed rushed headlong into being what shed fought against all her life a warped mirror image of her own mother she crushed her cigarette out toed it under pine needles maybe i should take up writing faith said lightly as she strolled back you appear to be riveted shed been caught up sliding into the rhythm of faiths words and the images they had running through her mind shed been both amused and sad then the pressure had come the weight on her chest that caused her heart to beat too fast and hard the place shed thought the memories that pounded fists on the white wall of her defense she wouldnt answer them wouldnt heed them she would stay in the here and the now but the cold skinned over her and the dark crept toward the edges of her vision the notebook slipped from her ringers fell on the ground at her feet where a tiny breeze toyed with the pages she was going under being dragged under someones watching hmm honey youve only had two glasses of this stuff havent you thats a mighty cheap drunk someones watching she took faiths hand and her grip was like iron run you have to run oh shit out of her depth faith bent over tapped her hand on torys cheek come on back now get ahold of yourself hes watching in the trees hes waiting for you you have to run theres nobody here but us but a chill worked through her im faith im not hope faith tory struggled to keep the pictures clear to hold yesterday and today separate hes back in the trees i can feel him hes watching run alarm rushed into her eyes turning them big and bright she could hear it now just the faintest rustle from the brush beyond the clearing panic wanted to seize her the cold fingertips of it scraped her skin there are two of us goddamn it she hissed it out as she snatched up her purse and were not eight years old and helpless run my ass she pulled her pretty pearlhandled out of her bag and hauled tory to her feet oh my god you snap out of it faith ordered were going after him are you crazy now thats the pot calling the kettle вђњcome on out you limpdicked son of a bitch she heard the snap of a twig the swish of leaves and charged forward hes running bastard faith dont but she was already racing into the trees left with no choice tory rushed after her the path narrowed all but died out in a tangle of underbrush birds shot toward the sky like bullets screaming in protest moss dripped down caught in torys hair she batted at it as she sprinted to catch up to faith i think he went toward the river we might not catch him but well scare his sorry ass she pointed the gun toward the sky and pulled the trigger gunshots blasted echoed and seemed to vibrate through tory down to the toes birds exploded out of trees and rushed the clouds at the sound of splashing faith grinned like a lunatic maybe hell end up gator bait come on tory could smell the river the warm ripeness of it the ground went soggy under her feet had faith sliding like a skater for gods sake be careful youll shoot yourself i can handle a damn pissant gun like this but her breath was heaving as much from the flood of emotion as the run you know the swamp better than i do you take the lead put the safety on that thing i dont care to get shot in the back tory caught her own breath pushed the tangled hair out of her face we can cut this way toward the river save time watch for snakes god i knew there was a reason i hated this place the first rush of adrenaline was gone and in its place was an innate disgust for anything that crawled or skittered but tory was pushing ahead and pride left her no choice but to follow through what was it about this place that appealed to you and hope its beautiful and wild she heard footsteps heavy deliberate and threw up a hand someones coming from the river doubled back did he faith planted her feet lifted the gun im ready for him show yourself you son of a bitch ive got a gun and ill use it there was a thump as if something had fallen or been dropped christ jesus dont shoot you step out and you show yourself right now dont go taking potshots holy god miss faith is that you miss faith its just piney piney cobb he eased out from the trees with his back to the curve of the river where cypress knees speared the surface his hands shook as he held them high what the hell were you doing sneaking around in here watching us i wasnt swear to god didnt know you were hereabouts till i heard the shots scared me down to the skin didnt know whether to run or hide ive just been frogging thats all been frogging the last hour or so the boss he dont mind if i do some frogging in here then where are the frogs got the bag right over there dropped it when you called out you scared ten years off me miss faith tory saw nothing in his face but fear felt nothing from him but panic he smelled of sweat and whiskey lets see the bag okay all right its right back here licking his lips he pointed with one finger you be real careful how you step piney im awful nervous right now and my fingers liable to shake she kept the gun aimed while tory moved forward see here see been frogging with this old burlap sack tory crouched down looked inside perhaps half a dozen unhappy frogs looked back at her this is a pretty pitiful haul for an hours work lost most of em when i dropped the bag dropped it twice he added as a flush worked up his neck tell you true i damn near shit a brick when that gun went off thought i heard somebody running off thataway barely had time to wonder on it when the gunfire started i figured id best get myself out of harms way nice and quiet maybe somebodys target shooting like mr cade and his friends used to and i could catch a stray bullet if i wasnt careful i do some frogging every couple weeks you can ask mr cade if that aint so what do you think faith asked tory i dont know he has frogs such as they are he wasnt a young man she thought but he knew the swamp and his muscles were tough from fieldwork still nothing could be proved im sorry we frightened you but someone was sneaking around near the clearing wasnt me his eyes jumped from tory to the gun then back i heard somebody running like i said lotsa ways in and out of here she nodded stepped back piney cleared his throat reached down for the bag i guess ill go on then yeah you go on faith told him if i were you id make sure cade knows when you plan to do some frogging ill see to that for sure you bet your life im just gonna go on now he backed up watching faiths face until he could slide into the shadows of the trees for close on to thirtyfive years jr and carl d fished on sunday afternoons it hadnt started as a tradition and even now both men would have been annoyed and embarrassed to have called it one it was simply a way to relax and pass the time after jrs father died and his mother went to work it had been carl ds mother iris had paid to watch sarabeth after school and on saturdays and it had been an unspoken agreement between the women that she would run herd on jr as well fanny russ cooked like an angel and had a will of steel both were a matter of pride jr learned to call her maam in a quick hurry and during his growingup years in the fifties when the klan still burned their hate throughout the south in shapes of crosses and no coloreds were allowed to sit at the counter in the diner on market street the young white boy and young black boy quietly became friends neither made an issue out of it and sunday after sunday with a rare miss for holidays or illness both men sat side by side with rod and reel on the bank of the river just as they had as boys they each had less hair and more girth than theyd had when theyd started but the rhythm of the afternoon stayed essentially true for a time during jrs courtship and through the early months of his marriage to boots shed prepared fancy little lunches in a wicker basket for them it had taken jr some little doing to discourage this without hurting her feelings picnic baskets filled with chicken salad sandwiches and neatly sliced vegetables made it all too female all the men needed was a cooler of beer and a fistful of night crawlers and if they were lucky a couple of wedges of ma russs sweet potato or pecan pie all that had remained constant for years there were little changes by the river the old peach tree had died three winters before but it had sent out a half dozen volunteers that had grown like weeds until the town council had elected to nurture the best pair of them and cut down the rest now the fruit still underripe hung on the branches and waited for children to come along to devour those hard green orbs and give themselves bellyaches the water flowed slow and quiet as always with the grand old willow bent over it to dip its lacy green fronds and now and again if you were patient enough fish stirred themselves to bite if they didnt a man was no worse off than hed been when he dropped his line years had forged the men into solid citizens pillars of responsibility family men with mortgages and paperwork the few hours a week they spent drowning worms was a statement that each of them was still as much his own man as hed always been sometimes they argued politics and as jr was a staunch republican and carl d an equally hidebound democrat these debates tended toward the explosive and effusive both of them enjoyed the conflict enormously on other sundays and depending on the season it was sports a high school football game could keep them both entertained and passionate for two hours but more often than not as their lives intersected it was family friends and the town itself that dominated their meandering discussions as the water lapped the bank and the sun filtered through the trees what each knew was that he could depend on the other for a sounding board and that what was said between them by the river stayed by the river still there were times when loyalties had to blur knowing this carl d chose his words and approach carefully idamaes birthdays coming up here shortly carl d spoke of his wife while he popped the top on his second beer and studied the calm surface of the water that electric fry pan i bought her last years still somewhat of a sore point between us told ya jr took a fistful of the barbecue potato chips from the bag ripped open between them yeah yeah you buy a woman something that plugs in youre asking for grief she wanted a new one complained every time i turned around about how the old one had hot spots dont matter a woman doesnt want a kitchen appliance all wrapped up in a bow what she wants is something useless im having a hell of a time thinking whats useless enough to suit her thought i might go by your nieces place have her figure it for me cant go wrong there torys got a good sense of things done her shop up nice lot of work there shes always been a good worker serious girl with a good head on her shoulders hard to believe she came out of what she did it was the opening carl d had wanted and still he maneuvered carefully he got out a fresh stick of gum went through his little ritual of unwrapping and folding she had it hard growing up i remember her hardly having a word to say for herself just looking just watching things with those big eyes your brotherinlaw had a heavy hand i know it jrs mouth tightened i wish id known more back then dont know as it wouldve made much difference but i wish id known how it was you know now were looking for him jr on that business back in hartsville like to see you find him too give him some of what hes got coming my sister well her lifes gone to hell either way but putting him behind bars might give tory a better nights sleep im some relieved to hear you say so jr and the fact is i got worse than that going on here the kind of worse that might spill over on you some what are you talking about what happened to sherry bellows christ that was bad business bad business jr repeated with a solemn shake of his head city business not what we get here in town pretty young woman like that he trailed off his shoulders straightening stiffening as he turned his head to stare into carl ds face god almighty you dont think hannibal had part in that i shouldnt be talking to you about it fact is i spent most of the night worrying it over in my head officially i should keep this to myself but im not going to cant right now jr your brotherinlaw isnt just top of the list of suspects on this hes the only suspect jr pushed to his feet he paced along the edge of the river looked across its narrow curve it was quiet with just the absent chattering of a few busy birds he had to listen hard to catch even the murmur of traffic from town he had to want to hear it to make the connection between this solitary spot with its tall wet grass and lazy water and the lives and business of progress i cant get my mind around that carl d hannibal hes a bully and a bastard i cant think of one good thing to say about him but killing that girl for gods sake killing her no i cant get my mind around that hes got a history of roughing up women i know that i know it im not making excuses here but theres a wide road between rough handling and murder the road narrows after a while especially if theres cause what cause would he have had jr strode back crouched down until their eyes were level he didnt even know that girl met her in your nieces shop the day she was killed met her spoke with her and as far as he knew she and tory were the only ones knew he was around theres more he said when jr shook his head youre not going to like it im sorrier than i can say your familys brought into this but i got a duty and i cant let being sorry stop me i wouldnt ask you but i think youre looking in the wrong direction thats all he sat again i have to think that i cant say i wasnt glancing that way to start but it was tory who turned me straight onto him tory i took her back to the scene with me the scene jrs eyes went blank then filled with shock the murder scene jesus carl d jesus christ whyd you do that why would you put her through something like that i got a girl about the same age as my own ella who went through something a hell of a lot worse i got a duty to her jr and ill use whatever i can to see that through torys not part of this youre wrong shes hitched into it tight now you just listen a damn minute before you go kicking at me i took her back there and im sorry for how it was hard on her but id do it again she knew things she couldnt have known saw how it had been like shed been right there while it was going on ive heard about things like that wondered on them but never seen it before not something ill ever forget she ought to be left alone you had no business using her that way you didnt see that girl jr i hope to god you never see anything like what was done to her but if you did you wouldnt tell me i had no business using anything that put that right again its the second time ive seen that kind of thing done if wed paid attention to tory the first time it might not have happened again what the hell are you talking about weve never had a woman raped and murdered in progress no the first time it was a child he saw jrs eyes widen and the blood drain from his face the first time it wasnt in town but tory was there just like she was here now and when she tells me the same person killed sherry bellows who killed little hope lavelle im going to believe her the spit dried up in jrs mouth some vagrant killed hope lavelle thats what the report said thats what everyone wanted to believe thats what chief tate believed and i cant say he was wrong to but im not going to say the same and i cant believe the same anymore im not going to try to hang this one on some passerby thereve been others too tory knows about them the fbi knows about them and theyre coming here theyll go after him jr and theyre going to talk to tory to her mama to your sister and to you hannibal bodeen jr laid his head in his hands thisll kill sarabeth itll kill her he dropped his hands hell go back there thats where hell go holy god carl d hell go to sari andвђ ive talked to the sheriff up there hes got a man watching the place keeping an eye on your sister i got to go up there myself make her come back here i expect if it was my sister id do the same ill go along with you help smooth it out with the cops there i can handle it i reckon you can carl d nodded as he began packing up he heard the anger the resentment hed expected both just as he expected what hed done and what he would do was bound to do some damage to a lifelong friendship there was nothing to do but wait and see how much could be mended again i reckon you can jr he said again but im going just the same i need to talk to your sister and id like to do it before the federal boys get here and snatch the whole goddamn business away from me are you going as a cop or as a friend of mine im both been your friend a lot longer but im both he shouldered his rod and met jrs eyes plan to keep being both if its all the same to you well take my car make better time it was a struggle but jr bit back words he knew would hang ugly between them he managed a thin humorless smile well make better yet if you put on the siren and drive like a man instead of an old lady relief eased some of the weight from carl ds heart i might could do that part of the way cade was working hard to control his own temper to watch his own words every time he thought about what a foolish reckless risk his sister and tory had taken the evening before fury stormed inside him lectures threats recriminations would have released some of his tension and would have gotten him nowhere he wasnt a man who indulged himself in idle directions he knew exactly where he wanted to go and simply had to choose the best route for getting there speed wasnt a priority so he bided his time he hadnt indulged in a lazy sunday morning for quite a while the best way to begin one in his opinion was to keep tory in bed as long as possible that was a simple matter of pinning her down and nibbling however wherever he liked until she got into the spirit of the thing and had the added benefit of smoothing out some of his own raw edges he fixed breakfast because he was hungry and hed come to the conclusion tory considered the morning meal well met if she had a second cup of coffee he steered conversation into casual lines books movies art they were fortunate to share tastes it wasnt something cade deemed essential but rather a nice comfortable bonus he imagined she didnt think he noticed how often her eyes skimmed over to a window and searched there was nothing he didnt notice the nervous hands she tried to keep busy the way she would stop go still as if straining to hear some change in the rhythm of sound outside the way she jumped when he let the screen door bang when he came out to join her as she tended her flowers how many times in his life had he come across his mother working in her garden he wondered he was just as unable to judge the direction of her thoughts as she weeded and plucked how tidy he mused how precise both women were about the chore kneeling wearing hat and gloves as they worked the bed filling a basket with ruthlessly pulled weeds and spent blossoms and how furious both would be if he voiced the comparison throughout the morning torys voice her face stayed utterly calm and that alone infuriated him she wouldnt share her nerves with him still kept part of herself closed off and separate his mother he thought again as he loitered on the porch and studied torys bent head had kept part of herself closed off and separate he could do nothing had never been able to do anything to reach his mother he would damn well reach tory come on take a ride with me a ride he pulled her to her feet ive got some things i need to see to come along with me her first reaction was quiet relief she would be alone she could lie down shut her eyes and try to sort through the turmoil swirling inside her head a few hours of solitude to shore up the wall and chase away the shakes i have a dozen things to do too you just go ahead its sunday im aware of the day of the week and tomorrow oddly enough is monday im expecting some new shipments including one from lavelle cotton i have paperworkвђ which can wait till monday he stripped off her garden gloves as he spoke theres something i want to show you cade im not fit to go anywhere i dont have my purse you wont need it he said as he pulled her to the car thats a statement only a man could make she snarled as he all but dumped her in the car well let me go brush my hair at least he plucked off her hat tossed it in the backseat it looks fine he slid behind the wheel before she could make another excuse gets a little windblown itll just be sexier he picked up his sunglasses from the dash put them on then shoved the car in reverse and yeah thats another statement only a man could make he turned onto the road punched the gas you look pretty when youre annoyed then i must be gorgeous right now that you are darling but then i like the look of you no matter what your mood thats handy isnt it how long have we known each other tory she held her hair back with one hand altogether about twenty years i suppose no weve known each other about two and a half months before that we knew of each other we walked around the edges of each other maybe we occasionally thought about or wondered about each other but for round about two months weve known each other do you want to know what ive learned about you in that space of time she couldnt quite judge this mood his tone was light his face relaxed but there was something im not sure i do thats one of the things ive learned right there victoria bodeens a cautious woman she rarely leaps before she looks and then shell do a comprehensive study she doesnt trust easily not even herself if you leap before you look you lower your chances of landing on the other side in one piece theres another thing logic a cautious and logical woman now that might seem like a fairly ordinary even uninteresting combination to some people but those wouldnt have taken the entire package into account they wouldnt have added in the determination the brain the wit or the kindness most of all they would have missed the warmth thats all the more precious for being so rarely shared and all of this is wrapped sometimes too tightly in a very appealing package he turned onto a narrow dirt road slowed thats quite an analysis it barely scratches the surface youre a complex and fascinating woman complicated and difficult demanding simply because you refuse to demand hard on a mans ego because you never ask for a damn thing she said nothing but her hands had linked together a sure sign of tension shed heard the anger now just the rougher edge of it in his voice well walk from here he stopped the car and climbed out on either side the fields spread with row after row of cotton marching like soldiers she could smell earth and manure and heat all ripe and sweet and strong they must have cultivated recently she mused turned the weeds into the earth puzzled unsure what needed to be done here or why they had come she followed him down the rows while the young plants brushed her legs and reminded her of childhood we havent had a lot of rain cade said enough but not a lot we dont need as much irrigation as the other farms the soil holds more water when it isnt full of chemicals treat it like a natural thing and it thrives like one insist on changing it force it to live up to your expectations and it needs more and more just to get by couple of months the ballsll open he crouched down removing his sunglasses and hooking them on his shirt before he lifted a tightly closed boll with a fingertip my father wouldve used a regulator to slow the growth a defoliant to kill the leaves thats what he knew thats how it was done you do things different people dont like it much you have to prove yourself to them you have to want to he straightened met her eyes how much do i have to prove to you tory i dont know what you mean the way i figure most people treated you a certain way thats what you knew thats how it was done id say ive done things different youre angry with me oh yeah im angry with you well get to that but right now im asking what you want from me just exactly what you want i dont want anything cade goddamn it thats the wrong answer when he strode away she hurried after him why is it wrong why should i have to want things from you or want you to be something do something when ive been happier with you just as you are than ive ever been he stopped turned back to her the sun beat mercilessly down on the fields he felt the heat roll over him roll inside him thats a first you telling me i make you happy but ill tell you whats wrong with it i want things from you and its not going to work between us if its all onesided neither one of us is going to stay happy for long that way the ache punched into her stomach and up toward her heart you want to end it i dontвђ her breath caught breaking her voice tears swam into her eyes burned there you cantвђ fumbling for words she backed away im sorry you should be for thinking that he didnt fuss with her tears but narrowed his own eyes calculated i told you i loved you do you think i can just switch that off because youre a lot of work i brought you here to show you i finish what i start that what belongs to me gets everything ive got you belong to me he gripped her arms brought her up to her toes im getting tired of waiting for you to figure that out i care for whats mine tory but i expect something back i told you i love you give me something back im afraid of what i feel for you can you understand i might if you tell me what you feel for me too much she shut her eyes so much i cant imagine my life without you in it i dont want to need you and of course its easy for everyone else to need for me to need you he gave her a little shake that had her eyes snapping open i love you victoria and its given me some very bad moments he pressed his lips to her brow i wouldnt change it even if i could i want to be calm about it she laid her cheek against his chest smiling a little when he pulled the sunglasses free and tossed them on the ground i just want to be normal about it why would you think its normal to be calm about love i dont feel calm he stroked a hand down her hair do you love me tory she tightened her grip anchoring herself yes i thinkвђ just yes he tugged her hair until her face lifted lets leave it at yes he murmured and covered her mouth with his say it a few times so we both get used to it do you love me yes she let out a shaky breath wrapped her arms around his neck better already do you love me tory this time she laughed yes nearly perfect he rubbed his lips over hers felt hers soften will you marry me tory yes her eyes fluttered open she jerked back what ill take the first response he swung her off her feet kept her mouth busy with his until she was breathless and dizzy no put me down let me think sorry im afraid you leaped before you looked now you have to live with it you know very well that was a trick a maneuver he corrected as he carried her back toward the car and a damn good one if i do say so myself cade marriage is nothing to joke about and its something i havent begun to think of youll have to think fast then if you want a big wedding we can wait till fall after harvest he dropped her into the car but if youd like small and intimate my preference next weekend suits me stop it just stop i havent agreed to marriage yes you did he hopped in beside her you can backtrack bluster circle around but the fact is i love you you love me marriage is where were heading thats the kind of people we are tory i want a life with you i want a family with you family the thought of it ran cold in her blood dont you see thats why oh god cade he took her face in his hands our family tory the one well make together will be ours you know nothings that simple theres nothing simple about it right doesnt always mean simple this isnt the time cade theres too much happening around us thats why its the perfect time well talk rationally about this she told him when he drove down the dirt road when my heads not spinning fine well talk all you want when the work road split he took the left fork instantly tory shot up in the seat her stomach pitching where are you going beaux reves theres something i need to get im not going there i cant go there of course you can he laid a hand on hers its a house tory just a house and its mine her chest hurt and her palms went damp im not ready and your mother wont like it its your mothers home cade its my home he corrected coolly and itll be our home my mother will have to deal with that and so he thought would tory it was tory thought the most wonderful house not grand and elegant like the lovely old homes in charleston with their fluidity and feminine grace but vibrant and unique and powerful as a child shed thought of it as a castle a place of dreams and beauty and great strength on the few occasions she had dared to step inside she had gawked and spoken in whispers like a pagan entering a cathedral she had gone in rarely too shy and afraid to risk the tightlipped disapproval of margaret lavelle and as yet too young to protect herself against the sharp arrows of margarets thoughts but she had seen and smelled and touched every room through hope she knew the view out of each window the feel of the tile and wood floors under her feet she smelled the scent that hung in the tower office the mix of leather and bourbon and tobacco that meant man papa she couldnt allow herself to see it through hopes eyes now to be drawn to it into it that way she had to see it through her own through the now it was as stunning as it had been the first time shed seen it she realized stunning and proud against the sky with towers defiantly rising beaux reves yes it was exactly that beautiful dreams with flowers spread at its feet like an offering and grand old trees guarding its flanks for a few precious moments tory forgot that the last time shed seen it shed limped up the lane with horror in her eyes and death in her heart it doesnt change she murmured hmm no matter what goes on around it even inside it it stays theres wonder in that it meant something to him to hear the pleasure in her voice when she spoke of his home my ancestors had ego and humor both are strong traits for building he stopped the car turned off the engine come inside victoria her smile one she hadnt known curved her lips vanished youre asking for trouble he got out of the car walked around to her door opened it im asking the woman i love into my home he took her hand and drew her out she was reminded that however genteel he might be he was equally stubborn if theres trouble well deal with it its easier for you you stand on a foundation like the house ive always teetered on boggy ground so i have to watch my step she looked up at him is it so important to you that i take this one yes it is well remember that if i end up sinking they walked up the steps onto the veranda she remembered sitting there with hope playing jacks or studying one of their pirate maps long tall glasses of lemonade beaded with damp frosted cookies the scents of roses and lavender the image of it slipped in and out of her mind two young girls arms and legs browned from the sun their heads bent close whispering secrets though there was no one to hear adventure tory said quietly that was our password we were going to have so many adventures now we will he lifted her hand to kiss it shed like that wouldnt she yes i suppose she would though she didnt care much for boys tory managed a smile as he opened the door youre so tedious and silly her heart beat too fast and the grand foyer with its lovely green tiles stretched in front of her like a pit cade trust me he said and drew her inside the air was cool it was always cool and fresh and fragrant she remembered the magic of that of how sharply it contrasted with the stuffy heat of her house how the smells of last nights dinner never smeared the air here and she remembered standing there with cade before nearly there you were tall for a boy she fought to keep her voice steady it seemed to me you were tall and so pretty the prince of the castle you still are so little has changed here tradition is a religion to the lavelles were schooled in it from birth its both comfort and trap come into the parlor ill get you something cool to drink she wasnt allowed in the parlor nearly said so before she caught herself she could sit in the kitchen if she went in the back lilah would give her iced tea or cocacola a cookie or some small treat and if she helped with the sweeping a quarter to tuck in her mason jar under the bed but she wasnt allowed in the family rooms with an effort she blocked out the old images that wanted to intrude and concentrated on the now the early lilies were in bloom and there was a vase bright with them on a gorgeous table spread beneath the curve of the stairs the scent of them was utterly female beside them were tall white tapers in bold blue stands no one had lighted them so they stood pure untouched and perfect like a photograph she thought every piece every placement absolute as if it had remained just exactly so for decades and now she was walking into the picture even as she stepped toward the doorway margaret appeared at the top of the sweep of stairs kincade her voice was sharp stinging her hand wanted to tremble as it held the banister but she wouldnt permit it head lifted she came halfway down i would like to speak with you of course he knew the tone the stance and didnt bother to mask his response with a polite smile im about to show tory into the parlor why dont you join us i prefer to speak with you privately please come upstairs she started to turn assured he would follow im afraid thatll have to wait he said pleasantly i have a guest she jerked to a halt her head whipping around just as cade led tory into the parlor cade dont do this already the tension the stabs of animosity were pricking her theres no point theres an essential point what would you like im sure lilah has iced tea in the kitchen or theres sparkling water behind the bar i dont need anything dont use me as a weapon its not fair darling he bent down to kiss her forehead im not how dare you margaret stood in the doorway her face pale and set her eyes swirling with temper how dare you defy me in this way and with this woman i made my wishes perfectly dear i will not have her in this house perhaps i didnt make my wishes perfectly clear cade shifted laid his hand on torys shoulder tory is with me and welcome here and i expect anyone i bring into my home to be treated with courtesy since you insist on having this conversation with her present i see no reason to bother with a pretense of courtesy or manners the picture changed again as margaret entered the stage tory thought was perfectly dressed only the characters revolved you are free to sleep with whomever you choose i cant stop you from spending your time with that woman or generating gossip about yourself and this family but you will not bring your slut under my roof be careful mother cades voice had gone soft dangerously soft youre speaking about the woman im going to marry as if hed struck her margaret took a staggering step back color flooded her face now staining her cheeks have you lost your mind where are my lines tory wondered surely i must have some in this odd little play why cant i remember them im not asking you to approve while i regret this upsets you youll have to adjust cade tory found her voice already rusty with disuse im sure your mother would prefer to speak to you in private dont put words in my mouth margaret snapped at her i see i might have waited too long if you persist on this path with this woman you risk beaux reves ill use my influence to persuade the board of lavelle cotton to remove you as chairman you can try he said equably you wont succeed ill fight you every step of the way and i have the advantage and even if you could undermine my position at the plant which i doubt youll never touch the farm this is your gratitude its her doing margarets heels clicked on the hardwood as she rushed forward cade merely stepped to the side putting himself between tory and his mother no its my doing deal with me oh good a party with bee racing at her heels faith strolled in her eyes were bright with anticipation her smile wicked hello tory dont you look pretty how about some wine thats an excellent idea faith pour tory some wine deal with me he repeated to margaret youre disgracing your family and your sisters memory no but you are its a disgrace to blame one child for the death of another a disgrace to treat a blameless woman with such contempt and viciousness out of your own guilt and grief im sorry you could never see beyond them to the children you had left to the life you might have made outside of that bubble you surrounded yourself with you would speak to me this way ive tried every other way if you did what you had to do for yourself i wont blame you for it if you continue to live as you have these last eighteen years its your choice but faith and i have lives of our own and mine is going to be with tory well congratulations faith lifted the glass of wine shed just poured then drank it herself i suppose this should be champagne tory let me be the first to welcome you into our happy family be quiet margaret hissed and got no more than a shrug from her daughter do you think i dont know why youre doing this she said to cade to spite me to punish me for some imagined wrongs im your mother and as such ive done my best by you since the day you were born i know that depressing isnt it faith murmured cade merely glanced at her shook his head ive nothing to spite or to punish you for im not doing this to you mama im doing it for me ive had a miracle in my life tory came back into it he took her hand again found it icy drew her up beside him and i found out im capable of more than i imagined im capable of loving someone and of wanting to do my best by her im getting the best of the bargain here she doesnt think so wont even after this but i know it and i intend to treasure it by tomorrow judge purcell will have my new will drawn up i will cut you both off without a penny she aimed her furious gaze at faith not a cent do you understand unless you stand with me now you have no personal stake in this woman she said to faith i will see to it that you receive your share and cades beginning with the fair market value of your interest in the marsh house and the market street property faith contemplated her wine hmmm now what would that fair market value be in the vicinity of a hundred thousand cade told her i cant speak for what my share of our mothers estate might be but i would assume it edges quite a bit closer to seven figures oooh faith pursed her lips imagine that so all that will be mine if i just toss cade to the wolves so to speak and do what you want me to do she waited a beat now when i wonder have i ever done what you wanted mama you would be wise to think this through second question when have i ever been wise do you want wine cade or would you rather a beer i will not make this offer a second time margaret said coldly if you insist on going through with this farce i will leave this house and you and i will have nothing more to say to each other ill be sorry for that cades voice remained calm i hope youll change your mind given time you would choose her over your own family your own blood without a minutes hesitation im sorry youve never felt that way about anyone if you had you wouldnt question it shell ruin you gathering herself margaret looked at tory you think you were clever to hold out you believe youve won but youre wrong in the end hell see you for what you are and youll have nothing the words were there just there making her understand shed only been waiting to say them he sees me for what i am thats my miracle mrs lavelle please dont make him choose between us dont make all of us live with that i had another child who chose you and she paid a high price for it now youll take a second ill make arrangements to leave immediately she said to cade have the decency to keep her away from me until theyre complete well well faith poured a second glass as her mother walked away that was pleasant faith oh dont give me that look she said brushing cade off i dont imagine either of you were particularly entertained but i was enormously god knows she had it coming here she pushed the wine into torys hand you look like you could use this go talk to her cade you cant leave it like this if he tries ill lose all this new respect and admiration i have for him rising to her toes faith kissed his cheek looks like she didnt ruin both of us after all he took her hand held it thank you oh darling it was my pleasure holding her glass aloft she dropped into a chair grinning when bee leaped into her lap i for one plan to celebrate what cades announcement that he intends to marry me or your mothers unhappiness faith tilted her head as she studied tory i can do both but apparently you cant you have too much sensibility and kindness oh shed hate that one more thing to celebrate she decided and sipped her wine thats unattractive faith cade murmured oh let me crow for a minute will you not everyones as highminded as the two of you good lord you really suit each other whod have thought it im happy for you imagine that im sincerely happy for you i believe i feel a little mushy inside try to control this embarrassing display of sentiment impatient with her cade turned to tory ran his hands up her arms down again to her wrists i need to get something out of my office then well go will you be all right cade talk to your mother no he kissed her lightly i wont be long drink your wine faith suggested when they were alone itll put some color back in your cheeks i dont want any wine tory set the glass aside then walked to the window she wanted to be outside again where she could breathe if you insist on looking unhappy youll only spoil this for cade he did this because he loves you and why did you interesting question a year ago oh hell likely a month ago i might have taken her up on it thats a powerful chunk of money and i do like what money can buy no you wouldnt have done it not ever and ill tell you why tory glanced back first it would have been to throw it back in her face but second and more than the first it would have been for cade because you love him yes i do and love doesnt come easy to either of us my mother saw to that will you blame her for everything no just what shes entitled to i screwed up my life plenty all on my own but he didnt he never did damage to himself or anyone else i love him tremendously surprised tory glanced over faiths eyes were still bright but there were tears in them he didnt say what he did to her to hurt her but because it was truth i would have said it to hurt her feel sorry for her if you must but dont expect it of me he has a chance with you and i want to see him take it why didnt you tell him that im telling you i see what he feels for you and i wish i could feel it for someone not to make myself a better person i like myself the way i am still if someone matters that much contemplatively she studied the wine in her glass the light that shined through it from the window if someone matters that much its bound to take something out of you she shifted her gaze to tory isnt it yes but im beginning to think its something you dont need anymore not if someone loves you back interesting thats a nut to chew on she looked over as cade came in i suppose you want to be alone now yes then bee and i will just take ourselves off wont we she nuzzled the dog then nudged her onto the floor in fact i think well go out and stay out until the air clears she touched cades cheek as she walked by id suggest you do the same not quite yet he waited until he heard the door close behind his sister then held out a hand for tory i want to do this here we can consider it closing a circle cade that was difficult for you for all of you iвђ no it wasnt and its done you and i were just beginning he took a box from his pocket opened it the diamond caught the sunlight exploded with it this was my grandmothers and it came to me panic choked her dont she tugged at her hand but he held her fingers firm in his it came to me he repeated with the hope that one day id give it to the woman i wanted to marry i didnt give it to deborah it never occurred to me to give it to her i suppose i knew i was keeping it for someone else that i was waiting for someone else look at me tory its all so fast you should take more time twenty years or two months times never been the point for us if you cant believe and trust what i say if it isnt enough to steady you look at what i feel he lifted her hand to his heart look in me tory she couldnt refuse or resist and the heat of it slid into her warmth and strength and hope his heart beat steady under her palm his eyes never wavered from hers trust she thought he was trusting her with all that he was the next step was hers i wish you could look in me because i dont know how to tell you what i feel scared because theres so much of it i never wanted to be in love with anyone again but i didnt know it could be different i didnt know it could be you youre so steady cade smiling now she lifted a hand to toy with his hair you steady me marry me oh god she took a deep breath had to take a second yes she looked down as he slipped the ring on her finger its beautiful i get dizzy looking at it its a little big he ran a thumb around the gold band you have delicate hands well have it sized not right away i want to get used to it first she closed her hand into a fist then let out a sigh she loved him her eyes swam as she lifted them again your grandmother she loved him her name was laura and she was happy so will we be he promised she let herself believe him carl d kept the siren on and the speedometer at eighty straight up it wasnt called for of course but it did give him a nice little kick and god knew it entertained jr he shut it down as they approached their turnoff maybe we oughta be doing this on sundays instead of fishing gets the blood moving jr agreed hard to feel like an old fart when youre highballing down the road who you calling an old fart tell you what ill do jr if you think itll make it smoother for you ill drop you off at your sisters place then ill go on and check in with sheriff give you time to talk to her and for her to get her things together i appreciate that jrs mood plummeted but he did his best to bolster it shes not going to want to budge so itll take a little doing i figure ill tell her were pretty sure hans still around progress so shell be closer to him if she comes on along with me it may just be the truth and that being the case im going to put extra patrols on your street i want you to start using that fancy alarm system boots talked you into a couple years back been using it since you found the bellows girl boots says she doesnt get a minutes rest unless we got it on he thought of his town the streets he could walk with his eyes shut the people he knew by name and all who knew him thats not the way its supposed to be no but sometimes thats the way it is you and me jr we grew up one way weve seen the changes come into progress and most of thems good we bend to them maybe lose a little something when they plant houses in a field where we used to play ball or put up another jiffy mart and talk about goddamn strip malls outside of town but we bend some changes you have to meet another way altogether jr smiled a little what the hell does that mean damned if i know this the turn for her place yeah roads rough youre going to want to mind your oil pan im ashamed for you to see how shes living carl d put that aside weve been friends too long for that kind of shit the cruiser bumped scraped wincing carl d slowed to a crawl then peering ahead his eyes narrowed what the hells this goddamn it theres trouble goddamn it he repeated and hit the gas so they took the rest of the rutted road in wild bumps two cruisers sat nosetonose outside the house yellow police tape was stretched around the scruffy yard even as he hit the brakes the uniform standing on the sagging porch stepped down chief russ outta progress he fumbled out his id held it up for the uniform to scan what happened here we had an incident chief russ the officers face was pale and coldly set his eyes concealed behind dark glasses ill have to ask you to stay here the sheriffs inside hell need to clear you this is my sisters place jr snatched at the cops sleeve my sister lives here wheres my sister youll have to speak with the sheriff please stay behind the line he ordered and strode into the house somethings happened to sarabeth i have toвђ hold on carl d grabbed his arm before jr could rush forward just hold on nothing you can do lets just hold on hed already spotted the dark stain on the dirt outside the chicken coop and a second smearing near the overgrown grass sheriff bridger was a hefty man with a face seamed by years and weather his eyes were faded blue and set in by lines that looked burned into the skin by the sun he scanned the area as he stepped out took a moment to wipe beads of sweat from his brow then walked toward the waiting men chief russ thats right sheriff i brought mr mooney here up to fetch his sister sarabeth bodeen what happened here bridger shifted his pale eyes to jr you brother to sarabeth bodeen yes wheres my sister im sorry to tell you mr mooney we had trouble here sometime early this morning your sisters dead dead what are you talking about that cant be i talked to her not two days

frame had started to shake you mind having somebody bring him some water sheriff with a nod bridger turned to signal the uniform purty bring mr mooney here a glass of water you sit here now carl ds knees popped like firecrackers when he crouched down just sit here and catch your breath let me do what i can do i just talked to her jr repeated friday evening i talked to her i know it just you sit here until i get back he stepped away from the car moving until he was out of jrs hearing can you tell me what happened here weve been putting it together last few hours flint he caught the twototen shift we didnt know there was trouble until his relief showed up and found him over there bridger gestured toward the coop theyd taken his man off to the morgue zipped into a black bag he was not going to forget it he caught a round in the back took him down he was young strong he tried getting back to his unit here crawled over fifteen feet with that round in him had his weapon out had his weapon in his hand somebody put a gun in his ear and pulled the trigger he was thirtythree years old chief russ got a tenyearold boy and an eightyearold girl at home i take responsibility theyre without a father now i sent him out here we knew bodeen was dangerous but we didnt know he was armed never used a firearm in any of his other doings the motherfucker shot my man in the back carl d wiped the back of his hand over his mouth and miz bodeen sarabeth sari mooney whod sat on his mas front porch ate at her table my guess is she knew he was coming had a suitcase packed theres an empty coffee can in the bedroom and looks to me like she mightve kept her house cash in it gone now door was open unforced she let him in or he walked in he shot her twice once in the chest once in the back of the head carl d shoved the sorrow aside eyed the situation of the house the land guess youve done a canvas yeah talked to the neighbors finally got somebody to say they heard what maybe was gunshots about five fivethirty this morning people mind their own around here nobody paid any attention to it the heat was merciless carl d dragged out a handkerchief and rubbed it over his face as sweat soaked through his fishing shirt how the helld he get here cant say hitched a ride maybe stole a car were looking into it for the money in a coffee can dont sit right she had a suitcase packed thats right her clothes in it and some of his she knew he was coming were checking the phone records gotta figure he called her and she gave him the lay of the land she wasnt what youd call cooperative with the police round these parts and he blamed her though she was dead as eve for the murder of his man mr mooney going to be up to doing a nextofkin id on her yeah carl d rubbed his mouth again hell do it you inform the deceaseds mother yet no i was going to handle that back at the office id appreciate it if youd let me do that sheriff bridger not wanting to step on your ground here but she knows me youre welcome to that part of the job it aint one i relish fine then ill take jr on by his mamas itll be easier for them that way all right hes a cop killer now chief russ if it gives your friend there any comfort you let him know that bastard wont be able to run far enough or fast enough you keep me uptodate sheriff and ill do the same i got the federals coming tomorrow or the day after theyll want to pay you a call welcome to but this is my turf and that was my man they carried away in a bag this morning bridger spat on the ground bodeen better pray to his almighty god the feds get to him before i do miles away hannibal bodeen tore into a pork chop hed gotten it along with bread and cheese and a bottle of jim beam from a house hed broken into it had been simple enough with the family gone off to church hed watched them stroll out of the house in their fancy sunday clothes and pile into a shiny minivan hypocrites going to church to show off their material goods into the house of the lord to flaunt themselves god would punish them just like he punished all the proud and pompous and god had provided he thought as he gnawed the pork bone clean hed found plenty of food in that big house meat wrapped up from last nights dinner enough to restore his body and drink to sustain him in his hour of need this was his trial his test this wandering in the wilderness he tossed the bone aside and took a long drink from the bottle for a time hed despaired why was he being punished a righteous man then it all came clear he was to be tested he was to prove his worthiness god had shouldered him with temptation time and time again there had been times hed been weak times hed succumbed but now he was given this chance satan had lived in his house under his roof for eighteen years he had done his best to drive the devil out but he had failed he would not fail again he lifted the bottle let the heat of the whiskey strengthen him soon very soon he would complete the task that had been given him he would rest he would pray then the way would be shown to him he closed his eyes and curled up to sleep the lord provided he thought and laid his hand over the gun tucked beside him tory watched chief russs car drive slowly down her lane make the turn onto the road to progress she sat where she had since her uncle had told her about her mother where shed lowered herself inch by inch into the old rocker on the front porch it was her stillness that worried cade her stillness and her silence tory come on inside and lie down awhile i dont want to lie down im all right i wish i werent so all right i wish i felt more than i do theres a blankness inside me where there should be grief im trying to write something on it and i cant what am i that i cant feel grief for my own mother dont push yourself i felt more grief and pity for sherry bellows a woman i met once i felt more shock and horror for a stranger than i do for my own blood i looked in my uncles eyes and i could see the pain there the sadness but its not in me ive got no tears for her maybe youve shed enough of them already somethings missing inside me no its not he came around now knelt in front of her she stopped being part of your life its easier to mourn a stranger than it is someone who should have been part of you and wasnt my mother is dead they believe my father killed her and the question in my mind most prominently in my mind at this moment is why do you want to take on someone who comes from that you know the answer and if love isnt enough well add sense you arent your parents any more than im mine the life well begin and build together is ours i should walk away from you thats sensible and i suppose loving too but i wont i need you i want so much what we might have together so i wont do the courageous thing and walk away darling you wouldnt get two feet she let out her breath in a shaky laugh maybe i know it cade it was so easy to touch him to brush her fingertips over the gilt edges of his hair would we have come together do you think if hope had lived if nothing that happened had happened and wed just grown up here like normal people yes sometimes your confidence is a comfort she walked to the end of the porch to look at the trees that tucked the marsh into shadows this is the second time since ive come home someone has died the second time i thought it would be me he came for hell come yet he wont get near you yes she thought his confidence could be a comfort hell have to come hell have to try she steadied herself turned back can you get me a gun toryвђ dont say youll protect me or that the police will find him stop him i believe all those things as far as they go but he will come back for me cade i know it as truly as i know anything i must be able to defend myself if i have to and i will defend myself i wont hesitate to take his life to save my own i might have once but i have too much at stake now i have you now there was a sick dread in his stomach but he nodded saying nothing he walked to his car opened the glove compartment hed started carrying the revolver with him since sherry bellows murder he brought it back to tory this is a revolver a thirtyeight its smaller than i imagined it was my fathers cade turned the old smith wesson over in his hand what you call a hideout gun i suppose because its compact do you know how to fire it she pressed her lips together it looked sinister and efficient in cades hand the elegant farmers hand pull the trigger well theres a little more to it than that are you sure about this tory yes she let out a breath yes im sure come on then well go out in the yard and ill give you a lesson faith sang in a voice surprisingly light and sweet as she carried groceries up the stairs into wades apartment bee scrambled after her sniffing the air that held memories of countless dogs cats and pet rodents delighted with herself faith shifted bags managed the knob and bumped the door open with her hip on a ragged pad in the living room mongo was lying with his head on his paws his tail thumped and his head lifted as faith walked in why hello there youre looking lots better you big old thing bee mongos recuperating dont chew on his ears hell swallow you in one bite but bee was already sniffing nibbling and nudging well i guess the two of you better get acquainted wheres the doctor she found him in the kitchen staring into a cup of coffee there he is now she dumped her bags on the counter then turned to wrap her arms around his neck from behind and kiss the top of his head ive got a big surprise for you doc wade youre going to get yourself a homecooked supper and if you play your cards right a romantic interlude will follow dessert there was a machinegun burst of barking from the living room that sent her scurrying out now isnt that the cutest thing wade you ought to come out and see this theyre playing together well this big dog heres pretty much squashing bee with one paw but theyre having such a time she was still laughing when she came back then stopped when she saw wades face honey whats the matter did something go wrong with the horse out at the hill place last night no no the mares fine my auntвђmy fathers sisterвђshes dead she was murdered early this morning oh my god oh wade thats awful what is going on around here she sat down across from him wishing she knew what to do your daddys sister torys mama yes i havent seen her in christ i dont even remember the last time i cant even get a picture of her face in my head thats all right now its not all right my familys ripping itself apart for gods sake faith they think my uncle killed her it was the horror in his eyes that had her pushing back her own hes a bad man wade a bad and dangerous man and nothing to do with you im sorry for tory i swear i am and for your aunt and your family but well im going to say it even if it makes you mad at me she chose him wade and she stayed with him maybe thats a kind of love but its a bad kind its a sorry kind we dont know what goes on in other peoples lives oh hell we dont were always saying that but we do know i know what went on in my parents lives i know that if either of them had any gumption theyd have made their marriage work or theyd have ended it instead my mother clung to the lavelle name like it was some sort of prize and papa took up with another woman and whose fault was that i spent a long time letting myself believe it was the other womans but it wasnt it was papas for not honoring his marriage vows and mamas for tolerating it maybe its easier to say this is all hannibal bodeens fault but its not and it sure as hell isnt yours or torys or your daddys she pushed back from the table i wish i could think of nice things to say of soft and comforting things to say but im no good at it i guess you want to go on over to your daddys no he kept his eyes on her face as he had since shed begun to speak hes better off with my mother shell know what to do for him who the hell wouldve thought youd know what to do for me he held out a hand when she took it he pulled her close turned his face into her belly stay will you course i will she stroked a hand down his hair her insides were a little shaky an odd feeling well just be quiet awhile he held on as surprised as she that she would be an anchor for him ive been sitting here since my father called i dont know how long half an hour an hour frozen inside i dont know what to do for my family you will when the time comes to do it you always do you want me to fix you some fresh coffee no thanks no i have to call my grandmother and tory i have to figure out what to say first with his eyes closed and his face pressed against her he listened to the dogs barking in the next room im going to keep mongo i know it honey his legs doing all right itll take a while to heal yet but hell be fine a little gimpy maybe i was going to find him a good home but i cant he looked up puzzled what do you mean you know it i never keep dogs you hadnt found the right one yet is all his eyes narrowed on her face but his dimples deepened as they did when he was amused youre getting a little too wise for comfort its the new me i kind of like it and this new you cooks supper on rare occasions i got us a couple of steaks in there and the trimmings she walked to the counter dug in the bag and pulled out two white candles lucy down at the market asked me what kind of evening i had planned buying red meat and white candles and a fancy cheesecake in a box he smiled a little rose from his chair and what did you tell lucy down at the market i told her i was fixing a romantic dinner for two for myself and dr wade mooney a number of interested ears pricked at that tidbit of information she set the candles down i hope you dont mind that i was indiscreet and that we will now find ourselves the subject of considerable talk and speculation no he slid his arms around her laid his cheek on her hair i dont mind lissy honey i dont feel right about this now dwight were paying a grievance call on friends and neighbors trying to find comfort lissy shifted on the seat of the car hauling her belly up with one arm torys just lost her mother and shell appreciate some sympathy tomorrow maybe dwight gave the road ahead a pained look the next day why she wont feel up to making herself a decent meal now will she so im taking her a nice chicken casserole help keep her strength up lord it will be trying for her despite her pious sigh there was a lively fascination dancing inside her torys own mother shot dead by her own father why it was just like something out of the tabloid papers or out of hollywood and since shed dragged dwight out of the house hardly an hour after the news hit shed likely be the first to get a look at tory not that she wasnt sympathetic to tory naturally she was hadnt she taken that casserole her mother had made for her to heat up after the baby came and brought it along food was for death everyone knew that shes not going to feel up to company dwight insisted were not company why i went to school with tory the both of us have known her since we were children i couldnt bear the idea of her being alone at such a time or of someone else getting there first besides all that dwight frazier youre mayor its your duty to call on the bereaved goodness watch these bumps honey i have to pee again i dont want you getting too excited or upset he reached over to pat her hand no going into labor out here lissy dont you worry but it pleased her that he did ive got three weeks left at least goodness how do i look anxious she flipped down the vanity mirror i must look a fright rushing out the way i did a big fat frightful cow youre beautiful still the prettiest girl in progress and all mine oh dwight she flushed rosily and fluffed her hair youre so sweet i just feel so fat and ugly these days and torys so slim skin and bones my womans got curves he reached over to rub her breast and made her squeal stop that giggling she gave his hand a swat shame on you now look were almost there and youve got me all flustered she snuck her hand between his legs got yourself flustered too remember how we used to park out this way when we were young and foolish and i talked you into the backseat of my daddys car didnt take much talking i was just crazy about you the first time we made love it was out here it was so dark so sexy dwight she walked her fingers up his leg after the baby comes and i get my figure back lets have mama come over and babysit you and ill drive on out here and see if you can still talk me into the backseat he blew out a breath keep talking like that lissy and im not going to be able to get out of this car without embarrassing myself slow down a little i want to put some lipstick on anyway she dug a tube out of her purse mama said shed keep luke overnight we should go by and see boots and jr after we leave torys i guess theyll have the funeral up around florence well have to go of course represent the town and so on i dont have any black maternity dresses i suppose ill have to make do with the navy even though it has that pretty white collar peoplell understand dont you think if i wear navy blue and well have to send flowers she chattered until they turned into the lane dwight was no longer aroused but he was getting a vague headache fifteen minutes he promised himself hed give lissy fifteen minutes to fuss over tory then he was taking her home and making her put her feet up that way he could get himself a beer kick back and watch whatever was on espn nobody in progress was going to do any grieving over sarabeth bodeen except her immediate family he didnt see why a death so far removed from him and his town need occupy more than the minimum amount of his time personal or official hed pay his duty calls then forget it i dont know why anybody would want to live way out here without a single soul for company lissy said as dwight hauled her out of the car then again tory always was an odd one rare as a twoheaded duck my mama would say then again she trailed off and gave cades car a significant look i guess she doesnt lack for company after all i swear i cant see those two together dwight not for a new york minute they cant have a thing in common and as far as i can see torys not the kind to keep a man very warm if you know what i mean shes goodlooking enough if you like that type but shes nothing compared to deborah purcell i cant for the life of me figure what cade sees in her a man in his position could have his pick of women god knows ive tried to steer him toward plenty of them dwight said hmmm and uhhuh and yes honey a couple of times as he got the casserole dish out of the car it wasnt necessary to actually listen to his wife when she started on one of her ramblings after several years of marriage he had her rhythm down so that he managed to punctuate her statements at the appropriate times without having a clue what she was talking about the system served them both well i imagine hell get tired of her before much longer and theyll drift apart the way people do when they dont have a real bond like we do she fluttered at him gave his arm a little pat and he read the signal correctly he glanced down and gave her a warm and loving look once hes shaken loose again well have him over for dinner with oh maybe crystal bean i might even be able to find some nice man for tory more her kind thatll take some doing as i dont think therere many men wholl be willing to take on such a strange one i swear sometimes shell just look at me and give me the shivers if you know what i mean tory she exclaimed it when tory opened the door and immediately opened her arms oh honey im just so sorry about your mother dwight and i came the minute we heard you poor thing now why arent you resting i was sure cade would have you lying down at a time like this the embrace was smothering and hot im all right of course youre not all right and you dont have to pretend with us old friends she flapped her hand against torys back now i want you to sit down and im going to make you a nice cup of tea i brought you a casserole here i want you to have a hot meal keep your strength up during this painful time cade she released tory to turn her attention on cade as he came in from the kitchen im glad youre here seeing to tory a time like this she needs all her friends now you come on with me honey she slipped an arm around torys waist as if to support her dwight you bring that dish on back to the kitchen so i can warm it up for tory lissy thats very kind of you tory began nothing kind about it not between friends i know you must be half out of your mind right now but were here for you whatevers said or done you count on us isnt that right dwight honey sure it is he gave cade a pained looked as lissy pulled tory toward the kitchen i couldnt stop her he murmured she means it for the best im sure she does its a terrible thing terrible hows tory holding up shes coping cade glanced back toward the kitchen where lissys voice ran on and on im worried about her but shes coping theyre saying it was hannibal bodeen who did it words spreading fast i figured youd want to know thats whats being said its going to get worse i expect before it gets better i dont think it gets any worse chief russ give you any updates on the manhunt hes playing it close i guess hes got to havent had anything like this around here since you lost your sister cade he hesitated then shifted the dish still in his hands it cant be easy on you either bringing all that back again no its not but ill tell you the way its starting to look and that might close this off once and for all its starting to look like it might have been bodeen who killed hope killedвђ he took a long breath blew it out again as he too glanced toward the kitchen god almighty cade i dont know what to say what to think neither do i yet dwight come on and bring me that casserole will you on the way he called back ill move lissy along soon as i can i know you dont want company appreciate it and id appreciate it if you wouldnt mention torys fathers connection to hope to lissy or anyone just yet things are hard enough on tory right now you can count on me i mean that cade you let me know what you want done and when and ill see to it he managed a smile you and me and wade we go back all the way back i will count on you i do iвђ there was a sudden squeal from the kitchen that had dwight bolting across the room in alarm he burst in to see lissy eyes wide mouth open with torys hand clutched in hers engaged why i just cant believe it dwight look here what torys wearing on her finger and neither of them saying a word about it she jerked torys hand forward her own face alive with the bliss of being she was sure the first to know isnt this something dwight studied the ring then looked into torys eyes he saw the fatigue the embarrassment the faint irritation it sure is i hope youll be very happy of course shell be happy lissy dropped torys hand so she could waddle around the table and hug cade arent you the sly one never letting on then snapping tory up so fast why her head must still be spinning we have to celebrate drink a toast to the happy couple oh she stopped had the grace to flush even if her eyes continued to dance what am i thinking im just a scatterbrain thats all oh honey you must be so torn she scurried back to tory as quickly as she could manage getting engaged and losing your mama this way so close together life goes on you remember that life does go on tory didnt bother to sigh but she did manage to get her hand in her lap before lissy could grab it again thank you lissy im sorry i hope you understand but i need to call my grandmother we have to see about arrangements of course we understand now i want you to let me know if theres anything i can do anything at all nothings too big or too small dwight and i are more than happy to help arent we dwight thats right he put his arm firmly around lissy well go on now but you can call us if theres anything you need no dont you get up he steered lissy toward the doorway well let ourselves out you call now you hear thank you imagine that imagine it lissy could hardly wait until theyd gotten to the front door wearing a diamond big enough to blind you and on the day she finds out her daddy killed her mama i swear dwight i dont know what to think shell be planning a wedding and a funeral at the same time i told you didnt i tell you she was a strange one you told me honey he nudged her into the car shut the door you surely told me he murmured inside cade sat at the table for a moment he and tory studied each other in silence sorry he said at length for dwights my friend and she comes along with him shes a silly woman not particularly crafty not particularly mean she thrives on other peoples business good and bad right now she doesnt know which to highlight heres victoria bodeen in the middle of a tragedy and scandal and here she is again engaged to one of the most prominent men in the county tory paused glanced down at the ring on her finger it was a jolt to see it there she thought not a bad sensation just an odd one such bulletins she continued it all must be rattling around in her head like marbles clinking together as there isnt much else in there to get in the way his mouth twitched is that speculation or did you take a look theres no need to and i dont do that anyway when everything shes thinking runs riot over her face dwight would never have gotten her out so quickly if she hadnt been jumping to get to a phone and start spreading the word and that bothers you yes she pushed back from the table wandered to the window odd that it comforted somehow to look out into the dark shadows of the marsh i knew when i came back here id be under the microscope i understood that and ill deal with it my mother ill deal with that too theres nothing else i can do you dont have to deal with it alone i know i came back here to face myself i suppose to resolve or at least accept what had happened to hope and my part in that i expected the talk the looks the speculation and curiosity i planned to use them to build my business i have and ill keep on using them thats cold no its good sense tough maybe but not cold i came back for me she said quietly to prove i could i expected to pay for it to quiet the restlessness inside me but to pay for it i never expected you she turned back i never expected you cade and i dont know quite what to do with all of this feeling i have inside me for you he got to his feet crossed to her to brush her hair back from her face youll figure it out this is so easy for you i guess ive been waiting for you cade my father what he is part of thats in me you have to consider that you have to weigh it in do i he gave her a considering look as he turned her to walk toward the bedroom youre probably right i suppose i should give you the same opportunity to weigh in my greatgrandfather horace who engaged in a long lascivious affair with his wifes brother when she discovered it and in what you can imagine was her shocked distress threatened to expose him horace along with his lover displeased by this reaction dismembered her and kept the alligators fat and happy for several days youre making that up no indeed he drew her down on the bed well the business about the alligators is family legend there are some who say she simply fled to savannah and lived to the age of ninetysix in mortified solitude either way it isnt a proud footnote in the lavelle family history she turned to him found the curve of his shoulder and rested her head there i suppose its a good thing i dont have any brothers there you go sleep awhile tory its just you and me here thats what matters now while she slept he lay wakeful listening to the sounds of the night im asking you to indulge me tory looked up at the peaks and lines of beaux reves youre putting me between yourself and your mother again cade thats not fair to any of us no but i need to speak with her and i dont want you driving into town by yourself i dont want you alone until this is over tory well that makes two of us so you can rest easy there but id as soon wait in the car while you do what you have to do inside lets compromise oh when did that word enter your vocabulary he slanted her a slow and very bland smile well go around back you can wait in the kitchen my mother doesnt spend a lot of time there she started to object again subsided he would she knew simply roll over her excuses and she was too worn out to fight about it too many dreams in the night too many images sliding into her head in the day when it was over he said as if it would be as if it could she got out of the car walked with him around the garden path through the wildly blooming roses past the glossyleafed camellia where a young girl had once secreted her pretty pink bike wound through the hills of azaleas with their blooms long since spent and fragrant spires of lavender that would scent the air all the way into winter the world was lush here full of color and shape and perfume a lazily elegant place of bricked paths and lovely benches set just so among the beds and shrubs with overflowing pots of mixed blooms tucked artistically among the stream the result was like a painting meticulously executed margarets world again tory realized just like the studied perfection of the rooms inside nothing to mar it nothing to change it how wrenching it would be to have some invader burst in and skew the balance of it all you dont understand her excuse me your mother you dont understand her at all intrigued cade laced his fingers with torys did i give you the impression i thought i did this is her world cade this is her life the house the gardens the view she sees out the windows even before hope died it was the center for her what she tended and preserved and continued to after she lost her child she could keep this she said turning to him touch it see it make certain it didnt change dont take this from her im not he cupped torys face in his hands now holding it up to his but neither will i tolerate her using it or the farm as a threat to hold me under her thumb i cant give her more than ive already offered not even for you there has to be a compromise just as you said one would think he laid his lips on her brow but sometimes with some people theres only yes or no dont take this on he drew her back and his eyes were troubled dont ask me to victoria the sound he made wasnt so much a sigh as a rush of air dont ask me to bargain our happiness against her approval ive never had her approval to begin with it was so strange to realize it and all at once hed grown up in a castle and had been just as starved for kind words as she it hurts you im sorry i didnt see that it hurts you old wounds he ran his hands down her arms laced fingers again they dont bleed like they used to but they would seep and trickle from time to time she thought as they began to walk again no one had ever used a belt on him or fists there were other ways to pummel a child even here in all this beauty so far removed from the barren and stifling rooms of her childhood beautiful yes tory thought as they walked under an arbor buried in morning glories but lonely that was just another word for barren there should be someone sitting on the bench or clipping the gerberas for a basket a child stretched bellydown over the path studying a lizard or toad the painting needed life and sound and movement i want children cade stopped in his tracks excuse me where had that come from and why had it popped out of her mind as if it had always been there i want children she repeated im tired of empty yards and quiet gardens and tidy rooms if we live here i want noise and crumbs on the floor and dishes in the sink i couldnt survive in all those perfect untouched rooms and thats something you cant ask me to do i dont want this house without life inside it the words rushed out of her mouth and the panic riding in them made him smile he remembered a young boy whod wanted to build a fort scrap wood and tar paper this is such an interesting coincidence i was thinking two children with an option for three okay she blew out a breath all right i shouldve known youd already figured it out i am a farmer we plan then we hope fate cooperates he bent to pluck a sprig of rosemary from the kitchen garden for remembrance he said as he gave it to her while youre waiting for me remember we have a life to plan as messy and noisy as we like she went inside with him and there was lilah as she was so often working at the sink the air smelled of coffee and biscuits and the sweet rose scent lilah sprayed on every morning you come in late for breakfast she said lucky for you im in a good mood shed been watching them the last few minutes with a lightness of heart they looked right together shed been waiting to see her boy look right with someone well sit down coffees fresh enough i made up some flapjack batter nobodys bothered to eat is my mother upstairs she is and the judge is cooling his heels in the front parlor lilah was already getting down mugs dont have much to say to me today been on the phone considerable and got her door shut that sister of yours she dont even bother coming home last night cades stomach clutched faiths not home nothing to worry on shes with doc wade breezed out of here yesterday saying thats where shed be and id see her when i see her seems nobody sleeps in their own bed around here these days but me too damn hot for all these carryingson sit down and eat i need to speak to my mother feed her he ordered pointing at tory im not a puppy tory muttered as he strode away dont go to any trouble lilah sit down and take that martyr look off your face its his place to settle things with his mama and not yours to fuss your head over it she got out the griddle to heat and youll eat what i put in front of you im beginning to think he takes after you why shouldnt he i did most of the raising of him im not speaking against miss margaret some women arent built to be mothers is all dont make them less just makes them what they are she got a bowl out of the refrigerator peeled back the cover i was sorry to hear about your mother thank you lilah stood a moment bowl in the crook of her arm her eyes dark and warm on torys face some women she said again arent built for mothering thats why just like the song says god blesses the child whos got his own you got your own honey you always did for the first time since shed heard the news of her mothers death tory wept cade stopped at the parlor first manners would never have permitted him to walk by an old family friend judge gerald turned and the stern contemplative lines of his face relaxed fractionally when he saw cade i was hoping id have a chance to speak with you this morning i hope you can spare me a minute of course cade stepped in gestured to a chair i hope youre well a little arthritis acts up now and again old age gerald gestured it aside as he sat never think its going to happen to you then you wake up one day and wonder who the hell that old man is in your shaving mirror well gerald laid his palms on the knees of his trousers ive known you since you were born so theres no need to pick your words cade finished im aware my mother has spoken to you about some legalities and changes in her will shes a proud woman and shes concerned for you is she cade lifted his eyebrows as if fascinated by that information she neednt be im fine more than fine if her concern is for beaux reves he continued its also misplaced were having a very good year better i think even than last gerald cleared his throat cade i knew your father most of my life was his friend i hope youll take what i have to say in that spirit if you would postpone your personal plans take a bit more time to consider im fully aware of a mans needs and desires but when those desires are put ahead of duty of practicality and most of all ahead of family it can never come to good ive asked tory to marry me i dont need my mothers blessing or yours for that matter i can only regret those blessings arent forthcoming cade youre a young man with your life in front of you im only asking as a friend of both your parents for you to take time to consider time you can well spare at your age to look at the entire picture particularly now that this tragedy has come into tory bodeens life a tragedy gerald added that speaks volumes of who and what she comes from you were just a boy yourself when she lived here and were sheltered from the harder facts of life what facts would they be gerald sighed hannibal bodeen is a dangerous man undoubtedly ill in his mind such things come down in the blood now i have every sympathy for the child make no mistake but theres no changing what is is this the apple doesnt fall far from the tree or is it as a twig is bent so it grows irritation flickered over geralds face either is apt victoria bodeen lived in that house under his hand too long not to be bent by it under his hand cade said carefully figuratively and im afraid literally many years ago iris mooney victorias maternal grandmother came to see me she wanted to sue the bodeens for custody of the girl she said bodeen beat the child she wanted to hire you she did however she had no proof of this abuse no substantiation i have no doubt had none then that she was telling the truth butвђ you knew cade said very quietly you knew that he was beating her putting welts and bruises on her and you did nothing the lawвђ fuck the law he spoke in that same deadly cool voice as he got to his feet she came to you for help because she wanted to take a child out of a nightmare and you did nothing it was not my place to interfere with the blood family she had no proof the case was weak flustered gerald rose as well he was unused to being questioned or looked at with such disgust there were no police reports none from social services just the word of a grandmother if i had taken the case nothing would have come of it well never know will we because you didnt take the case you didnt try to help it was not my place gerald said again it was your place its everyones place but she got through it without you without anyone now if youll excuse me i have personal business he walked out quickly upstairs cade knocked on his mothers door it occurred to him that there had often been closed doors in this house barriers that required a polite request before they were removed manners forever took precedence here over intimacy that would change he could promise himself that the doors of beaux reves would be open his children wouldnt have to wait like company for an invitation to enter come in margaret continued to pack shed seen cade drive up with that woman and had been expecting him to knock she assumed he would ask her to change her mind about leaving would attempt to reach a compromise he was a deal maker she mused as she laid tissue paper between precisely folded blouses as his father had been it would give her enormous satisfaction to listen to his requests and offers and refuse them all im sorry to disturb you the prologue came automatically hed said the same thing countless times when admitted to her rooms and im sorry you and i find ourselves at odds she didnt bother to look over ive made arrangements to have my luggage picked up this afternoon i will naturally expect the rest of my belongings to be shipped to me i have a partial list of what is mine it will take a bit more time to complete i have acquired a number of possessions in my years in this house of course have you decided where youll be staying the smooth tone of the question had her hands fumbling her gaze darting toward him ive made no permanent arrangements such things require careful consideration yes i thought you might be more comfortable in a house of your own and somewhere nearby as you have ties to the community we own the property at the corner of magnolia and main its an attractive brick house two stories with a wellestablished yard and garden its tenanted at the moment but the lease runs out in just over two months if youre interested ill give the tenants notice staggered she stared at him how easily you put me out im not putting you out the choice is yours youre welcome to stay here its your home and can continue to be but it will also be torys home youll see what she is eventually but shell have ruined you by then her mother was trash her father is a murderer and she herself is nothing but an opportunist a calculating sneak who never knew her place her place is here with me if you cant accept that and her then youll have to make your place elsewhere sometimes for some people the answer was yes or no it occurred to him that this time it applied to him as much as his mother the house on magnolia is yours if you want it if however you prefer to go elsewhere beaux reves will acquire the property of your choice out of guilt no mama i have no guilt for taking my happiness or loving a woman i also admire and respect respect margaret spat out you can speak of respect yes ive never known anyone i respect more so guilt plays no part here but i will see to it you have a comfortable home i need nothing from you i have money of my own i know that take whatever time you need to decide whatever that decision is i hope youll be happy with it or at least content i wish he closed his eyes a moment weary from maintaining the facade of manners i wish there was more between us than this i wish i knew why there cant be we disappoint each other mama im sorry for that she had to press her lips together to stop their trembling when i leave this house youll be dead to me grief swam into his eyes swirled there then cleared away yes i know he stepped back then quietly shut the door between them alone margaret sank onto the bed and listened to the silence cade gathered what paperwork he thought hed need over the next day or two and listened to his phone messages while he loaded his briefcase he needed to check in with piney return calls from the factory and run by a couple of the rental units there was a board meeting the next day but that could be rescheduled his quarterly meeting with his bookkeeper couldnt hed just have to find a safe place to plant tory for a few hours he glanced at his watch picked up the phone faith answered her voice slurred with sleep wheres wade hmmm down with a cocker spaniel or something what time is it its after nine go away im sleeping im coming into town torys with me shes making noises about going into the shop she doesnt plan to open today but i expect she wants to find something to keep her busy i want you to keep an eye out then go over and stay with her maybe you didnt hear me im sleeping get up well be there within a half hour youre awful damn bossy this morning i dont want either of you alone until bodeens in custody you stick with her you hear ill be back around as soon as i can what the hell am i supposed to do with her youll think of something get up he repeated then broke the connection satisfied he carried his briefcase downstairs the first thing he noticed was that torys plate was nearly cleared the second was that shed been crying whats wrong what did you say to her oh stop fussing lilah swatted him off like a fly shes had herself a nice weep and shes the better for it isnt that so little girl yes thanks i cant eat any more lilah i really cant lips pursed lilah studied the plate then nodded you did all right she glanced over at cade will miss margaret or the judge be wanting breakfast i dont think so my mothers made arrangements to leave this afternoon she going through with it apparently i dont want you staying here alone lilah i thought you might like to visit your sister for a couple of days i could do that she picked up torys plate to carry it to the sink ill wait and see if its all the same to you cade ill check in later best thing her going she breaks free of this house shell be the happier for it in the long run i hope youre right you call your sister he said and held out a hand for tory tory got to her feet and after a moments hesitation stepped over to press her cheek to lilahs thank you youre a good girl just remember to hold on to your own im going to she waited until they were outside in the car and driving down the treelined lane away from the house i dont want a big wedding cade arched his brows okay id like to do it as quietly as possible and as and he made the turn onto the road tory glanced out the window toward the edges of the swamp and as soon as possible why how like him to ask she thought and turned to him again because i want to start our life i want to begin well arrange for the license tomorrow will that suit you yes she laid a hand over his that suits me fine smiling at him she saw nothing felt nothing from the marsh or what waited in it faith strolled across to southern comfort when she saw cades car pull up she put on a big smile and hooked her arm companionably through cades there you are i thought youd forgotten forgotten remember honey you said i could borrow your car today here you go she dropped her own keys in his hand and fluttered her lashes so sweet of you too isnt he just the best brother tory he knows i have a partiality for his little convertible and hes always letting me borrow it she nipped the keys out of cades fingers then gave him a big noisy kiss tory im just bored silly with wade so busy today im just going to keep you company awhile all right im thinking of buying wade one of those fat candlesticks youve got in here smoothly she transferred her grip from cade to tory his place could sure use some fixing up well youve seen it yourself so you know looks like im going to be spending more time there and i just cant abide that primitive male decor of his cars around the back of wades building she called out to cade as she steered tory toward the door its low on gas with a last glance at cades annoyed face tory unlocked the shop was the car a bribe no he didnt trouble to offer a bribe he woke me up this morning so hes got to pay a price he wants us looking out for each other wheres your dog oh shes having a fine time at wades faith turned to the window and waved cheerfully to cade oh hes steaming he just hates for me to drive this toy of his so naturally you drive it as often as possible naturally got anything cold to drink its hot enough to steal your breath out there today in the back help yourself are you opening today no i dont want people today so dont be offended if i ignore you same goes faith slipped into the back room and came back with two bottles of coke tory had the music on low and was busy with glass cleaner and a cloth you might as well give me something to do before i do die of boredom tory held out the cloth you ought to be able to manage this i have plenty of work in the back please dont let anyone in if someone comes to the door just tell them were closed today fine by me she shrugged as tory went into the back then entertained herself by rearranging stock to her liking imagining what it would be like to run a shop entirely too much work she decided too much trouble though it was fun to be around so many nice things and speculate who would buy what she found the keys for the jewelry case behind the counter and tried on several pairs of earrings admired a bracelet fashioned out of a coil of silver and tried that on as well when someone knocked on the door she jumped guiltily and closed the display she didnt recognize the faces the man and woman stood outside the door studying her as she studied them it was a shame faith thought that tory wasnt open at least customers would be a diversion faith smiled brightly and tapped the closed sign the woman held up a badge oops the fbi she thought an even better diversion she unlocked the door miss bodeen no shes in the back faith took a moment to size them up the woman was tall and tough with short black hair and cool dark eyes she wore what faith considered a very unflattering gray suit and deadugly shoes the man had more potential with curling brown hair and a square jaw with a sexy little dent in it she tried the smile on him and got the faintest glimmer of response ive never met an fbi agent before i guess im a little flustered would you ask miss bodeen to come out the woman requested of course just excuse me for one minute yall wait right here she hurried to the stockroom closed the door behind her its the fbi torys head snapped up here right out there a man and a woman and nothing like those two on the tv show hes not half bad but shes wearing a suit i wouldnt be buried in shes a yankee too i dont know about him he hasnt opened his mouth ask me she runs the show for gods sake what do i care about that tory got to her feet but her knees were shaking before she could steady herself there was a brisk knock on the door and it opened miss bodeen yes iвђyes im special agent tatia lynn williams the woman showed her badge again and this is special agent marks we need to speak with you have you found my father not at this time has he contacted you no i havent seen him or heard from him hed know i wouldnt help him wed like to ask you some questions williams gave faith a pointed look instantly faith scooted behind the desk to wrap an arm around torys shoulder this is my brothers fiancгe i promised him id stay with her i wont break my word to my brother marks took out his notebook flipped pages and you would be faith lavelle torys going through a very distressing time im staying with her youre acquainted with hannibal bodeen i know him and i believe he killed my sister eighteen years ago we have no evidence of that williams said flatly miss bodeen when did you last see your mother in april my uncle and i went to see her ive been estranged from my parents for a number of years i hadnt seen her since i was twenty or my father either until he came here to my shop and at that time you were aware he was a fugitive yes yet you gave him money he took money tory corrected but id have given it to him to keep him away from me your father was physically violent with you all of my life giving in tory sat and with your mother no not really he didnt have to be i believe he battered her in more recent years when i wasnt there but that would be speculation im told you dont have to speculate williams glanced up fixed her eyes on torys face you claim to be psychic i dont claim anything you were involved in several cases of abducted children a few years ago what would that have to do with my mothers murder you were friends with hope lavelle marks picked up the pattern smoothly slid into a chair himself while his partner remained standing yes very good friends and you led her family and the authorities to her body yes im sure you have the reports theres nothing i can add to them you claimed to have seen her murder when tory didnt respond marks leaned forward recently you enlisted the aid of abigail lawrence an attorney in charleston you were interested in a series of sexual homicides why because they were all killed by the same person the same person who murdered hope because each of them was hope to him at a different age you sense this williams commented and drew torys gaze i know this i dont expect you to believe me if you know this williams continued why didnt you come forward to what purpose to amuse someone like you to have what happened to jonah mansfield dragged up again and my part in it thrown in my face you know all there is to know about me agent williams marks took a plastic bag from his pocket tossed it on the desk inside was a single earring a simple gold hoop what can you tell us about that tory kept her hands in her lap its an earring one of the things we know is youre very cool under fire williams stepped forward you were interested enough in the murders to gather information on them arent you interested enough to see what you can pick up lets say from that ive told you all i can about my father ill do whatever i can to help you find him marks picked up the bag start with this was it my mothers without thinking tory snatched it out of his hand broke the seal then closed her fingers over the earring she opened herself wanting this last connection more than shed realized she shivered once then dropped the earring onto the desk the mates in your pocket she said to williams you took them off as you were driving into town put this one in here her eyes tracked up stayed level im not required to put myself on display for you i apologize williams stepped forward to pick up the earring i do know quite a bit about you miss bodeen i was interested in the work you did in new york ive studied the mansfield case she slipped the earring back into her pocket they should have listened to you she gave her partner a quiet look i intend to theres nothing more i can tell you she got to her feet faith would you show them out please sure williams took out a card laid it on the desk then followed faith out of the storeroom minutes later faith came back in took out a fresh coke and settled down in the chair marks had vacated you could tell that just by touching that earring you knew it was hers and all that just by touching it i have work to do oh get over yourself faith took a long swig from the bottle i swear ive never known anybody takes every damn thing so serious what we ought to do is go buy ourselves some lottery tickets or run on up to the racetrack can you tell with horses i dont see why you couldnt for gods sake well why not why cant you have some fun with it it doesnt have to be some dark depressing weight no ive got it better than horses well go to vegas and play blackjack jesus christ tory wed break the bank in every casino its not something to profit from why not oh of course i forgot this is you youd rather mope about it poor little me faith dabbed an invisible hankie under her eyes im psychic so i must suffer the insult was so huge tory couldnt imagine why her lips wanted to twitch into a ridiculous grin im not moping you would given half a chance im an expert on moping she edged a hip onto the desk come on over to wades with me you can like brush up against him or whatever and find out whats going on in his head about me i will not oh be a pal no youre such a bitch thats right now go away and put that bracelet back where you got it fine its not my style anyway she leaned over the desk what am i thinking right now tory glanced up and her mouth quivered its inventive but anatomically impossible she swiveled back to her keyboard faith thanks with a sniff faith pulled open the door for what for deliberately annoying me so i wouldnt mope oh that my pleasure its so easy after all wade honey faith cocked the phone on her shoulder and peered over the counter toward the storeroom where it seemed to her tory had been holed up for ten days you busy me of course not i just finished neutering a dachshund another day in paradise oh what exactly do youвђno never mind i dont think i want to know hows my baby im just fine and how are you i meant bee is she all right usurped by puppy breath he let out a weighty sigh for form shes enjoying herself im sure shell tell you all about her first day at work later im having a first day at work too sort of faith studied with a surprising sense of satisfaction the glass displays shed polished to a sparkle what time do you think youre going to be done over there i should be wrapped up by fivethirty what did you have in mind i have cades convertible and i was thinking how it would be if we took us a long drive its so hot and sticky im not wearing a thing but that red dress with a sly smile on her face she twirled a lock of hair around her finger you remember my red dress dont you honey there was a long long pause youre trying to kill me her laugh was low and satisfied im just trying to be sure since weve been spending a lot of time lately having conversations and so forth that a certain part of our relationship isnt neglected i can get behind that then why dont we take that drive we could find us a cheap motel and play traveling salesman what are you selling this time her laugh was long and robust oh honey just trust me the price is going to be right then im buying wed have to drive back late tonight or early tomorrow morning i have appointments thatll be fine she was getting used to this makingplans business wade yeah you remember how you said you were in love with me i seem to recollect something of the sort well i think i love you back and you know what it doesnt feel half bad there was another long pause i think i can get out of here by fivefifteen ill pick you up she hung up and danced around the counter tory come on out of there might as well be in jail she stated as she pulled open the door tory merely looked up from her inventory list youve never actually had a job have you what would i want one of those for i have an inheritance fulfillment selfsatisfaction the pleasure of completing a task all right ill work with you have they built a ski lift in hell no really it might be fun but well talk about that later now you have to come along with me ive got to run home and get some things together go ahead where i go you go i promised cade and weve played here your way for she checked her watch rolled her eyes almost four hours i havent finished here well i have and if we stay here the rest of the day those fbi people might come back all right tory tossed down her pencil but i promised my grandmother id be at my uncles by five thats perfect ill drop you off there before i pick up wade grab us a couple of cokes honey im just parched faith breezed out to freshen her lipstick in one of torys decorative mirrors since when do you have a reflection tory asked sweetly as she brought out the bottles unoffended faith slipped the top on the lipstick tube and dropped it in her purse youre just cross because youve been holed up in your cave all day youre going to thank me when we get out on the road and i open up that beauty of cades get some wind in your hair it might actually have a little style theres nothing wrong with my hair not a thing if you want to look like an oldmaid librarian thats a ridiculous clichг and an insult to an entire profession faith stood another moment at the mirror fluffed her own sleek blond mane have you seen miss matilda down at progress library lately despite her best intentions torys lips quivered oh shut up she suggested and shoved the coke bottle into faiths hands thats what i like about you always the snappy comeback she gave her hair a toss then started to leave well come on you changed things tory scanned the shelves the cases noted the small shifts in stock snappy comebacks faith thought and an eye like a damn hawk so she wanted to complain nearly did on principle but honesty got the better of her its not bad excuse me im so overwhelmed with flattery i feel a little faint in that case ill drive the hell you will laughing faith danced out the door as she followed locked up tory realized she was enjoying herself dealing with faith made it impossible to brood the idea of a fast ride in an open car held a great deal of appeal shed focus on that just that and worry about the rest later fasten your seat belt she ordered as she slid into the passenger seat oh right the airs so thick you could chew it faith clicked her belt on took out her sunglasses then turned the key gunning the engine she gave tory a mischievous grin now for some mood music she punched the cd button flipping through until pete seeger wailed out about rockandroll ah classical perfect were about to see what youre made of victoria deliberately tory took out her own sunglasses slipped them on stern stuff good faith waited for a break in traffic then shot away from the curb in a screaming uturn she nipped through the light at the square seconds before it turned red youre going to get a ticket before you get out of town oh i bet the fbis keeping our locals plenty busy jesus dont you just love this car why dont you buy one of your own then id miss the fun of nagging cade to death about borrowing it she crossed the town limits and poured it on the wind whipped over torys face tore at her hair and thrilled her blood an adventure she thought as they streamed around turns foolishness it had been a long long time since she indulged in simple idiocy speed hope had loved going fast riding her bike like it was a stallion or a rocket ship daring the devil as she threw her arms high in the air and gave herself to the moment tory did the same now throwing her head back and letting the speed and the music pour over her the smells were summer and summer was childhood hot tar melting under the searing sun still water going ripe in the heat she could race through the fields when the cotton had burst from its bolls and pretend she was an explorer on an alien planet do cartwheels across the road and feel the tar go soft under her palms into the marsh that was any world she wanted it to be running there running with the ground spongy under her feet with the moss tumbling down and mosquitoes singing for blood running running away with her heart pounding and a scream trapped in her throat runningвђ theres cade what tory jerked back lightheaded clammy her eyes wide and nearly blind as she swiveled her head there carelessly faith gestured toward the field where two men stood in a sea of green cotton she gave the horn a cheerful toot waved and laughed oh hes cursing us now giving piney an earful about his crazy irresponsible sister dont you worry she added smugly hell just figure im trying to corrupt you im all right tory forced herself to breathe in breathe out im fine faith gave her a longer more considering look sure you are you sure go pale though why dont youвђoh shit the rabbit darted across the road a brown streak of confusion instinctively faith hit the brakes swerved the car fishtailed squealed and under her firm hands found its balance again i just cant stand hitting anything though god knows why they run out like that seems they wait for a car to come along and she trailed off as she looked at tory again the snicker escaped before she cleared her throat and slowed down uh oh saying nothing tory looked down most of the coke that had been in the bottle was now splattered all over her shirt with two fingertips she pulled it away from her skin and slanted her gaze to faith well gee whiz i couldnt run down the little bunny could i just do me a favor and get me home so i can change okay tapping her fingers on the wheel faith swung into torys lane kicking dust and gravel into the air as she braked laughing but cautious faith hopped out of the car ill run some cold water over that shirt while you clean up shame to ruin it even if it is deadly ordinary classic you keep believing that pleased with the diversion faith strolled up the steps you take your time straightening yourself up she said as tory pulled open the door you need it more than i do i dont suppose it takes long to look ready to hop in the next available bed grinning faith followed her into the bedroom then making herself at home she opened torys closet and poked through hey some of this stuffs not half bad get your fingers out of my clothes this is a good color for me she pulled out a silk blouse in a deep dusky blue then turned to the mirror brings out my eyes stripped down to her bra tory snatched the blouse and shoved the damp shirt at faith go make yourself useful faith rolled her eyes but headed out to rinse the shirt in the bathroom sink if youre not wearing it in the next few days you could lend it to me i was thinking wade and i could have an evening at home tomorrow night if things go as theyre supposed to i wouldnt have it on that long anyhow then it doesnt matter what you wear a statement like that just proves you need me faith splashed the shirt around in the bowl what a woman wears is directly related to how she wants a man to respond tory reached in her closet for a white camp shirt frowned then eyed the silk blouse well why not tory buttoned the blouse and walked to the mirror to brush out her hair it needed to be tamed and tied back she told herself she was going to comfort her grandmother to do what she could to help hold what was left of her family together it wasnt the time for the frivolous or the selfish now though god shed needed just that and wouldnt forget that faith had provided it lifting her arms she began to work her hair into a braid the repetitive motion the hum of the ceiling fan lulled her until her eyes were half closed and she was smiling dreamily into the mirror she saw the rabbit dart out into the road a panicked brown streak running fleeing from the scent of man someone was coming someone was watching her arms froze over her head and the panic tripped her heart the air went thick heavy edged with the faintest taste of stale whiskey she scented him prey to hunter in one leap she was at the nightstand and the gun cade had given her was in her hand there was a whimper in the back of her throat but she closed it off all that came out was the ragged panting of fear she rushed from the room just as faith wandered out of the bathroom i left it soaking you can wring it out whenвђ she saw the gun first then torys face oh god was all she managed before tory grabbed her arm listen to me dont ask questions there isnt much time go out the front hurry get in the car and go for help get help ill stop him if i can come on with me come on now no tory broke away swung toward the kitchen hes coming go she ran toward the back of the house to give faith time to escape and to face her father he kicked in the back door lurched through his clothes were filthy his face and arms raw with scratches and the swollen bites of greedy insects he swayed a little but his eyes stayed steady on his daughters face he had an empty bottle in one hand and a gun in the other ive been waiting for you tory tightened her grip on the revolver i know wheres that lavelle bitch gone safe theres no one here but me lying little whore you dont take two steps without that rich mans brat i wanna talk to her he grinned i wanna talk to both of you hopes dead theres just me now thats right thats right he lifted the bottle then realizing it was empty heaved it against the wall where it shattered like gunshots got herself killed asked for it both of you asked for everything you got lying and sneaking touching each other in unholy ways there was nothing but innocence between me and hope tory strained her ears for the panther roar of cades engine but heard nothing you think i didnt know he gestured wildly with the gun but she didnt flinch you think i didnt see you swimming naked floating in the water splashing in it so it ran down your bodies it sickened her that he could twist a simple childhood memory into the profane we were eight years old but you werent the sin was in you it always was no you stay back she lifted the gun now and the trembling ran from her shoulder to her fingertips you wont lay a hand on me again or anyone else didnt mama give you enough money this time didnt she move fast enough is that why you did it i never raised my hand to your mother unless she needed it god made man head of the house put that down and get me a drink the police are on their way by now theyve been looking for you for hope for mama for all the others the gun jerked in her hand as he came forward in her mind there was the hiss and snap of a sam browne belt you come near me and we wont wait for them ill end it now you think you worry me you never had a lick of gumption nobodys ever said that about me faith stepped up behind tory the little gun gleamed in her hand if she wont shoot you i promise i will you said she was dead you said she was dead he was a big man with a long reach in panic as much as fury he lunged knocking tory hard against the wall a gunshot rang out and the smell of blood drenched her senses she stumbled back against faith as her father howled and stormed out the broken doorway i told you to go teeth chattering tory went down to her knees well i didnt listen did i because her vision was going gray faith braced against the wall and shook her head fiercely i used cades car phone to call the police you came back yeah blowing little panting breaths faith bent over from the waist to try to get some blood back in her head you wouldnt have left me there was blood i smelled blood instantly tory was on her feet jerking faith upright again are you shot did he shoot you no it was you you shot him tory snap out of it tory stared down at her own hand the gun was still in it shaking as if it were alive with a little gasp of shock she dropped it clattering to the floor i shot him your gun went off when he shoved you i think god it happened fast there was blood on his shirt im sure of that much and i didnt fire i think im going to be sick i hate being sick sirens hearing them faith rested her back against the wall oh thank god then she heard the roar of an engine and shoved away from the wall oh no oh jesus cades car i left the keys in the car before tory could stop her she was darting toward the front door they burst out together in time to see the car squeal onto the road cades going to kill me tory drew in a breath like a sob but when it came out it was laughter edging toward hysteria but laughter we just chased off a madman and youre worried about your big brother only you well cade can be pretty fierce as much to comfort as to support herself faith draped an arm around torys shoulder tory let her head droop closed her eyes the scream of sirens battered her ears she saw hands on the wheel of the car her fathers hands scored deep with scratches she felt the speed the dance of the tires as the car was whipped around coming back pushing for speed the radio blaring hot rock lights whirling you see them in the rearview mirror as your eyes dart up panic outrage hate theyre getting closer your arm burns from the bullet and the blood drips but youll get away gods on your side he left the car for you fast faster a test its just another test youll get away have to get away but youll come back for her oh youll come back and youll make her pay hands slicked with blood the wheel spins out of your grip the world rushes at you shapes tumbling screaming is that you screaming tory for gods sake tory stop it wake up she came back facedown on the shoulder of the road her body jerking screams ripping through her head dont do this i dont know what im supposed to do im all right painfully tory rolled over shielded her eyes with her arm i just need a minute all right you went tearing out to the road when they drove by i was afraid you were going to run right out in front of them then your eyes rolled back in your head and you went down faith dropped her head in her hands this is too much for me this is just more than enough its all right its over hes dead i think i figured that part out look she pointed down the road the flames and smoke pillared up and the sun bounced off the chrome and glass of the police cars circled in the distance i heard the crash then a kind of explosion a fiery death tory murmured i wished it on him he wished it on himself i want wade oh my god i want wade well get someone to call him steadier tory got to her feet held out a hand for faith well go down and ask someone to call him okay i feel a little drunk me too well just hold on to each other arms wrapped around each others waists they started down the road the heat bounced off the asphalt shimmered on the air through the waves of it tory saw the fire the spin of lights the dull beige of the government car with the fbi agents beside it do you see where he crashed tory murmured just across from where hope just on the bend of the road across from hope she heard the car coming behind them stopped turned cade leaped out raced forward to wrap his arms around both of them youre all right youre all right i heard the sirens then saw the fire oh god i thought he didnt hurt us cades scent was there sweat and man hers tory let it fill her hes dead i felt him die ssh dont im going to get you home both of you i want wade he pressed his lips to the top of faiths head well get him honey come on with me hold on to me for now he took your car cade faith kept her eyes shut her face pressed against her brothers chest im sorry cade only shook his head held her tighter dont think about it everythings going to be all right clinging to control by a thread he helped them into the car as he drove forward agent williams stepped out in the road signaled miss bodeen can you verify thats your father she gestured toward the wreck that hannibal bodeen was driving that vehicle yes hes dead i need to ask you a few questions not here not now cade shoved the truck back in first gear you come to beaux reves when youre done out here im taking them home all right williams looked past him toward tory are you injured not anymore her mind went dull for a while she was aware in a secondary way of cade taking her into the house leading her up the stairs she drifted a little further away when he laid her on a bed after a while there was something cool on her face she opened her eyes looked into his im all right just a little tired i got one of faiths nightgowns youll feel better once we get it on you no she sat up put her arms around him now i feel better he stroked her hair gently then his grip vised around her and he buried his face in her hair i need a minute me too probably a lot of minutes dont let go i wont i cant i saw yall go by faith driving like a maniac i was going to blister her good for it she did it on purpose she loves to agitate you she did plenty i stalked back over the fields vowing to pay her back for it with piney walking along with me grinning like an idiot then i heard the shot liked to stop my heart i started running but i was still a good piece from the road and the car when the police went by i saw the explosion i thought id lost you he began to rock her i thought id lost you tory i was in the car with him in my mind i think i wanted to be so id know the exact moment it was over he cant ever touch you again no he cant touch any of us again she rested her head on the strong curve of his shoulder wheres faith shes downstairs wades here she cant keep still he leaned back let his gaze roam her face shell rev until she falls down and hell be there for her she stayed with me just like you asked her to she let out a sigh i have to go to my grandmother shes coming here i called her this is your home now tory well get your things from the marsh house later that sounds like a very good idea dusk had fallen when she walked the gardens with her grandmother i wish youd stay here with us gran you and cecil jr needs me he lost a sister one he wasnt able to save from herself i lost a child her voice cracked i lost her long ago still no matter how you deny it theres always that stubborn hope that youll get it all back put it right now thats gone i dont know what to do for you youre doing it youre alive and youre happy she clung to torys hand she couldnt seem to stop holding stop touching we all have to make our peace with this in our own way iris drew in a steadying breath im going to bury her here in progress i think thats the way it should be she had some happy years here and well jr wants it i dont want a church service im holding against him on that well bury her day after tomorrow in the morning if jr wants it his minister can say a few words at the gravesite i wont blame you tory if you choose not to come of course ill come im glad iris lowered to a bench the fireflies were out bumping their lights against the dark funerals are for the living to help close a gap youll be better for it she drew tory down beside her im feeling my age honeypot dont say that oh itll pass i wont tolerate otherwise but tonight im feeling old and tired they say a parent isnt meant to outlive the child but nature and fate they decide whats meant we just live with it well all live with this tory i want to know youre going to take whats in front of you with both hands and hold it tight i am i will hopes sister knows how to do that im taking lessons i always liked that girl she mean to marry my wade i think he means to marry her and hes going to let her think it was her idea clever boy and a steady one hell keep her in line without bruising her wings im going to see both my grandchildren happy thats what im holding on to tight tory wade fought with the knot of his tie he hated the damned things every time he put one on it brought a flashback of his mother wearing an easter hat that looked like an overturned bowl of flowers strangling him into a bright blue tie to match his much hated bright blue suit hed been six and figured it had traumatized him for life you wore ties for weddings and you wore ties for funerals there was no getting around it even if you were lucky enough to have a profession that didnt require a goddamn noose around your neck every day of the week they were burying his aunt in an hour there was no getting around that either it was raining a thundering bitch of a storm funerals demanded lousy weather he figured just like they demanded ties and black crepe and overly sweetscented flowers hed have given a year of his life to have crawled back in bed pulled the covers over his head and let the entire mess happen without him maxine said shell be glad to look after the dogs faith announced she walked in dressed in the most dignified black dress she could find in her closet wade what have you done to that tie i tied it thats what you do with ties mauled its more like here let me see what i can do she plucked at it tugged twisted dont fuss it doesnt matter not if you want to go out looking like youve got a black goiter under your chin my greataunt harriet had goiters and they were not attractive just hold still a minute ive nearly got it just let it be faith he turned away from her to pick up his suit jacket i want you to stay here theres no point in your going out in this or in both of us being wet and miserable for the next couple of hours youve been through enough as it is she set down the purse shed just picked up you dont want me with you you should go on home she glanced at him then around the room her perfume was on his dresser her robe on the hook behind the door funny here i was thinking thats just where i was is that my mistake he took his wallet off the dresser stuffed it in his back pocket scooped up the loose change my aunts funeral is the last place you should be that doesnt answer my question but ill pose another why is your aunts funeral the last place i should be for christs sake faith put it together my aunt was married to the man who killed your sister and who might have killed you just two days ago if youve forgotten that i havent no i havent forgotten it she turned to the mirror and to keep her hands busy picked up her brush with every appearance of calm she ran it over her hair you know a lot of people probably most believe i dont have much more sense than a turnip green that im flighty and foolish and too shallow to stick to anything for longer than it takes to file my nails thats all right she set the brush down picked up her bottle of perfume and dabbed scent on her collarbone thats all right she repeated for most people but the funny thing is i expect you to think better of me i expect you to think better of me than i do myself i think considerable of you do you wade her eyes shifted and met his in the mirror do you really and at the same time you think you can put on that irritable attitude and buzz me off today maybe i should just go get my hair done while youre at your aunts funeral then the next time you have to deal with something difficult or uncomfortable ill go shopping and the time after that she continued her voice rising hardening ill just have moved on anyway so it wont be an issue this is different faith i thought it was she set the bottle down turned i hoped it was but if you dont want me with you today if you dont think i want to be with you today or have the belly for it then this is no different than what ive already done im not interested in repeating myself emotion stormed into his eyes raged through him until his hands were fists i hate this i hate seeing my father torn to pieces this way i hate knowing your familys been ripped again and that mine had a part in it i hate knowing you were in the same room with bodeen imagining what could have happened thats good because i hate all those things too and ill tell you something maybe you dont know as soon as it was over that day as soon as i started thinking again i wanted you you were the one person i needed with me i knew youd take care of me and hold on to me and everything would be all right if you dont need the same from me then i wont let myself need you either im selfish enough to stop ill go with you today and stand with you and try to be some comfort to you or ill go back to beaux reves and start working on getting over you you could do it too he said quietly why is it i admire that flighty foolish he shook his head as he walked to her youre the strongest woman i know stay with me he lowered his forehead to hers stay with me thats my plan she slipped her arms around him ran her hands up and down his back i want to be there for you thats new for me its your own fault you just kept at me till i was in love with you first time i havent aimed and shot first i kinda like it she held him felt him lean on her she liked that too she realized no one had ever leaned on her before now come on she spoke briskly kissed his cheek well be late and funerals arent the kind of occasions where you make grand entrances he had to laugh right got an umbrella of course not of course not let me get one when he went to the closet to root around she angled her head and studied him with a faint smile wade when we get engaged will you buy me a sapphire instead of a diamond his hand closed over the handle of the umbrella then simply froze there are we getting engaged a nice one not too big or gaudy mind square cut that first moron i was married to didnt even get me a ring and the second got me the tackiest diamond she picked up the black straw hat shed tossed on the bed and walked to the mirror to set it on her head at an appropriately dignified angle might as well have been a big hunk of glass for all the style it had i sold it after the divorce and had a lovely two weeks at a fancy spa on the proceeds so what id like is a squarecut sapphire he took the umbrella down stepped back out of the closet are you proposing faith certainly not she tipped back her head to look down her nose and dont think because im giving you some inclination of my response it gets you out of asking i expect you to follow tradition all the way down on one knee with she added a squarecut sapphire in your hand ill make a note of it fine you do that little thing she held out a hand ready i used to think i was he took her hand laced his fingers firmly with hers no ones ever ready for you they buried her mother in rain that pelted the ground like bullets while lightning ripped and clawed at the eastern sky violence tory thought her mother had lived with it died from it and even now it seemed drew it to her she didnt listen to the minister though she was sure his words were meant to comfort she felt too detached to need it and couldnt be sorry for it shed never known the woman inside the flowerdraped box never understood her never depended on her if tory had grief it was for the lack shed lived with all her life she watched the rain beat against the casket listened to it hammer on the umbrellas and waited for it to be over more had come than shed expected and stood in a small dark circle in the gloom she and her uncle flanked her grandmother with the sturdy cecil just behind them and cade stood beside her boots bless her easy heart wept quietly between her husband and son heads were bowed as prayers were read but faiths lifted and her eyes met torys and there was comfort so unexpected from someone who understood dwight had come as mayor tory supposed and as wades friend he stood a little apart looking solemn and respectful she imagined hed be glad to be done with this duty and get back to lissy there was lilah steady as a rock eyes dry as she silently mouthed the prayers with the minister and oddly cades aunt rosie in full black complete with hat and veil it had caught everyone off guard when shed arrived with a trunk the night before margaret was staying temporarily at her place shed announced which meant rosie had immediately packed to stay temporarily elsewhere shed offered tory her mothers wedding dress gone yellow as butter with age and smelling strongly of mothballs then had put it on herself and worn it the rest of the evening when the casket was lowered into the fresh grave and the minister closed his book jr stepped forward she had a harder life than she needed to he cleared his throat and a harder death than she deserved shes at peace now when she was a little girl she liked yellow daisies best he kissed the one he held in his hand then dropped it into the grave and turned away to his wife hed have done more for her iris said if shed let him im going to visit jimmy awhile she told tory then well be going home she took torys shoulders kissed her cheeks im happy for you tory and proud kincade you take care of my little girl yes maam i hope youll come and stay with us both of you when you come back to progress cecil bent down to touch his lips to torys cheek ill look after her he whispered dont you worry i wont she turned knowing she was expected to receive condolences rosie was right there her eyes birdbright behind her veil it was a proper service dignified and brief it reflects well on you thank you miss rosie we cant choose our blood but we can choose what to do with it what to do about it she tipped up her face looked at her nephew youve chosen well margaret will come around or she wont but thats not for you to worry about im going to talk to iris find out who that big strapping man is shes got with her she plowed through the wet in a twothousanddollar chanel suit and birkenstocks struggling against twin urges to laugh and weep tory laid a hand on cades arm go take her your umbrella ill be fine ill be right back tory im very sorry dwight held out a hand and clasping hers kissed her cheek even as he shifted his umbrella to shield her from the rain lissy wanted to come but i made her stay home im glad you did it wouldnt be good for her to be out in this weather today it was kind of you to come dwight weve known each other a long time and wade hes one of my two closest friends tory is there anything i can do for you no but thank you im going to walk over and visit hopes grave before i leave you should go on back to lissy i will take this he brought her hand up to the handle of the umbrella no ill be fine take it he insisted and dont stay out in the wet too long he left her to walk back to wade grateful for the shelter tory turned away from her mothers grave to walk through the grass through the stones to hopes rain ran down the angels face like tears and beat at the fairy roses inside the globe the winged horse flew its all over now it doesnt feel settled yet tory said with a sigh i have this heaviness inside me well its so much to take in at once i wish i could there are too many things to wish for i never bring flowers here faith said from behind her i dont know why she has the roses thats not it theyre not my roses not mine to bring her tory looked behind her then shifted so they were standing together i cant feel her here maybe you cant either i dont want to go in the ground when my time comes i want my ashes spread somewhere the sea i think as thats where i plan to have wade ask me to marry him by the sea she might have felt the same only hers would have been for the river or near it in the marsh that was her place yes it was it is it seemed important and natural to reach out a hand and clasp faiths there are flowers at beaux reves that was her place too i could cut some when the storm passes take them to the marsh to the river put them there for hope maybe it would be the right way laying flowers on the water instead of letting them die on the ground would you do that with me i hated sharing her with you faith paused closed her eyes now i dont itll be clear this afternoon ill tell wade she started to walk away stopped tory if you get there firstвђ ill wait for you tory watched her go looked back over the gentle slope the curtaining rain the gathering ground fog there was her grandmother with cecil strong at her back rosie in her veil and lilah holding an umbrella over her jr and boots still by the grave of the sister he had loved more than he might have realized and there was cade with his friends waiting as she walked to him the rain began to thin and the first hint of sun shimmered watery light through the gloom you understand why i want to do this i understand you want to tory smiled a little as she shook rain from the spears of lavender shed cut and youre annoyed just a little that im not asking you to come with me a little its counterbalanced by the fact that you and faith are becoming friends and all of that is overpowered by the sheer terror of knowing im going to be at aunt rosies mercy until you return she has a gift for me and ive seen it its a moldy top hat which she expects i will wear for our wedding itll go well with the motheaten dress shes giving me i tell you what you wear the hat ill wear the dress and well have lilah take our picture well put it in a nice frame for miss rosie then well pack them away someplace dark and safe before the wedding thats brilliant im marrying a very wise woman but well have to take the picture tonight were getting married tomorrow tomorrow butвђ here he said as he turned her into his arm quietly in the garden ive taken care of most of the details and will get to the rest this afternoon but my grandmotherвђ i spoke with her she and cecil will be staying another night theyll be here i havent had time to buy a dress orвђ your grandmother mentioned that and hoped youd be receptive to wearing the one she wore when she married your grandfather shes running up to florence to get it this afternoon she said it would mean a lot to her thought of everything didnt you yes do you have a problem with that were going to have lots of problems with that over the next fifty or sixty years but just now no good lilahs baking a cake jrs bringing a case of champagne the idea brightened him considerably thank you since youre grateful ill just add aunt rosie plans to sing dont tell me she drew back lets not spoil the moment well since everyone has approved the schedule and the details who am i to object have you arranged for the honeymoon too she saw him wince and rolled her eyes cade really youre not going to argue about a trip to paris are you of course not he gave her a quick kiss before she could you might want to close the shop for a few days but boots really liked the idea of running it for you and faith had some ideas oh god but thats up to you thank you very much she pushed a hand through her hair my heads spinning well discuss all this when i get back sure im flexible the hell you are she muttered you just pretend to be she shifted the basket of flowers handed him the shears dont start naming the children while im gone exasperating man she thought as she slid into her car and set the basket of flowers on the seat planning their wedding behind her back planning exactly the sort of wedding she wanted too how irritating and how lovely to be known that well so why wasnt she relaxed as she turned onto the road she shifted her shoulders she just couldnt quite break through the tension understandable she reminded herself shed been through a hideous ordeal she couldnt imagine getting married within twentyfour hours with so much still tied up inside her but she wanted to begin she wanted to close this door and open the next she glanced at the flowers beside her maybe she was about to she pulled off onto the side of the road where hope had once parked her bike and climbing out she crossed the little bridge where tiger lilies burst into storybook bloom then took the path she knew her friend had taken that night hope lavelle girl spy the rain had turned to steam and the steam rose out of the ground in curling fingers that broke apart then twined together again around her ankles the air was thick with wet with green with rot mysteries waiting to be solved as she approached the clearing she wished shed thought to bring some wood everything would be too damp to start a fire and perhaps it was foolish to want to in all the heat but she wished shed thought of it and could have laid one the way hope had just thinking of it remembering it she caught a drift of smoke there was the fire small and carefully built to burn low a little circle of flame with long sharpened sticks beside it waiting for marshmallows she blinked once to clear the vision but the fire simmered and the smoke puffed sluggishly in the mist dazed tory stepped into the clearing the basket tipping to spill out flowers at her feet hope she pressed a hand to her heart almost to make sure it continued to beat but the marble child whod been her friend stood in her pool of flowers and said nothing with a trembling hand she picked up one of the sticks and saw that the cuts to sharpen it were fresh not a dream not a flashback but here and now real not hope never again hope the pressure rose up in her a hot gush of fear and of knowledge in the brush came a rustling wet and sly she whirled toward it password she thought it heard it sound in her head but she wasnt hope she wasnt eight and dear god it wasnt over after all cade was in the garden deciding where they should set up tables for the wedding reception when chief russ pulled in glad youre here i just got news i thought you should know come on inside where its cool no i gotta get back but i wanted to tell you in person we got ballistic reports on sarabeth bodeen the gun she was killed with wasnt the same one bodeen had with him not even the same caliber cade felt one quick knock of dread im not sure i understand turns out the one bodeen had when he broke in on tory and your sister was stolen from a house about fifteen miles south of here on the morning torys mother was killed house was broken into between nine and ten am that same day how can that be only way it could be is if bodeen spouted wings and flew down here from darlington county or if somebody else put those bullets in miz bodeen carl d cupped a hand over his chin rubbed it hard his eyes burned with fatigue ive been in touch with those federals and im piecing it together the phone records show miz bodeen got a call just after two that morning from the pay phone outside the winndixie north of town here now we were figuring that wouldve been bodeen calling her from here telling her he was coming for her thats fine as far as it goes but it dont fit when you add the rest it had to be bodeen calling her why else would she have packed up i cant say but youve got him calling from here at round about two in the morning getting up there doing the shooting between five and fivethirty then heading back here and moving south another fifteen miles breaking into a house and stealing a gun a bottle and some leftover supper now why would the man be zigzagging back and forth thataway he was crazy i wont argue with that but being crazy doesnt make him able to all but break land and speed records in one morning specially since it doesnt look like he had any kind of vehicle now im not saying it couldnt be done im saying it dont make sense what kind of sense does it make otherwise who else would have killed torys mother i cant answer that i gotta work with facts here he had the wrong gun we got nothing to show the man had a car now could be well find one yet and the gun that he used on his wife that could be he took his handkerchief out of his pocket wiped the back of his neck but it appears to me if bodeen didnt do those murders up in darlington county maybe he didnt kill anyone that means whoever did is still walking free i was hoping to have a talk with tory shes not here shesвђ white hot fear burned through his belly shes gone to hope tory opened herself tried to feel him gauge him but all she saw was dark cold blank dark the rustling moved in a circle a taunting she turned with it even as the saliva dried up in her mouth she turned to face it headon which of us did you want that night or did it matter it was never you why would i want you she was beautiful she was a child true dwight stepped out in the clearing but so was i it broke her heart one quick snap you were cades friend sure cade and wade like twins themselves rich and privileged and handsome and i was their chubby little token dwight the dweeb well i fooled them all didnt i hed have been twelve she thought staring at the easy smile on his face no more than twelve years old why call it a rite of passage they were always first one or the other of them always first in everything i was going to be the first one to have a girl amusementвђit couldnt be anything but amusementвђdanced in his eyes not that could brag on it kinda like being batman oh god dwight hard for you to see that you being a female well call it a guy thing i had a bad itch why shouldnt it have been my good friend cades precious sister i used to scratch it he spoke so calmly so casually that the birds continued to sing liquid notes that ran like tears i didnt know i was going to kill her that just happened id snuck some of my daddys whiskey drink like a man you know my mind was a little fuzzy you were only twelve how could you want such a thing he circled the clearing not really coming closer just stalking a patient anticipatory cat and mouse i used to watch the two of you skinnydipping or sprawled out here on your bellies telling secrets sod your old man he said with a grin you might say i was inspired by him he wanted you your old man wanted to fuck you all right but he didnt have the guts i was better than him better than any of them i proved it that night i was a man that night town mayor proud father devoted husband loyal friend what kind of madness could hide so well you raped and murdered a child that made you a man all my life i heard be a man dwight the amusement died out of his eyes so they turned cold and blank for christs sake be a man cant be a man if youre a virgin can you and no girl would look twice at me i fixed that that night changed my life look at me now he spread his arms stepped closer watching her i got confidence got myself in shape and didnt i end up with the prettiest girl in progress i got respect a beautiful wife a son i got position it all started that night all those other girls why not you cant imagine what its likeвђor maybe you can yeah maybe you can you know how to feel it dont you their fear while its happening im the most important person in the world to them i am the world to them theres a hell of a kick to that she thought of running the idea whipped in and out of her mind and she saw the gleam in his eyes saw he was waiting for her to do just that deliberately she slowed her breathing opened herself there was the blankness again like a pit but around the edges was a kind of ugly hunger recognizing it anticipating it was the only weapon she had you didnt even know them dwight they were strangers to you i just imagine theyre hope and its that first night all over again theyre nothing but tramps and losers until i make them into her it wasnt the same with sherry i didnt want to wait he shrugged lissy isnt much on sex these days cant blame her and that sexy little teacher she wanted it wanted it from wade though stupid bitch well she got it from me she wasnt quite right though not quite faiths perfect he saw tory jolt yeah youve gotten pretty tight with faith

into going over to see her and i know my girl shell keep faith occupied just long enough theyll know this time dwight you wont be able to pass it off on someone else your father sure did cooperate didnt he did i mention i was the one who killed your mother gave her a call told her i was a friend and her loving husband was on his way to get her it just seemed like a nice touch one that kept the cops on his ass and let me sit back and watch with my concernedmayor attitude she was nothing to you none of them was except hope and dont you worry about me nobodyll look to me im an upstanding citizen and right now im out at the mall buying a teddy bear for my unborn child a big yellow bear lissys just going to love it i could never really feel you she murmured because theres nothing there to feel youre almost blank inside i wondered about that gave me some bad moments i took your hand today a kind of test just to see you got nothing from me but youre going to feel me before were done why dont you run the way she did you know how she ran and called out ill give you a chance no ill give myself one without an instants hesitation she stabbed out with the stick aiming for his eye when he screamed she ran as hope had done the moss tangled in her hair slithering spider legs and the ground sucked greedily at her feet her shoes slithered tearing through soaked ferns as she batted viciously at branches she saw as hope had seen the two images blending into one hot summer night merging with steamy afternoon and felt as hope had felt with her own fear and rage leaping just ahead of the childhood terror she heard as hope had heard the footsteps pounding behind her the thrashing through the brush it was the rage that stopped her that made her turn before the intent was clear in her mind it seared through her black as pitch as she charged him with teeth and claws stunned by the sudden attack half blind from the blood he went down beneath her howling as she sank her teeth into his shoulder he struck out felt the blow connect but she clung like a burr raking her nails down his face none of the others had been able to fight him but she would god she would i am tory the words were a battle cry ringing in her ears she was tory and she would fight even when his hands closed around her throat she tore at him when her vision grayed when she was gasping for air she used her fists someone was shouting her name wild desperate calls that echoed inside the roar of blood in her head she clawed at the hands around her throat choking when the grip loosened i feel you now fear and pain now you know now you know you bastard she was being lifted away and she fought mindlessly her gaze locked on dwights face blood ran from his eye and his cheeks were ripped from her hands now you know now you know tory stop stop look at me his face white and running with sweat cade held hers until her eyes cleared he killed her it was always him i never saw it hes hated you his whole life hes hated all of you youre hurt no im not its his blood cade my god she went crazy coughing dwight rolled to his side struggled up to hands and knees it felt as if he were bleeding from a thousand wounds his right eye was a burning coal but his mind worked and worked fast and cool she thought i was her father liar rage bloomed again and had her struggling wildly against cade he killed hope he was waiting here for me killed hope blood dripped from his torn mouth as dwight sank back on his knees that was almost twenty years ago shes sick cade anybody could see shes sick jesus my eye you have to help me he tried to get to his feet and was genuinely shocked when his legs wouldnt hold him for gods sake cade call an ambulance im going to lose my fucking eye you knew they came here cade kept torys arms pinned as he studied the ravaged face of his old friend you knew they snuck out at night to come in here i told you myself we laughed about it what does that have to do with anything dwights good eye wheeled as he heard the slash of wet branches carl d panting with the effort pushed through the brush thank christ chief call an ambulance tory had some kind of breakdown look what she did to me sweet jesus christ carl d muttered as he hurried forward to dwights side he wanted me to run but ive stopped running tory stopped struggling and lay a hand over cades as carl d crouched to tie his handkerchief over dwights ruined eye he killed hope and the others he killed my mother i tell you shes crazy dwight shouted he couldnt see goddamn it he couldnt see his teeth began to chatter she cant face what her father did well get you to the hospital dwight then well sort this all out carl d looked over at tory are you hurt no im not hurt you dont want to believe me you dont want to believe what he is has been living side by side with you all these years but it has it found a way she shifted met cades eyes im sorry i dont want to believe you either but i do i know it and drawing on that she got to her feet the gun he killed my mother with is in the attic of his house up in the rafters on the south side gently she rubbed a hand over her throat where the violence of his fingers left their mark you made a mistake dwight letting me in that far getting that close shouldve been more careful with your thoughts shes lying she planted it there herself shes crazy he stumbled as carl d pulled him to his feet cade weve been friends all our lives you have to believe me theres something you have to believe cade told him if id gotten here sooner youd be dead now you believe that and you remember it you gotta come on with me now dwight carl d snapped cuffs over his wrists whatre you doing what the hell are you doing youre taking the word of a crazy woman over mine that gun isnt where she said or it doesnt match what was used to kill a young police officer and a helpless woman ill give you a big apology come on with me miss tory you best go on to the hospital yourself no she wiped the blood off her mouth with the back of her hand i havent done what i came to do you go ahead carl d told them ill take care of this miss tory ill be by later to see you shes crazy dwight screamed it kept screaming it as carl d pulled him away hes insulted with a shaky laugh tory pressed her fingers to her eyes thats the primary emotion running through him right now insult that he would be treated like a criminal its even bigger than the hate and the hunger step back from him cade demanded dont look at him youre right cade youre right second time i almost lost you ill be damned if itll ever happen again you believed me tory murmured i could feel how it hurt you but you believed me i cant tell you what that means she put her arms around him held tight you loved him im so sorry i didnt even know him and still cade grieved if i could go backвђ we cant ive spent a lot of time learning that your face is bruised he turned his lips to it his is worse she leaned her head against his shoulder as they began to walk i was running and i was going to keep on running then all at once there was this life inside me this rage of life he wasnt going to win he wasnt going to chase me like a fox after a rabbit for once he was going to know what it was like he was going to know he would never get the picture completely out of his head cade knew of tory her face bruised and bloody tearing like a cat at dwight and his hands around her throat hell keep denying cade said hell hire lawyers but it wont matter in the end it wont matter what he does no i think you can depend on agent williams to tie it all up poor lissy she sighed what will she do tory stopped in the clearing to gather the fallen flowers the fire had burned down to sputters and the light watery streams of it slanted through the trees ill come back and do this another time with faith this time is for you and me together they walked to the banks of the river we loved her and well always remember her tory tossed flowers on the water but its over now finally ive waited so long to say goodbye she had tears in her yet but they were quiet and they were healing they glimmered on her cheeks as she turned to cade id like to marry you in the garden tomorrow and wear my grandmothers dress he took her hand kissed it would you yes i would yes i very much would and id like to go to paris with you and sit at a table in the sunlight and drink wine make love with you when the suns coming up then i want to come back here and build a life with you were already building one he drew her close the sun shimmered in thin beams and moss dripped with rain flowers bright blossoms floated silently down the river
