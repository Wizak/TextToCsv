masterpieces of mystery in four volumes foreword the ghost story is as old as human speech and perhaps even antedates it a nave acceptance of the supernatural was unquestionably one of the primal attributes of human intelligence the ghost story may thus quite conceivably be the first form of tale ever invented it makes its appearance comparatively early in the annals of literature who that has read it is likely to forget plinys account in a letter to an intimate of an apparition shortly after death to a mutual acquaintance old books of tales and legends are full of the ghost story it has persisted throughout the ages it began to attain some real standing in literature to take its definite place a little more than a century ago like the apparition it embodies it had always been and is still today even more or less discredited mrs radcliffe gave it a new being and even a certain dignity in her castle of otranto and after her came sir walter scott who frankly surrendered to the power and charm of the theme the line of succession has been continuous the ghost has held his own with his human fellow in fiction and his tale has been told with increasing skill as the art of the writer has developed today the case for the ghost as an element in fiction is an exceedingly strong one there has indeed sprung into being within a couple of decades a new school of such writers nowadays almost every fictionist of account produces one good thriller at least of this sort the temptation is irresistible for the simple reason that the theme imposes absolutely no limit on the imagination the reader will find here a careful selection illustrating the growth in art of this exotic in literature during the past fifty years and for a contrast spanning the centuries the nave narration of

masterpieces of mystery masterpieces of mystery ghost stories the listenera algernon blackwood sept i have hunted all over london for rooms suited to my income a year and have at last found them two rooms without modern conveniences it is true and in an old ramshackle building but within a stones throw of p place and in an eminently respectable street the rent is only a year i had begun to despair when at last i found them by chance the chance was a mere chance and unworthy of record i had to sign a lease for a year and i did so willingly the furniture from our old place in h shire which has been stored so long will just suit them oct here i am in my two rooms in the centre of london and not far from the offices of the periodicals where occasionally i dispose of an article or two the building is at the end of a culdesac the alley is well paved and clean and lined chiefly with the backs of sedate and institutionallooking buildings there is a stable in it my own house is dignified with the title of chambers i feel as if one day the honour must prove too much for it and it will swell with pride and fall asunder it is very old the floor of my sittingroom has valleys and low hills on it and the top of the door slants away from the ceiling with a glorious disregard of what is usual they must have quarrelled fifty years ago and have been going apart ever since oct my landlady is old and thin with a faded dusty face she is uncommunicative the few words she utters seem to cost her pain probably her lungs are half choked with dust she keeps my rooms as free from this commodity as possible and has the assistance of a strong girl who brings up the breakfast and lights the fire as i have said already she is not communicative in reply to pleasant efforts on my part she informed me briefly that i was the only occupant of the house at present my rooms had not been occupied for some years there had been other gentlemen upstairs but they had left she never looks straight at me when she speaks but fixes her dim eyes on my middle waistcoat button till i get nervous and begin to think it isnt on straight or is the wrong sort of button altogether oct my weeks book is nicely kept and so far is reasonable milk and sugar d bread d butter d marmalade d eggs s d laundress s d oil d attendance s total s d the landlady has a son who she told me is somethink on a homnibus he comes occasionally to see her i think he drinks for he talks very loud regardless of the hour of the day or night and tumbles about over the furniture downstairs all the morning i sit indoors writing articles verses for the comic papers a novel ive been at for three years and concerning which i have dreams a childrens book in which the imagination has free rein and another book which is to last as long as myself since it is an honest record of my souls advance or retreat in the struggle of life besides these i keep a book of poems which i use as a safety valve and concerning which i have no dreams whatsoever between the lot i am always occupied in the afternoons i generally try to take a walk for my healths sake through regents park into kensington gardens or farther afield to hampstead heath oct everything went wrong today i have two eggs for breakfast this morning one of them was bad i rang the bell for emily when she came in i was reading the paper and without looking up i said eggs bad oh is it sir she said ill get another one and went out taking the egg with her i waited my breakfast for her return which was in five minutes she put the new egg on the table and went away but when i looked down i saw that she had taken away the good egg and left the bad one all green and yellow in the slop basin i rang again youve taken the wrong egg i said oh she exclaimed i thought the one i took down didnt smell so very bad in due time she returned with the good egg and i resumed my breakfast with two eggs but less appetite it was all very trivial to be sure but so stupid that i felt annoyed the character of that egg influenced everything i did i wrote a bad article and tore it up i got a bad headache i used bad words to myself everything was bad so i chucked work and went for a long walk i dined at a cheap chophouse on my way back and reached home about nine oclock rain was just beginning to fall as i came in and the wind was rising it promised an ugly night the alley looked dismal and dreary and the hall of the house as i passed through it felt chilly as a tomb it was the first stormy night i had experienced in my new quarters the draughts were awful they came crisscross met in the middle of the room and formed eddies and whirlpools and cold silent currents that almost lifted the hair of my head i stuffed up the sashes of the windows with neckties and odd socks and sat over the smoky fire to keep warm first i tried to write but found it too cold my hand turned to ice on the paper what tricks the wind did play with the old place it came rushing up the forsaken alley with a sound like the feet of a hurrying crowd of people who stopped suddenly at the door i felt as if a lot of curious folk had arranged themselves just outside and were staring up at my windows then they took to their heels again and fled whispering and laughing down the lane only however to return with the next gust of wind and repeat their impertinence on the other side of my room a single square window opens into a sort of shaft or well that measures about six feet across to the back wall of another house down this funnel the wind dropped and puffed and shouted such noises i never heard before between these two entertainments i sat over the fire in a greatcoat listening to the deep booming in the chimney it was like being in a ship at sea and i almost looked for the floor to rise in undulations and rock to and fro oct i wish i were not quite so lonely and so poor and yet i love both my loneliness and my poverty the former makes me appreciate the companionship of the wind and rain while the latter preserves my liver and prevents me wasting time in dancing attendance upon women poor illdressed men are not acceptable attendants my parents are dead and my only sister is no not dead exactly but married to a very rich man they travel most of the time he to find his health she to lose herself through sheer neglect on her part she has long passed out of my life the door closed when after an absolute silence of five years she sent me a cheque for at christmas it was signed by her husband i returned it to her in a thousand pieces and in an unstamped envelope so at least i had the satisfaction of knowing that it cost her something she wrote back with a broad quill pen that covered a whole page with three lines you are evidently as cracked as ever and rude and ungrateful into the bargain it had always been my special terror lest the insanity in my fathers family should leap across the generations and appear in me this thought haunted me and she knew it so after this little exchange of civilities the door slammed never to open again i heard the crash it made and with it the falling from the walls of my heart of many little bits of china with their own peculiar value rare china some of it that only needed dusting the same walls too carried mirrors in which i used sometimes to see reflected the misty lawns of childhood the daisy chains the windtorn blossoms scattered through the orchard by warm rains the robbers cave in the long walk and the hidden store of apples in the hayloft she was my inseparable companion then but when the door slammed the mirrors cracked across their entire length and the visions they held vanished for ever now i am quite alone at forty one cannot begin all over again to build up careful friendships and all others are comparatively worthless oct my bedroom is by it is below the level of the front room and a step leads down into it both rooms are very quiet on calm nights for there is no traffic down this forsaken alleyway in spite of the occasional larks of the wind it is a most sheltered strip at its upper end below my windows all the cats of the neighbourhood congregate as soon as darkness gathers they lie undisturbed on the long ledge of a blind window of the opposite building for after the postman has come and gone at no footsteps ever dare to interrupt their sinister conclave no step but my own or sometimes the unsteady footfall of the son who is somethink on a homnibus oct i dined at an a b c shop on poached eggs and coffee and then went for a stroll round the outer edge of regents park it was ten oclock when i got home i counted no less than thirteen cats all of a dark colour crouching under the lee side of the alley walls it was a cold night and the stars shone like points of ice in a blueblack sky the cats turned their heads and stared at me in silence as i passed an odd sensation of shyness took possession of me under the glare of so many pairs of unblinking eyes as i fumbled with the latchkey they jumped noiselessly down and pressed against my legs as if anxious to be let in but i slammed the door in their faces and ran quickly upstairs the front room as i entered to grope for the matches felt as cold as a stone vault and the air held an unusual dampness oct for several days i have been working on a ponderous article that allows no play for the fancy my imagination requires a judicious rein i am afraid to let it loose for it carries me sometimes into appalling places beyond the stars and beneath the world no one realizes the danger more than i do but what a foolish thing to write here for there is no one to know no one to realize my mind of late has held unusual thoughts thoughts i have never had before about medicines and drugs and the treatment of strange illnesses i cannot imagine their source at no time in my life have i dwelt upon such ideas as now constantly throng my brain i have had no exercise lately for the weather has been shocking and all my afternoons have been spent in the readingroom of the british museum where i have a readers ticket i have made an unpleasant discovery there are rats in the house at night from my bed i have heard them scampering across the hills and valleys of the front room and my sleep has been a good deal disturbed in consequence oct last night the son who is somethink on a homnibus came in he had evidently been drinking for i heard loud and angry voices below in the kitchen long after i had gone to bed once too i caught the singular words rising up to me through the floor burning from top to bottom is the only thing thatll ever make this ouse right i knocked on the floor and the voices ceased suddenly though later i again heard their clamour in my dreams these rooms are very quiet almost too quiet sometimes on windless nights they are silent as the grave and the house might be miles in the country the roar of londons traffic reaches me only in heavy distant vibrations it holds an ominous note sometimes like that of an approaching army or an immense tidalwave very far away thundering in the night oct mrs monson though admirably silent is a foolish fussy woman she does such stupid things in dusting the room she puts all my things in the wrong places the ashtrays which should be on the writingtable she sets in a silly row on the mantelpiece the pentray which should be beside the inkstand she hides away cleverly among the books on my readingdesk my gloves she arranges daily in idiotic array upon a halffilled bookshelf and i always have to rearrange them on the low table by the door she places my armchair at impossible angles between the fire and the light and the tablecloth the one with trinity hall stains she puts on the table in such a fashion that when i look at it i feel as if my tie and all my clothes were on crooked and awry she exasperates me her very silence and meekness are irritating sometimes i feel inclined to throw the inkstand at her just to bring an expression into her watery eyes and a squeak from those colourless lips dear me what violent expressions i am making use of how very foolish of me and yet it almost seems as if the words were not my own but had been spoken into my ear i mean i never make use of such terms naturally oct i have been here a month the place does not agree with me i think my headaches are more frequent and violent and my nerves are a perpetual source of discomfort and annoyance i have conceived a great dislike for mrs monson a feeling i am certain she reciprocates somehow the impression comes frequently to me that there are goings on in this house of which i know nothing and which she is careful to hide from me last night her son slept in the house and this morning as i was standing at the window i saw him go out he glanced up and caught my eye it was a loutish figure and a singularly repulsive face that i saw and he gave me the benefit of a very unpleasant leer at least so i imagined nov the utter stillness of this house is beginning to oppress me i wish there were other fellows living upstairs no footsteps ever sound overhead and no tread ever passes my door to go up the next flight of stairs i am beginning to feel some curiosity to go up myself and see what the upper rooms are like i feel lonely here and isolated swept into a deserted corner of the world and forgotten once i actually caught myself gazing into the long cracked mirrors trying to see the sunlight dancing beneath the trees in the orchard but only deep shadows seemed to congregate there now and i soon desisted it has been very dark all day and no wind stirring the fogs have begun i had to use a readinglamp all this morning there was no cart to be heard today i actually missed it this morning in the gloom and silence i think i could almost have welcomed it after all the sound is a very human one and this empty house at the end of the alley holds other noises that are not quite so satisfactory i have never once seen a policeman in the lane and the postmen always hurry out with no evidence of a desire to loiter pm as i write this i hear no sound but the deep murmur of the distant traffic and the low sighing of the wind the two sounds melt into one another now and again a cat raises its shrill uncanny cry upon the darkness the cats are always there under my windows when the darkness falls the wind is dropping into the funnel with a noise like the sudden sweeping of immense distant wings it is a dreary night i feel lost and forgotten nov from my windows i can see arrivals when anyone comes to the door i can just see the hat and shoulders and the hand on the bell only two fellows have been to see me since i came here two months ago both of them i saw from the window before they came up and heard their voices asking if i was in neither of them ever came back i have finished the ponderous article on reading it through however i was dissatisfied with it and drew my pencil through almost every page there were strange expressions and ideas in it that i could not explain and viewed with amazement not to say alarm they did not sound like my very own and i could not remember having written them can it be that my memory is beginning to be affected my pens are never to be found that stupid old woman puts them in a different place each day i must give her due credit for finding so many new hiding places such ingenuity is wonderful i have told her repeatedly but she always says ill speak to emily sir emily always says ill tell mrs monson sir their foolishness makes me irritable and scatters all my thoughts i should like to stick the lost pens into them and turn them out blindeyed to be scratched and mauled by those thousand hungry cats whew what a ghastly thought where in the world did it come from such an idea is no more my own than it is the policemans yet i felt i had to write it it was like a voice singing in my head and my pen wouldnt stop till the last word was finished what ridiculous nonsense i must and will restrain myself i must take more regular exercise my nerves and liver plague me horribly nov i attended a curious lecture in the french quarter on death but the room was so hot and i was so weary that i fell asleep the only part i heard however touched my imagination vividly speaking of suicides the lecturer said that selfmurder was no escape from the miseries of the present but only a preparation of greater sorrow for the future suicides he declared cannot shirk their responsibilities so easily they must return to take up life exactly where they laid it so violently down but with the added pain and punishment of their weakness many of them wander the earth in unspeakable misery till they can reclothe themselves in the body of some one else generally a lunatic or weakminded person who cannot resist the hideous obsession this is their only means of escape surely a weird and horrible idea i wish i had slept all the time and not heard it at all my mind is morbid enough without such ghastly fancies such mischievous propaganda should be stopped by the police ill write to the times and suggest it good idea i walked home through greek street soho and imagined that a hundred years had slipped back into place and de quincey was still there haunting the night with invocations to his just subtle and mighty drug his vast dreams seemed to hover not very far away once started in my brain the pictures refused to go away and i saw him sleeping in that cold tenantless mansion with the strange little waif who was afraid of its ghosts both together in the shadows under a single horsemans cloak or wandering in the companionship of the spectral anne or later still on his way to the eternal rendezvous she never was able to keep what an unutterable gloom what an untold horror of sorrow and suffering comes over me as i try to realize something of what that man boy he then was must have taken into his lonely heart as i came up the alley i saw a light in the top window and a head and shoulders thrown in an exaggerated shadow upon the blind i wondered what the son could be doing up there at such an hour nov this morning while writing some one came up the creaking stairs and knocked cautiously at my door thinking it was the landlady i said come in the knock was repeated and i cried louder come in come in but no one turned the handle and i continued my writing with a vexed well stay out then under my breath went on writing i tried to but my thoughts had suddenly dried up at their source i could not set down a single word it was a dark yellowfog morning and there was little enough inspiration in the air as it was but that stupid woman standing just outside my door waiting to be told again to come in roused a spirit of vexation that filled my head to the exclusion of all else at last i jumped up and opened the door myself what do you want and why in the world dont you come in i cried out but the words dropped into empty air there was no one there the fog poured up the dingy staircase in deep yellow coils but there was no sign of a human being anywhere i slammed the door with imprecations upon the house and its noises and went back to my work a few minutes later emily came in with a letter were you or mrs monson outside a few minutes ago knocking at my door no sir are you sure mrs monsons gone to market and theres no one but me and the child in the ole ouse and ive been washing the dishes for the last hour sir i fancied the girls face turned a shade paler she fidgeted toward the door with a glance over her shoulder wait emily i said and then told her what i had heard she stared stupidly at me though her eyes shifted now and then over the articles in the room who was it i asked when i had come to the end mrs monson says its honly mice she said as if repeating a learned lesson mice i exclaimed its nothing of the sort someone was feeling about outside my door who was it is the son in the house her whole manner changed suddenly and she became earnest instead of evasive she seemed anxious to tell the truth oh no sir theres no one in the house at all but you and me and the child and there couldnt have been nobody at your door as for them knocks she stopped abruptly as though she had said too much well what about the knocks i said more gently of course she stammered the knocks isnt mice nor the footsteps neither but then again she came to a full halt anything wrong with the house lor no sir the drains is splendid i dont mean drains girl i mean did anything anything bad ever happen here she flushed up to the roots of her hair and then turned suddenly pale again she was obviously in considerable distress and there was something she was anxious yet afraid to tell some forbidden thing she was not allowed to mention i dont mind what it was only i should like to know i said encouragingly raising her frightened eyes to my face she began to blurt out something about that which appened once to a gentleman that lived hupstairs when a shrill voice calling her name sounded below emily emily it was the returning landlady and the girl tumbled downstairs as if pulled backward by a rope leaving me full of conjectures as to what in the world could have happened to a gentleman upstairs that could in so curious a manner affect my ears downstairs nov i have done capital work have finished the ponderous article and had it accepted for the review and another one ordered i feel well and cheerful and have had regular exercise and good sleep no headaches no nerves no liver those pills the chemist recommended are wonderful even the grayfaced landlady rouses pity in me i am sorry for her so worn so weary so oddly put together just like the building she looks as if she had once suffered some shock of terror and was momentarily dreading another when i spoke to her today very gently about not putting the pens in the ashtray and the gloves on the bookshelf she raised her faint eyes to mine for the first time and said with the ghost of a smile ill try and remember sir i felt inclined to pat her on the back and say come cheer up and be jolly lifes not so bad after all oh i am much better theres nothing like open air and success and good sleep they build up as if by magic the portions of the heart eaten down by despair and unsatisfied yearnings even to the cats i feel friendly when i came in at eleven oclock tonight they followed me to the door in a stream and i stooped down to stroke the one nearest to me bah the brute hissed and spat and struck at me with her paws the claw caught my hand and drew blood in a thin line the others danced sideways into the darkness screeching as though i had done them an injury i believe these cats really hate me perhaps they are only waiting to be reinforced then they will attack me ha ha in spite of the momentary annoyance this fancy sent me laughing upstairs to my room the fire was out and the room seemed unusually cold as i groped my way over to the mantelpiece to find the matches i realized all at once that there was another person standing beside me in the darkness i could of course see nothing but my fingers feeling along the ledge came into forcible contact with something that was at once withdrawn it was cold and moist i could have sworn it was somebodys hand my flesh began to creep instantly whos that i exclaimed in a loud voice my voice dropped into the silence like a pebble into a deep well there was no answer but at the same moment i heard someone moving away from me across the room in the direction of the door it was a confused sort of footstep and the sound of garments brushing the furniture on the way the same second my hand stumbled upon the matchbox and i struck a light i expected to see mrs monson or emily or perhaps the son who is something on an omnibus but the flare of the gas jet illumined an empty room there was not a sign of a person anywhere i felt the hair stir upon my head and instinctively i backed up against the wall lest something should approach me from behind i was distinctly alarmed but the next minute i recovered myself the door was open on to the landing and i crossed the room not without some inward trepidation and went out the light from the room fell upon the stairs but there was no one to be seen anywhere nor was there any sound on the creaking wooden staircase to indicate a departing creature i was in the act of turning to go in again when a sound overhead caught my ear it was a very faint sound not unlike the sigh of wind yet it could not have been the wind for the night was still as the grave though it was not repeated i resolved to go upstairs and see for myself what it all meant two senses had been affected touch and hearing and i could not believe that i had been deceived so with a lighted candle i went stealthily forth on my unpleasant journey into the upper regions of this queer little old house on the first landing there was only one door and it was locked on the second there was also only one door but when i turned the handle it opened there came forth to meet me the chill musty air that is characteristic of a long unoccupied room with it there came an indescribable odour i use the adjective advisedly though very faint diluted as it were it was nevertheless an odour that made my gorge rise i had never smelt anything like it before and i cannot describe it the room was small and square close under the roof with a sloping ceiling and two tiny windows it was cold as the grave without a shred of carpet or a stick of furniture the icy atmosphere and the nameless odour combined to make the room abominable to me and after lingering a moment to see that it contained no cupboards or corners into which a person might have crept for concealment i made haste to shut the door and went downstairs again to bed evidently i had been deceived after all as to the noise in the night i had a foolish but very vivid dream i dreamed that the landlady and another person dark and not properly visible entered my room on all fours followed by a horde of immense cats they attacked me as i lay in bed and murdered me and then dragged my body upstairs and deposited it on the floor of that cold little square room under the roof nov since my talk with emily the unfinished talk i have hardly once set eyes on her mrs monson now attends wholly to my wants as usual she does everything exactly as i dont like it done it is all too utterly trivial to mention but it is exceedingly irritating like small doses of morphine often repeated she has finally a cumulative effect nov this morning i woke early and came into the front room to get a book meaning to read in bed till it was time to get up emily was laying the fire good morning i said cheerfully mind you make a good fire its very cold the girl turned and showed me a startled face it was not emily at all wheres emily i exclaimed you mean the girl as was ere before me has emily left i came on the th she replied sullenly and shed gone then i got my book and went back to bed emily must have been sent away almost immediately after our conversation this reflection kept coming between me and the printed page i was glad when it was time to get up such prompt energy such merciless decision seemed to argue something of importance to somebody nov the wound inflicted by the cats claw has swollen and causes me annoyance and some pain it throbs and itches im afraid my blood must be in poor condition or it would have healed by now i opened it with a penknife soaked in an antiseptic solution and cleaned it thoroughly i have heard unpleasant stories of the results of wounds inflicted by cats nov in spite of the curious effect this house certainly exercises upon my nerves i like it it is lonely and deserted in the very heart of london but it is also for that reason quiet to work in i wonder why it is so cheap some people might be suspicious but i did not even ask the reason no answer is better than a lie if only i could remove the cats from the outside and the rats from the inside i feel that i shall grow accustomed more and more to its peculiarities and shall die here ah that expression reads queerly and gives a wrong impression i meant live and die here i shall renew the lease from year to year till one of us crumbles to pieces from present indications the building will be the first to go nov this morning i woke to find my clothes scattered about the room and a cane chair overturned beside the bed my coat and waistcoat looked just as if they had been tried on by someone in the night i had horribly vivid dreams too in which someone covering his face with his hands kept coming close up to me crying out as if in pain where can i find covering oh who will clothe me how silly and yet it frightened me a little it was so dreadfully real it is now over a year since i last walked in my sleep and woke up with such a shock on the cold pavement of earls court road where i then lived i thought i was cured but evidently not this discovery has rather a disquieting effect upon me tonight i shall resort to the old trick of tying my toe to the bedpost nov last night i was again troubled by most oppressive dreams someone seemed to be moving in the night up and down my room sometimes passing into the front room and then returning to stand beside the bed and stare intently down upon me i was being watched by this person all night long i never actually awoke though i was often very near it i suppose it was a nightmare from indigestion for this morning i have one of my old vile headaches yet all my clothes lay about the floor when i awoke where they had evidently been flung had i tossed them during the dark hours and my trousers trailed over the step into the front room worse than this though i fancied i noticed about the room in the morning that strange fetid odour though very faint its mere suggestion is foul and nauseating what in the world can it be i wonder in future i shall lock my door nov i have accomplished a lot of good work during this past week and have also managed to get regular exercise i have felt well and in an equable state of mind only two things have occurred to disturb my equanimity the first is trivial in itself and no doubt to be easily explained the upper window where i saw the light on the night of november with the shadow of a large head and shoulder upon the blind is one of the windows in the square room under the roof in reality it has no blind at all here is the other thing i was coming home last night in a fresh fall of snow about eleven oclock my umbrella low down over my head halfway up the alley where the snow was wholly untrodden i saw a mans legs in front of me the umbrella hid the rest of his figure but on raising it i saw that he was tall and broad and was walking as i was towards the door of my house he could not have been four feet ahead of me i had thought the alley was empty when i entered it but might of course been mistaken very easily a sudden gust of wind compelled me to lower the umbrella and when i raised it again not half a minute later there was no longer any man to be seen with a few more steps i reached the door it was closed as usual i then noticed with a sudden sensation of dismay that the surface of the freshly fallen snow was unbroken my own footmarks were the only ones to be seen anywhere and though i retraced my way to the point where i had first seen the man i could find no slightest impression of any other boots feeling creepy and uncomfortable i went upstairs and was glad to get into bed nov with the fastening of my bedroom door the disturbances ceased i am convinced that i walked in my sleep probably i untied my toe and then tied it up again the fancied security of the locked door would alone have been enough to restore sleep to my troubled spirit and enable me to rest quietly last night however the annoyance was suddenly renewed in another and more aggressive form i woke in the darkness with the impression that some one was standing outside my bedroom door listening as i became more awake the impression grew into positive knowledge though there was no appreciable sound of moving or breathing i was so convinced of the propinquity of a listener that i crept out of bed and approached the door as i did so there came faintly from the next room the unmistakable sound of someone retreating stealthily across the floor yet as i heard it it was neither the tread of a man nor a regular footstep but rather it seemed to me a confused sort of crawling almost as of someone on his hands and knees i unlocked the door in less than a second and passed quickly into the front room and i could feel as by the subtlest imaginable vibrations upon my nerves that the spot i was standing in had just that instant been vacated the listener had moved he was now behind the other door standing in the passage yet this door was also closed i moved swiftly and as silently as possible across the floor and turned the handle a cold rush of air met me from the passage and sent shiver after shiver down my back there was no one in the doorway there was no one on the little landing there was no one moving down the staircase yet i had been so quick that this midnight listener could not be very far away and i felt that if i persevered i should eventually come face to face with him and the courage that came so opportunely to overcome my nervousness and horror seemed born of the unwilling conviction that it was somehow necessary for my safety as well as my sanity that i should find this intruder and force his secret from him for was it not the intent action of his mind upon my own in concentrated listening that had awakened me with such a vivid realization of his presence advancing across the narrow landing i peered down into the well of the little house there was nothing to be seen no one was moving in the darkness how cold the oilcloth was to my bare feet i cannot say what it was that suddenly drew my eyes upward i only know that without apparent reason i looked up and saw a person about halfway up the next turn of the stairs leaning forward over the balustrade and staring straight into my face it was a man he appeared to be clinging to the rail rather than standing on the stairs the gloom made it impossible to see much beyond the general outline but the head and shoulders were seemingly enormous and stood sharply silhouetted against the skylight in the roof immediately above the idea flashed into my brain in a moment that i was looking into the visage of something monstrous the huge skull the manelike hair the widehumped shoulders suggested in a way i did not pause to analyze that which was scarcely human and for some seconds fascinated by horror i returned the gaze and stared into the dark inscrutable countenance above me without knowing exactly where i was or what i was doing then i realized in quite a new way that i was face to face with the secret midnight listener and i steeled myself as best i could for what was about to come the source of the rash courage that came to me at this awful moment will ever be to me an inexplicable mystery though shivering with fear and my forehead wet with an unholy dew i resolved to advance twenty questions leaped to my lips what are you what do you want why do you listen and watch why do you come into my room but none of them found articulate utterance i began forthwith to climb the stairs and with the first signs of my advance he drew himself back into the shadows and began to move too he retreated as swiftly as i advanced i heard the sound of his crawling motion a few steps ahead of me ever maintaining the same distance when i reached the landing he was halfway up the next flight and when i was halfway up the next flight he had already arrived at the top landing and then i heard him open the door of the little square room under the roof and go in immediately though the door did not close after him the sound of his moving entirely ceased at this moment i longed for a light or a stick or any weapon whatsoever but i had none of these things and it was impossible to go back so i marched steadily up the rest of the stairs and in less than a minute found myself standing in the gloom face to face with the door through which this creature had just entered for a moment i hesitated the door was about halfway open and the listener was standing evidently in his favourite attitude just behind it listening to search through that dark room for him seemed hopeless to enter the same small space where he was seemed horrible the very idea filled me with loathing and i almost decided to turn back it is strange at such times how trivial things impinge on the consciousness with a shock as of something important and immense something it might have been a beetle or a mouse scuttled over the bare boards behind me the door moved a quarter of an inch closing my decision came back with a sudden rush as it were and thrusting out a foot i kicked the door so that it swung sharply back to its full extent and permitted me to walk forward slowly into the aperture of profound blackness beyond what a queer soft sound my bare feet made on the boards how the blood sang and buzzed in my head i was inside the darkness closed over me hiding even the windows i groped my way round the walls in a thorough search but in order to prevent all possibility of the others escape i first of all closed the door there we were we two shut in together between four walls within a few feet of one another but with what with whom was i thus momentarily imprisoned a new light flashed suddenly over the affair with a swift illuminating brilliance and i knew i was a fool an utter fool i was wide awake at last and the horror was evaporating my cursed nerves again a dream a nightmare and the old result walking in my sleep the figure was a dreamfigure many a time before had the actors in my dreams stood before me for some moments after i was awake there was a chance match in my pajamas pocket and i struck it on the wall the room was utterly empty it held not even a shadow i went quickly down to bed cursing my wretched nerves and my foolish vivid dreams but as soon as ever i was asleep again the same uncouth figure of a man crept back to my bedside and bending over me with his immense head close to my ear whispered repeatedly in my dreams i want your body i want its covering im waiting for it and listening always words scarcely less foolish than the dream but i wonder what that queer odour was up in the square room i noticed it again and stronger than ever before and it seemed to be also in my bedroom when i woke this morning nov slowly as moonbeams rise over a misty sea in june the thought is entering my mind that my nerves and somnambulistic dreams do not adequately account for the influence this house exercises upon me it holds me as with a fine invisible net i cannot escape if i would it draws me and it means to keep me nov the post this morning brought me a letter from aden forwarded from my old rooms in earls court it was from chapter my former trinity chum who is on his way home from the east and asks for my address i sent it to him at the hotel he mentioned to await arrival as i have already said my windows command a view of the alley and i can see an arrival without difficulty this morning while i was busy writing the sound of footsteps coming up the alley filled me with a sense of vague alarm that i could in no way account for i went over to the window and saw a man standing below waiting for the door to be opened his shoulders were broad his tophat glossy and his overcoat fitted beautifully round the collar all this i could see but no more presently the door opened and the shock to my nerves was unmistakable when i heard a mans voice ask is mr still here mentioning my name i could not catch the answer but it could only have been in the affirmative for the man entered the hall and the door shut to behind him but i waited in vain for the sound of his steps on the stairs there was no sound of any kind it seemed to me so strange that i opened my door and looked out no one was anywhere to be seen i walked across the narrow landing and looked through the window that commands the whole length of the alley there was no sign of a human being coming or going the lane was deserted then i deliberately walked downstairs into the kitchen and asked the grayfaced landlady if a gentleman had just that minute called for me the answer given with an odd weary sort of smile was no dec i feel genuinely alarmed and uneasy over the state of my nerves dreams are dreams but never before have i had dreams in broad daylight i am looking forward very much to chapters arrival he is a capital fellow vigorous healthy with no nerves and even less imagination and he has a year into the bargain periodically he makes me offers the last was to travel round the world with him as secretary which was a delicate way of paying my expenses and giving me some pocketmoney offers however which i invariably decline i prefer to keep his friendship women could not come between us money might therefore i give it no opportunity chapter always laughed at what he called my fancies being himself possessed only of that thinblooded quality of imagination which is ever associated with the prosaicminded man yet if taunted with this obvious lack his wrath is deeply stirred his psychology is that of the crass materialist always a rather funny article it will afford me genuine relief none the less to hear the cold judgment his mind will have to pass upon the story of this house as i shall have it to tell dec the strangest part of it all i have not referred to in this brief diary truth to tell i have been afraid to set it down in black and white i have kept it in the background of my thoughts preventing it as far as possible from taking shape in spite of my efforts however it has continued to grow stronger now that i come to face the issue squarely it is harder to express than i imagined like a halfremembered melody that trips in the head but vanishes the moment you try to sing it these thoughts form a group in the background of my mind behind my mind as it were and refuse to come forward they are crouching ready to spring but the actual leap never takes place in these rooms except when my mind is strongly concentrated on my own work i find myself suddenly dealing in thoughts and ideas that are not my own new strange conceptions wholly foreign to my temperament are forever cropping up in my head what precisely they are is of no particular importance the point is that they are entirely apart from the channel in which my thoughts have hitherto been accustomed to flow especially they come when my mind is at rest unoccupied when im dreaming over the fire or sitting with a book which fails to hold my attention then these thoughts which are not mine spring into life and make me feel exceedingly uncomfortable sometimes they are so strong that i almost feel as if someone were in the room beside me thinking aloud evidently my nerves and liver are shockingly out of order i must work harder and take more vigorous exercise the horrid thoughts never come when my mind is much occupied but they are always there waiting and as it were alive what i have attempted to describe above came first upon me gradually after i had been some days in the house and then grew steadily in strength the other strange thing has come to me only twice in all these weeks it appals me it is the consciousness of the propinquity of some deadly and loathsome disease it comes over me like a wave of fever heat and then passes off leaving me cold and trembling the air seems for a few seconds to become tainted so penetrating and convincing is the thought of this sickness that on both occasions my brain has turned momentarily dizzy and through my mind like flames of white heat have flashed the ominous names of all the dangerous illnesses i know i can no more explain these visitations than i can fly yet i know there is no dreaming about the clammy skin and palpitating heart which they always leave as witnesses of their brief visit most strongly of all was i aware of this nearness of a mortal sickness when on the night of the th i went upstairs in pursuit of the listening figure when we were shut in together in that little square room under the roof i felt that i was face to face with the actual essence of this invisible and malignant disease such a feeling never entered my heart before and i pray to god it never may again there now i have confessed i have given some expression at least to the feelings that so far i have been afraid to see in my own writing for since i can no longer deceive myself the experiences of that night th were no more a dream than my daily breakfast is a dream and the trivial entry in this diary by which i sought to explain away an occurrence that caused me unutterable horror was due solely to my desire not to acknowledge in words what i really felt and believed to be true the increase that would have accrued to my horror by so doing might have been more than i could stand dec i wish chapter would come my facts are all ready marshalled and i can see his cool gray eyes fixed incredulously on my face as i relate them the knocking at my door the welldressed caller the light in the upper window and the shadow upon the blind the man who preceded me in the snow the scattering of my clothes at night emilys arrested confession the landladys suspicious reticence the midnight listener on the stairs and those awful subsequent words in my sleep and above all and hardest to tell the presence of the abominable sickness and the stream of thoughts and ideas that are not my own i can see chapters face and i can almost hear his deliberate words youve been at the tea again and underfeeding i expect as usual better see my nerve doctor and then come with me to the south of france for this fellow who knows nothing of disordered liver or highstrung nerves goes regularly to a great nerve specialist with the periodical belief that his nervous system is beginning to decay dec ever since the incident of the listener i have kept a nightlight burning in my bedroom and my sleep has been undisturbed last night however i was subjected to a far worse annoyance i woke suddenly and saw a man in front of the dressingtable regarding himself in the mirror the door was locked as usual i knew at once it was the listener and the blood turned to ice in my veins such a wave of horror and dread swept over me that it seemed to turn me rigid in the bed and i could neither move nor speak i noted however that the odour i so abhorred was strong in the room the man seemed to be tall and broad he was stooping forward over the mirror his back was turned to me but in the glass i saw the reflection of a huge head and face illumined fitfully by the flicker of the nightlight the spectral gray of very early morning stealing in round the edges of the curtains lent an additional horror to the picture for it fell upon the hair that was tawny and manelike hanging about a face whose swollen rugose features bore the once seen never forgotten leonine expression of i dare not write down that awful word but by way of corroborative proof i saw in the faint mingling of the two lights that there were several bronzecoloured blotches on the cheeks which the man was evidently examining with great care in the glass the lips were pale and very thick and large one hand i could not see but the other rested on the ivory back of my hairbrush its muscles were strangely contracted the fingers thin to emaciation the back of the hand closely puckered up it was like a big gray spider crouching to spring or the claw of a great bird the full realization that i was alone in the room with this nameless creature almost within arms reach of him overcame me to such a degree that when he suddenly turned and regarded me with small beady eyes wholly out of proportion to the grandeur of their massive setting i sat bolt upright in bed uttered a loud cry and then fell back in a dead swoon of terror upon the bed dec when i came to this morning the first thing i noticed was that my clothes were strewn all over the floor i find it difficult to put my thoughts together and have sudden accesses of violent trembling i determined that i would go at once to chapters hotel and find out when he is expected i cannot refer to what happened in the night it is too awful and i have to keep my thoughts rigorously away from it i feel lightheaded and queer couldnt eat any breakfast and have twice vomited with blood while dressing to go out a hansom rattled up noisily over the cobbles and a minute later the door opened and to my great joy in walked the very subject of my thoughts the sight of his strong face and quiet eyes had an immediate effect upon me and i grew calmer again his very handshake was a sort of tonic but as i listened eagerly to the deep tones of his reassuring voice and the visions of the night time paled a little i began to realize how very hard it was going to be to tell him my wild intangible tale some men radiate an animal vigour that destroys the delicate woof of a vision and effectually prevents its reconstruction chapter was one of these men we talked of incidents that had filled the interval since we last met and he told me something of his travels he talked and i listened but so full was i of the horrid thing i had to tell that i made a poor listener i was forever watching my opportunity to leap in and explode it all under his nose before very long however it was borne in upon me that he too was merely talking for time he too held something of importance in the background of his mind something too weighty to let fall till the right moment presented itself so that during the whole of the first halfhour we were both waiting for the psychological moment in which properly to release our respective bombs and the intensity of our minds action set up opposing forces that merely sufficed to hold one another in check and nothing more as soon as i realized this therefore i resolved to yield i renounced for the time my purpose of telling my story and had the satisfaction of seeing that his mind released from the restraint of my own at once began to make preparations for the discharge of its momentous burden the talk grew less and less magnetic the interest waned the descriptions of his travels became less alive there were pauses between his sentences presently he repeated himself his words clothed no living thoughts the pauses grew longer then the interest dwindled altogether and went out like a candle in the wind his voice ceased and he looked up squarely into my face with serious and anxious eyes the psychological moment had come at last i say he began and then stopped short i made an unconscious gesture of encouragement but said no word i dreaded the impending disclosure exceedingly a dark shadow seemed to precede it i say he blurted out at last what in the world made you ever come to this place to these rooms i mean theyre cheap for one thing i began and central and theyre too cheap he interrupted didnt you ask what made em so cheap it never occurred to me at the time there was a pause in which he avoided my eyes for gods sake go on man and tell it i cried for the suspense was getting more than i could stand in my nervous condition this was where blount lived so long he said quietly and where he died you know in the old days i often used to come here and see him and do what i could to alleviate his he stuck fast again well i said with a great effort please go on faster but chapter went on turning his face to the window with a perceptible shiver he finally got so terrible i simply couldnt stand it though i always thought i could stand anything it got on my nerves and made me dream and haunted me day and night i stared at him and said nothing i had never heard of blount in my life and didnt know what he was talking about but all the same i was trembling and my mouth had become strangely dry this is the first time ive been back here since he said almost in a whisper and pon my word it gives me the creeps i swear it isnt fit for a man to live in i never saw you look so bad old man ive got it for a year i jerked out with a forced laugh signed the lease and all i thought it was rather a bargain chapter shuddered and buttoned his overcoat up to his neck then he spoke in a low voice looking occasionally behind him as though he thought someone was listening i too could have sworn someone else was in the room with us he did it himself you know and no one blamed him a bit his sufferings were awful for the last two years he used to wear a veil when he went out and even then it was always in a closed carriage even the attendant who had nursed him for so long was at length obliged to leave the extremities of both the lower limbs were gone dropped off and he moved about the ground on all fours with a sort of crawling motion the odour too was i was obliged to interrupt him here i could hear no more details of that sort my skin was moist i felt hot and cold by turns for at last i was beginning to understand poor devil chapter went on i used to keep my eyes closed as much as possible he always begged to be allowed to take his veil off and asked if i minded very much i used to stand by the open window he never touched me though he rented the whole house nothing would induce him to leave it did he occupy these very rooms no he had the little room on the top floor the square one just under the roof he preferred it because it was dark these rooms were too near the ground and he was afraid people might see him through the windows a crowd had been known to follow him up to the very door and then stand below the windows in the hope of catching a glimpse of his face but there were hospitals he wouldnt go near one and they didnt like to force him you know they say its not contagious so there was nothing to prevent his staying here if he wanted to he spent all his time reading medical books about drugs and so on his head and face were something appalling just like a lions i held up my hand to arrest further description he was a burden to the world and he knew it one night i suppose he realized it too keenly to wish to live he had the free use of drugs and in the morning he was found dead on the floor two years ago that was and they said then he had still several years to live then in heavens name i cried unable to bear the suspense any longer tell me what it was he had and be quick about it i thought you knew he exclaimed with genuine surprise i thought you knew he leaned forward and our eyes met in a scarcely audible whisper i caught the words his lip seemed almost afraid to utter he was a leper a courtesy of laurence j gomme ii number montague rhodes james among the towns of jutland viborg justly holds a high place it is the seat of a bishopric it has a handsome but almost entirely new cathedral a charming garden a lake of great beauty and many storks near it is hald accounted one of the prettiest things in denmark and hard by is finderup where marsk stig murdered king erik glipping on st cecilias day in the year fiftysix blows of squareheaded iron maces were traced on eriks skull when his tomb was opened in the seventeenth century but i am not writing a guidebook there are good hotels in viborg preislers and the phoenix are all that can be desired but my cousin whose experiences i have to tell you now went to the golden lion the first time that he visited viborg he has not been there since and the following pages will perhaps explain the reason of his abstention the golden lion is one of the very few houses in the town that were not destroyed in the great fire of which practically demolished the cathedral the sognekirke the raadhuus and so much else that was old and interesting it is a great redbrick house that is the front is of brick with corbie steps on the gables and a text over the door but the courtyard into which the omnibus drives is of black and white wood and plaster the sun was declining in the heavens when my cousin walked up to the door and the light smote full upon the imposing faade of the house he was delighted with the oldfashioned aspect of the place and promised himself a thoroughly satisfactory and amusing stay in an inn so typical of old jutland it was not business in the ordinary sense of the word that had brought mr anderson to viborg he was engaged upon some researches into the church history of denmark and it had come to his knowledge that in the rigsarkiv of viborg there were papers saved from the fire relating to the last days of roman catholicism in the country he proposed therefore to spend a considerable time perhaps as much as a fortnight or three weeks in examining and copying these and he hoped that the golden lion would be able to give him a room of sufficient size to serve alike as a bedroom and a study his wishes were explained to the landlord and after a certain amount of thought the latter suggested that perhaps it might be the best way for the gentleman to look at one or two of the larger rooms and pick one for himself it seemed a good idea the top floor was soon rejected as entailing too much getting upstairs after the days work the second floor contained no room of exactly the dimensions required but on the first floor there was a choice of two or three rooms which would so far as size went suit admirably the landlord was strongly in favour of number but mr anderson pointed out that its windows commanded only the blank wall of the next house and that it would be very dark in the afternoon either number or number would be better for both of them looked on the street and the bright evening light and the pretty view would more than compensate him for the additional amount of noise eventually number was selected like its neighbours it had three windows all on one side of the room it was fairly high and unusually long there was of course no fireplace but the stove was handsome and rather old a castiron erection on the side of which was a representation of abraham sacrificing isaac and the inscription bog mose cap above nothing else in the room was remarkable the only interesting picture was an old coloured print of the town date about suppertime was approaching but when anderson refreshed by the ordinary ablutions descended the staircase there were still a few minutes before the bell rang he devoted them to examining the list of his fellowlodgers as is usual in denmark their names were displayed on a large blackboard divided into columns and lines the numbers of the rooms being painted in at the beginning of each line the list was not exciting there was an advocate or sagfrer a german and some bagmen from copenhagen the one and only point which suggested any food for thought was the absence of any number from the tale of the rooms and even this was a thing which anderson had already noticed half a dozen times in his experience of danish hotels he could not help wondering whether the objection to that particular number common as it is was so widespread and so strong as to make it difficult to let a room so ticketed and he resolved to ask the landlord if he and his colleagues in the profession had actually met with many clients who refused to be accommodated in the thirteenth room he had nothing to tell me i am giving the story as i heard it from him about what passed at supper and the evening which was spent in unpacking and arranging his clothes books and papers was not more eventful toward eleven oclock he resolved to go to bed but with him as with a good many other people nowadays an almost necessary preliminary to bed if he meant to sleep was the reading of a few pages of print and he now remembered that the particular book which he had been reading in the train and which alone would satisfy him at that present moment was in the pocket of his greatcoat then hanging on a peg outside the diningroom to run down and secure it was the work of a moment and as the passages were by no means dark it was not difficult for him to find his way back to his own door so at least he thought but when he arrived there and turned the handle the door entirely refused to open and he caught the sound of a hasty movement toward it from within he had tried the wrong door of course was his own room to the right or to the left he glanced at the number it was his room would be on the left and so it was and not before he had been in bed for some minutes had read his wonted three or four pages of his book blown out his light and turned over to go to sleep did it occur to him that whereas on the blackboard of the hotel there had been no number there was undoubtedly a room numbered in the hotel he felt rather sorry he had not chosen it for his own perhaps he might have done the landlord a little service by occupying it and given him the chance of saying that a wellworn english gentleman had lived in it for three weeks and liked it very much but probably it was used as a servants room or something of the kind after all it was most likely not so large or good a room as his own and he looked drowsily about the room which was fairly perceptible in the halflight from the streetlamp it was a curious effect he thought rooms usually look larger in a dim light than a full one but this seemed to have contracted in length and grown proportionately higher well well sleep was more important than these vague ruminations and to sleep he went on the day after his arrival anderson attacked the rigsarkiv of viborg he was as one might expect in denmark kindly received and access to all that he wished to see was made as easy for him as possible the documents laid before him were far more numerous and interesting than he had at all anticipated besides official papers there was a large bundle of correspondence relating to bishop jrgen friis the last roman catholic who held the see and in these there cropped up many amusing and what are called intimate details of private life and individual character there was much talk of a house owned by the bishop but not inhabited by him in the town its tenant was apparently somewhat of a scandal and a stumblingblock to the reforming party he was a disgrace they wrote to the city he practised secret and wicked arts and had sold his soul to the enemy it was of a piece with the gross corruption and superstition of the babylonish church that such a viper and bloodsucking troldmand should be patronized and harboured by the bishop the bishop met these reproaches boldly he protested his own abhorrence of all such things as secret arts and required his antagonists to bring the matter before the proper court of course the spiritual court and sift it to the bottom no one could be more ready and willing than himself to condemn mag nicolas francken if the evidence showed him to have been guilty of any of the crimes informally alleged against him anderson had not time to do more than glance at the next letter of the protestant leader rasmus nielsen before the record office was closed for the day but he gathered its general tenor which was to the effect that christian men were now no longer bound by the decisions of bishops of rome and that the bishops court was not and could not be a fit or competent tribunal to judge so grave and weighty a cause on leaving the office mr anderson was accompanied by the old gentleman who presided over it and as they walked the conversation very naturally turned to the papers of which i have just been speaking herr scavenius the archivist of viborg though very well informed as to the general run of the documents under his charge was not a specialist in those of the reformation period he was much interested in what anderson had to tell him about them he looked forward with great pleasure he said to seeing the publication in which mr anderson spoke of embodying their contents this house of the bishop friis he added it is a great puzzle to me where it can have stood i have studied carefully the topography of old viborg but it is most unlucky of the old terrier of the bishops property which was made in and of which we have the greater part in the arkiv just the piece which had the list of the town property is missing never mind perhaps i shall some day succeed to find him after taking some exercise i forget exactly how or where anderson went back to the golden lion his supper his game of patience and his bed on the way to his room it occurred to him that he had forgotten to talk to the landlord about the omission of number from the hotel board and also that he might as well make sure that number did actually exist before he made any reference to the matter the decision was not difficult to arrive at there was the door with its number as plain as could be and work of some kind was evidently going on inside it for as he neared the door he could hear footsteps and voices or a voice within during the few seconds in which he halted to make sure of the number the footsteps ceased seemingly very near the door and he was a little startled at hearing a quick hissing breathing as of a person in strong excitement he went on to his own room and again he was surprised to find how much smaller it seemed now than it had when he selected it it was a slight disappointment but only slight if he found it really not large enough he could very easily shift to another in the meantime he wanted something as far as i remember it was a pockethandkerchief out of his portmanteau which had been placed by the porter on a very inadequate trestle or stool against the wall at the furthest end of the room from his bed here was a very curious thing the portmanteau was not to be seen it had been moved by officious servants doubtless the contents had been put in the wardrobe no none of them were there this was vexatious the idea of a theft he dismissed at once such things rarely happen in denmark but some piece of stupidity had certainly been performed which is not so uncommon and the stuepige must be severely spoken to whatever it was that he wanted it was not so necessary to his comfort that he could not wait till the morning for it and he therefore settled not to ring the bell and disturb the servants he went to the window the righthand window it was and looked out on the quiet street there was a tall building opposite with large spaces of dead wall no passers by a dark night and very little to be seen of any kind the light was behind him and he could see his own shadow clearly cast on the wall opposite also the shadow of the bearded man in number on the left who passed to and fro in shirt sleeves once or twice and was seen first brushing his hair and later on in a nightgown also the shadow of the occupant of number on the right this might be more interesting number was like himself leaning on his elbows on the windowsill looking out into the street he seemed to be a tall thin man or was it by any chance a woman at least it was someone who covered his or her head with some kind of drapery before going to bed and he thought must be possessed of a red lampshade and the lamp must be flickering very much there was a distinct playing up and down of a dull red light on the opposite wall he craned out a little to see if he could make any more of the figure but beyond a fold of some light perhaps white material on the windowsill he could see nothing now came a distant step in the street and its approach seemed to recall number to a sense of his exposed position for very swiftly and suddenly he swept aside from the window and his red light went out anderson who had been smoking a cigarette laid the end of it on the windowsill and went to bed next morning he was woke by the stuepige with hot water etc he roused himself and after thinking out the correct danish words said as distinctly as he could you must not move my portmanteau where is it as is not uncommon the maid laughed and went away without making any distinct answer anderson rather irritated sat up in bed intending to call her back but he remained sitting up staring straight in front of him there was his portmanteau on its trestle exactly where he had seen the porter put it when he first arrived this was a rude shock for a man who prided himself on his accuracy of observation how it could possibly have escaped him the night before he did not pretend to understand at any rate there it was now the daylight showed more than the portmanteau it let the true proportions of the room with its three windows appear and satisfied its tenant that his choice after all had not been a bad one when he was almost dressed he walked to the middle one of the three windows to look out at the weather another shock awaited him strangely unobservant he must have been last night he could have sworn ten times over that he had been smoking at the righthand window the last thing before he went to bed and here was his cigaretteend on the sill of the middle window he started to go down to breakfast rather late but number was later here were his boots still outside his door a gentlemans boots so then number was a man not a woman just then he caught sight of the number on the door it was he thought he must have passed number without noticing it three stupid mistakes in twelve hours were too much for a methodical accurateminded man so he turned back to make sure the next number to was number his own room there was no number at all after some minutes devoted to a careful consideration of everything he had had to eat and drink during the last twentyfour hours anderson decided to give the question up if his eyes or his brain were giving way he would have plenty of opportunities for ascertaining that fact if not then he was evidently being treated to a very interesting experience in either case the development of events would certainly be worth watching during the day he continued his examination of the episcopal correspondence which i have already summarized to his disappointment it was incomplete only one other letter could be found which referred to the affair of mag nicolas francken it was from the bishop jrgen friis to rasmus nielsen he said although we are not in the least degree inclined to assent to your judgment concerning our court and shall be prepared if need be to withstand you to the uttermost in that behalf yet forasmuch as our trusty and wellbeloved mag nicolas francken against whom you have dared to allege certain false and malicious charges hath been suddenly removed from among us it is apparent that the question for this term falls but forasmuch as you further allege that the apostle and evangelist st john in his heavenly apocalypse describes the holy roman church under the guise and symbol of the scarlet woman be it known to you etc search as he would anderson could find no sequel to this letter nor any clue to the cause or manner of the removal of the casus belli he could only suppose that francken had died suddenly and as there were only two days between the date of nielsens last letter when francken was evidently still in being and that of the bishops letter the death must have been completely unexpected in the afternoon he paid a short visit to hald and took his tea at baekkelund nor could he notice though he was in a somewhat nervous frame of mind that there was any indication of such a failure of eye or brain as his experiences of the morning had led him to fear at supper he found himself next to the landlord what he asked him after some indifferent conversation is the reason why in most of the hotels one visits in this country the number thirteen is left out of the list of rooms i see you have none here the landlord seemed amused to think that you should have noticed a thing like that ive thought about it once or twice myself to tell the truth an educated man ive said has no business with these superstitious notions i was brought up myself here in the high school of viborg and our old master was always a man to set his face against anything of that kind hes been dead now this many years a fine upstanding man he was and ready with his hands as well as his head i recollect us boys one snowy day here he plunged into reminiscence then you dont think there is any particular objection to having a number said anderson ah to be sure well you understand i was brought up to the business by my poor old father he kept an hotel in aarhuus first and then when we were born he moved to viborg here which was his native place and had the phoenix here until he died that was in then i started business in silkeborg and only the year before last i moved into this house then followed more details as to the state of the house and business when first taken over and when you came here was there a number no no i was going to tell you about that you see in a place like this the commercial class the travellers are what we have to provide for in general and put them in number why theyd as soon sleep in the street or sooner as far as im concerned myself it wouldnt make a penny difference to me what the number of my room was and so ive often said to them but they stick to it that it brings them bad luck quantities of stories they have among them of men that have slept in a number and never been the same again or lost their best customers or one thing and another said the landlord after searching for a more graphic phrase then what do you use your number for said anderson conscious as he said the words of a curious anxiety quite disproportionate to the importance of the question my number why dont i tell you that there isnt such a thing in the house i thought you might have noticed that if there was it would be next door to your own room well yes only i happened to think that is i fancied last night that i had seen a door numbered thirteen in that passage and really i am almost certain i must have been right for i saw it the night before as well of course herr kristensen laughed this notion to scorn as anderson had expected and emphasized with much iteration the fact that no number existed or had existed before him in that hotel anderson was in some ways relieved by his certainty but still puzzled and he began to think that the best way to make sure whether he had indeed been subject to an illusion or not was to invite the landlord to his room to smoke a cigar later on in the evening some photographs of english towns which he had with him formed a sufficiently good excuse herr kristensen was flattered by the invitation and most willingly accepted it at about ten oclock he was to make his appearance but before that anderson had some letters to write and retired for the purpose of writing them he almost blushed to himself at confessing it but he could not deny that it was the fact that he was becoming quite nervous about the question of the existence of number so much so that he approached his room by way of number in order that he might not be obliged to pass the door or the place where the door ought to be he looked quickly and suspiciously about the room when he entered it but there was nothing beyond that indefinable air of being smaller than usual to warrant any misgivings there was no question of the presence or absence of his portmanteau tonight he had himself emptied it of its contents and lodged it under his bed with a certain effort he dismissed the thought of number from his mind and sat down to his writing his neighbours were quiet enough occasionally a door opened in the passage and a pair of boots was thrown out or a bagman walked past humming to himself and outside from time to time a cart thundered over the atrocious cobblestones or a quick step hurried along the flags anderson finished his letters ordered in whiskey and soda and then went to the window and studied the dead wall opposite and the shadows upon it as far as he could remember number had been occupied by the lawyer a staid man who said little at meals being generally engaged in studying a small bundle of papers beside his plate apparently however he was in the habit of giving vent to his animal spirits when alone why else should he be dancing the shadow from the next room evidently showed that he was again and again his thin form crossed the window his arms waved and a gaunt leg was kicked up with surprising agility he seemed to be barefooted and the floor must be well laid for no sound betrayed his movements sagfrer herr anders jensen dancing at ten oclock at night in a hotel bedroom seemed a fitting subject for a historical painting in the grand style and andersons thoughts like those of emily in the mysteries of udolpho began to arrange themselves in the following lines when i return to my hotel at ten oclock pm the waiters think i am unwell i do not care for them but when ive locked my chamber door and put my boots outside i dance all night upon the floor and even if my neighbours swore id go on dancing all the more for im acquainted with the law and in despite of all their jaw their protests i deride had not the landlord at this moment knocked at the door it is probable that quite a long poem might have been laid before the reader to judge from his look of surprise when he found himself in the room herr kristensen was struck as anderson had been by something unusual in its aspect but he made no remark andersons photographs interested him mightily and formed the text of many autobiographical discourses nor is it quite clear how the conversation could have been diverted into the desired channel of number had not the lawyer at this moment begun to sing and to sing in a manner which could leave no doubt in anyones mind that he was either exceedingly drunk or raving mad it was a high thin voice that they heard and it seemed dry as if from long disuse of words or tune there was no question it went sailing up to a surprising height and was carried down with a despairing moan as of a winter wind in a hollow chimney or an organ whose wind fails suddenly it was a really horrible sound and anderson felt that if he had been alone he must have fled for refuge and society to some neighbour bagmans room the landlord sat openmouthed i dont understand it he said at last wiping his forehead it is dreadful i have heard it once before but i made sure it was a cat is he mad said anderson he must be and what a sad thing such a good customer too and so successful in his business by what i hear and a young family to bring up just then came an impatient knock at the door and the knocker entered without waiting to be asked it was the lawyer in deshabille and very roughhaired and very angry he looked i beg pardon sir he said but i should be much obliged if you would kindly desist here he stopped for it was evident that neither of the persons before him was responsible for the disturbance and after a moments lull it swelled forth again more wildly than before but what in the name of heaven does it mean broke out the lawyer where is it who is it am i going out of my mind surely herr jensen it comes from your room next door isnt there a cat or something stuck in the chimney this was the best that occurred to anderson to say and he realized its futility as he spoke but any thing was better than to stand and listen to that horrible voice and look at the broad white face of the landlord all perspiring and quivering as he clutched the arms of his chair impossible said the lawyer impossible there is no chimney i came here because i was convinced the noise was going on here it was certainly in the next room to mine was there no door between yours and mine said anderson eagerly no sir said herr jensen rather sharply at least not this morning ah said anderson nor tonight i am not sure said the lawyer with some hesitation suddenly the crying or singing voice in the next room died away and the singer was heard seemingly to laugh to himself in a crooning manner the three men actually shivered at the sound then there was a silence come said the lawyer what have you to say herr kristensen what does this mean good heaven said kristensen how should i tell i know no more than you gentlemen i pray i may never hear such a noise again so do i said herr jensen and he added something under his breath anderson thought it sounded like the last words of the psalter omnis spiritus laudet dominum but he could not be sure but we must do something said anderson the three of us shall we go and investigate in the next room but that is herr jensens room wailed the landlord it is no use he has come from there himself i am not so sure said jensen i think this gentleman is right we must go and see the only weapons of defence that could be mustered on the spot were a stick and umbrella the expedition went out into the passage not without quakings there was a deadly quiet outside but a light shone from under the next door anderson and jensen approached it the latter turned the handle and gave a sudden vigorous push no use the door stood fast herr kristensen said jensen will you go and fetch the strongest servant you have in the place we must see this through the landlord nodded and hurried off glad to be away from the scene of action jensen and anderson remained outside looking at the door it is number you see said the latter yes there is your door and there is mine said jensen my room has three windows in the daytime said anderson with difficulty suppressing a nervous laugh by george so has mine said the lawyer turning and looking at anderson his back was now to the door in that moment the door opened and an arm came out and clawed at his shoulder it was clad in ragged yellowish linen and the bare skin where it could be seen had long gray hair upon it anderson was just in time to pull jensen out of its reach with a cry of disgust and fright when the door shut again and a low laugh was heard jensen had seen nothing but when anderson hurriedly told him what a risk he had run he fell into a great state of agitation and suggested that they should retire from the enterprise and lock themselves up in one or other of their rooms however while he was developing this plan the landlord and two ablebodied men arrived on the scene all looking rather serious and alarmed jensen met them with a torrent of description and explanation which did not at all tend to encourage them for the fray the men dropped the crowbars they had brought and said flatly that they were not going to risk their throats in that devils den the landlord was miserably nervous and undecided conscious that if the danger were not faced his hotel was ruined and very loath to face it himself luckily anderson hit upon a way of rallying the demoralized force is this he said the danish courage i have heard so much of it isnt a german in there and if it was we are five to one the two servants and jensen were stung into action by this and made a dash at the door stop said anderson dont lose your heads you stay out here with the light landlord and one of you two men break in the door and dont go in when it gives way the men nodded and the younger stepped forward raised his crowbar and dealt a tremendous blow on the upper panel the result was not in the least what any of them anticipated there was no cracking or rending of wood only a dull sound as if the solid wall had been struck the man dropped his tool with a shout and began rubbing his elbow his cry drew their eyes upon him for a moment then anderson looked at the door again it was gone the plaster wall of the passage stared him in the face with a considerable gash in it where the crowbar had struck it number had passed out of existence for a brief space they stood perfectly still gazing at the blank wall an early cock in the yard beneath was heard to crow and as anderson glanced in the direction of the sound he saw through the window at the end of the long passage that the eastern sky was paling to the dawn perhaps said the landlord with hesitation you gentleman would like another room for tonight a doublebedded one neither jensen nor anderson was averse to the suggestion they felt inclined to hunt in couples after their late experience it was found convenient when each of them went to his room to collect the articles he wanted for the night that the other should go with him and hold the candle they noticed that both number and number had three windows next morning the same party reassembled in number the landlord was naturally anxious to avoid engaging outside help and yet it was imperative that the mystery attaching to that part of the house should be cleared up accordingly the two servants had been induced to take upon them the function of carpenters the furniture was cleared away and at the cost of a good many irretrievably damaged planks that portion of the floor was taken up which lay nearest to number you will naturally suppose that a skeleton say that of mag nicolas francken was discovered that was not so what they did find lying between the beams which supported the flooring was a small copper box in it was a neatlyfolded vellum document with about twenty lines of writing both anderson and jensen who proved to be something of a palographer were much excited by this discovery which promised to afford the key to these extraordinary phenomena i possess a copy of an astrological work which i have never read it has by way of frontispiece a woodcut by hans sebald beham representing a number of sages seated round a table this detail may enable connoisseurs to identify the book i cannot myself recollect its title and it is not at this moment within reach but the flyleaves of it are covered with writing and during the ten years in which i have owned the volume i have not been able to determine which way up this writing ought to be read much less in what language it is not dissimilar was the position of anderson and jensen after the protracted examination to which they submitted the document in the copper box after two days contemplation of it jensen who was the bolder spirit of the two hazarded the conjecture that the language was either latin or old danish anderson ventured upon no surmises and was very willing to surrender the box and the parchment to the historical society of viborg to be placed in their museum i had the whole story from him a few months later as we sat in a wood near upsala after a visit to the library there where we or rather i had laughed over the contract by which daniel salthenius in later life professor of hebrew at knigsberg sold himself to satan anderson was not really amused young idiot he said meaning salthenius who was only an undergraduate when he committed that indiscretion how did he know what company he was courting and when i suggested the usual considerations he only grunted that same afternoon he told me what you have read but he refused to draw any inferences from it and to assent to any that i drew for him iii joseph a story katherine rickford they were sitting round the fire after dinner not an ordinary fire one of those fires that has a little room all to itself with seats at each side of it to hold a couple of people or three the big diningroom was panelled with oak at the far end was a handsome dresser that dated back for generations ones imagination ran riot when one pictured the people who must have laid those pewter plates on the long narrow solid table massive medival chests stood against the walls arms and parts of armour hung against the panelling but one noticed few of these things for there was no light in the room save what the fire gave it was christmas eve games had been played the old had vied with the young at snatching raisins from the burning snapdragon the children had long since gone to bed it was time their elders followed them but they lingered round the fire taking turns at telling stories nothing very weird had been told no one had felt any wish to peep over his shoulder or try to penetrate the darkness of the far end of the room the omission caused a sensation of something wanting from each one there this thought went out and so a sudden silence fell upon the party it was a girl who broke it a mere child she wore her hair up that night for the first time and that seemed to give her the right to sit up so late mr grady is going to tell one she said all eyes were turned to a middleaged man in a deep armchair placed straight in front of the fire he was short inclined to be fat with a bald head and a pointed beard like the beards that sailors wear it was plain that he was deeply conscious of the sudden turning of so much strained yet forceful thought upon himself he was restless in his chair as people are in a room that is overheated he blinked his eyes as he looked round the company his lips twitched in a nervous manner one side of him seemed to be endeavouring to restrain another side of him from a feverish desire to speak it was this room that made me think of him he said thoughtfully there was a long silence but it occurred to no one to prompt him everyone seemed to understand that he was going to speak or rather that something inside him was going to speak some force that craved expression and was using him as a medium the little old mans pink face grew strangely calm the animation that usually lit it was gone one would have said that the girl who had started him already regretted the impulse and now wanted to stop him she was breathing heavily and once or twice made as though she would speak to him but no words came she must have abandoned the idea for she fell to studying the company she examined them carefully one by one this one she told herself is soandso and that one there just another soandso she stared at them knowing that she could not turn them to herself with her stare they were just bodies kept working so to speak by some subtle sort of sentry left behind by the real selves that streamed out in pentup thought to the little old man in the chair in front of the fire his name was joseph at least they called him joseph he dreamed you understand dreams he was an extraordinary lad in many ways his mother i knew her very well had three children in quick succession soon after marriage then ten years went by and joseph was born quiet and reserved he always was a selfcontained child whose only friend was his mother people said things about him you know how people talk some said he was not claras child at all but that she had adopted him others that her husband was not his father and these put her change of manner down to a perpetual struggle to keep her husband comfortably in the dark i always imagined that the boy was in some way aware of all this gossip for i noticed that he took a dislike to the people who spread it most the little man rested his elbows on the arms of his chair and let the tips of his fingers meet in front of him a smile played about his mouth he seemed to be searching among his reminiscences for the one that would give the clearest portrait of joseph well anyway he said at last the boy was odd there is no gainsaying the fact i suppose he was eleven when clara came down here with her family for christmas the coningtons owned the place then mrs conington was claras sister it was christmas eve as it is now many years ago we had spent a normal christmas eve a little happier perhaps than usual by reason of the family reunion and because of the presence of so many children we had eaten and drank laughed and played and gone to bed i woke in the middle of the night from sheer restlessness clara knowing my weakness had given me a fire in my room i lit a cigarette played with a book and then purely from curiosity opened the door and looked down the passage from my door i could see the head of the staircase in the distance the opposite wing of the house or the passage rather beyond the stairs was in darkness the reason i saw the staircase at all was that the window you pass coming downstairs allowed the moon to throw an uncertain light upon it a weird light because of the stained glass i was arrested by the curious effect of this patch of light in so much darkness when suddenly someone came into it turned and went downstairs it was just like a scene in a theatre something was about to happen that i was going to miss i ran as i was barefooted to the head of the stairs and looked over the banister i was excited strung up too strung up to feel the fright that i knew must be with me i remember the sensation perfectly i knew that i was afraid yet i did not feel fright on the stairs nothing moved the little hall down here was lost in darkness looking over the banister i was facing the stained glass window you know how the stairs run round three sides of the hall well it occurred to me that if i went halfway down and stood under the window i should be able to keep the top of the stairs in sight and see anything that might happen in the hall i crept down very cautiously and waited under the window first of all i saw the suit of empty armour just outside the door here you know how a thing like that if you stare at it in a poor light appears to move well it moved sure enough and the illusion was enhanced by clouds being blown across the moon by the fire like this one can talk of these things rationally but in the dead of night it is a different matter so i went down a few steps to make sure of that armour when suddenly something passed me on the stairs i did not hear it i did not see it i sensed it in no way i just knew that something had passed me on its way upstairs i realized that my retreat was cut off and with the knowledge fear came upon me i had seen someone come down the stairs that at any rate was definite now i wanted to see him again any ghost is bad enough but a ghost that one can see is better than one that one cant i managed to get past the suit of armour but then i had to feel my way to these double doors here he indicated the direction of the doors by a curious wave of his hand he did not look toward them nor did any of the party both men and women were completely absorbed in his story they seemed to be mesmerized by the earnestness of his manner only the girl was restless she gave an impression of impatience with the slowness with which he came to his point one would have said that she was apart from her fellows an alien among strangers so dense was the darkness that i made sure of finding the first door closed but it was not it was wide open and standing between them i could feel that the other was open too i was standing literally in the wall of the house and as i peered into the room trying to make out some familiar object thoughts ran through my mind of people who had been bricked up in walls and left there to die for a moment i caught the spirit of the inside of a thick wall then suddenly i felt the sensation i have often read about but never experienced before i knew there was someone in the room you are surprised yes but wait i knew more i knew that that someone was conscious of my presence it occurred to me that whoever it was might want to get out of the door i made room for him to pass i waited for him made sure of him began to feel giddy and then a mans voice deep and clear there is someone there who is it i answered mechanically george grady im joseph a match was drawn across a matchbox and i saw the boy bending over a candle waiting for the wick to catch for a moment i thought he must be walking in his sleep but he turned to me quite naturally and said in his own boyish voice lost anything i was amazed at the lads complete calm i wanted to share my fright with someone instead i had to hide it from this boy i was conscious of a curious sense of shame i had watched him grow taught him praised him scolded him and yet here he was waiting for an explanation of my presence in the diningroom at that odd hour of the night soon he repeated the question lost anything no i said and then i stammered have you no he said with a little laugh its that room i cant sleep in it oh i said whats the matter with the room its the room i was killed in he said quite simply of course i had heard about his dreams but i had had no direct experience of them when therefore he said that he had been killed in his room i took it for granted that he had been dreaming again i was at a loss to know quite how to tackle him whether to treat the whole thing as absurd and laugh it off as such or whether to humour him and hear his story i got him upstairs to my room sat him in a big armchair and poked the fire into a blaze youve been dreaming again i said bluntly oh no i havent dont you run away with that idea his whole manner was so grown up that it was quite unthinkable to treat him as the child he really was in fact it was a little uncanny this man in a childs frame i was killed there he said again how do you mean killed i asked him why killed murdered of course it was years and years ago i cant say when still i remember the room i suppose it was the room that reminded me of the incident incident i exclaimed what else being killed is only an incident in the existence of anyone one makes a fuss about it at the time of course but really when you come to think of it tell me about it i said lighting a cigarette he lit one too that child and began you know my room is the only modern one in this old house nobody knows why it is modern the reason is obvious of course it was made modern after i was killed there the funny thing is that i should have been put there i suppose it was done for a purpose because i i he looked at me so fixedly i knew he would catch me if i lied what i asked dream yes i said that is why you were put there i thought so and yet of all the rooms but then of course no one knew anyhow i did not recognize the room until after i was in bed i had been asleep some time and then i woke suddenly there is an old wheelback chair there the only old thing in the room it is standing facing the fire as it must have stood the night i was killed the fire was burning brightly the pattern of the back of the chair was thrown in shadow across the ceiling now the night i was murdered the conditions were exactly the same so directly i saw that pattern on the ceiling i remembered the whole thing i was not dreaming dont think it i was not what happened that night was this i was lying in bed counting the parts of the back of that chair in shadow on the ceiling i probably could not get to sleep you know the sort of thing count up to a thousand and remember in the morning where you got to well i was counting those pieces when suddenly they were obliterated the whole back became a shadow someone was sitting in the chair now surely you understand that directly i saw the shadow of that chair on the ceiling tonight i realized that i had not a moment to lose at any moment that same person might come back to that same chair and escape would be impossible i slipped from my bed as quickly as i could and ran downstairs but were you not afraid i askeddownstairs that she might follow me it was a woman you know no i dont think i was she does not belong downstairs anyhow she didnt no i said no my voice must have been out of control for he caught me up at once you dont mean to say you saw her he said vehemently oh no you felt her she passed me as i came downstairs i said what can i have done to her that she follows me so he buried his face in his hands as though searching for an answer to his thought suddenly he looked up and stared at me where had i got to oh yes the murder i can remember it all distinctly you can imagine how startled i was to see that shadow in the chair startled you know but not really frightened i leaned up in bed and looked at the chair and sure enough a woman was sitting in it a young woman i watched her with a profound interest until she began to turn in her chair as i felt to look at me when she did that i shrank back in bed i dared not meet her eyes she might not have had eyes she might not have had a face you know the sort of pictures that one sees when one glances back at all ones soul has ever thought i got back in the bed as far as i could and peeped over the sheets at the shadow on the ceiling i was tired frightened to death i grew weary of watching i must have fallen asleep for suddenly the fire was almost out the pattern of the chair barely discernible the shadow had gone i raised myself with a sense of huge relief yes the chair was empty but just think of it the woman was on the floor on her hands and knees crawling toward the bed i fell back stricken with terror very soon i felt a gentle pull at the counterpane i thought i was in a nightmare but too lazy or too comfortable to try to wake myself from it i waited in an agony of suspense but nothing seemed to be happening in fact i had just persuaded myself that the movement of the counterpane was fancy when a hand brushed softly over my knee there was no mistaking it i could feel the long thin fingers now was the time to do something i tried to rouse myself but all my efforts were futile i was stiff from head to foot although the hand was lost to me outwardly it now came within my range of knowledge if you know what i mean i knew that it was groping its way along the bed feeling for some other part of me at any moment i could have said exactly where it had got to when it was hovering just over my chest another hand knocked lightly against my shoulder i fancied it lost and wandering in search of its fellow i was lying on my back staring at the ceiling when the hands met the weight of their presence brought a feeling of oppression to my chest i seemed to be completely cut off from my body i had no sort of connection with any part of it nothing about me would respond to my will to make it move there was no sound at all anywhere i fell into a state of indifference a sort of patient indifference that can wait for an appointed time to come how long i waited i cannot say but when the time came it found me ready i was not taken by surprise there was a great upward rush of pentup force released it was like a mighty mass of men who have been lost in prayer rising to their feet i cant remember clearly but i think the woman must have got on to my bed i could not follow her distinctly my whole attention was concentrated on her hands all the time i felt those fingers itching for my throat at last they moved slowly at first then quicker and then a longdrawn swish like the sound of an overbold wave that has broken too far up the beach and is sweeping back to join the sea the boy was silent for a moment then he stretched out his hand for the cigarettes you remember nothing else i asked him no he said the next thing i remember clearly is deliberately breaking the nursery window because it was raining and mother would not let me go out there was a moments tension then the strain of listening passed and everyone seemed to be speaking at once the rector was taking the story seriously tell me grady he said how long do you suppose elapsed between the boys murder and his breaking the nursery window but a young married woman in the first flush of her happiness broke in between them she ridiculed the whole idea of course the boy was dreaming she was drawing the majority to her way of thinking when from the corner where the girl sat a hollowsounding voice and the boy where is he the tone of the girls voice inspired horror that fear that does not know what it is it fears one could see it on every face on every face that is but the face of the baldheaded little man there was no horror on his face he was smiling serenely as he looked the girl straight in the eyes hes a man now he said alive she cried why not said the little old man rubbing his hands together she tried to rise but her frock had got caught between the chairs and pulled her to her seat again the man next her put out his hand to steady her but she dashed it away roughly she looked round the party for an instant for all the world like an animal at bay then she sprang to her feet and charged blindly they crowded round her to prevent her falling at the touch of their hands she stopped she was out of breath as though she had been running all right she said pushing their hands from her all right ill come quietly i did it they caught her as she fell and laid her on the sofa watching the colour fade from her face the hostess an old woman with white hair and a kind face approached the little old man for once in her life she was roused to anger i cant think how you could be so stupid she said see what you have done i did it for a purpose he said for a purpose i have always thought that girl was the culprit i have to thank you for the opportunity you have given me of making sure iv the horla guy de maupassant may th what a lovely day i have spent all the morning lying in the grass in front of my house under the enormous plantain tree which covers it and shades and shelters the whole of it i like this part of the country and i am fond of living here because i am attached to it by deep roots profound and delicate roots which attach a man to the soil on which his ancestors were born and died which attach him to what people think and what they eat to the usages as well as to the food local expression the peculiar language of the peasants to the smell of the soil of the villages and of the atmosphere itself i love my house in which i grew up from my windows i can see the seine which flows by the side of my garden on the other side of the road almost through my grounds the great and wide seine which goes to rouen and havre and which is covered with boats passing to and fro on the left down yonder lies rouen that large town with its blue roofs under its pointed gothic towers they are innumerable delicate or broad dominated by the spire of the cathedral and full of bells which sound through the blue air on fine mornings sending their sweet and distant iron clang to me their metallic sound which the breeze wafts in my direction now stronger and now weaker according as the wind is stronger or lighter what a delicious morning it was about eleven oclock a long line of boats drawn by a steam tug as big as a fly and which scarcely puffed while emitting its thick smoke passed my gate after two english schooners whose red flag fluttered toward the sky there came a magnificent brazilian threemaster it was perfectly white and wonderfully clean and shining i saluted it i hardly know why except that the sight of the vessel gave me great pleasure may th i have had a slight feverish attack for the last few days and i feel ill or rather i feel lowspirited whence do these mysterious influences come which change our happiness into discouragement and our selfconfidence into diffidence one might almost say that the air the invisible air is full of unknowable forces whose mysterious presence we have to endure i wake up in the best spirits with an inclination to sing in my throat why i go down by the side of the water and suddenly after walking a short distance i return home wretched as if some misfortune were awaiting me there why is it a cold shiver which passing over my skin has upset my nerves and given me low spirits is it the form of the clouds or the colour of the sky or the colour of the surrounding objects which is so changeable which have troubled my thoughts as they passed before my eyes who can tell everything that surrounds us everything that we see without looking at it everything that we touch without knowing it everything that we handle without feeling it all that we meet without clearly distinguishing it has a rapid surprising and inexplicable effect upon us and upon our organs and through them on our ideas and on our heart itself how profound that mystery of the invisible is we cannot fathom it with our miserable senses with our eyes which are unable to perceive what is either too small or too great too near to or too far from us neither the inhabitants of a star nor of a drop of water with our ears that deceive us for they transmit to us the vibrations of the air in sonorous notes they are fairies who work the miracle of changing that movement into noise and by that metamorphosis give birth to music which makes the mute agitation of nature musical with our sense of smell which is smaller than that of a dog with our sense of taste which can scarcely distinguish the age of a wine oh if we only had other organs which would work other miracles in our favour what a number of fresh things we might discover around us may th i am ill decidedly i was so well last month i am feverish horribly feverish or rather i am in a state of feverish enervation which makes my mind suffer as much as my body i have without ceasing that horrible sensation of some danger threatening me that apprehension of some coming misfortune or of approaching death that presentiment which is no doubt an attack of some illness which is still unknown which germinates in the flesh and in the blood may th i have just come from consulting my medical man for i could no longer get any sleep he found that my pulse was high my eyes dilated my nerves highly strung but no alarming symptoms i must have a course of showerbaths and of bromide of potassium may th no change my state is really very peculiar as the evening comes on an incomprehensible feeling of disquietude seizes me just as if night concealed some terrible menace toward me i dine quickly and then try to read but i do not understand the words and can scarcely distinguish the letters then i walk up and down my drawingroom oppressed by a feeling of confused and irresistible fear the fear of sleep and fear of my bed about ten oclock i go up to my room as soon as i have got in i double lock and bolt it i am frightened of what up till the present time i have been frightened of nothing i open my cupboards and look under my bed i listen i listen to what how strange it is that a simple feeling of discomfort impeded or heightened circulation perhaps the irritation of a nervous thread a slight congestion a small disturbance in the imperfect and delicate functions of our living machinery can turn the most lighthearted of men into a melancholy one and make a coward of the bravest then i go to bed and i wait for sleep as a man might wait for the executioner i wait for its coming with dread and my heart beats and my legs tremble while my whole body shivers beneath the warmth of the bedclothes until the moment when i suddenly fall asleep as one would throw oneself into a pool of stagnant water in order to drown oneself i do not feel coming over me as i used to do formerly this perfidious sleep which is close to me and watching me which is going to seize me by the head to close my eyes and annihilate me i sleep a long time two or three hours perhaps then a dream no a nightmare lays hold on me i feel that i am in bed and asleep i feel it and i know it and i feel also that somebody is coming close to me is looking at me touching me is getting on to my bed is kneeling on my chest is taking my neck between his hands and squeezing it squeezing it with all his might in order to strangle me i struggle bound by that terrible powerlessness which paralyzes us in our dreams i try to cry out but i cannot i want to move i cannot i try with the most violent efforts and out of breath to turn over and throw off this being which is crushing and suffocating me i cannot and then suddenly i wake up shaken and bathed in perspiration i light a candle and find that i am alone and after that crisis which occurs every night i at length fall asleep and slumber tranquilly till morning june d my state has grown worse what is the matter with me the bromide does me no good and the showerbaths have no effect whatever sometimes in order to tire myself out though i am fatigued enough already i go for a walk in the forest of roumare i used to think at first that the fresh light and soft air impregnated with the odour of herbs and leaves would instill new blood into my veins and impart fresh energy to my heart i turned into a broad ride in the wood and then i turned toward la bouille through a narrow path between two rows of exceedingly tall trees which placed a thick green almost black roof between the sky and me a sudden shiver ran through me not a cold shiver but a shiver of agony and so i hastened my steps uneasy at being alone in the wood frightened stupidly and without reason at the profound solitude suddenly it seemed to me as if i were being followed that somebody was walking at my heels close quite close to me near enough to touch me i turned round suddenly but i was alone i saw nothing behind me except the straight broad ride empty and bordered by high trees horribly empty on the other side it also extended until it was lost in the distance and looked just the same terrible i closed my eyes why and then i began to turn round on one heel very quickly just like a top i nearly fell down and opened my eyes the trees were dancing round me and the earth heaved i was obliged to sit down then ah i no longer remembered how i had come what a strange idea what a strange strange idea i did not the least know i started off to the right and got back into the avenue which had led me into the middle of the forest june d i have had a terrible night i shall go away for a few weeks for no doubt a journey will set me up again july d i have come back quite cured and have had a most delightful trip into the bargain i have been to mont saintmichel which i had not seen before what a sight when one arrives as i did at avranches toward the end of the day the town stands on a hill and i was taken into the public garden at the extremity of the town i uttered a cry of astonishment an extraordinary large bay lay extended before me as far as my eyes could reach between two hills which were lost to sight in the mist and in the middle of this immense yellow bay under a clear golden sky a peculiar hill rose up sombre and pointed in the midst of the sand the sun had just disappeared and under the still flaming sky the outline of that fantastic rock stood out which bears on its summit a fantastic monument at daybreak i went to it the tide was low as it had been the night before and i saw that wonderful abbey rise up before me as i approached it after several hours walking i reached the enormous mass of rocks which supports the little town dominated by the great church having climbed the steep and narrow street i entered the most wonderful gothic building that has ever been built to god on earth as large as a town full of low rooms which seem buried beneath vaulted roofs and lofty galleries supported by delicate columns i entered this gigantic granite jewel which is as light as a bit of lace covered with towers with slender belfries to which spiral staircases ascend and which raise their strange heads that bristle with chimeras with devils with fantastic animals with monstrous flowers and which are joined together by finely carved arches to the blue sky by day and to the black sky by night when i had reached the summit i said to the monk who accompanied me father how happy you must be here and he replied it is very windy monsieur and so we began to talk while watching the rising tide which ran over the sand and covered it with a steel cuirass and then the monk told me stories all the old stories belonging to the place legends nothing but legends one of them struck me forcibly the country people those belonging to the mornet declare that at night one can hear talking going on in the sand and then that one hears two goats bleat one with a strong the other with a weak voice incredulous people declare that it is nothing but the cry of the sea birds which occasionally resembles bleatings and occasionally human lamentations but belated fishermen swear that they have met an old shepherd whose head which is covered by his cloak they can never see wandering on the downs between two tides round the little town placed so far out of the world and who is guiding and walking before them a hegoat with a mans face and a shegoat with a womans face and both of them with white hair and talking incessantly quarrelling in a strange language and then suddenly ceasing to talk in order to bleat with all their might do you believe it i asked the monk i scarcely know he replied and i continued if there are other beings besides ourselves on this earth how comes it that we have not known it for so long a time or why have you not seen them how is it that i have not seen them he replied do we see the hundred thousandth part of what exists look here there is the wind which is the strongest force in nature which knocks down men and blows down buildings uproots trees raises the sea into mountains of water destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers the wind which kills which whistles which sighs which roars have you ever seen it and can you see it it exists for all that however i was silent before this simple reasoning the man was a philosopher or perhaps a fool i could not say which exactly so i held my tongue what he had said had often been in my own thoughts july d i have slept badly certainly there is some feverish influence here for my coachman is suffering in the same way as i am when i went back home yesterday i noticed his singular paleness and i asked him what is the matter with you jean the matter is that i never get any rest and my nights devour my days since your departure monsieur there has been a spell over me however the other servants are all well but i am very frightened of having another attack myself july th i am decidedly taken again for my old nightmares have returned last night i felt somebody leaning on me who was sucking my life from between my lips with his mouth yes he was sucking it out of my neck like a leech would have done then he got up satiated and i woke up so beaten crushed and annihilated that i could not move if this continues for a few days i shall certainly go away again july th have i lost my reason what has happened what i saw last night is so strange that my head wanders when i think of it as i do now every evening i had locked my door and then being thirsty i drank half a glass of water and i accidentally noticed that the water bottle was full up to the cutglass stopper then i went to bed and fell into one of my terrible sleeps from which i was aroused in about two hours by a still more terrible shock picture to yourself a sleeping man who is being murdered and who wakes up with a knife in his chest and who is rattling in his throat covered with blood and who can no longer breathe and is going to die and does not understand anything at all about it there it is having recovered my senses i was thirsty again so i lit a candle and went to the table on which my water bottle was i lifted it up and tilted it over my glass but nothing came out it was empty it was completely empty at first i could not understand it at all and then suddenly i was seized by such a terrible feeling that i had to sit down or rather i fell into a chair then i sprang up with a bound to look about me and then i sat down again overcome by astonishment and fear in front of the transparent crystal bottle i looked at it with fixed eyes trying to conjecture and my hands trembled somebody had drunk the water but who i i without any doubt it could surely only be i in that case i was a somnambulist i lived without knowing it that double mysterious life which makes us doubt whether there are not two beings in us or whether a strange unknowable and invisible being does not at such moments when our soul is in a state of torpor animate our captive body which obeys this other being as it does us ourselves and more than it does ourselves oh who will understand my horrible agony who will understand the emotion of a man who is sound in mind wide awake full of sound sense and who looks in horror at the remains of a little water that has disappeared while he was asleep through the glass of a water bottle and i remained there until it was daylight without venturing to go to bed again july th i am going mad again all the contents of my water bottle have been drunk during the night or rather i have drunk it but is it i is it i who could it be who oh god am i going mad who will save me july th i have just been through some surprising ordeals decidedly i am mad and yet on july th before going to bed i put some wine milk water bread and strawberries on my table somebody drank i drank all the water and a little of the milk but neither the wine bread nor the strawberries were touched on the seventh of july i renewed the same experiment with the same results and on july th i left out the water and the milk and nothing was touched lastly on july th i put only water and milk on my table taking care to wrap up the bottles in white muslin and to tie down the stoppers then i rubbed my lips my beard and my hands with pencil lead and went to bed irresistible sleep seized me which was soon followed by a terrible awakening i had not moved and my sheets were not marked i rushed to the table the muslin round the bottles remained intact i undid the string trembling with fear all the water had been drunk and so had the milk ah great god i must start for paris immediately july th paris i must have lost my head during the last few days i must be the plaything of my enervated imagination unless i am really a somnambulist or that i have been brought under the power of one of those influences which have been proved to exist but which have hitherto been inexplicable which are called suggestions in any case my mental state bordered on madness and twentyfour hours of paris sufficed to restore me to my equilibrium yesterday after doing some business and paying some visits which instilled fresh and invigorating mental air into me i wound up my evening at the thtre franais a play by alexandre dumas the younger was being acted and his active and powerful mind completed my cure certainly solitude is dangerous for active minds we require men who can think and can talk around us when we are alone for a long time we people space with phantoms i returned along the boulevards to my hotel in excellent spirits amid the jostling of the crowd i thought not without irony of my terrors and surmises of the previous week because i believed yes i believed that an invisible being lived beneath my roof how weak our head is and how quickly it is terrified and goes astray as soon as we are struck by a small incomprehensible fact instead of concluding with these simple words i do not understand because the cause escapes me we immediately imagine terrible mysteries and supernatural powers july th fte of the republic i walked through the streets and the crackers and flags amused me like a child still it is very foolish to be merry on a fixed date by a government decree the populace is an imbecile flock of sheep now steadily patient and now in ferocious revolt say to it amuse yourself and it amuses itself say to it go and fight with your neighbour and it goes and fights say to it vote for the emperor and it votes for the emperor and then say to it vote for the republic and it votes for the republic those who direct it are also stupid but instead of obeying men they obey principles which can only be stupid sterile and false for the very reason that they are principles that is to say ideas which are considered as certain and unchangeable in this world where one is certain of nothing since light is an illusion and noise is an illusion july th i saw some things yesterday that troubled me very much i was dining at my cousins madame sabl whose husband is colonel of the th chasseurs at limoges there were two young women there one of whom had married a medical man dr parent who devotes himself a great deal to nervous diseases and the extraordinary manifestations to which at this moment experiments in hypnotism and suggestion give rise he related to us at some length the enormous results obtained by english scientists and the doctors of the medical school at nancy and the facts which he adduced appeared to me so strange that i declared that i was altogether incredulous we are he declared on the point of discovering one of the most important secrets of nature i mean to say one of its most important secrets on this earth for there are certainly some which are of a different kind of importance up in the stars yonder ever since man has thought since he has been able to express and write down his thoughts he has felt himself close to a mystery which is impenetrable to his coarse and imperfect senses and he endeavours to supplement the want of power of his organs by the efforts of his intellect as long as that intellect still remained in its elementary stage this intercourse with invisible spirits assumed forms which were commonplace though terrifying thence sprang the popular belief in the supernatural the legends of wandering spirits of fairies of gnomes ghosts i might even say the legend of god for our conceptions of the workmancreator from whatever religion they may have come down to us are certainly the most mediocre the stupidest and the most unacceptable inventions that ever sprang from the frightened brain of any human creatures nothing is truer than what voltaire says god made man in his own image but man has certainly paid him back again but for rather more than a century men seem to have had a presentiment of something new mesmer and some others have put us on an unexpected track and especially within the last two or three years we have arrived at really surprising results my cousin who is also very incredulous smiled and dr parent said to her would you like me to try and send you to sleep madame yes certainly she sat down in an easychair and he began to look at her fixedly so as to fascinate her i suddenly felt myself somewhat uncomfortable with a beating heart and a choking feeling in my throat i saw that madame sabls eyes were growing heavy her mouth twitched and her bosom heaved and at the end of ten minutes she was asleep stand behind her the doctor said to me and so i took a seat behind her he put a visiting card into her hands and said to her this is a lookingglass what do you see in it and she replied i see my cousin what is he doing he is twisting his moustache and now he is taking a photograph out of his pocket whose photograph is it his own that was true and that photograph had been given me that same evening at the hotel what is his attitude in this portrait he is standing up with his hat in his hand so she saw on that card on that piece of white pasteboard as if she had seen it in a looking glass the young women were frightened and exclaimed that is quite enough quite quite enough but the doctor said to her authoritatively you will get up at eight oclock tomorrow morning then you will go and call on your cousin at his hotel and ask him to lend you five thousand francs which your husband demands of you and which he will ask for when he sets out on his coming journey then he woke her up on returning to my hotel i thought over this curious sance and i was assailed by doubts not as to my cousins absolute and undoubted good faith for i had known her as well as if she had been my own sister ever since she was a child but as to a possible trick on the doctors part had not he perhaps kept a glass hidden in his hand which he showed to the young woman in her sleep at the same time as he did the card professional conjurers do things which are just as singular so i went home and to bed and this morning at about half past eight i was awakened by my footman who said to me madame sabl has asked to see you immediately monsieur so i dressed hastily and went to her she sat down in some agitation with her eyes on the floor and without raising her veil she said to me my dear cousin i am going to ask a great favour of you what is it cousin i do not like to tell you and yet i must i am in absolute want of five thousand francs what you yes i or rather my husband who has asked me to procure them for him i was so stupefied that i stammered out my answers i asked myself whether she had not really been making fun of me with doctor parent if it were not merely a very wellacted farce which had been got up beforehand on looking at her attentively however my doubts disappeared she was trembling with grief so painful was this step to her and i was sure that her throat was full of sobs i knew that she was very rich and so i continued what has not your husband five thousand francs at his disposal come think are you sure that he commissioned you to ask me for them she hesitated for a few seconds as if she were making a great effort to search her memory and then she replied yes yes i am quite sure of it he has written to you she hesitated again and reflected and i guessed the torture of her thoughts she did not know she only knew that she was to borrow five thousand francs of me for her husband so she told a lie yes he has written to me when pray you did not mention it to me yesterday i received his letter this morning can you show it me no no no it contained private matters things too personal to ourselves i burnt it so your husband runs into debt she hesitated again and then murmured i do not know thereupon i said bluntly i have not five thousand francs at my disposal at this moment my dear cousin she uttered a kind of cry as if she were in pain and said oh oh i beseech you i beseech you to get them for me she got excited and clasped her hands as if she were praying to me i heard her voice change its tone she wept and stammered harassed and dominated by the irresistible order that she had received oh oh i beg you to if you knew what i am suffering i want them today i had pity on her you shall have them by and by i swear to you oh thank you thank you how kind you are i continued do you remember what took place at your house last night yes do you remember that doctor parent sent you to sleep yes oh very well then he ordered you to come to me this morning to borrow five thousand francs and at this moment you are obeying that suggestion she considered for a few moments and then replied but as it is my husband who wants them for a whole hour i tried to convince her but could not succeed and when she had gone i went to the doctor he was just going out and he listened to me with a smile and said do you believe now yes i cannot help it let us go to your cousins she was already dozing on a couch overcome with fatigue the doctor felt her pulse looked at her for some time with one hand raised toward her eyes which she closed by degrees under the irresistible power of this influence and when she was asleep he said your husband does not require the five thousand francs any longer you must therefore forget that you asked your cousin to lend them to you and if he speaks to you about it you will not understand him then he woke her up and i took out a pocketbook and said here is what you asked me for this morning my dear cousin but she was so surprised that i did not venture to persist nevertheless i tried to recall the circumstance to her but she denied it vigorously thought that i was making fun of her and in the end very nearly lost her temper there i have just come back and i have not been able to eat any lunch for this experiment has altogether upset me july th many people to whom i have told the adventure have laughed at me i no longer know what to think the wise man says perhaps july st i dined at bougival and then i spent the evening at a boatmens ball decidedly everything depends on place and surroundings it would be the height of folly to believe in the supernatural on the le de la grenouillire but on the top of mont saintmichel and in india we are terribly under the influence of our surroundings i shall return home next week frog island july th i came back to my own house yesterday everything is going on well august d nothing fresh it is splendid weather and i spend my days in watching the seine flow past august th quarrels among my servants they declare that the glasses are broken in the cupboards at night the footman accuses the cook who accuses the needlewoman who accuses the other two who is the culprit a clever person to be able to tell august th this time i am not mad i have seen i have seen i have seen i can doubt no longer i have seen it i was walking at two oclock among my rose trees in the full sunlight in the walk bordered by autumn roses which are beginning to fall as i stopped to look at a gant de bataille which had three splendid blooms i distinctly saw the stalk of one of the roses bend close to me as if an invisible hand had bent it and then break as if that hand had picked it then the flower raised itself following the curve which a hand would have described in carrying it toward a mouth and it remained suspended in the transparent air all alone and motionless a terrible red spot three yards from my eyes in desperation i rushed at it to take it i found nothing it had disappeared then i was seized with furious rage against myself for it is not allowable for a reasonable and serious man to have such hallucinations but was it a hallucination i turned round to look for the stalk and i found it immediately under the bush freshly broken between two other roses which remained on the branch and i returned home then with a much disturbed mind for i am certain now as certain as i am of the alternation of day and night that there exists close to me an invisible being that lives on milk and on water which can touch objects take them and change their places which is consequently endowed with a material nature although it is impossible to our senses and which lives as i do under my roof august th i slept tranquilly he drank the water out of my decanter but did not disturb my sleep i ask myself whether i am mad as i was walking just now in the sun by the riverside doubts as to my own sanity arose in me not vague doubts such as i have had hitherto but precise and absolute doubts i have seen mad people and i have known some who have been quite intelligent lucid even clearsighted in every concern of life except on one point they spoke clearly readily profoundly on everything when suddenly their thoughts struck upon the breakers of their madness and broke to pieces there and were dispersed and foundered in that furious and terrible sea full of bounding waves fogs and squalls which is called madness i certainly should think that i was mad absolutely mad if i were not conscious did not perfectly know my state if i did fathom it by analyzing it with the most complete lucidity i should in fact be a reasonable man who was labouring under a hallucination some unknown disturbance must have been excited in my brain one of those disturbances which physiologists of the present day try to note and to fix precisely and that disturbance must have caused a profound gulf in my mind and in the order and logic of my ideas similar phenomena occur in the dreams which lead us through the most unlikely phantasmagoria without causing us any surprise because our verifying apparatus and our sense of control has gone to sleep while our imaginative faculty wakes and works is it not possible that one of the imperceptible keys of the cerebral fingerboard has been paralyzed in me some men lose the recollection of proper names or of verbs or of numbers or merely of dates in consequence of an accident the localization of all the particles of thought has been proved nowadays what then would there be surprising in the fact that my faculty of controlling the unreality of certain hallucinations should be destroyed for the time being i thought of all this as i walked by the side of the water the sun was shining brightly on the river and made earth delightful while it filled my looks with love for life for the swallows whose agility is always delightful in my eyes for the plants by the riverside whose rustling is a pleasure to my ears by degrees however an inexplicable feeling of discomfort seized me it seemed to me as if some unknown force were numbing and stopping me were preventing me from going farther and were calling me back i felt that painful wish to return which oppresses you when you have left a beloved invalid at home and when you are seized by a presentiment that he is worse i therefore returned in spite of myself feeling certain that i should find some bad news awaiting me a letter or a telegram there was nothing however and i was more surprised and uneasy than if i had had another fantastic vision august th i spent a terrible evening yesterday he does not show himself any more but i feel that he is near me watching me looking at me penetrating me dominating me and more redoubtable when he hides himself thus than if he were to manifest his constant and invisible presence by supernatural phenomena however i slept august th nothing but i am afraid august th nothing what will happen tomorrow august th still nothing i cannot stop at home with this fear hanging over me and these thoughts in my mind i shall go away august th ten oclock at night all day long i have been trying to get away and have not been able i wished to accomplish this simple and easy act of liberty go out get into my carriage in order to go to rouen and i have not been able to do it what is the reason august th when one is attacked by certain maladies all the springs of our physical being appear to be broken all our energies destroyed all our muscles relaxed our bones to have become as soft as our flesh and our blood as liquid as water i am experiencing that in my moral being in a strange and distressing manner i have no longer any strength any courage any selfcontrol nor even any power to set my own will in motion i have no power left to will anything but someone does it for me and i obey august th i am lost somebody possesses my soul and governs it somebody orders all my acts all my movements all my thoughts i am no longer anything in myself nothing except an enslaved and terrified spectator of all the things which i do i wish to go out i cannot he does not wish to and so i remain trembling and distracted in the armchair in which he keeps me sitting i merely wish to get up and to rouse myself so as to think that i am still master of myself i cannot i am riveted to my chair and my chair adheres to the ground in such a manner that no force could move us then suddenly i must i must go to the bottom of my garden to pick some strawberries and eat them and i go there i pick the strawberries and i eat them oh my god my god is there a god if there be one deliver me save me succour me pardon pity mercy save me oh what sufferings what torture what horror august th certainly this is the way in which my poor cousin was possessed and swayed when she came to borrow five thousand francs of me she was under the power of a strange will which had entered into her like another soul like another parasitic and ruling soul is the world coming to an end but who is he this invisible being that rules me this unknowable being this rover of a supernatural race invisible beings exist then how is it then that since the beginning of the world they have never manifested themselves in such a manner precisely as they do to me i have never read anything which resembles what goes on in my house oh if i could only leave it if i could only go away and flee so as never to return i should be saved but i cannot august th i managed to escape today for two hours like a prisoner who finds the door of his dungeon accidentally open i suddenly felt that i was free and that he was far away and so i gave orders to put the horses in as quickly as possible and i drove to rouen oh how delightful to be able to say to a man who obeyed you go to rouen i made him pull up before the library and i begged them to lend me dr herrmann herestausss treatise on the unknown inhabitants of the ancient and modern world then as i was getting into my carriage i intended to say to the railway station but instead of this i shouted i did not say but i shouted in such a loud voice that all the passersby turned round home and i fell back onto the cushion of my carriage overcome by mental agony he had found me out and regained possession of me august th oh what a night what a night and yet it seems to me that i ought to rejoice i read until one oclock in the morning herestauss doctor of philosophy and theogony wrote the history and the manifestation of all those invisible beings which hover around man or of whom he dreams he describes their origin their domains their power but none of them resembles the one which haunts me one might say that man ever since he has thought has had a foreboding of and feared a new being stronger than himself his successor in this world and that feeling him near and not being able to foretell the nature of that master he has in his terror created the whole race of hidden beings of vague phantoms born of fear having therefore read until one oclock in the morning i went and sat down at the open window in order to cool my forehead and my thoughts in the calm night air it was very pleasant and warm how i should have enjoyed such a night formerly there was no moon but the stars darted out their rays in the dark heavens who inhabits those worlds what forms what living beings what animals are there yonder what do those who are thinkers in those distant worlds know more than we do what can they do more than we can what do they see which we do not know will not one of them some day or other traversing space appear on our earth to conquer it just as the norsemen formerly crossed the sea in order to subjugate nations more feeble than themselves we are so weak so unarmed so ignorant so small we who live on this particle of mud which turns round in a drop of water i fell asleep dreaming thus in the cool night air and then having slept for about three quarters of an hour i opened my eyes without moving awakened by i know not what confused and strange sensation at first i saw nothing and then suddenly it appeared to me as if a page of a book which had remained open on my table turned over of its own accord not a breath of air had come in at my window and i was surprised and waited in about four minutes i saw i saw yes i saw with my own eyes another page lift itself up and fall down on the others as if a finger had turned it over my armchair was empty appeared empty but i knew that he was there he and sitting in my place and that he was reading with a furious bound the bound of an enraged wild beast that wishes to disembowel its tamer i crossed my room to seize him to strangle him to kill him but before i could reach it my chair fell over as if somebody had run away from me my table rocked my lamp fell and went out and my window closed as if some thief had been surprised and had fled out into the night shutting it behind him so he had run away he had been afraid he afraid of me so so tomorrow or later some day or other i should be able to hold him in my clutches and crush him against the ground do not dogs occasionally bite and strangle their masters august th i have been thinking the whole day long oh yes i will obey him follow his impulses fulfill all his wishes show myself humble submissive a coward he is the stronger but an hour will come august th i know i know i know all i have just read the following in the revue de monde scientifique a curious piece of news comes to us from rio de janeiro madness an epidemic of madness which may be compared to that contagious madness which attacked the people of europe in the middle ages is at this moment raging in the province of sanpaulo the frightened inhabitants are leaving their houses deserting their villages abandoning their land saying that they are pursued possessed governed like human cattle by invisible though tangible beings a species of vampire which feed on their life while they are asleep and who besides drink water and milk without appearing to touch any other nourishment professor dom pedro henriques accompanied by several medical savants has gone to the province of sanpaulo in order to study the origin and the manifestations of this surprising madness on the spot and to propose such measures to the emperor as may appear to him to be most fitted to restore the mad population to reason ah ah i remember now that fine brazilian threemaster which passed in front of my windows as it was going up the seine on the th of last may i thought it looked so pretty so white and bright that being was on board of her coming from there where its race sprang from and it saw me it saw my house which was also white and it sprang from the ship onto the land oh good heavens now i know i can divine the reign of man is over and he has come he whom disquieted priests exorcised whom sorcerers evoked on dark nights without yet seeing him appear to whom the presentiments of the transient masters of the world lent all the monstrous or graceful forms of gnomes spirits genii fairies and familiar spirits after the coarse conceptions of primitive fear more clearsighted men foresaw it more clearly mesmer divined him and ten years ago physicians accurately discovered the nature of his power even before he exercised it himself they played with that weapon of their new lord the sway of a mysterious will over the human soul which had become enslaved they called it magnetism hypnotism suggestion what do i know i have seen them amusing themselves like impudent children with this horrible power woe to us woe to man he has come the the what does he call himself the i fancy that he is shouting out his name to me and i do not hear him the yes he is shouting it out i am listening i cannot repeat it horla i have heard the horla it is he the horla he has come ah the vulture has eaten the pigeon the wolf has eaten the lamb the lion has devoured the buffalo with sharp horns man has killed the lion with an arrow with a sword with gunpowder but the horla will make of man what we have made of the horse and of the ox his chattel his slave and his food by the mere power of his will woe to us but nevertheless the animal sometimes revolts and kills the man who has subjugated it i should also like i shall be able to but i must know him touch him see him learned men say that beasts eyes as they differ from ours do not distinguish like ours do and my eye cannot distinguish this newcomer who is oppressing me why oh now i remember the words of the monk at mont saintmichel can we see the hundredthousandth part of what exists look here there is the wind which is the strongest force in nature which knocks down men and blows down buildings uproots trees raises the sea into mountains of water destroys cliffs and casts great ships onto the breakers the wind which kills which whistles which sighs which roars have you ever seen it and can you see it it exists for all that however and i went on thinking my eyes are so weak so imperfect that they do not even distinguish hard bodies if they are as transparent as glass if a glass without tinfoil behind it were to bar my way i should run into it just as a bird which has flown into a room breaks its head against the window panes a thousand things moreover deceive him and lead him astray how should it then be surprising that he cannot perceive a fresh body which is traversed by the light a new being why not it was assuredly bound to come why should we be the last we do not distinguish it like all the others created before us the reason is that its nature is more perfect its body finer and more finished than ours that ours is so weak so awkwardly conceived encumbered with organs that are always tired always on the strain like locks that are too complicated which lives like a plant and like a beast nourishing itself with difficulty on air herbs and flesh an animal machine which is a prey to maladies to malformations to decay brokenwinded badly regulated simple and eccentric ingeniously badly made a coarse and a delicate work the outline of a being which might become intelligent and grand we are only a few so few in this world from the oyster up to man why should there not be one more when once that period is accomplished which separates the successive apparitions from all the different species why not one more why not also other trees with immense splendid flowers perfuming whole regions why not other elements besides fire air earth and water there are four only four those nursing fathers of various beings what a pity why are they not forty four hundred four thousand how poor everything is how mean and wretched grudgingly given dryly invented clumsily made ah the elephant and the hippopotamus what grace and the camel what elegance but the butterfly you will say a flying flower i dream of one that should be as large as a hundred worlds with wings whose shape beauty colours and motion i cannot even express but i see it it flutters from star to star refreshing them and perfuming them with the light and harmonious breath of its flight and the people up there look at it as it passes in an ecstasy of delight what is the matter with me it is he the horla who haunts me and who makes me think of these foolish things he is within me he is becoming my soul i shall kill him august th i shall kill him i have seen him yesterday i sat down at my table and pretended to write very assiduously i knew quite well that he would come prowling round me quite close to me so close that i might perhaps be able to touch him to seize him and then then i should have the strength of desperation i should have my hands my knees my chest my forehead my teeth to strangle him to crush him to bite him to tear him to pieces and i watched for him with all my overexcited organs i had lighted my two lamps and the eight wax candles on my mantelpiece as if by this light i could have discovered him my bed my old oak bed with its columns was opposite to me on my right was the fireplace on my left the door which was carefully closed after i had left it open for some time in order to attract him behind me was a very high wardrobe with a lookingglass in it which served me to make my toilet every day and in which i was in the habit of looking at myself from head to foot every time i passed it so i pretended to be writing in order to deceive him for he also was watching me and suddenly i felt i was certain that he was reading over my shoulder that he was there almost touching my ear i got up so quickly with my hands extended that i almost fell eh well it was as bright as at midday but i did not see myself in the glass it was empty clear profound full of light but my figure was not reflected in it and i i was opposite to it i saw the large clear glass from top to bottom and i looked at it with unsteady eyes and i did not dare to advance i did not venture to make a movement nevertheless feeling perfectly that he was there but that he would escape me again he whose imperceptible body had absorbed my reflection how frightened i was and then suddenly i began to see myself through a mist in the depths of the lookingglass in a mist as it were through a sheet of water and it seemed to me as if this water were flowing slowly from left to right and making my figure clearer every moment it was like the end of an eclipse whatever it was that hid me did not appear to possess any clearly defined outlines but a sort of opaque transparency which gradually grew clearer at last i was able to distinguish myself completely as i do every day when i look at myself i had seen it and the horror of it remained with me and makes me shudder even now august th how could i kill it as i could not get hold of it poison but it would see me mix it with the water and then would our poisons have any effect on its impalpable body no no no doubt about the matter then then august st i sent for a blacksmith from rouen and ordered iron shutters of him for my room such as some private hotels in paris have on the ground floor for fear of thieves and he is going to make me a similar door as well i have made myself out as a coward but i do not care about that september th rouen hotel continental it is done it is done but is he dead my mind is thoroughly upset by what i have seen well then yesterday the locksmith having put on the iron shutters and door i left everything open until midnight although it was getting cold suddenly i felt that he was there and joy mad joy took possession of me i got up softly and i walked to the right and left for some time so that he might not guess anything then i took off my boots and put on my slippers carelessly then i fastened the iron shutters and going back to the door quickly i doublelocked it with a padlock putting the key into my pocket suddenly i noticed that he was moving restlessly round me that in his turn he was frightened and was ordering me to let him out i nearly yielded though i did not yet but putting my back to the door i half opened it just enough to allow me to go out backward and as i am very tall my head touched the lintel i was sure that he had not been able to escape and i shut him up quite alone quite alone what happiness i had him fast then i ran downstairs in the drawingroom which was under my bedroom i took the two lamps and i poured all the oil onto the carpet the furniture everywhere then i set fire to it and made my escape after having carefully doublelocked the door i went and hid myself at the bottom of the garden in a clump of laurel bushes how long it was how long it was everything was dark silent motionless not a breath of air and not a star but heavy banks of clouds which one could not see but which weighed oh so heavily on my soul i looked at my house and waited how long it was i already began to think that the fire had gone out of its own accord or that he had extinguished it when one of the lower windows gave way under the violence of the flames and a long soft caressing sheet of red flame mounted up the white wall and kissed it as high as the roof the light fell onto the trees the branches and the leaves and a shiver of fear pervaded them also the birds awoke a dog began to howl and it seemed to me as if the day were breaking almost immediately two other windows flew into fragments and i saw that the whole of the lower part of my house was nothing but a terrible furnace but a cry a horrible shrill heartrending cry a womans cry sounded through the night and two garret windows were opened i had forgotten the servants i saw the terrorstruck faces and their frantically waving arms then overwhelmed with horror i set off to run to the village shouting help help fire fire i met some people who were already coming onto the scene and i went back with them to see by this time the house was nothing but a horrible and magnificent funeral pile a monstrous funeral pile which lit up the whole country a funeral pile where men were burning and where he was burning also he he my prisoner that new being the new master the horla suddenly the whole roof fell in between the walls and a volcano of flames darted up to the sky through all the windows which opened onto that furnace i saw the flames darting and i thought that he was there in that kiln dead dead perhaps his body was not his body which was transparent indestructible by such means as would kill ours if he was not dead perhaps time alone has power over that invisible and redoubtable being why this transparent unrecognizable body this body belonging to a spirit if it also had to fear ills infirmities and premature destruction premature destruction all human terror springs from that after man the horla after him who can die every day at any hour at any moment by any accident he came who was only to die at his own proper hour and minute because he had touched the limits of his existence no no without any doubt he is not dead then then i suppose i must kill myself v the beast with five fingersb william f harvey when i was a little boy i once went with my father to call on adrian borlsover i played on the floor with a black spaniel while my father appealed for a subscription just before we left my father said mr borlsover may my son here shake hands with you it will be a thing to look back upon with pride when he grows to be a man i came up to the bed on which the old man was lying and put my hand in his awed by the still beauty of his face he spoke to me kindly and hoped that i should always try to please my father then he placed his right hand on my head and asked for a blessing to rest upon me amen said my father and i followed him out of the room feeling as if i wanted to cry but my father was in excellent spirits that old gentleman jim said he is the most wonderful man in the whole town for ten years he has been quite blind but i saw his eyes i said they were ever so black and shiny they werent shut up like noras puppies cant he see at all and so i learnt for the first time that a man might have eyes that looked dark and beautiful and shining without being able to see just like mrs tomlinson has big ears i said and cant hear at all except when mr tomlinson shouts jim said my father its not right to talk about a ladys ears remember what mr borlsover said about pleasing me and being a good boy that was the only time i saw adrian borlsover i soon forgot about him and the hand which he laid in blessing on my head but for a week i prayed that those dark tender eyes might see his spaniel may have puppies i said in my prayers and he will never be able to know how funny they look with their eyes all closed up please let old mr borlsover see adrian borlsover as my father had said was a wonderful man he came of an eccentric family borlsovers sons for some reason always seemed to marry very ordinary women which perhaps accounted for the fact that no borlsover had been a genius and only one borlsover had been mad but they were great champions of little causes generous patrons of odd sciences founders of querulous sects trustworthy guides to the bypath meadows of erudition adrian was an authority on the fertilization of orchids he had held at one time the family living at borlsover conyers until a congenital weakness of the lungs obliged him to seek a less rigorous climate in the sunny south coast wateringplace where i had seen him occasionally he would relieve one or other of the local clergy my father described him as a fine preacher who gave long and inspiring sermons from what many men would have considered unprofitable texts an excellent proof he would add of the truth of the doctrine of direct verbal inspiration adrian borlsover was exceedingly clever with his hands his penmanship was exquisite he illustrated all his scientific papers made his own woodcuts and carved the reredos that is at present the chief feature of interest in the church at borlsover conyers he had an exceedingly clever knack in cutting silhouettes for young ladies and paper pigs and cows for little children and made more than one complicated wind instrument of his own devising when he was fifty years old adrian borlsover lost his sight in a wonderfully short time he had adapted himself to the new conditions of life he quickly learned to read braille so marvellous indeed was his sense of touch that he was still able to maintain his interest in botany the mere passing of his long supple fingers over a flower was sufficient means for its identification though occasionally he would use his lips i have found several letters of his among my fathers correspondence in no case was there anything to show that he was afflicted with blindness and this in spite of the fact that he exercised undue economy in the spacing of lines toward the close of his life the old man was credited with powers of touch that seemed almost uncanny it has been said that he could tell at once the colour of a ribbon placed between his fingers my father would neither confirm nor deny the story i adrian borlsover was a bachelor his elder brother george had married late in life leaving one son eustace who lived in the gloomy georgian mansion at borlsover conyers where he could work undisturbed in collecting material for his great book on heredity like his uncle he was a remarkable man the borlsovers had always been born naturalists but eustace possessed in a special degree the power of systematizing his knowledge he had received his university education in germany and then after postgraduate work in vienna and naples had travelled for four years in south america and the east getting together a huge store of material for a new study into the processes of variation he lived alone at borlsover conyers with saunders his secretary a man who bore a somewhat dubious reputation in the district but whose powers as a mathematician combined with his business abilities were invaluable to eustace uncle and nephew saw little of each other the visits of eustace were confined to a week in the summer or autumn long weeks that dragged almost as slowly as the bathchair in which the old man was drawn along the sunny sea front in their way the two men were fond of each other though their intimacy would doubtless have been greater had they shared the same religious views adrian held to the oldfashioned evangelical dogmas of his early manhood his nephew for many years had been thinking of embracing buddhism both men possessed too the reticence the borlsovers had always shown and which their enemies sometimes called hypocrisy with adrian it was a reticence as to the things he had left undone but with eustace it seemed that the curtain which he was so careful to leave undrawn hid something more than a halfempty chamber two years before his death adrian borlsover developed unknown to himself the not uncommon power of automatic writing eustace made the discovery by accident adrian was sitting reading in bed the forefinger of his left hand tracing the braille characters when his nephew noticed that a pencil the old man held in his right hand was moving slowly along the opposite page he left his seat in the window and sat down beside the bed the right hand continued to move and now he could see plainly that they were letters and words which it was forming adrian borlsover wrote the hand eustace borlsover george borlsover francis borlsover sigismund borlsover adrian borlsover eustace borlsover saville borlsover b for borlsover honesty is the best policy beautiful belinda borlsover what curious nonsense said eustace to himself king george the third ascended the throne in wrote the hand crowd a noun of multitude a collection of individuals adrian borlsover eustace borlsover it seems to me said his uncle closing the book that you had much better make the most of the afternoon sunshine and take your walk now i think perhaps i will eustace answered as he picked up the volume i wont go far and when i come back i can read to you those articles in nature about which we were speaking he went along the promenade but stopped at the first shelter and seating himself in the corner best protected from the wind he examined the book at leisure nearly every page was scored with a meaningless jungle of pencil marks rows of capital letters short words long words complete sentences copybook tags the whole thing in fact had the appearance of a copybook and on a more careful scrutiny eustace thought that there was ample evidence to show that the handwriting at the beginning of the book good though it was was not nearly so good as the handwriting at the end he left his uncle at the end of october with a promise to return early in december it seemed to him quite clear that the old mans power of automatic writing was developing rapidly and for the first time he looked forward to a visit that combined duty with interest but on his return he was at first disappointed his uncle he thought looked older he was listless too preferring others to read to him and dictating nearly all his letters not until the day before he left had eustace an opportunity of observing adrian borlsovers newfound faculty the old man propped up in bed with pillows had sunk into a light sleep his two hands lay on the coverlet his left hand tightly clasping his right eustace took an empty manuscript book and placed a pencil within reach of the fingers of the right hand they snatched at it eagerly then dropped the pencil to unloose the left hand from its restraining grasp perhaps to prevent interference i had better hold that hand said eustace to himself as he watched the pencil almost immediately it began to write blundering borlsovers unnecessarily unnatural extraordinarily eccentric culpably curious who are you asked eustace in a low voice never you mind wrote the hand of adrian is it my uncle who is writing oh my prophetic soul mine uncle is it anyone i know silly eustace youll see me very soon when shall i see you when poor old adrians dead where shall i see you where shall you not instead of speaking his next question borlsover wrote it what is the time the fingers dropped the pencil and moved three or four times across the paper then picking up the pencil they wrote ten minutes before four put your book away eustace adrian mustnt find us working at this sort of thing he doesnt know what to make of it and i wont have poor old adrian disturbed au revoir adrian borlsover awoke with a start ive been dreaming again he said such queer dreams of leaguered cities and forgotten towns you were mixed up in this one eustace though i cant remember how eustace i want to warn you dont walk in doubtful paths choose your friends well your poor grandfather a fit of coughing put an end to what he was saying but eustace saw that the hand was still writing he managed unnoticed to draw the book away ill light the gas he said and ring for tea on the other side of the bed curtain he saw the last sentences that had been written its too late adrian he read were friends already arent we eustace borlsover on the following day eustace borlsover left he thought his uncle looked ill when he said goodbye and the old man spoke despondently of the failure his life had been nonsense uncle said his nephew you have got over your difficulties in a way not one in a hundred thousand would have done everyone marvels at your splendid perseverance in teaching your hand to take the place of your lost sight to me its been a revelation of the possibilities of education education said his uncle dreamily as if the word had started a new train of thought education is good so long as you know to whom and for what purpose you give it but with the lower orders of men the base and more sordid spirits i have grave doubts as to its results well goodbye eustace i may not see you again you are a true borlsover with all the borlsover faults marry eustace marry some good sensible girl and if by any chance i dont see you again my will is at my solicitors ive not left you any legacy because i know youre well provided for but i thought you might like to have my books oh and theres just one other thing you know before the end people often lose control over themselves and make absurd requests dont pay any attention to them eustace goodbye and he held out his hand eustace took it it remained in his a fraction of a second longer than he had expected and gripped him with a virility that was surprising there was too in its touch a subtle sense of intimacy why uncle he said i shall see you alive and well for many long years to come two months later adrian borlsover died ii eustace borlsover was in naples at the time he read the obituary notice in the morning post on the day announced for the funeral poor old fellow he said i wonder where i shall find room for all his books the question occurred to him again with greater force when three days later he found himself standing in the library at borlsover conyers a huge room built for use and not for beauty in the year of waterloo by a borlsover who was an ardent admirer of the great napoleon it was arranged on the plan of many college libraries with tall projecting bookcases forming deep recesses of dusty silence fit graves for the old hates of forgotten controversy the dead passions of forgotten lives at the end of the room behind the bust of some unknown eighteenthcentury divine an ugly iron corkscrew stair led to a shelflined gallery nearly every shelf was full i must talk to saunders about it said eustace i suppose that it will be necessary to have the billiardroom fitted up with bookcases the two men met for the first time after many weeks in the diningroom that evening hullo said eustace standing before the fire with his hands in his pockets how goes the world saunders why these dress togs he himself was wearing an old shootingjacket he did not believe in mourning as he had told his uncle on his last visit and though he usually went in for quietcoloured ties he wore this evening one of an ugly red in order to shock morton the butler and to make them thrash out the whole question of mourning for themselves in the servants hall eustace was a true borlsover the world said saunders goes the same as usual confoundedly slow the dress togs are accounted for by an invitation from captain lockwood to bridge how are you getting there ive told your coachman to drive me in your carriage any objection oh dear me no weve had all things in common for far too many years for me to raise objections at this hour of the day youll find your correspondence in the library went on saunders most of it ive seen to there are a few private letters i havent opened theres also a box with a rat or something inside it that came by the evening post very likely its the sixtoed beast terry was sending us to cross with the fourtoed albino i didnt look because i didnt want to mess up my things but i should gather from the way its jumping about that its pretty hungry oh ill see to it said eustace while you and the captain earn an honest penny dinner over and saunders gone eustace went into the library though the fire had been lit the room was by no means cheerful well have all the lights on at any rate he said as he turned the switches and morton he added when the butler brought the coffee get me a screwdriver or something to undo this box whatever the animal is hes kicking up the deuce of a row what is it why are you dawdling if you please sir when the postman brought it he told me that theyd bored the holes in the lid at the postoffice there were no breathin holes in the lid sir and they didnt want the animal to die that is all sir its culpably careless of the man whoever he was said eustace as he removed the screws packing an animal like this in a wooden box with no means of getting air confound it all i meant to ask morton to bring me a cage to put it in now i suppose i shall have to get one myself he placed a heavy book on the lid from which the screws had been removed and went into the billiardroom as he came back into the library with an empty cage in his hand he heard the sound of something falling and then of something scuttling along the floor bother it the beasts got out how in the world am i to find it again in this library to search for it did indeed seem hopeless he tried to follow the sound of the scuttling in one of the recesses where the animal seemed to be running behind the books in the shelves but it was impossible to locate it eustace resolved to go on quietly reading very likely the animal might gain confidence and show itself saunders seemed to have dealt in his usual methodical manner with most of the correspondence there were still the private letters what was that two sharp clicks and the lights in the hideous candelabra that hung from the ceiling suddenly went out i wonder if something has gone wrong with the fuse said eustace as he went to the switches by the door then he stopped there was a noise at the other end of the room as if something was crawling up the iron corkscrew stair if its gone into the gallery he said well and good he hastily turned on the lights crossed the room and climbed up the stair but he could see nothing his grandfather had placed a little gate at the top of the stair so that children could run and romp in the gallery without fear of accident this eustace closed and having considerably narrowed the circle of his search returned to his desk by the fire how gloomy the library was there was no sense of intimacy about the room the few busts that an eighteenthcentury borlsover had brought back from the grand tour might have been in keeping in the old library here they seemed out of place they made the room feel cold in spite of the heavy red damask curtains and great gilt cornices with a crash two heavy books fell from the gallery to the floor then as borlsover looked another and yet another very well youll starve for this my beauty he said well do some little experiments on the metabolism of rats deprived of water go on chuck them down i think ive got the upper hand he turned once again to his correspondence the letter was from the family solicitor it spoke of his uncles death and of the valuable collection of books that had been left to him in the will there was one request he read which certainly came as a surprise to me as you know mr adrian borlsover had left instructions that his body was to be buried in as simple a manner as possible at eastbourne he expressed a desire that there should be neither wreaths nor flowers of any kind and hoped that his friends and relatives would not consider it necessary to wear mourning the day before his death we received a letter cancelling these instructions he wished his body to be embalmed he gave us the address of the man we were to employ pennifer ludgate hill with orders that his right hand was to be sent to you stating that it was at your special request the other arrangements as to the funeral remained unaltered good lord said eustace what in the world was the old boy driving at and what in the name of all thats holy is that someone was in the gallery someone had pulled the cord attached to one of the blinds and it had rolled up with a snap someone must be in the gallery for a second blind did the same someone must be walking round the gallery for one after the other the blinds sprang up letting in the moonlight i havent got to the bottom of this yet said eustace but i will before the night is very much older and he hurried up the corkscrew stair he had just got to the top when the lights went out a second time and he heard again the scuttling along the floor quickly he stole on tiptoe in the dim moonshine in the direction of the noise feeling as he went for one of the switches his fingers touched the metal knob at last he turned on the electric light about ten yards in front of him crawling along the floor was a mans hand eustace stared at it in utter astonishment it was moving quickly in the manner of a geometer caterpillar the five fingers humped up one moment flattened out the next the thumb appeared to give a crablike motion to the whole while he was looking too surprised to stir the hand disappeared round the corner eustace ran forward he no longer saw it but he could hear it as it squeezed its way behind the books on one of the shelves a heavy volume had been displaced there was a gap in the row of books where it had got in in his fear lest it should escape him again he seized the first book that came to his hand and plugged it into the hole then emptying two shelves of their contents he took the wooden boards and propped them up in front to make his barrier doubly sure i wish saunders was back he said one cant tackle this sort of thing alone it was after eleven and there seemed little likelihood of saunders returning before twelve he did not dare to leave the shelf unwatched even to run downstairs to ring the bell morton the butler often used to come round about eleven to see that the windows were fastened but he might not come eustace was thoroughly unstrung at last he heard steps down below morton he shouted morton sir has mr saunders got back yet not yet sir well bring me some brandy and hurry up about it im up here in the gallery you duffer thanks said eustace as he emptied the glass dont go to bed yet morton there are a lot of books that have fallen down by accident bring them up and put them back in their shelves morton had never seen borlsover in so talkative a mood as on that night here said eustace when the books had been put back and dusted you might hold up these boards for me morton that beast in the box got out and ive been chasing it all over the place i think i can hear it chawing at the books sir theyre not valuable i hope i think thats the carriage sir ill go and call mr saunders it seemed to eustace that he was away for five minutes but it could hardly have been more than one when he returned with saunders all right morton you can go now im up here saunders whats all the row asked saunders as he lounged forward with his hands in his pockets the luck had been with him all the evening he was completely satisfied both with himself and with captain lockwoods taste in wines whats the matter you look to me to be in an absolute blue funk that old devil of an uncle of mine began eustace oh i cant explain it all its his hand thats been playing old harry all the evening but ive got it cornered behind these books youve got to help me catch it whats up with you eustace whats the game its no game you silly idiot if you dont believe me take out one of those books and put your hand in and feel all right said saunders but wait till ive rolled up my sleeve the accumulated dust of centuries eh he took off his coat knelt down and thrust his arm along the shelf theres something there right enough he said its got a funny stumpy end to it whatever it is and nips like a crab ah no you dont he pulled his hand out in a flash shove in a book quickly now it cant get out what was it asked eustace it was something that wanted very much to get hold of me i felt what seemed like a thumb and forefinger give me some brandy how are we to get it out of there what about a landing net no good it would be too smart for us i tell you saunders it can cover the ground far faster than i can walk but i think i see how we can manage it the two books at the end of the shelf are big ones that go right back against the wall the others are very thin ill take out one at a time and you slide the rest along until we have it squashed between the end two it certainly seemed to be the best plan one by one as they took out the books the space behind grew smaller and smaller there was something in it that was certainly very much alive once they caught sight of fingers pressing outward for a way of escape at last they had it pressed between the two big books theres muscle there if there isnt flesh and blood said saunders as he held them together it seems to be a hand right enough too i suppose this is a sort of infectious hallucination ive read about such cases before infectious fiddlesticks said eustace his face white with anger bring the thing downstairs well get it back into the box it was not altogether easy but they were successful at last drive in the screws said eustace we wont run any risks put the box in this old desk of mine theres nothing in it that i want heres the key thank goodness theres nothing wrong with the lock quite a lively evening said saunders now lets hear more about your uncle they sat up together until early morning saunders had no desire for sleep eustace was trying to explain and to forget to conceal from himself a fear that he had never felt before the fear of walking alone down the long corridor to his bedroom iii whatever it was said eustace to saunders on the following morning i propose that we drop the subject theres nothing to keep us here for the next ten days well motor up to the lakes and get some climbing and see nobody all day and sit bored to death with each other every night not for me thanks why not run up to town runs the exact word in this case isnt it were both in such a blessed funk pull yourself together eustace and lets have another look at the hand as you like said eustace theres the key they went into the library and opened the desk the box was as they had left it on the previous night what are you waiting for asked eustace i am waiting for you to volunteer to open the lid however since you seem to funk it allow me there doesnt seem to be the likelihood of any rumpus this morning at all events he opened the lid and picked out the hand cold asked eustace tepid a bit below bloodheat by the feel soft and supple too if its the embalming its a sort of embalming ive never seen before is it your uncles hand oh yes its his all right said eustace i should know those long thin fingers anywhere put it back in the box saunders never mind about the screws ill lock the desk so that therell be no chance of its getting out well compromise by motoring up to town for a week if we get off soon after lunch we ought to be at grantham or stamford by night right said saunders and tomorrow oh well by tomorrow we shall have forgotten all about this beastly thing if when the morrow came they had not forgotten it was certainly true that at the end of the week they were able to tell a very vivid ghost story at the little supper eustace gave on hallow een you dont want us to believe that its true mr borlsover how perfectly awful ill take my oath on it and so would saunders here wouldnt you old chap any number of oaths said saunders it was a long thin hand you know and it gripped me just like that dont mr saunders dont how perfectly horrid now tell us another one do only a really creepy one please heres a pretty mess said eustace on the following day as he threw a letter across the table to saunders its your affair though mrs merrit if i understand it gives a months notice oh thats quite absurd on mrs merrits part saunders replied she doesnt know what shes talking about lets see what she says dear sir he read this is to let you know that i must give you a months notice as from tuesday the th for a long time ive felt the place too big for me but when jane parfit and emma laidlaw go off with scarcely as much as an if you please after frightening the wits out of the other girls so that they cant turn out a room by themselves or walk alone down the stairs for fear of treading on halffrozen toads or hearing it run along the passages at night all i can say is that its no place for me so i must ask you mr borlsover sir to find a new housekeeper that has no objection to large and lonely houses which some people do say not that i believe them for a minute my poor mother always having been a wesleyan are haunted yours faithfully elizabeth merrit p s i should be obliged if you would give my respects to mr saunders i hope that he wont run no risks with his cold saunders said eustace youve always had a wonderful way with you in dealing with servants you mustnt let poor old merrit go of course she shant go said saunders shes probably only angling for a rise in salary ill write to her this morning no theres nothing like a personal interview weve had enough of town well go back tomorrow and you must work your cold for all its worth dont forget that its got on to the chest and will require weeks of feeding up and nursing all right i think i can manage mrs merrit but mrs merrit was more obstinate than he had thought she was very sorry to hear of mr saunderss cold and how he lay awake all night in london coughing very sorry indeed shed change his room for him gladly and get the south room aired and wouldnt he have a hot basin of bread and milk last thing at night but she was afraid that she would have to leave at the end of the month try her with an increase of salary was the advice of eustace it was no use mrs merrit was obdurate though she knew of a mrs handyside who had been housekeeper to lord gargrave who might be glad to come at the salary mentioned whats the matter with the servants morton asked eustace that evening when he brought the coffee into the library whats all this about mrs merrit wanting to leave if you please sir i was going to mention it myself i have a confession to make sir when i found your note asking me to open that desk and take out the box with the rat i broke the lock as you told me and was glad to do it because i could hear the animal in the box making a great noise and i thought it wanted food so i took out the box sir and got a cage and was going to transfer it when the animal got away what in the world are you talking about i never wrote any such note excuse me sir it was the note i picked up here on the floor on the day you and mr saunders left i have it in my pocket now it certainly seemed to be in eustaces handwriting it was written in pencil and began somewhat abruptly get a hammer morton he read or some other tool and break open the lock in the old desk in the library take out the box that is inside you need not do anything else the lid is already open eustace borlsover and you opened the desk yes sir and as i was getting the cage ready the animal hopped out what animal the animal inside the box sir what did it look like well sir i couldnt tell you said morton nervously my back was turned and it was halfway down the room when i looked up what was its colour asked saunders black oh no sir a grayish white it crept along in a very funny way sir i dont think it had a tail what did you do then i tried to catch it but it was no use so i set the rattraps and kept the library shut then that girl emma laidlaw left the door open when she was cleaning and i think it must have escaped and you think it was the animal thats been frightening the maids well no sir not quite they said it was youll excuse me sir a hand that they saw emma trod on it once at the bottom of the stairs she thought then it was a halffrozen toad only white and then parfit was washing up the dishes in the scullery she wasnt thinking about anything in particular it was close on dusk she took her hands out of the water and was drying them absentminded like on the roller towel when she found that she was drying someone elses hand as well only colder than hers what nonsense exclaimed saunders exactly sir thats what i told her but we couldnt get her to stop you dont believe all this said eustace turning suddenly towards the butler me sir oh no sir ive not seen anything nor heard anything well sir if you must know the bells do ring at odd times and theres nobody there when we go and when we go round to draw the blinds of a night as often as not somebodys been there before us but as i says to mrs merrit a young monkey might do wonderful things and we all know that mr borlsover has had some strange animals about the place very well morton that will do what do you make of it asked saunders when they were alone i mean of the letter he said you wrote oh thats simple enough said eustace see the paper its written on i stopped using that years ago but there were a few odd sheets and envelopes left in the old desk we never fastened up the lid of the box before locking it in the hand got out found a pencil wrote this note and shoved it through the crack on to the floor where morton found it thats plain as daylight but the hand couldnt write couldnt it youve not seen it do the things ive seen and he told saunders more of what had happened at eastbourne well said saunders in that case we have at least an explanation of the legacy it was the hand which wrote unknown to your uncle that letter to your solicitor bequeathing itself to you your uncle had no more to do with that request than i in fact it would seem that he had some idea of this automatic writing and feared it then if its not my uncle what is it i suppose some people might say that a disembodied spirit had got your uncle to educate and prepare a little body for it now its got into that little body and is off on its own well what are we to do well keep our eyes open said saunders and try to catch it if we cant do that we shall have to wait till the bally clockwork runs down after all if its flesh and blood it cant live forever for two days nothing happened then saunders saw it sliding down the banister in the hall he was taken unawares and lost a full second before he started in pursuit only to find that the thing had escaped him three days later eustace writing alone in the library at night saw it sitting on an open book at the other end of the room the fingers crept over the page feeling the print as if it were reading but before he had time to get up from his seat it had taken the alarm and was pulling itself up the curtains eustace watched it grimly as it hung on to the cornice with three fingers flicking thumb and forefinger at him in an expression of scornful derision i know what ill do he said if i only get it into the open ill set the dogs on to it he spoke to saunders of the suggestion its a jolly good idea he said only we wont wait till we find it out of doors well get the dogs there are the two terriers and the underkeepers irish mongrel thats on to rats like a flash your spaniel has not got spirit enough for this sort of game they brought the dogs into the house and the keepers irish mongrel chewed up the slippers and the terriers tripped up morton as he waited at table but all three were welcome even false security is better than no security at all for a fortnight nothing happened then the hand was caught not by the dogs but by mrs merrits gray parrot the bird was in the habit of periodically removing the pins that kept its seed and water tins in place and of escaping through the holes in the side of the cage when once at liberty peter would show no inclination to return and would often be about the house for days now after six consecutive weeks of captivity peter had again discovered a new means of unloosing his bolts and was at large exploring the tapestried forests of the curtains and singing songs in praise of liberty from cornice and picture rail its no use your trying to catch him said eustace to mrs merrit as she came into the study one afternoon toward dusk with a stepladder youd much better leave peter alone starve him into surrender mrs merrit and dont leave bananas and seed about for him to peck at when he fancies hes hungry youre far too softhearted well sir i see hes right out of reach now on that picture rail so if you wouldnt mind closing the door sir when you leave the room ill bring his cage in tonight and put some meat inside it hes that fond of meat though it does make him pull out his feathers to suck the quills they do say that if you cook never mind mrs merrit said eustace who was busy writing that will do ill keep an eye on the bird there was silence in the room unbroken but for the continuous whisper of his pen scratch poor peter said the bird scratch poor old peter be quiet you beastly bird poor old peter scratch poor peter do im more likely to wring your neck if i get hold of you he looked up at the picture rail and there was the hand holding on to a hook with three fingers and slowly scratching the head of the parrot with the fourth eustace ran to the bell and pressed it hard then across to the window which he closed with a bang frightened by the noise the parrot shook its wings preparatory to flight and as it did so the fingers of the hand got hold of it by the throat there was a shrill scream from peter as he fluttered across the room wheeling round in circles that ever descended borne down under the weight that clung to him the bird dropped at last quite suddenly and eustace saw fingers and feathers rolled into an inextricable mass on the floor the struggle abruptly ceased as finger and thumb squeezed the neck the birds eyes rolled up to show the whites and there was a faint halfchoked gurgle but before the fingers had time to loose their hold eustace had them in his own send mr saunders here at once he said to the maid who came in answer to the bell tell him i want him immediately then he went with the hand to the fire there was a ragged gash across the back where the birds beak had torn it but no blood oozed from the wound he noticed with disgust that the nails had grown long and discoloured ill burn the beastly thing he said but he could not burn it he tried to throw it into the flames but his own hands as if restrained by some old primitive feeling would not let him and so saunders found him pale and irresolute with the hand still clasped tightly in his fingers ive got it at last he said in a tone of triumph good lets have a look at it not when its loose get me some nails and a hammer and a board of some sort can you hold it all right yes the things quite limp tired out with throttling poor old peter i should say and now said saunders when he returned with the things what are we going to do drive a nail through it first so that it cant get away then we can take our time over examining it do it yourself said saunders i dont mind helping you with guineapigs occasionally when theres something to be learned partly because i dont fear a guineapigs revenge this things different all right you miserable skunk i wont forget the way youve stood by me he took up a nail and before saunders had realized what he was doing had driven it through the hand deep into the board oh my aunt he giggled hysterically look at it now for the hand was writhing in agonized contortions squirming and wriggling upon the nail like a worm upon the hook well said saunders youve done it now ill leave you to examine it dont go in heavens name cover it up man cover it up shove a cloth over it here and he pulled off the antimacassar from the back of a chair and wrapped the board in it now get the keys from my pocket and open the safe chuck the other things out oh lord its getting itself into frightful knots and open it quick he threw the thing in and banged the door well keep it there till it dies he said may i burn in hell if i ever open the door of that safe again mrs merrit departed at the end of the month her successor certainly was more successful in the management of the servants early in her rule she declared that she would stand no nonsense and gossip soon withered and died eustace borlsover went back to his old way of life old habits crept over and covered his new experience he was if anything less morose and showed a greater inclination to take his natural part in country society i shouldnt be surprised if he marries one of these days said saunders well im in no hurry for such an event i know eustace far too well for the future mrs borlsover to like me it will be the same old story again a long friendship slowly made marriage and a long friendship quickly forgotten iv but eustace borlsover did not follow the advice of his uncle and marry he was too fond of old slippers and tobacco the cooking too under mrs handysides management was excellent and she seemed too to have a heavensent faculty in knowing when to stop dusting little by little the old life resumed its old power then came the burglary the men it was said broke into the house by way of the conservatory it was really little more than an attempt for they only succeeded in carrying away a few pieces of plate from the pantry the safe in the study was certainly found open and empty but as mr borlsover informed the police inspector he had kept nothing of value in it during the last six months then youre lucky in getting off so easily sir the man replied by the way they have gone about their business i should say they were experienced cracksmen they must have caught the alarm when they were just beginning their evenings work yes said eustace i suppose i am lucky ive no doubt said the inspector that we shall be able to trace the men ive said that they must have been old hands at the game the way they got in and opened the safe shows that but theres one little thing that puzzles me one of them was careless enough not to wear gloves and im bothered if i know what he was trying to do ive traced his fingermarks on the new varnish on the window sashes in every one of the downstairs rooms they are very distinctive ones too right hand or left or both asked eustace oh right every time thats the funny thing he must have been a foolhardy fellow and i rather think it was him that wrote that he took out a slip of paper from his pocket thats what he wrote sir ive got out eustace borlsover but ill be back before long some jail bird just escaped i suppose it will make it all the easier for us to trace him do you know the writing sir no said eustace its not the writing of any one i know im not going to stay here any longer said eustace to saunders at luncheon ive got on far better during the last six months than ever i expected but im not going to run the risk of seeing that thing again i shall go up to town this afternoon get morton to put my things together and join me with the car at brighton on the day after tomorrow and bring the proofs of those two papers with you well run over them together how long are you going to be away i cant say for certain but be prepared to stay for some time weve stuck to work pretty closely through the summer and i for one need a holiday ill engage the rooms at brighton youll find it best to break the journey at hitchin ill wire to you there at the crown to tell you the brighton address the house he chose at brighton was in a terrace he had been there before it was kept by his old college gyp a man of discreet silence who was admirably partnered by an excellent cook the rooms were on the first floor the two bedrooms were at the back and opened out of each other saunders can have the smaller one though it is the only one with a fireplace he said ill stick to the larger of the two since its got a bathroom adjoining i wonder what time hell arrive with the car saunders came about seven cold and cross and dirty well light the fire in the diningroom said eustace and get prince to unpack some of the things while we are at dinner what were the roads like rotten swimming with mud and a beastly cold wind against us all day and this is july dear old england yes said eustace i think we might do worse than leave dear old england for a few months they turned in soon after twelve you oughtnt to feel cold saunders said eustace when you can afford to sport a great catskin lined coat like this you do yourself very well all things considered look at those gloves for instance who could possibly feel cold when wearing them they are far too clumsy though for driving try them on and see and he tossed them through the door on to eustaces bed and went on with his unpacking a minute later he heard a shrill cry of terror oh lord he heard its in the glove quick saunders quick then came a smacking thud eustace had thrown it from him ive chucked it into the bathroom he gasped its hit the wall and fallen into the bath come now if you want to help saunders with a lighted candle in his hand looked over the edge of the bath there it was old and maimed dumb and blind with a ragged hole in the middle crawling staggering trying to creep up the slippery sides only to fall back helpless stay there said saunders ill empty a collar box or something and well jam it in it cant get out while im away yes it can shouted eustace its getting out now its climbing up the plug chain no you brute you filthy brute you dont come back saunders its getting away from me i cant hold it its all slippery curse its claw shut the window you idiot the top too as well as the bottom you utter idiot its got out there was the sound of something dropping on to the hard flagstones below and eustace fell back fainting for a fortnight he was ill i dont know what to make of it the doctor said to saunders i can only suppose that mr borlsover has suffered some great emotional shock you had better let me send someone to help you nurse him and by all means indulge that whim of his never to be left alone in the dark i would keep a light burning all night if i were you but he must have more fresh air its perfectly absurd this hatred of open windows eustace however would have no one with him but saunders i dont want the other men he said theyd smuggle it in somehow i know they would dont worry about it old chap this sort of thing cant go on indefinitely you know i saw it this time as well as you it wasnt half so active it wont go on living much longer especially after that fall i heard it hit the flags myself as soon as youre a bit stronger well leave this place not bag and baggage but with only the clothes on our backs so that it wont be able to hide anywhere well escape it that way we wont give any address and we wont have any parcels sent after us cheer up eustace youll be well enough to leave in a day or two the doctor says i can take you out in a chair tomorrow what have i done asked eustace why does it come after me im no worse than other men im no worse than you saunders you know im not it was you who were at the bottom of that dirty business in san diego and that was fifteen years ago its not that of course said saunders we are in the twentieth century and even the parsons have dropped the idea of your old sins finding you out before you caught the hand in the library it was filled with pure malevolence to you and all mankind after you spiked it through with that nail it naturally forgot about other people and concentrated its attention on you it was shut up in that safe you know for nearly six months that gives plenty of time for thinking of revenge eustace borlsover would not leave his room but he thought that there might be something in saunderss suggestion to leave brighton without notice he began rapidly to regain his strength well go on the first of september he said the evening of august st was oppressively warm though at midday the windows had been wide open they had been shut an hour or so before dusk mrs prince had long since ceased to wonder at the strange habits of the gentlemen on the first floor soon after their arrival she had been told to take down the heavy window curtains in the two bedrooms and day by day the rooms had seemed to grow more bare nothing was left lying about mr borlsover doesnt like to have any place where dirt can collect saunders had said as an excuse he likes to see into all the corners of the room couldnt i open the window just a little he said to eustace that evening were simply roasting in here you know no leave well alone were not a couple of boardingschool misses fresh from a course of hygiene lectures get the chessboard out they sat down and played at ten oclock mrs prince came to the door with a note i am sorry i didnt bring it before she said but it was left in the letterbox open it saunders and see if it wants answering it was very brief there was neither address nor signature will eleven oclock tonight be suitable for our last appointment who is it from asked borlsover it was meant for me said saunders theres no answer mrs prince and he put the paper into his pocket a dunning letter from a tailor i suppose he must have got wind of our leaving it was a clever lie and eustace asked no more questions they went on with their game on the landing outside saunders could hear the grandfathers clock whispering the seconds blurting out the quarterhours check said eustace the clock struck eleven at the same time there was a gentle knocking on the door it seemed to come from the bottom panel whos there asked eustace there was no answer mrs prince is that you she is up above said saunders i can hear her walking about the room then lock the door bolt it too your move saunders while saunders sat with his eyes on the chessboard eustace walked over to the window and examined the fastenings he did the same in saunderss room and the bathroom there were no doors between the three rooms or he would have shut and locked them too now saunders he said dont stay all night over your move ive had time to smoke one cigarette already its bad to keep an invalid waiting theres only one possible thing for you to do what was that the ivy blowing against the window there its your move now eustace it wasnt the ivy you idiot it was someone tapping at the window and he pulled up the blind on the outer side of the window clinging to the sash was the hand what is it that its holding its a pocketknife its going to try to open the window by pushing back the fastener with the blade well let it try said eustace those fasteners screw down they cant be opened that way anyhow well close the shutters its your move saunders ive played but saunders found it impossible to fix his attention on the game he could not understand eustace who seemed all at once to have lost his fear what do you say to some wine he asked you seem to be taking things coolly but i dont mind confessing that im in a blessed funk youve no need to be theres nothing supernatural about that hand saunders i mean it seems to be governed by the laws of time and space its not the sort of thing that vanishes into thin air or slides through oaken doors and since thats so i defy it to get in here well leave the place in the morning i for one have bottomed the depths of fear fill your glass man the windows are all shuttered the door is locked and bolted pledge me my uncle adrian drink man what are you waiting for saunders was standing with his glass half raised it can get in he said hoarsely it can get in weve forgotten theres the fireplace in my bedroom it will come down the chimney quick said eustace as he rushed into the other room we havent a minute to lose what can we do light the fire saunders give me a match quick they must be all in the other room ill get them hurry man for goodness sake look in the bookcase look in the bathroom here come and stand here ill look be quick shouted saunders i can hear something then plug a sheet from your bed up the chimney no heres a match he had found one at last that had slipped into a crack in the floor is the fire laid good but it may not burn i know the oil from that old readinglamp and this cottonwool now the match quick pull the sheet away you fool we dont want it now there was a great roar from the grate as the flames shot up saunders had been a fraction of a second too late with the sheet the oil had fallen on to it it too was burning the whole place will be on fire cried eustace as he tried to beat out the flames with a blanket its no good i cant manage it you must open the door saunders and get help saunders ran to the door and fumbled with the bolts the key was stiff in the lock hurry shouted eustace the whole place is ablaze the key turned in the lock at last for half a second saunders stopped to look back afterwards he could never be quite sure as to what he had seen but at the time he thought that something black and charred was creeping slowly very slowly from the mass of flames toward eustace borlsover for a moment he thought of returning to his friend but the noise and the smell of the burning sent him running down the passage crying fire fire he rushed to the telephone to summon help and then back to the bathroom he should have thought of that before for water as he burst open the bedroom door there came a scream of terror which ended suddenly and then the sound of a heavy fall this is the story which i heard on successive saturday evenings from the senior mathematical master at a secondrate suburban school for saunders has had to earn a living in a way which other men might reckon less congenial than his old manner of life i had mentioned by chance the name of adrian borlsover and wondered at the time why he changed the conversation with such unusual abruptness a week later saunders began to tell me something of his own history sordid enough though shielded with a reserve i could well understand for it had to cover not only his failings but those of a dead friend of the final tragedy he was at first especially loath to speak and it was only gradually that i was able to piece together the narrative of the preceding pages saunders was reluctant to draw any conclusions at one time he thought that the fingered beast had been animated by the spirit of sigismund borlsover a sinister eighteenthcentury ancestor who according to legend built and worshipped in the ugly pagan temple that overlooked the lake at another time saunders believed the spirit to belong to a man whom eustace had once employed as a laboratory assistant a blackhaired spiteful little brute he said who died cursing his doctor because the fellow couldnt help him to live to settle some paltry score with borlsover from the point of view of direct contemporary evidence saunderss story is practically uncorroborated all the letters mentioned in the narrative were destroyed with the exception of the last note which eustace received or rather which he would have received had not saunders intercepted it that i have seen myself the handwriting was thin and shaky the handwriting of an old man i remember the greek e was used in appointment a little thing that amused me at the time was that saunders seemed to keep the note pressed between the pages of his bible i had seen adrian borlsover once saunders i learnt to know well it was by chance however and not by design that i met a third person of the story morton the butler saunders and i were walking in the zoological gardens one sunday afternoon when he called my attention to an old man who was standing before the door of the reptile house why morton he said clapping him on the back how is the world treating you poorly mr saunders said the old fellow though his face lighted up at the greeting the winters drag terribly nowadays there dont seem no summers or springs you havent found what you were looking for i suppose no sir not yet but i shall some day i always told them that mr borlsover kept some queer animals and what is he looking for i asked when we had parted from him a beast with five fingers said saunders this afternoon since he has been in the reptile house i suppose it will be a reptile with a hand next week it will be a monkey with practically no body the poor old chap is a born materialist its a queer coincidence by the way that you should have known adrian borlsover and that you should have received a blessing at his hand has it brought you any luck no i answered slowly as i looked back over a life of inconspicuous failure i dont think it has it was his right hand you know b reprinted by permission of robt m mcbride co vi sister maddelena ralph adams cram across the valley of the oreto from monreale on the slopes of the mountains just above the little village of parco lies the old convent of sta catarina from the cloister terrace at monreale you can see its pale walls and the slim campanile of its chapel rising from the crowded citron and mulberry orchards that flourish rank and wild no longer cared for by pious and loving hands from the rough road that climbs the mountains to assunto the convent is invisible a gnarled and ragged olive grove intervening and a spur of cliffs as well while from palermo one sees only the speck of white flashing in the sun indistinguishable from the many similar gleams of desert monastery or pauper village partly because of this seclusion partly by reason of its extreme beauty partly it may be because the present owners are more than charming and gracious in their pressing hospitality sta catarina seems to preserve an element of the poetic almost magical and as i drove with the cavaliere valguanera one evening in march out of palermo along the garden valley of the oreto then up the mountain side where the warm light of the spring sunset swept across from monreale lying golden and mellow on the luxuriant growth of figs and olives and orangetrees and fantastic cacti and so up to where the path of the convent swung off to the right round a dizzy point of cliff that reached out gaunt and gray from the olives below as i drove thus in the balmy air and saw of a sudden a vision of creamy walls and orange roof draped in fantastic festoons of roses with a single curving palmtree stuck black and feathery against the gold sunset it is hardly to be wondered at that i should slip into a mood of visionary enjoyment looking for a time on the whole thing as the misty phantasm of a summer dream the cavaliere had introduced himself to us tom rendel and me one morning soon after we reached palermo when in the first bewilderment of architects in this paradise of art and colour we were working nobly at our sketches in that dream of delight the capella palatina he was himself an amateur archologist he told us and passionately devoted to his island so he felt impelled to speak to anyone whom he saw appreciating the almost and in a way fortunately unknown beauties of palermo in a little time we were fully acquainted and talking like the oldest friends of course he knew acquaintances of rendels someone always does this time they were officers on the tubby u s s quinebaug that during the summer of was trying to uphold the maritime honour of the united states in european waters luckily for us one of the officers was a kind of cousin of rendels and came from baltimore as well so as he had visited at the cavalieres place we were soon invited to do the same it was in this way that with the luck that attends rendel wherever he goes we came to see something of domestic life in italy and that i found myself involved in another of those adventures for which i naturally sought so little i wonder if there is any other place in sicily so faultless as sta catarina taormina is a paradise an epitome of all that is beautiful in italy venice excepted girgenti is a solemn epic with its golden temples between the sea and hills cefal is wild and strange and monreale a vision out of a fairy tale but sta catarina fancy a convent of creamy stone and rose red brick perched on a ledge of rock midway between earth and heaven the cliff falling almost sheer to the valley two hundred feet and more the mountain rising behind straight toward the sky all the rocks covered with cactus and dwarf figtrees the convent draped in smothering roses and in front a terrace with a fountain in the midst and then nothing between you and the sapphire sea six miles away below stretches the eden valley the concha doro goldgreen fig orchards alternating with smokeblue olives the mountains rising on either hand and sinking undulously away toward the bay where like a magic city of ivory and nacre palermo lies guarded by the twin mountains monte pelligrino and capo zafferano arid rocks like dull amethysts rose in sunlight violet in shadow lions couchant guarding the sleeping town seen as we saw it for the first time that hot evening in march with the golden lambent light pouring down through the valley making it in verity a shell of gold sitting in indian chairs on the terrace with the perfume of roses and jasmines all around us the valley of the oreto palermo sta catarina monreale all were but parts of a dreamy vision like the heavenly city of sir percivale to attain which he passed across the golden bridge that burned after him as he vanished in the intolerable light of the beatific vision it was all so unreal so phantasmal that i was not surprised in the least when late in the evening after the ladies had gone to their rooms and the cavaliere tom and i were stretched out in chairs on the terrace smoking lazily under the multitudinous stars the cavaliere said there is something i really must tell you both before you go to bed so that you may be spared any unnecessary alarm you are going to say that the place is haunted said rendel feeling vaguely on the floor beside him for his glass of amaro thank you it is all it needs the cavaliere smiled a little yes that is just it sta catarina is really haunted and much as my reason revolts against the idea as superstitious and savouring of priestcraft yet i must acknowledge i see no way of avoiding the admission i do not presume to offer any explanations i only state the fact and the fact is that tonight one or other of you will in all human or unhuman probability receive a visit from sister maddelena you need not be in the least afraid the apparition is perfectly gentle and harmless and moreover having seen it once you will never see it again no one sees the ghost or whatever it is but once and that usually the first night he spends in the house i myself saw the thing eight nine years ago when i first bought the place from the marchese di muxaro all my people have seen it nearly all my guests so i think you may as well be prepared then tell us what to expect i said what kind of a ghost is this nocturnal visitor it is simple enough some time tonight you will suddenly awake and see before you a carmelite nun who will look fixedly at you say distinctly and very sadly i cannot sleep and then vanish that is all it is hardly worth speaking of only some people are terribly frightened if they are visited unwarned by strange apparitions so i tell you this that you may be prepared this was a carmelite convent then i said yes it was suppressed after the unification of italy and given to the house of muxaro but the family died out and i bought it there is a story about the ghostly nun who was only a novice and even that unwillingly which gives an interest to an otherwise very commonplace and uninteresting ghost i beg that you will tell it us cried rendel there is a storm coming i added see the lightning is flashing already up among the mountains at the head of the valley if the story is tragic as it must be now is just the time for it you will tell it will you not the cavaliere smiled that slow cryptic smile of his that was so unfathomable as you say there is a shower coming and as we have fierce tempests here we might not sleep so perhaps we may as well sit up a little longer and i will tell you the story the air was utterly still hot and oppressive the rich sick odour of the oranges just bursting into bloom came up from the valley in a gently rising tide the sky thick with stars seemed mirrored in the rich foliage below so numerous were the glowworms under the still trees and the fireflies that gleamed in the hot air lightning flashed fitfully from the darkening west but as yet no thunder broke the heavy silence the cavaliere lighted another cigar and pulled a cushion under his head so that he could look down to the distant lights of the city this is the story he said once upon a time late in the last century the duca di castiglione was attached to the court of charles iii king of the two sicilies down at palermo they tell me he was very ambitious and not content with marrying his son to one of the ladies of the house of tuscany had betrothed his only daughter rosalia to prince antonio a cousin of the king his whole life was wrapped up in the fame of his family and he quite forgot all domestic affection in his madness for dynastic glory his son was a worthy scion cold and proud but rosalia was according to legend utterly the reverse a passionate beautiful girl wilful and headstrong and careless of her family and the world the time had nearly come for her to marry prince antonio a typical rou of the spanish court when through the treachery of a servant the duke discovered that his daughter was in love with a young military officer whose name i dont remember and that an elopement had been planned to take place the next night the fury and dismay of the old autocrat passed belief he saw in a flash the downfall of all his hopes of family aggrandizement through union with the royal house and knowing well the spirit of his daughter despaired of ever bringing her to subjection nevertheless he attacked her unmercifully and by bullying and threats by imprisonment and even bodily chastisement he tried to break her spirit and bend her to his indomitable will through his power at court he had the lover sent away to the mainland and for more than a year he held his daughter closely imprisoned in his palace on the toledo that one you may remember on the right just beyond the via del collegio dei gesuiti with the beautiful ironwork grilles at all the windows and the painted frieze but nothing could move her nothing bend her stubborn will and at last furious at the girl he could not govern castiglione sent her to this convent then one of the few houses of barefoot carmelite nuns in italy he stipulated that she should take the name of maddelena that he should never hear of her again and that she should be held an absolute prisoner in this conventual castle rosalia or sister maddelena as she was now believed her lover dead for her father had given her good proofs of this and she believed him nevertheless she refused to marry another and seized upon the convent life as a blessed relief from the tyranny of her maniacal father she lived here for four or five years her name was forgotten at court and in her fathers palace rosalia di castiglione was dead and only sister maddelena lived a carmelite nun in her place in ferdinand iv found himself driven from his throne on the mainland his kingdom divided and he himself forced to flee to sicily with him came the lover of the dead rosalia now high in military honour he on his part had thought rosalia dead and it was only by accident that he found that she still lived a carmelite nun then began the second act of the romance that until then had been only sadly commonplace but now became dark and tragic michele michele biscari that was his name i remember now haunted the region of the convent striving to communicate with sister maddelena and at last from the cliffs over us up there among the citrons you will see by the next flash of lightning he saw her in the great cloister recognized her in her white habit found her the same dark and splendid beauty of six years before only made more beautiful by her white habit and her rigid life by and by he found a day when she was alone and tossed a ring to her as she stood in the midst of the cloister she looked up saw him and from that moment lived only to love him in life as she had loved his memory in the death she had thought had overtaken him with the utmost craft they arranged their plans together they could not speak for a word would have aroused the other inmates of the convent they could make signs only when sister maddelena was alone michele could throw notes to her from the cliff a feat demanding a strong arm as you will see if you measure the distance with your eye and she could drop replies from the window over the cliff which he picked up at the bottom finally he succeeded in casting into the cloister a coil of light rope the girl fastened it to the bars of one of the windows and so great is the madness of love biscari actually climbed the rope from the valley to the window of the cell a distance of almost two hundred feet with but three little craggy restingplaces in all that height for nearly a month these nocturnal visits were undiscovered and michele had almost completed his arrangements for carrying the girl from sta catarina and away to spain when unfortunately one of the sisters suspecting some mystery from the changed face of sister maddelena began investigating and at length discovered the rope neatly coiled up by the nuns window and hidden under some clinging vines she instantly told the mother superior and together they watched from a window in the crypt of the chapel the only place as you will see tomorrow from which one could see the window of sister maddelenas cell they saw the figure of michele daringly ascending the slim rope watched hour after hour the sister remaining while the superior went to say the hours in the chapel at each of which sister maddelena was present and at last at prime just as the sun was rising they saw the figure slip down the rope watched the rope drawn up and concealed and knew that sister maddelena was in their hands for vengeance and punishment a criminal the next day by the order of the mother superior sister maddelena was imprisoned in one of the cells under the chapel charged with her guilt and commanded to make full and complete confession but not a word would she say although they offered her forgiveness if she would tell the name of her lover at last the superior told her that after this fashion would they act the coming night she herself would be placed in the crypt tied in front of the window her mouth gagged that the rope would be lowered and the lover allowed to approach even to the sill of her window and at that moment the rope would be cut and before her eyes her lover would be dashed to death on the ragged cliffs the plan was feasible and sister maddelena knew that the mother was perfectly capable of carrying it out her stubborn spirit was broken and in the only way possible she begged for mercy for the sparing of her lover the mother superior was deaf at first at last she said it is your life or his i will spare him on condition that you sacrifice your own life sister maddelena accepted the terms joyfully wrote a last farewell to michele fastened the note to the rope and with her own hands cut the rope and saw it fall coiling down to the valley bed far below then she silently prepared for death and at midnight while her lover was wandering mad with the horror of impotent fear around the white walls of the convent sister maddelena for love of michele gave up her life how was never known that she was indeed dead was only a suspicion for when biscari finally compelled the civil authorities to enter the convent claiming that murder had been done there they found no sign sister maddelena had been sent to the parent house of the barefoot carmelites at avila in spain so the superior stated because of her incorrigible contumacy the old duke of castiglione refused to stir hand or foot in the matter and michele after fruitless attempts to prove that the superior of sta catarina had caused the death was forced to leave sicily he sought in spain for very long but no sign of the girl was to be found and at last he died exhausted with suffering and sorrow even the name of sister maddelena was forgotten and it was not until the convents were suppressed and this house came into the hands of the muxaros that her story was remembered it was then that the ghost began to appear and an explanation being necessary the story or legend was obtained from one of the nuns who still lived after the suppression i think the fact for it is a fact of the ghost rather goes to prove that michele was right and that poor rosalia gave her life a sacrifice for love whether in accordance with the terms of the legend or not i cannot say one or the other of you will probably see her tonight you might ask her for the facts well that is all the story of sister maddelena known in the world as rosalia di castiglione do you like it it is admirable said rendel enthusiastically but i fancy i should rather look on it simply as a story and not as a warning of what is going to happen i dont much fancy real ghosts myself but the poor sister is quite harmless and valguanera rose stretching himself my servants say she wants a mass said over her or something of that kind but i havent much love for such priestly hocuspocus i beg your pardon turning to me i had forgotten that you were a catholic forgive my rudeness my dear cavaliere i beg you not to apologize i am sorry you cannot see things as i do but dont for a moment think i am hypersensitive i have an excuse perhaps you will say only an explanation but i live where i see all the absurdities and corruptions of the church perhaps you let the accidents blind you to the essentials but do not let us quarrel tonight see the storm is close on us shall we go in the stars were blotted out through nearly all the sky low thunderous clouds massed at the head of the valley were sweeping over so close that they seemed to brush the black pines on the mountain above us to the south and east the stormclouds had shut down almost to the sea leaving a space of black sky where the moon in its last quarter was rising just to the left of monte pellegrino a black silhouette against the pallid moonlight the rosy lightning flashed almost incessantly and through the fitful darkness came the sound of bells across the valley the rushing torrent below and the dull roar of the approaching rain with a deep organpoint of solemn thunder through it all we fled indoors from the coming tempest and taking our candles said goodnight and sought each his respective room my own was in the southern part of the old convent giving on the terrace we had just quitted and about over the main doorway the rushing storm as it swept down the valley with the swelling torrent beneath was very fascinating and after wrapping myself in a dressinggown i stood for some time by the deeply embrasured window watching the blazing lightning and the beating rain whirled by fitful gusts of wind around the spurs of the mountains gradually the violence of the shower seemed to decrease and i threw myself down on my bed in the hot air wondering if i really was to experience the ghostly visit the cavaliere so confidently predicted i had thought out the whole matter to my own satisfaction and fancied i knew exactly what i should do in case sister maddelena came to visit me the story touched me the thought of the poor faithful girl who sacrificed herself for her lover himself very likely quite unworthy and who now could never sleep for reason of her unquiet soul sent out into the storm of eternity without spiritual aid or counsel i could not sleep for the still vivid lightning the crowding thoughts of the dead nun and the shivering anticipation of my possible visitation made slumber quite out of the question no suspicion of sleepiness had visited me when perhaps an hour after midnight came a sudden vivid flash of lightning and as my dazzled eyes began to regain the power of sight i saw her as plainly as in life a tall figure shrouded in the white habit of the carmelites her head bent her hands clasped before her in another flash of lightning she slowly raised her head and looked at me long and earnestly she was very beautiful like the virgin of beltraffio in the national gallery more beautiful than i had supposed possible her deep passionate eyes very tender and pitiful in their pleading beseeching glance i hardly think i was frightened or even startled but lay looking steadily at her as she stood in the beating lightning then she breathed rather than articulated with a voice that almost brought tears so infinitely sad and sorrowful was it i cannot sleep and the liquid eyes grew more pitiful and questioning as bright tears fell from them down the pale dark face the figure began to move slowly toward the door its eyes fixed on mine with a look that was weary and almost agonized i leaped from the bed and stood waiting a look of utter gratitude swept over the face and turning the figure passed through the doorway out into the shadow of the corridor it moved like a drift of pallid stormcloud and i followed all natural and instinctive fear or nervousness quite blotted out by the part i felt i was to play in giving rest to a tortured soul the corridors were velvet black but the pale figure floated before me always an unerring guide now but a thin mist on the utter night now white and clear in the bluish lightning through some window or doorway down the stairway into the lower hall across the refectory where the great frescoed crucifixion flared into sudden clearness under the fitful lightning out into the silent cloister it was very dark i stumbled along the heaving bricks now guiding myself by a hand on the whitewashed wall now by a touch on a column wet with the storm from all the eaves the rain was dripping on to the pebbles at the foot of the arcade a pigeon startled from the capital where it was sleeping beat its way into the cloister close still the white thing drifted before me to the farther side of the court then along the cloister at right angles and paused before one of the many doorways that led to the cells a sudden blaze of fierce lightning the last now of the fleeting trail of storm leaped around us and in the vivid light i saw the white face turned again with the look of overwhelming desire of beseeching pathos that had choked my throat with an involuntary sob when first i saw sister maddelena in the brief interval that ensued after the flash and before the roaring thunder burst like the crash of battle over the trembling convent i heard again the sorrowful words i cannot sleep come from the impenetrable darkness and when the lightning came again the white figure was gone i wandered around the courtyard searching in vain for sister maddelena even until the moonlight broke through the torn and sweeping fringes of the storm i tried the door where the white figure vanished it was locked but i had found what i sought and carefully noting its location went back to my room but not to sleep in the morning the cavaliere asked rendel and me which of us had seen the ghost and i told him my story then i asked him to grant me permission to sift the thing to the bottom and he courteously gave the whole matter into my charge promising that he would consent to anything i could hardly wait to finish breakfast but no sooner was this done than forgetting my morning pipe i started with rendel and the cavaliere to investigate i am sure there is nothing in that cell said valguanera when we came in front of the door i had marked it is curious that you should have chosen the door of the very cell that tradition assigns to sister maddelena but i have often examined that room myself and i am sure that there is no chance for anything to be concealed in fact i had the floor taken up once soon after i came here knowing the room was that of the mysterious sister and thinking that there if anywhere the monastic crime would have taken place still we will go in if you like he unlocked the door and we entered one of us at all events with a beating heart the cell was very small hardly eight feet square there certainly seemed no opportunity for concealing a body in the tiny place and although i sounded the floor and walls all gave a solid heavy answer the unmistakable sound of masonry for the innocence of the floor the cavaliere answered he had he said had it all removed even to the curving surfaces of the vault below yet somewhere in this room the body of the murdered girl was concealed of this i was certain but where there seemed no answer and i was compelled to give up the search for the moment somewhat to the amusement of valguanera who had watched curiously to see if i could solve the mystery but i could not forget the subject and toward noon started on another tour of investigation i procured the keys from the cavaliere and examined the cells adjoining they were apparently the same each with its window opposite the door and nothing stay were they the same i hastened into the suspected cell it was as i thought this cell being on the corner could have had two windows yet only one was visible and that to the left at right angles with the doorway was it imagination as i sounded the wall opposite the door where the other window should be i fancied that the sound was a trifle less solid and dull i was becoming excited i dashed back to the cell on the right and forcing open the little window thrust my head out it was found at last in the smooth surface of the yellow wall was a rough space following approximately the shape of the other cell windows not plastered like the rest of the wall but showing the shapes of bricks through its thick coatings of whitewash i turned with a gasp of excitement and satisfaction yes the embrasure of the wall was deep enough what a wall it was four feet at least and the opening of the window reached to the floor though the window itself was hardly three feet square i felt absolutely certain that the secret was solved and called the cavaliere and rendel too excited to give them an explanation of my theories they must have thought me mad when i suddenly began scraping away at the solid wall in front of the door but in a few minutes they understood what i was about for under the coatings of paint and plaster appeared the original bricks and as my architectural knowledge had led me rightly the space i had cleared was directly over a vertical joint between firm workmanlike masonry on one hand and rough amateurish work on the other bricks laid anyway and without order or science rendel seized a pick and was about to assail the rude wall when i stopped him let us be careful i said who knows what we may find so we set to work digging out the mortar around a brick at about the level of our eyes how hard the mortar had become but a brick yielded at last and with trembling fingers i detached it darkness within yet beyond question there was a cavity there not a solid wall and with infinite care we removed another brick still the hole was too small to admit enough light from the dimly illuminated cell with a chisel we pried at the sides of a large block of masonry perhaps eight bricks in size it moved and we softly slid it from its bed valguanera who was standing watching us as we lowered the bricks to the floor gave a sudden cry a cry like that of a frightened woman terrible coming from him yet there was cause framed by the ragged opening of the bricks hardly seen in the dim light was a face an ivory image more beautiful than any antique bust but drawn and distorted by unspeakable agony the lovely mouth half open as though gasping for breath the eyes cast upward and below slim chiselled hands crossed on the breast but clutching the folds of the white carmelite habit torture and agony visible in every tense muscle fighting against the determination of the rigid pose we stood there breathless staring at the pitiful sight fascinated bewitched so this was the secret with fiendish ingenuity the rigid ecclesiastics had blocked up the window then forced the beautiful creature to stand in the alcove while with remorseless hands and iron hearts they had shut her into a living tomb i had read of such things in romance but to find the verity here before my eyes steps came down the cloister and with a simultaneous thought we sprang to the door and closed it behind us the room was sacred that awful sight was not for curious eyes the gardener was coming to ask some trivial question of valguanera the cavaliere cut him short pietro go down to parco and ask padre stefano to come here at once i thanked him with a glance stay he turned to me signore it is already two oclock and too late for mass is it not i nodded valguanera thought a moment then he said bring two horses the signor americano will go with you do you understand then turning to me you will go will you not i think you can explain matters to padre stefano better than i of course i will go more than gladly so it happened that after a hasty luncheon i wound down the mountain to parco found padre stefano explained my errand to him found him intensely eager and sympathetic and by five oclock had him back at the convent with all that was necessary for the resting of the soul of the dead girl in the warm twilight with the last light of the sunset pouring into the little cell through the window where almost a century ago rosalia had for the last time said farewell to her lover we gathered together to speed her tortured soul on its journey so long delayed nothing was omitted all the needful offices of the church were said by padre stefano while the light in the window died away and the flickering flames of the candles carried by two of the acolytes from san francesco threw fitful flashes of pallid light into the dark recess where the white face had prayed to heaven for a hundred years finally the padre took the asperge from the hands of one of the acolytes and with a sign of the cross in benediction while he chanted the asperges gently sprinkled the holy water on the upturned face instantly the whole vision crumbled to dust the face was gone and where once the candlelight had flickered on the perfect semblance of the girl dead so very long it now fell only on the rough bricks which closed the window bricks laid with frozen hearts by pitiless hands but our task was not done yet it had been arranged that padre stefano should remain at the convent all night and that as soon as midnight made it possible he should say the first mass for the repose of the girls soul we sat on the terrace talking over the strange events of the last crowded hours and i noted with satisfaction that the cavaliere no longer spoke of the church with that hardness which had hurt me so often it is true that the padre was with us nearly all the time but not only was valguanera courteous he was almost sympathetic and i wondered if it might not prove that more than one soul benefited by the untoward events of the day with the aid of the astonished and delighted servants and no little help as well from signora valguanera i fitted up the long cold altar in the chapel and by midnight we had the gloomy sanctuary beautiful with flowers and candles it was a curiously solemn service in the first hour of the new day in the midst of blazing candles and the thick incense the odour of the opening orangeblooms drifting up in the fresh morning air and mingling with the incense smoke and the perfume of flowers within many prayers were said that night for the soul of the dead girl and i think many afterward for after the benediction i remained for a little time in my place and when i rose from my knees and went toward the chapel door i saw a figure kneeling still and with a start recognized the form of the cavaliere i smiled with quiet satisfaction and gratitude and went away softly content with the chain of events that now seemed finished the next day the alcove was again walled up for the precious dust could not be gathered together for transportation to consecrated ground so i went down to the little cemetery at parco for a basket of earth which we cast in over the ashes of sister maddelena by and by when rendel and i went away with great regret valguanera came down to palermo with us and the last act that we performed in sicily was assisting him to order a tablet of marble whereon was carved this simple inscription here lies the body of rosalia di castiglioni called sister maddelena her soul is with him who gave it to this i added in thought let him that is without sin among you cast the first stone vii thrawn janet robert louis stevenson the reverend murdoch soulis was long minister of the moorland parish of balweary in the vale of dule a severe bleakfaced old man dreadful to his hearers he dwelt in the last years of his life without relative or servant or any human company in the small and lonely manse under the hanging shaw in spite of the iron composure of his features his eye was wild scared and uncertain and when he dwelt in private admonitions on the future of the impenitent it seemed as if his eye pierced through the storms of time to the terrors of eternity many young persons coming to prepare themselves against the season of the holy communion were dreadfully affected by his talk he had a sermon on st peter v and th the devil as a roaring lion on the sunday after every seventeenth of august and he was accustomed to surpass himself upon that text both by the appalling nature of the matter and the terror of his bearing in the pulpit the children were frightened into fits and the old looked more than usually oracular and were all that day full of those hints that hamlet deprecated the manse itself where it stood by the water of dule among some thick trees with the shaw overhanging it on the one side and on the other many cold moorish hilltops rising toward the sky had begun at a very early period of mr souliss ministry to be avoided in the dusk hours by all who valued themselves upon their prudence and guidmen sitting at the clachan alehouse shook their heads together at the thought of passing late by that uncanny neighbourhood there was one spot to be more particular which was regarded with especial awe the manse stood between the highroad and the water of dule with a gable to each its back was toward the kirktown of balweary nearly half a mile away in front of it a bare garden hedged with thorn occupied the land between the river and the road the house was two stories high with two large rooms on each it opened not directly on the garden but on a causewayed path or passage giving on the road on the one hand and closed on the other by the tall willows and elders that bordered on the stream and it was this strip of causeway that enjoyed among the young parishioners of balweary so infamous a reputation the minister walked there often after dark sometimes groaning aloud in the instancy of his unspoken prayers and when he was from home and the manse door was locked the more daring schoolboys ventured with beating hearts to follow my leader across that legendary spot this atmosphere of terror surrounding as it did a man of god of spotless character and orthodoxy was a common cause of wonder and subject of inquiry among the few strangers who were led by chance or business into that unknown outlying country but many even of the people of the parish were ignorant of the strange events which had marked the first year of mr souliss ministrations and among those who were better informed some were naturally reticent and others shy of that particular topic now and again only one of the older folk would warm into courage over his third tumbler and recount the cause of the ministers strange and solitary life fifty years syne when mr soulis cam first into baweary he was still a young man a callant the folk said fu o book learnin and grand at the exposition but as was natural in sae young a man wi nae leevin experience in religion the younger sort were greatly taken wi his gifts and his gab but auld concerned serious men and women were moved even to prayer for the young man whom they took to be a selfdeceiver and the parish that was like to be sae illsupplied it was before the days o the moderates weary fa them but ill things are like guid they baith come bit by bit a pickle at a time and there were folk even then that said the lord had left the college professors to their ain devices an the lads that went to study wi them wad hae done mair and better sittin in a peatbog like their forbears of the persecution wi a bible under their oxter and a speerit o prayer in their heart there was nae doubt onyway but that mr soulis had been ower lang at the college he was careful and troubled for mony things besides the ae thing needful he had a feck o books wi him mair than had ever been seen before in a that presbytery and a sair wark the carrier had wi them for they were a like to have smoored in the deils hag between this and kilmackerlie they were books o divinity to be sure or so they cad them but the serious were o opinion there was little service for sae mony when the hail o gods word would gang in the neuk of a plaid then he wad sit half the day and half the nicht forbye which was scant decent writin nae less and first they were feared he wad read his sermons and syne it proved he was writin a book himsel which was surely no fittin for ane of his years and sma experience onyway it behoved him to get an auld decent wife to keep the manse for him an see to his bit denners and he was recommended to an auld limmer janet mclour they caed her and sae far left to himsel as to be ower persuaded there was mony advised him to the contrar for janet was mair than suspeckit by the best folk in baweary lang or that she had had a wean to a dragoon she hadnae come forrit for maybe thretty year and bairns had seen her mumblin to hersel up on keys loan in the gloamin whilk was an unco time an place for a godfearin woman howsoever it was the laird himsel that had first tauld the minister o janet and in thae days he wad have gane a far gate to pleesure the laird when folk tauld him that janet was sib to the deil it was a superstition by his way of it an when they cast up the bible to him an the witch of endor he wad threep it doun their thrapples that thir days were a gane by and the deil was mercifully restrained to come forrit to offer oneself as a communicant weel when it got about the clachan that janet mclour was to be servant at the manse the folk were fair mad wi her an him thegether and some o the guidwives had nae better to dae than get round her door cheeks and chairge her wi a that was kent again her frae the sodgers bairn to john tamsons twa kye she was nae great speaker folk usually let her gang her ain gate an she let them gang theirs wi neither fairguideen nor fairguidday but when she buckled to she had a tongue to deave the miller up she got an there wasnae an auld story in baweary but she gart somebody lowp for it that day they couldnae say ae thing but she could say twa to it till at the hinder end the guidwives up and claught hand of her and clawed the coats aff her back and pud her doun the clachan to the water o dule to see if she were a witch or no soum or droun the carline skirled till ye could hear her at the hangin shaw and she focht like ten there was mony a guidwife bure the mark of her neist day an mony a lang day after and just in the hettest o the collieshangie wha suld come up for his sins but the new minister women said he and he had a grand voice i charge you in the lords name to let her go janet ran to him she was fair wud wi terror an clang to him an prayed him for christs sake save her frae the cummers an they for their part tauld him a that was kent and maybe mair woman says he to janet is this true as the lord sees me says she as the lord made me no a word ot forbye the bairn says she ive been a decent woman a my days will you says mr soulis in the name of god and before me his unworthy minister renounce the devil and his works weel it wad appear that when he askit that she gave a girn that fairly frichtit them that saw her an they could hear her teeth play dirl thegether in her chafts but there was naething for it but the ae way or the ither an janet lifted up her hand and renounced the deil before them a and now says mr soulis to the guidwives home with ye one and all and pray to god for his forgiveness and he gied janet his arm though she had little on her but a sark and took her up the clachan to her ain door like a leddy of the land an her scrieghin and laughin as was a scandal to be heard there were mony grave folk lang ower their prayers that nicht but when the morn cam there was sic a fear fell upon a baweary that the bairns hid theirsels and even the men folk stood and keekit frae their doors for there was janet comin doun the clachan her or her likeness nane could tell wi her neck thrawn and her held on ae side like a body that has been hangit and a grin on her face like an unstreakit corp by an by they got used wi it and even speered at her to ken what was wrang but frae that day forth she couldnae speak like a christian woman but slavered and played click wi her teeth like a pair o shears and frae that day forth the name o god cam never on her lips whiles she wad try to say it but it michtnae be them that kenned best said least but they never gied that thing the name o janet mclour for the auld janet by their way ot was in muckle hell that day but the minister was neither to haud nor to bind he preached about naething but the folks cruelty that had gien her a stroke of the palsy he skelpt the bairns that meddled her and he had her up to the manse that same nicht and dwalled there a his lane wi her under the hangin shaw weel time gaed by and the idler sort commenced to think mair lichtly o that black business the minister was weel thocht o he was aye late at the writing folk wad see his canle doon by the dule water after twal at een and he seemed pleased wi himsel and upsitten as at first though a body could see that he was dwining as for janet she cam an she gaed if she didnae speak muckle afore it was reason she should speak less then she meddled naebody but she was an eldritch thing to see an nane wad hae mistrysted wi her for baweary glebe about the end o july there cam a spell o weather the like ot never was in that countryside it was lown an het an heartless the herds couldnae win up the black hill the bairns were ower weariet to play an yet it was gousty too wi claps o het wund that rummled in the glens and bits o shouers that slockened naething we aye thocht it but to thuner on the morn but the morn cam an the morns morning and it was aye the same uncanny weather sair on folks and bestial of a that were the waur nane suffered like mr soulis he could neither sleep nor eat he tauld his elders an when he wasnae writin at his weary book he wad be stravaguin ower a the countryside like a man possessed when a body else was blythe to keep caller ben the house abune hangin shaw in the bield o the black hill theres a bit enclosed grund wi an iron yett and it seems in the auld days that was the kirkyaird o baweary and consecrated by the papists before the blessed licht shone upon the kingdom it was a great howff o mr souliss onyway there he would sit an consider his sermons and inded its a bieldy bit weel as he cam ower the wast end o the black hill ae day he saw first twa an syne fower an syne seeven corbie craws fleein round an round abune the auld kirkyaird they flew laigh and heavy an squawked to ither as they gaed and it was clear to mr soulis that something had put them frae their ordinar he wasnae easy fleyed an gaed straucht up to the was and what suld he find there but a man or the appearance of a man sittin in the inside upon a grave he was of a great stature an black as hell and his een were singular to see mr soulis had heard tell o black men monys the time but there was something unco about this black man that daunted him het as he was he took a kind o cauld grue in the marrow o his banes but up he spak for a that an says he my friend are you a stranger in this place the black man answered never a word he got upon his feet an begude to hirsle to the wa on the far side but he aye lookit at the minister an the minister stood an lookit back till a in a meenute the black man was ower the wa an runnin for the bield o the trees mr soulis he hardly kenned why ran after him but he was sair forjaskit wi his walk an the het unhalsome weather and rin as he likit he got nae mair than a glisk o the black man amang the birks till he won doun to the foot o the hillside an there he saw him ance mair gaun hap step an lowp ower dule water to the manse it was a common belief in scotland that the devil appeared as a black man this appears in several witch trials and i think in laws memorials that delightful storehouse of the quaint and grisly mr soulis wasnae weel pleased that this fearsome gangrel suld mak sae free wi baweary manse an he ran the harder an wet shoon ower the burn an up the walk but the deil a black man was there to see he stepped out upon the road but there was naebody there he gaed a ower the gairden but na nae black man at the binder end and a bit feared as was but natural he lifted the hasp and into the manse and there was janet mclour before his een wi her thrawn craig and nane sae pleased to see him and he aye minded sinsyne when first he set his een upon her he had the same cauld and deidly grue janet says he have you seen a black man a black man quo she save us a yere no wise minister theres nae black man in a baweary but she didnae speak plain ye maun understand but yamyammered like a powny wi the bit in its moo weel says he janet if there was nae black man i have spoken with the accuser of the brethren and he sat doun like ane wi a fever an his teeth chittered in his heid hoots says she think shame to yoursel minister and gied him a drap brandy that she keept aye by her syne mr soulis gaed into his study amang a his books its a lang laigh mirk chalmer perishin cauld in winter an no very dry even in the top o the simmer for the manse stands near the burn sae doun he sat and thocht of a that had come an gane since he was in baweary an his hame an the days when he was a bairn an ran daffin on the braes and that black man aye ran in his held like the owercome of a sang aye the mair he thocht the mair he thocht o the black man he tried the prayer an the words wouldnae come to him an he tried they say to write at his book but he couldnae mak nae mair o that there was whiles he thocht the black man was at his oxter an the swat stood upon him cauld as wellwater and there was other whiles when he cam to himsel like a christened bairn and minded naething the upshot was that he gaed to the window an stood glowrin at dule water the trees are unco thick an the water lies deep an black under the manse and there was janet washin the claes wi her coats kilted she had her back to the minister an he for his pairt hardly kenned what he was lookin at syne she turned round an shawed her face mr soulis had the same cauld grue as twice that day afore an it was borne in upon him what folk said that janet was deid lang syne an this was a bogle in her claycauld flesh he drew back a pickle and he scanned her narrowly she was tramptrampin in the claes croonin to hersel and eh gude guide us but it was a fearsome face whiles she sang louder but there was nae man born o woman that could tell the words o her sang an whiles she lookit sidelang doun but there was naething there for her to look at there gaed a scunner through the flesh upon his banes and that was heevens advertisement but mr soulis just blamed himsel he said to think sae ill of a puir auld afflicted wife that hadnae a freend forbye himsel an he put up a bit prayer for him an her an drank a little caller water for his heart rose again the meat an gaed up to his naked bed in the gloaming that was a nicht that has never been forgotten in baweary the nicht o the seeventeenth of august seventeen huner an twal it had been het afore as i hae said but that nicht it was better than ever the sun gaed doun amang uncolookin clouds it fell as mirk as the pit no a star no a breath o wund ye couldnae see your han afore your face and even the auld folk cuist the covers frae their beds and lay pechin for their breath wi a that he had upon his mind it was gey and unlikely mr soulis wad get muckle sleep he lay an he tummled the gude caller bed that he got into brunt his very banes whiles he slept and whiles he waukened whiles he heard the time o nicht and whiles a tyke yowlin up the muir as if somebody was deid whiles he thocht he heard bogles claverin in his lug an whiles he saw spunkies in the room he behoved he judged to be sick an sick he was little he jaloosed the sickness at the hinder end he got a clearness in his mind sat up in his sark on the bedside and fell thinkin ance mair o the black man an janet he couldnae weel tell how maybe it was the cauld to his feet but it cam in up upon him wi a spate that there was some connection between thir twa an that either or baith o them were bogles and just at that moment in janets room which was neist to his there cam a stramp o feet as if men were warslin an then a loud bang an then a wund gaed reishling round the fower quarters of the house an then a was ance mair as seelent as the grave mr soulis was feared for neither man nor deevil he got his tinderbox an lit a canle he made three steps ot ower to janets door it was on the hasp an he pushed it open an keeked bauldly in it was a big room as big as the ministers ain a plenished wi grand auld solid gear for he had nathing else there was a fowerposted bed wi auld tapestry and a braw cabinet of aik that was fu o the ministers divinity books an put there to be out o the gate an a wheen duds o janets lying here and there about the floor but nae janet could mr soulis see nor ony sign of a contention in he gaed an theres few that wad hae followed him an lookit a round an listened but there was naethin to be heard neither inside the manse nor in a baweary parish an naethin to be seen but the muckle shadows turnin round the canle an then a at ance the ministers heart played dunt an stood stockstill an a cauld wund blew amang the hairs o his heid whaten a weary sicht was that for the puir mans een for there was janet hangin frae a nail beside the auld aik cabinet her heid aye lay on her shouther her een were steeked the tongue projeckit frae her mouth and her heels were twa feet clear abune the floor god forgive us all thocht mr soulis poor janets dead he cam a step nearer to the corp an then his heart fair whammled in his inside for by what cantrip it wad illbeseem a man to judge she was hingin frae a single nail an by a single wursted thread for darnin hose its a awfu thing to be your lane at nicht wi siccan prodigies o darkness but mr soulis was strong in the lord he turned an gaed his ways oot o that room and lockit the door ahint him and step by step doon the stairs as heavy as leed and set doon the canle on the table at the stairfoot he couldnae pray he couldnae think he was dreepin wi caul swat an naething could he hear but the duntduntduntin o his ain heart he micht maybe have stood there an hour or maybe twa he minded sae little when a o a sudden he heard a laigh uncanny steer upstairs a foot gaed to an fro in the chalmer whaur the corp was hingin syne the door was opened though he minded weel that he had lockit it an syne there was a step upon the landin an it seemed to him as if the corp was lookin ower the rail and doun upon him whaur he stood he took up the canle again for he couldnae want the licht and as saftly as ever he could gaed straucht out o the manse an to the far end o the causeway it was aye pitmirk the flame o th canle when he set it on the grund brunt steedy an clear as in a room naething moved but the dule water

minister lang lang he lay ravin in his bed and frae that hour to this he was the man ye ken the day viii the yellow catc wilbur daniel steele at least once in my life i have had the good fortune to board a deserted vessel at sea i say good fortune because it has left me the memory of a singular impression i have felt a ghost of the same thing two or three times since then when peeping through the doorway of an abandoned house now that vessel was not dead she was a good vessel a sound vessel even a handsome vessel in her bluntbowed coastwise way she sailed under four lowers across as blue and glittering a sea as i have ever known and there was not a point in her sailing that one could lay a finger upon as wrong and yet passing that schooner at two miles one knew somehow that no hand was on her wheel sometimes i can imagine a vessel stricken like that moving over the empty spaces of the sea carrying it off quite well were it not for that indefinable suggestion of a stagger and i can think of all those ocean gods in whom no landsman will ever believe looking at one another and tapping their foreheads with just the shadow of a smile i wonder if they all scream these ships that have lost their souls mine screamed we heard her voice like nothing i have ever heard before when we rowed under her counter to read her name the marionnette it was of halifax i remember how it made me shiver there in the full blaze of the sun to hear her going on so railing and screaming in that stark fashion and i remember too how our footsteps pattering through the vacant internals in search of that haggard utterance made me think of the footsteps of hurrying warders roused in the night and we found a parrot in a cage that was all it wanted water we gave it water and went away to look things over keeping pretty close together all of us in the quarters the table was set for four two men had begun to eat by the evidences of the plates nowhere in the vessel was there any sign of disorder except one seachest broken out evidently in haste her papers were gone and the stern davits were empty that is how the case stood that day and that is how it has stood to this i saw this same marionnette a week later tied up to a hoboken dock where she awaited news from her owners but even there in the midst of all the waterfront bustle i could not get rid of the feeling that she was still very far away in a sort of shippish otherworld the thing happens now and then sometimes half a dozen years will go by without a solitary wanderer of this sort crossing the ocean paths and then in a single season perhaps several of them will turn up vacant waifs impassive and mysterious a quartercolumn of tidings tucked away on the second page of the evening paper that is where i read the story about the abbie rose i recollect how painfully awkward and outofplace it looked there cramped between ruled black edges and smelling of landsmans ink this thing that had to do essentially with air and vast coloured spaces i forget the exact words of the heading something like abandoned craft picked up at sea but i still have the clipping itself couched in the formal patter of the marinenews writer the first hint of another mystery of the sea came in today when the schooner abbie rose dropped anchor in the upper river manned only by a crew of one it appears that the outbound freighter mercury sighted the abbie rose off block island on thursday last acting in a suspicious manner a boatparty sent aboard found the schooner in perfect order and condition sailing under four lower sails the topsails being pursed up to the mastheads but not stowed with the exception of a yellow cat the vessel was found to be utterly deserted though her small boat still hung in the davits no evidences of disorder were visible in any part of the craft the dishes were washed up the stove in the galley was still slightly warm to the touch everything in its proper place with the exception of the vessels papers which were not to be found all indications being for fair weather captain rohmer of the mercury detailed two of his company to bring the find back to this port a distance of one hundred and fifteen miles the only man available with a knowledge of the foreandaft rig was stewart mccord the second engineer a seaman by the name of bjrnsen was sent with him mccord arrived this noon after a very heavy voyage of five days reporting that bjrnsen had fallen overboard while shaking out the foretopsail mccord himself showed evidence of the hardships he has passed through being almost a nervous wreck stewart mccord yes stewart mccord would have a knowledge of the foreandaft rig or of almost anything else connected with the affairs of the sea it happened that i used to know this fellow i had even been quite chummy with him in the old days that is to the extent of drinking too many beers with him in certain hotcountry ports i remembered him as a stolid and deliberate sort of a person with an amazing hodgepodge of learning a stamp collection and a theory about the effects of tropical sunshine on the caucasian race to which i have listened half of more than one night stretched out naked on a freighters deck he had not impressed me as a fellow who would be bothered by his nerves and there was another thing about the story which struck me as rather queer perhaps it is a relic of my seafaring days but i have always been a conscientious reader of the weather reports and i could remember no weather in the past week sufficient to shake a man out of a top especially a man by the name of bjrnsen a thoroughgoing seafaring name i was destined to hear more of this in the evening from the ancient boatman who rowed me out on the upper river he had been to sea in his day he knew enough to wonder about this thing even to indulge in a little superstitious awe about it no siree something happened to them four chaps and another thing i fancied i heard a seabird whining in the darkness overhead a shape moved out of the gloom ahead passed to the left lofty and silent and merged once more with the gloom behind a barge at anchor with the seagrass clinging around her waterline funny about that other chap the old fellow speculated bjrnsen i blieve he called im now that story sounds to me kind of he feathered his oars with a suspicious jerk and peered at me this mccord a friend of yourn he inquired in a way i said hmm well he turned on his thwart to squint ahead there she is he announced with something of relief i thought it was hard at that time of night to make anything but a black blotch out of the abbie rose of course i could see that she was potbellied like the rest of the coastwise sisterhood and that mccord had not stowed his topsails i could make them out pursed at the mastheads and hanging down as far as the crosstrees like huge overripe pears then i recollected that he had found them so probably had not touched them since a queer way to leave tops it seemed to me i could see also the glowing tip of a cigar floating restlessly along the farther rail i called mccord oh mccord the spark came swimming across the deck hello hello there ah there was a note of querulous uneasiness there that somehow jarred with my remembrance of this man ridgeway i explained he echoed the name uncertainly still with that suggestion of peevishness hanging over the rail and peering down at us oh by gracious he exclaimed abruptly im glad to see you ridgeway i had a boatman coming out before this but i guess well i guess hell be along by gracious im glad ill not keep you i told the gnome putting the money in his palm and reaching for the rail mccord lent me a hand on my wrist then when i stood squarely on the deck beside him he appeared to forget my presence leaned forward heavily on the rail and squinted after my waning boatman ahoy boat he called out sharply shielding his lips with his hand his violence seemed to bring him out of the blank for he fell immediately to puffing strongly at his cigar and explaining in rather a shamevoiced way that he was beginning to think his own boatman had passed him up come in and have a nip he urged with an abrupt heartiness clapping me on the shoulder so youve i did not say what i had intended i was thinking that in the old days mccord had made rather a fetish of touching nothing stronger than beer neither had he been of the shoulderclapping sort so youve got something aboard i shifted dead mens liquor he chuckled it gave me a queer feeling in the pit of my stomach to hear him i began to wish i had not come but there was nothing for it now but to follow him into the afterhouse the cabin itself might have been nine feet square with three bunks occupying the port side to the right opened the masters stateroom and a door in the forward bulkhead led to the galley i took in these features at a casual glance then hardly knowing why i did it i began to examine them with greater care have you a match i asked my voice sounded very small as though something unheard of had happened to all the air smoke he asked ill get you a cigar no i took the proffered match scratched it on the side of the galley door and passed out there seemed to be a thousand pans there throwing my match back at me from every wall of the boxlike compartment even mccords eyes in the doorway were large and round and shining he probably thought me crazy perhaps i was a little i ran the match along close to the ceiling and came upon a rusty hook a little aport of the centre there i said was there anything hanging from this er say a parrot or something mccord the match burned my fingers and went out what do you mean mccord demanded from the doorway i got myself back into the comfortable yellow glow of the cabin before i answered and then it was a question do you happen to know anything about this crafts personal history no what are you talking about why well i do i offered for one thing shes changed her name and it happens this isnt the first time shes well damn it all fourteen years ago i helped pick up this whateversheis off the virginia capes in the same sort of condition there you are i was yapping like a nervestrung puppy mccord leaned forward with his hands on the table bringing his face beneath the fan of the hanginglamp for the first time i could mark how shockingly it had changed it was almost colourless the jaw had somehow lost its oldtime security and the eyes seemed to be loose in their sockets i had expected him to start at my announcement he only blinked at the light i am not surprised he remarked at length after what ive seen and heard he lifted his fist and brought it down with a sudden crash on the table man lets have a nip he was off before i could say a word fumbling out of sight in the narrow stateroom presently he reappeared holding a glass in either hand and a dark bottle hugged between his elbows putting the glasses down he held up the bottle between his eyes and the lamp and its shadow falling across his face green and luminous at the core gave him a ghastly look like a mutilation or an unspeakable birthmark he shook the bottle gently and chuckled his dead mens liquor again then he poured two halfglasses of the clear gin swallowed his portion and sat down a parrot he mused a little of the liquors colour creeping into his cheeks no this time it was a cat ridgeway a yellow cat she was was i caught him up whats happened whats become of her vanished evaporated i havent seen her since night before last when i caught her trying to lower the boat stop it it was i who banged the table now without any of the reserve of decency mccord youre drunk drunk i tell you a cat let a cat throw you off your head like this shes probably hiding out below this minute on affairs of her own hiding he regarded me for a moment with the queer superiority of the damned i guess you dont realize how many times ive been over this hulk from decks to keelson with a mallet and a footrule or fallen overboard i shifted with less assurance like this fellow bjrnsen by the way mccord i stopped there on account of the look in his eyes he reached out poured himself a shot swallowed it and got up to shuffle about the confined quarters i watched their restless circuit my friend and his jumping shadow he stopped and bent forward to examine a sundaysupplement chromo tacked on the wall and the two heads drew together as though there were something to whisper of a sudden i seemed to hear the old gnome croaking now that story sounds to me kind of mccord straightened up and turned to face me what do you know about bjrnsen he demanded well only what they had you saying in the papers i told him pshaw he snapped his fingers tossing the affair aside i found her log he announced in quite another voice you did eh i judged from what i read in the paper that there wasnt a sign no no i happened on this the other night under the mattress in there he jerked his head toward the stateroom wait i heard him knocking things over in the dark and mumbling at them after a moment he came out and threw on the table a long clothcovered ledger of the common commercial sort it lay open at about the middle showing close script running indiscriminately across the column ruling when i said log he went on i guess i was going it a little strong at least i wouldnt want that sort of log found around my vessel lets call it a personal record heres his picture somewhere he shook the book by its back and a common kodak blueprint fluttered to the table it was the likeness of a solid man with a paunch a huge square beard small squinting eyes and a bald head what do you make of him a writing chap from the nose down yes i estimated from the nose up he will tend to his own business if you will tend to yours strictly mccord slapped his thigh by gracious thats the fellow he hates the chinaman he knows as well as anything he ought not to put down in black and white how intolerably he hates the chinaman and yet he must sneak off to his cubbyhole and suck his pencil and how is it stevenson has it the agony of composition you remember can you imagine the fellow ridgeway bundling down here with the fever on him about the chinaman i broke in i think you said something about a chinaman yes the cook he must have been i gather he wasnt the masters pick by the readingmatter here probably clapped on to him by the owners shifted from one of their others at the last moment a queer trick listen he picked up the book and running over the pages with a selective thumb read august second first part moderate southwesterly breeze and so forth er but here he comes to it anything can happen to a man at sea even a funeral in special to a chinyman who is of no account to social welfare being a barbarian as i look at it something of a philosopher you see and did you get the reserve in that even a funeral an artist i tell you but wait let me catch him a bit wilder here ill get that mustardcoloured this is back a couple of days never can hear the coming in them carpet slippers turned round and found him standing right to my back this morning could have stuck a knife into me easy look here says i and fetched him a tap on the ear that will make him walk louder next time i warrant he could have stuck a knife into me easy a clear case of moral funk i should say can you imagine the fellow ridgeway yes oh yes i was ready with a phrase of my own a man handicapped with an imagination you see he cant quite understand this barbarian who has him beaten by about thirty centuries of civilization and his imagination has to have something to chew on something to hit a tap on the ear you know by gracious thats the ticket mccord pounded his knee and now weve got another chap going to pieces peters he calls him refuses to eat dinner on august the third claiming he caught the chink making passes over the chowderpot with his thumb can you believe it ridgeway in this very cabin here then he went on with a suggestion of haste as though he had somehow made a slip well at any rate the disease seems to be catching next day its bach the second seaman who begins to feel the gaff listen bach he comes to me tonight complaining hes being watched he claims the has got the evil eye says he can see you through a twoinch bulkhead and the like the chinks laying in his bunk turned the other way why dont you go aboard of him says i the dutcher says nothing but goes over to his own bunk and feels under the straw when he comes back hes looking queer by god says he the devil has swiped my gun now if thats true there is going to be hell to pay in this vessel very quick i figure im still master of this vessel the evil eye i grunted consciences gone wrong there somewhere not altogether ridgeway i can see that yellow man peeking now just figure yourself say eight thousand miles from home out on the water alone with a crowd of heathen fanatics crazy from fright looking around for guns and so on dont you believe youd keep an eye around the corners kind of eh ill bet a hat he was taking it all in lying there in his bunk turned the other way eh i pity the poor cuss well theres only one more entry after that hes good and mad here now by god this is the end my guns gone too right out from under lock and key by god i been talking with bach this morning not to let on i had him in to clean my lamp theres more ways than one he says and so do i mccord closed the book and dropped it on the table finis he said the rest is blank paper well i will confess i felt much better than i had for some time past theres one mystery of the sea gone to pot at any rate and now if you dont mind i think ill have another of your nips mccord he pushed my glass across the table and got up and behind his back his shadow rose to scour the corners of the room like an incorruptible sentinel i forgot to take up my gin watching him after an uneasy minute or so he came back to the table and pressed the tip of a forefinger on the book ridgeway he said you dont seem to understand this particular mystery of the sea hasnt been scratched yet not even scratched ridgeway he sat down and leaned forward fixing me with a didactic finger what happened well i have an idea the barbarian got them when it came to the pinch and let the remains over the side i should say and they came back and got the barbarian and let him over the side eh there were none left you remember oh good lord i dont know i flared with a childish resentment at this catechizing of his but his finger remained there challenging i do he announced the chinaman put them over the side as we have said and then after that he died of wounds about the head so i had still sarcasm you will remember he went on that the skipper did not happen to mention a cat a yellow cat in his confessions mccord i begged him please drop it why in thunder should he mention a cat true why should he mention a cat i think one of the reasons why he should not mention a cat is because there did not happen to be a cat aboard at that time oh all right i reached out and pulled the bottle to my side of the table then i took out my watch if you dont mind i suggested i think wed better be going ashore ive got to get to my office rather early in the morning what do you say he said nothing for the moment but his finger had dropped he leaned back and stared straight into the core of the light above his eyes squinting he would have been from the south of china probably he seemed to be talking to himself theres a considerable sprinkling of the belief down there ive heard its an uncanny business this transmigration of souls personally i had had enough of it mccords fingers came groping across the table for the bottle i picked it up hastily and let it go through the open companionway where it died with a faint gurgle out somewhere on the river now i said to him shaking the vagrant wrist either you come ashore with me or you go in there and get under the blankets youre drunk mccord drunk do you hear me ridgeway he pronounced bringing his eyes down to me and speaking very slowly youre a fool if you cant see better than that im not drunk im sick i havent slept for three nights and now i cant and you say you he went to pieces very suddenly jumped up pounded the legs of his chair on the decking and shouted at me and you say that you you landlubber you office coddler youre so comfortably sure that everything in the world is cut and dried come back to the water again and learn how to wonder and stop talking like a damn fool do you know where is there anything in your municipal budget to tell me where bjrnsen went listen he sat down waving me to do the same and went on with a sort of desperate repression it happened on the first night after we took this hellion id stood the wheel most of the afternoon off and on that is because she sails herself uncommonly well just put her on a reach you know and she carries it off pretty well i know i nodded well we mugged up about seven oclock there was a good deal of canned stuff in the galley and bjrnsen wasnt a bad hand with a kettle a thoroughgoing squarehead he was tall and lean and yellowhaired with little fat round cheeks and a white moustache not a bad chap at all he took the wheel to stand till midnight and i turned in but i didnt drop off for quite a spell i could hear his boots wandering around over my head padding off forward coming back again i heard him whistling now and then an outlandish air occasionally i could see the shadow of his head waving in a block of moonlight that lay on the decking right down there in front of the stateroom door it came from the companion the cabin was dark because we were going easy on the oil they hadnt left a great deal for some reason or other mccord leaned back and described with his finger where the illumination had cut the decking there i could see it from my bunk as i lay you understand i must have almost dropped off once when i heard him fiddling around out here in the cabin and then he said something in a whisper just to find out if i was still awake i suppose i asked him what the matter was he came and poked his head in the door the breeze is going out says he i was wondering if we couldnt get a little more sail on her only i cant give you his fierce squarehead tang how about the tops he suggested i was so sleepy i didnt care and i told him so all right he says but i thought i might shake out one of them tops then i heard him blow at something outside scat you then this cats going to set me crazy mr mccord he says following me around everywhere he gave a kick and i saw something yellow floating across the moonlight it never made a sound just floated you wouldnt have known it ever lit anywhere just like mccord stopped and drummed a few beats on the table with his fist as though to bring himself back to the straight narrative i went to sleep he began again i dreamed about a lot of things i woke up sweating you know how glad you are to wake up after a dream like that and find none of it is so well i turned over and settled to go off again and then i got a little more awake and thought to myself it must be pretty near time for me to go on deck i scratched a match and looked at my watch that fellow must be either a good chap or asleep i said to myself and i rolled out quick and went abovedecks he wasnt at the wheel i called him bjrnsen bjrnsen no answer mccord was really telling a story now he paused for a long moment one hand shielding an ear and his eyeballs turned far up that was the first time i really went over the hulk he ran on i got out a lantern and started at the forward end of the hold and i worked aft and there was nothing there not a sign or a stain or a scrap of clothing or anything you may believe that i began to feel funny inside i went over the decks and the rails and the house itself inch by inch not a trace i went out aft again the cat sat on the wheelbox washing her face i hadnt noticed the scar on her head before running down between her ears rather a new scar three or four days old i should say it looked ghastly and bluewhite in the flat moonlight i ran over and grabbed her up to heave her over the side you understand how upset i was now you know a cat will squirm around and grab something when you hold it like that generally speaking this one didnt she just drooped and began to purr and looked up at me out of her moonlit eyes under that scar i dropped her on the deck and backed off you remember bjrnsen had kicked her and i didnt want anything like that happening to the narrator turned upon me with a sudden heat leaned over and shook his finger before my face there you go he cried you with your stout stone buildings and your policemen and your neighbourhood church youre so damn sure but id just like to see you out there alone with the moon setting and all the lights gone tall and queer and a shipmate he lifted his hand overhead the fingertips pressed together and then suddenly separated as though he had released an impalpable something into the air go on i told him i felt more like you do when it got light again and warm and sunshiny i said bah to the whole business i even fed the cat and i slept awhile on the roof of the house i was so sure we lay dead most of the day without a streak of air but that night well that night i hadnt got over being sure yet it takes quite a jolt you know to shake loose several dozen generations a fair steady breeze had come along the glass was high she was staying herself like a doll and so i figured i could get a little rest lying below in the bunk even if i didnt sleep i tried not to sleep in case something should come up a squall or the like but i think i must have dropped off once or twice i remember i heard something fiddling around in the galley and i hollered scat and everything was quiet again i rolled over and lay on my left side staring at that square of moonlight outside my door for a long time youll think it was a dream what i saw there go on i said call this tabletop the spot of light roughly he said he placed a fingertip at about the middle of the forward edge and drew it slowly toward the centre here what would correspond with the upper side of the companionway there came down very gradually the shadow of a tail i watched it streaking out there across the deck wiggling the slightest bit now and then when it had come down about halfway across the light the solid part of the animal its shadow you understand began to appear quite big and round but how could she hang there done up in a ball from the hatch he shifted his finger back to the edge of the table and puddled it around to signify the shadowed body i fished my gun out from behind my back you see i was feeling funny again then i started to slide one foot over the edge of the bunk always with my eyes on that shadow now i swear i didnt make the sound of a pin dropping but i had no more than moved a muscle when that shadowed thing twisted itself around in a flash and there on the floor before me was the profile of a mans head upside down listening a mans head with a tail of hair mccord got up hastily and stepped over in front of the stateroom door where he bent down and scratched a match see he said holding the tiny flame above a splintered scar on the boards you wouldnt think a man would be fool enough to shoot at a shadow he came back and sat down it seemed to me all hell had shaken loose youve no idea ridgeway the rumpus a gun raises in a box like this i found out afterward the slug ricochetted into the galley bringing down a couple of pans and that helped oh yes i got out of here quick enough i stood there half out of the companion with my hands on the hatch and the gun between them and my shadow running off across the top of the house shivering before my eyes like a dry leaf there wasnt a whisper of sound in the world just the pale water floating past and the sails towering up like a pair of twittering ghosts and everything that crazy colour well in a minute i saw it just abreast of the mainmast crouched down in the shadow of the weather rail sneaking off forward very slowly this time i took a good long sight before i let go did you ever happen to see blackpowder smoke in the moonlight it puffed out perfectly round like a big pale balloon this did and for a second something was bounding through it without a sound you understand something a shade solider than the smoke and big as a cow it looked to me it passed from the weather side to the lee and ducked behind the sweep of the mainsail like that mccord snapped his thumb and forefinger under the light go on i said what did you do then mccord regarded me for an instant from beneath his lids uncertain his fist hung above the table youre he hesitated his lips working vacantly a forefinger came out of the fist and gesticulated before my face if youre laughing why damn me ill go on i repeated what did you do then i followed the thing he was still watching me sullenly i got up and went forward along the roof of the house so as to have an eye on either rail you understand this business had to be done with i kept straight along every shadow i wasnt absolutely sure of i made sure of pointblank and i rounded the thing up at the very stern sitting on the butt of the bowsprit ridgeway washing her yellow face under the moon i didnt make any bones about it this time i put the bad end of that gun against the scar on her head and squeezed the trigger it snicked on an empty shell i tell you a fact i was almost deafened by the report that didnt come she followed me aft i couldnt get away from her i went and sat on the wheelbox and she came and sat on the edge of the house facing me and there we stayed for upward of an hour without moving finally she went over and stuck her paw in the waterpan id set out for her then she raised her head and looked at me and yawled at sundown thered been two quarts of water in that pan you wouldnt think a cat could get away with two quarts of water in he broke off again and considered me with a sort of weary defiance whats the use he spread out his hands in a gesture of hopelessness i knew you wouldnt believe it when i started you couldnt it would be a kind of blasphemy against the sacred institution of pavements youre too damn smug ridgeway i cant shake you you havent sat two days and two nights keeping your eyes open by sheer teethgritting until they got used to it and wouldnt shut any more when i tell you i found that yellow thing snooping around the davits and three bights off the boatfall loosened out plain on deck you grin behind your collar when i tell you she padded off forward and evaporated flickered back to hell and hasnt been seen since then why you explain to yourself that im drunk i tell you he jerked his head back abruptly and turned to face the companionway his lips still apart he listened so for a moment then he shook himself out of it and went on i tell you ridgeway ive been over this hulk with a footrule theres not a cubic inch i havent accounted for not a plank i this time he got up and moved a step toward the companion where he stood with his head bent forward and slightly to the side after what might have been twenty seconds of this he whispered do you hear far and far away down the reach a ferryboat lifted its infinitesimal wail and then the silence of the night river came down once more profound and inscrutable a corner of the wick above my head sputtered a little that was all hear what i whispered back he lifted a cautious finger toward the opening somebody listen the mans faculties must have been keyed up to the pitch of his nerves for to me the night remained as voiceless as a subterranean cavern i became intensely irritated with him within my mind i cried out against this infatuated pantomime of his and then of a sudden there was a sound the dying rumour of a ripple somewhere in the outside darkness as though an object had been let into the water with extreme care you heard i nodded the ticking of the watch in my vest pocket came to my ears shucking off the leisurely seconds while mccords fingernails gnawed at the palms of his hands the man was really sick he wheeled on me and cried out my god ridgeway why dont we go out i for one refused to be a fool i passed him and climbed out of the opening he followed far enough to lean his elbows on the hatch his feet and legs still within the secure glow of the cabin you see theres nothing my wave of assurance was possibly a little overdone over there he muttered jerking his head toward the shore lights something swimming i moved to the corner of the house and listened river thieves i argued the place is full of ridgeway look behind you perhaps it is the pavements but no matter i am not ordinarily a jumping sort and yet there was something in the quality of that voice beyond my shoulder that brought the sweat stinging through the pores of my scalp even while i was in the act of turning a cat sat there on the hatch expressionless and immobile in the gloom i did not say anything i turned and went below mccord was there already standing on the farther side of the table after a moment or so the cat followed and sat on her haunches at the foot of the ladder and stared at us without winking i think she wants something to eat i said to mccord he lit a lantern and went out into the galley returning with a chunk of salt beef he threw it into the farther corner the cat went over and began to tear at it her muscles playing with convulsive shadowlines under the sagging yellow hide and now it was she who listened to something beyond the reach of even mccords faculties her neck stiff and her ears flattened i looked at mccord and found him brooding at the animal with a sort of listless malevolence quick she has kittens somewhere about i shook his elbow sharply when she starts now you dont seem to understand he mumbled it wouldnt be any use she had turned now and was making for the ladder with the soundless agility of her race i grasped mccords wrist and dragged him after me the lantern banging against his knees when we came up the cat was already amidships a scarcely discernible shadow at the margin of our lanterns ring she stopped and looked back at us with her luminous eyes appeared to hesitate uneasy at our pursuit of her shifted here and there with quick soft bounds and stopped to fawn with her back arched at the foot of the mast then she was off with an amazing suddenness into the shadows forward lively now i yelled at mccord he came pounding along behind me still protesting that it was of no use abreast of the foremast i took the lantern from him to hold above my head you see he complained peering here and there over the illuminated deck i tell you ridgeway this thing but my eyes were in another quarter and i slapped him on the shoulder an engineer an engineer to the core i cried at him look aloft man our quarry was almost to the crosstrees clambering up the shrouds with a smartness no sailor has ever come to her yellow body cut by the moving shadows of the ratlines a queer sight against the mat of the night mccord closed his mouth and opened it again for two words by gracious the following instant he had the lantern and was after her i watched him go up above my head a ponderous swaying climber into the sky come to the crosstrees and squat there with his knees clamped around the mast the clear star of the lantern shot this way and that for a moment then it disappeared and in its place there sprang out a bag of yellow light like a fireballoon at anchor in the heavens i could see the shadows of his head and hands moving monstrously over the inner surface of the sail and muffled exclamations without meaning came down to me after a moment he drew out his head and called all right theyre here heads there below i ducked at his warning and something spanked on the planking a yard from my feet i stepped over to the vague blur on the deck and picked up a slipper a slipper covered with some woven straw stuff and soled with a matted felt perhaps a halfinch thick another struck somewhere abaft the mast and then mccord reappeared above and began to stagger down the shrouds under his left arm he hugged a curious assortment of litter a sheaf of papers a brace of revolvers a gray kimono and a soiled apron well he said when he had come to deck i feel like a man who has gone to hell and come back again you know id come to the place where i really believed that about the cat when you think of it by gracious we havent come so far from the jungle after all we went aft and below and sat down at the table as we had been mccord broke a prolonged silence im sort of glad he got away poor cuss hes probably climbing up a wharf this minute shivering and scared to death over toward the gastanks by the way he was swimming by gracious now that the worlds turned over straight again i feel i could sleep a solid week poor cuss can you imagine him ridgeway yes i broke in i think i can he must have lost his nerve when he made out your smoke and shinnied up there to stow away taking the ships papers with him he would have attached some profound importance to them remember the barbarian eight thousand miles from home probably couldnt read a word i suppose the cat followed him the traditional source of food he must have wanted water badly i should say he wouldnt have taken the chances he did well i announced at any rate i can say it now theres another mystery of the sea gone to pot mccord lifted his heavy lids no he mumbled the mystery is that a man who has been to sea all his life could sail around for three days with a man bundled up in his top and not know it when i think of him peeking down at me and playing off that damn cat probably without realizing it scared to death by gracious ridgeway there was a pair of funks aboard this craft eh wow yow i could sleep i should think you could mccord did not answer by the way i speculated i guess you were right about bjrnsen mccord that is his fooling with the foretop he must have been caught all of a bunch eh again mccord failed to answer i looked up mildly surprised and found his head hanging back over his chair and his mouth opened wide he was asleep c reprinted by permission of the author and messrs harper brothers ix letter to sura pliny the younger our leisure furnishes me with the opportunity of learning from you and you with that of instructing me accordingly i particularly wish to know whether you think there exist such things as phantoms possessing an appearance peculiar to themselves and a certain supernatural power or that mere empty delusions receive a shape from our fears for my part i am led to believe in their existence especially by what i hear happened to curtius rufus while still in humble circumstances and obscure he was a hangeron in the suit of the governor of africa while pacing the colonnade one afternoon there appeared to him a female form of superhuman size and beauty she informed the terrified man that she was africa and had come to foretell future events for that he would go to rome would fill offices of state there and would even return to that same province with the highest powers and die in it all which things were fulfilled moreover as he touched at carthage and was disembarking from his ship the same form is said to have presented itself to him on the shore it is certain that being seized with illness and auguring the future from the past and misfortune from his previous prosperity he himself abandoned all hope of life though none of those about him despaired is not the following story again still more appalling and not less marvellous i will relate it as it was received by me there was at athens a mansion spacious and commodious but of evil repute and dangerous to health in the dead of night there was a noise as of iron and if you listened more closely a clanking of chains was heard first of all from a distance and afterward hard by presently a spectre used to appear an ancient man sinking with emaciation and squalor with a long beard and bristly hair wearing shackles on his legs and fetters on his hands and shaking them hence the inmates by reason of their fears passed miserable and horrible nights in sleeplessness this want of sleep was followed by disease and their terrors increasing by death for in the daytime as well though the apparition had departed yet a reminiscence of it flitted before their eyes and their dread outlived its cause the mansion was accordingly deserted and condemned to solitude was entirely abandoned to the dreadful ghost however it was advertised on the chance of someone ignorant of the fearful curse attached to it being willing to buy or to rent it athenodorus the philosopher came to athens and read the advertisement when he had been informed of the terms which were so low as to appear suspicious he made inquiries and learned the whole of the particulars yet none the less on that account nay all the more readily did he rent the house as evening began to draw on he ordered a sofa to be set for himself in the front part of the house and called for his notebooks writing implements and a light the whole of his servants he dismissed to the interior apartments and for himself applied his soul eyes and hand to composition that his mind might not from want of occupation picture to itself the phantoms of which he had heard or any empty terrors at the commencement there was the universal silence of night soon the shaking of irons and the clanking of chains was heard yet he never raised his eyes nor slackened his pen but hardened his soul and deadened his ears by its help the noise grew and approached now it seemed to be heard at the door and next inside the door he looked round beheld and recognized the figure he had been told of it was standing and signalling to him with its finger as though inviting him he in reply made a sign with his hand that it should wait a moment and applied himself afresh to his tablets and pen upon this the figure kept rattling its chains over his head as he wrote on looking round again he saw it making the same signal as before and without delay took up a light and followed it it moved with a slow step as though oppressed by its chains and after turning into the courtyard of the house vanished suddenly and left his company on being thus left to himself he marked the spot with some grass and leaves which he plucked next day he applied to the magistrates and urged them to have the spot in question dug up there were found there some bones attached to and intermingled with fetters the body to which they had belonged rotted away by time and the soil had abandoned them thus naked and corroded to the chains they were collected and interred at the public expense and the house was ever afterward free from the spirit which had obtained due sepulture the above story i believe on the strength of those who affirm it what follows i am myself in a position to affirm to others i have a freedman who is not without some knowledge of letters a younger brother of his was sleeping with him in the same bed the latter dreamed he saw someone sitting on the couch who approached a pair of scissors to his head and even cut the hair from the crown of it when day dawned he was found to be cropped round the crown and his locks were discovered lying about a very short time afterward a fresh occurrence of the same kind confirmed the truth of the former one a lad of mine was sleeping in company with several others in the pages apartment there came through the windows so he tells the story two figures in white tunics who cut his hair as he lay and departed the way they came in his case too daylight exhibited him shorn and his locks scattered around nothing remarkable followed except perhaps this that i was not brought under accusation as i should have been if domitian in whose reign these events happened had lived longer for in his desk was found an information against me which had been presented by carus from which circumstance may be conjectured inasmuch as it is the custom of accused persons to let their hair grow that the cutting off of my slaves hair was a sign of the danger which threatened me being averted i beg then that you will apply your great learning to this subject the matter is one which deserves long and deep consideration on your part nor am i for my part undeserving of having the fruits of your wisdom imparted to me you may even argue on both sides as your way is provided you argue more forcibly on one side than the other so as not to dismiss me in suspense and anxiety when the very cause of my consulting you has been to have my doubts put
