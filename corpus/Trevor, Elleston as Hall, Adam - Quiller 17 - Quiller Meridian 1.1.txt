an agent lies dead in a bucharest freight yard the headless victim of a blown rendezvous with a russian quiller is ordered in to clear up the mess and to take over the mission from moscow he boards the siberian express in search of zimyanin the russian on board is his elusive quarry three conspiring russian generals and tanya a beautiful and mysterious muscovite amidst the snows of siberia subject of a militia manhunt and the machinations of a rogue agent quiller must avert a terrible threat to world peace that is rising from the ruins of the smashed soviet empire adam hall quiller meridian bucharest they found me in rome and the embassy phoned my hotel and i went along there and talked to london and signals said something had come unstuck in bucharest and mr croder would be grateful if l could get on a plane and see if i could pull anyone out alive they hadnt actually put it like that theyd said if i could be of assistance in any way but when mr croder can find it in his rat infested soul to tell you hed be grateful for something it can only mean that some kind of hell has got loose and he wants you to get it back in the cage that was soon after six and i caught the last night flight out of rome and got into bucharest at and put my watch forward an hour and found someone waiting for me with a battered looking volvo we exchanged paroles and he asked me if i wanted to drive and i said no because i didnt know this city and there was obviously a rush on and he could take short cuts his name was baker and he was small and wrapped up in a bomber jacket against the cold and smelt of garlic and looked rather pale but that was possibly his normal winter complexion what happened i asked him i dont know the dif just sent me to pick you up whats his name turner he got past a meat truck and caught a wing just slightly because the streets were iced over in places he was driving just this side of smashing us up but i didnt say anything because he knew what he was doing i hadnt heard of a director in the field called turner he must be new new and inexperienced and at this moment sitting at his base with a dry mouth and a telephone jammed against his head listening to his control in london and trying to tell him it hadnt been his fault and the best of luck because when a mission hits the wall it must be the fault of the dif because hes running the executive in the field and its his job to keep him out of trouble where are we going i asked baker the railway station freight yard we lost the back end and he touched the wheel and used the kerb to kick us straight and when hed settled down again i asked him the question id been trying not to ask him ever since wed left the airport whos the executive he gave me a glance and stared through the windscreen again and tucked his chin in hornby he said it quietly i hadnt heard of hornby either and it didnt sound as if i ever would again he must have been new too they were cutting down the training time at norfolk these days and sending neophytes into the field without a chance of getting them home again if anything awkward happened id told croder how i felt about it and hed said hed pass it on to the proper quarters but it wouldnt do any good he felt the same way as i did and those pontifical bastards in the bureau hierarchy obviously hadnt listened even to him say this much at least for croder hes a total professional and one of the three really brilliant controls in london and he doesnt get any kick out of going into the signals room and listening to those calls coming in from the field i dont know if i can make it theyve cut me off and i havent got long can you do anything send anyone in thered been a call like that reaching london this evening some time before six and hornbys control had said yes hed find the nearest executive and send him into the field and that was why i was sitting in this dog eared volvo skating through the streets of bucharest a little bit too late its nearly always a little bit too late because things happen so fast when a mission starts running hot that there just isnt time to pull people out was there a rendezvous baker glanced at me again i dont know didnt want to know all he wanted to do was get me to the freight yard and drop me off and go home and try and sleep theyre not all like this the contacts most of them are seasoned and theyve learned to get used to things blowing up but one or two hang on to a shred of sensitivity and this man was one of them i could feel the vibrations how long have you been out here i asked him in bucharest yes year bit more picking up the language with a nervous laugh trying its a bitch there was some black ice and we spun full circle across a waste of tarmac perhaps a car park and soon after that we picked up the coloured lights of signals on the skyline and baker touched the wheel and hit gravel and sped up and we started bumping across some half buried railway sleepers and i told him to slow down and cut his lights and the engine and take me as far as the line of trucks below the big black water tank that stood silhouetted against the sky i got out and told him to go home then i stood there for ten minutes in the shadow of the end truck and waited for my eyes to adjust from the glare of the headlights to the half darkness here i didnt know if the local supports had got the area protected or whether they too lacked experience bucharest isnt a major field and you cant expect first class people wherever you go there was a film of cloud across the city lit by the glow of the streets but only a few lights in the freight yard high up on swan neck poles smell of coal steel soot sacking some kind of produce potatoes or grain very little sound but i was picking up low voices over towards the main passenger station the air was still cold against the face the outline of the trucks was sharper now and i began moving keeping my feet on hard surfaces tarmac sleepers rails going slowly feeling my way in a plane was sloping down to the airport its strobes winking against the ochre smudge of the horizon the high thin scream of the jets fading across the sky there was some kind of bell ringing up there towards the main station perhaps there was a train due in i went on moving there was something i didnt know london had called me in either because i was the nearest shadow executive to this area or because this was something that needed a lot of experience to handle neither idea seemed to work there must be shadows closer to bucharest than rome and the bureau couldnt have had a mission running in a minor east european state that would need a high echelon executive to handle the mess when it crashed i would have to ask london what the score was when i got into signals with them the air was colder still here away from the line of trucks something of a night breeze was getting up its all right i said softly i was behind him and my left hand was across his mouth i didnt want any noise he struggled quite hard until i put a little more pressure on the throat then he slackened and i took it off again dont worry i said i know mr turner i released most of the hold so that he could half turn and look into my face i didnt offer him the parole id exchanged with baker at the airport this man could be anyone not one of ours i took the last degree of pressure off his throat and he asked me who i was good english recognizable red brick u accent i didnt tell him but i asked him for the parole and got it the code name for the mission longshot when youre protecting an area i said try and find some really deep shadow and try to stand where there are no hard surfaces around you look for gravel or whatever loose surface there is if youd done that i wouldnt have seen you so easily and youd have heard me coming jesus he said hed already been upset by the hornby thing amen it was routine especially in minor fields where people hadnt been through full training were expected to help them along and id shocked him first to drive the lesson home because one day it could save his life where is everybody i asked him over there his breath clouded in the faint light was it a rendezvous yes hornby and who a russian not a romanian that could be the answer to the question i had for london what was the russians name i dont know find some shadow i said and left him moving along a rail under the cover of the next line of trucks until i came to three people standing there close together one of them spun round very fast and had a gun out and i stopped and lifted my hands longshot i said the man lowered the gun but didnt put it away where are you from rome who sent you mr croder he put his gun away and told me his name was fry he looked appallingly young what happened i asked him the other two backed off a bit to let me into the group one of them had been sick somewhere i could smell it hornby was to make contact with a russian here what was his name zymyanin did he turn up we dont know he was a thin man fry with eyes buried deep under his brows so that in this light i couldnt see them just caught a glint now and then wheres the head i asked him on the other side of the rail i could hear one of the other people shivering his mouth open shivering through his teeth hands stuck into the pockets of his leather coat his head down probably the one whod been sick well put him into something i said not you i told fry weve got to talk we werent going to move him fry said that was out of the book but not everything in this trades in the book in fact very little that really matters none of the deadly vibrations you pick up in a red sector nothing of what we call mission feel the unnamed sense that allows a single photon of light to hit the retina and alert the brain the sound of a sleeve folding in the dark as the knife is raised the smell of gun oil we were standing here at the site of a blown rendezvous and the contact on our side had been killed and the contact on the other side was missing and we didnt know how many of the opposition might be standing off in the shadows waiting for the right time to move in waiting perhaps for the man from rome to get here they were worried about booby traps that was all fry and the other two its in chapter of the practical field manual with its red cover never move a dead body without first considering that it might conceal a booby trap or other explosive device get a sack i told frys people and went across to the body and turned it over to show them it was safe in terms of security the opposition had been unusually sensitive when you blow a rendezvous by killing the opposite number you dont normally take the trouble to disguise things but the people whod blown this one had staged an accident or a suicide for the local police and left hornbys body on one side of the rail and his head on the other so they wouldnt have triggered them with explosives as well it would have spoiled the picture where from one of the men was asking i looked upwhat where do we get a sack oh for christs sake i said and went across to the flatbed freight truck and got out my penknife and ripped open one of the sacks and poured out the grain and came back and got hornbys body into it and picked up the head my hands more tender now because this husk this coconut this yorick thing with its matted hair and its staring eyes and its gaping mouth had recently been the vessel of all this mans experience and now it was here between my hands a bony urn containing the traces of a human life etched among the infinitely complex network of nerve synapses and cerebral electronics until only a little while ago they had burned out like a firework show and left a shell of ashes for the world to grieve on i took off his watch and put it into my pocket wives and mothers sometimes ask for them as keepsakes come on i said i need some help hornbys arms and legs were difficult because rigor mortis had set in how long have you been here i asked fry when wed finished he checked his watch nearly two hours in the faint hope that zymyanin had got clear before the pounce and would come back here to do business as arranged it sometimes happens if he doesnt show up i said have we lost him not if hes still alive hes been keeping in contact with our dif are you taking over as the executive i dont know i said im here to clean up the mess for the moment i didnt mean hornby i meant the whole mission there was going to be a lot to do and the first thing was to trace the russian contact zymyanin if we could if yes he were still alive but youd better tell me all you can because there might not be a dif for this mission any more that sometimes happens too even though the director in the field is required to stay out of the action in his ivory tower throughout the duration hes not always safe there it depends on how bright he is theyd got hornby and they might have got turner too by now when did you last signal him i asked fry soon after we got here theres a public phone up there at the station how long did turner tell you to wait here for zymyanin my discretion he didnt sound complaining he should have the director hi the field isnt meant to leave anything to the discretion of the support groups or anyone else except the executive hes meant to direct them whos the control in london for longshot i asked him mr pritchard that wasnt surprising pritchard was halfway over the hill and tad done his bit for the bureau due for his pension give him a minor job in bucharest to end his career with but zymyanin was a russian and the russians still werent playing a minor role in international intelligence if london wanted me to take over longshot and get the wheels back on id need a new control someone like croder the bell sounded again from up there at the station and a whistle blew it was rather comforting on this stark and deathly night to know that someone was playing at trams how many people have you got i asked fry protecting the four that was a lot of people seven in all for the support group of a minor mission turner must feel there was safety in numbers you can pull them out i said zymyanin wont be coming back how do you know his tone was challenging and i said because ive been in this trade for seventeen years and the number of missions ive seen blown by totally incompetent directors in the field would make your hair stand on end and since were on the subject theres one of your adamhall people up there with shit in his pants because i came up on him from behind while he was watching the pretty blue and green signal lights so find someone who can train him before you put him into the field again you want to get him killed that was how the poor devil lying down there in his sack had got killed he hadnt checked out the area or surveilled local traffic before hed moved in for the rendezvous he couldnt have and he was meant to be an executive i turned to the man standing next to fry not the one who was shivering go and phone the embassy and ask for their di man and tell him youre bureau and give the parole and the code name for the mission and ask him to get a car sent here to pick up the body and send it back to england he took his hands out of his pockets hell want to know what hell want to know where the body is and that is all youll tell him you understand theres no scrambler on that phone up there all right get going yes sir he swung away and i looked at fry again how many cars have you got here three where are they in the station yard which is the newest one this was bucharest the honda i asked him for the number and the keys and he gave them to me taking his time resentful a very resentful man understandably all right pull your people out as soon as the bodys been picked up i got hornbys watch out of my pocket give this to the embassy people and ask them to put it into the diplomatic pouch addressed to the bureau property of hornbys estate where do i find your dif fry put the watch into his pocket im afraid i cant tell you not afraid at all he was delighted had read the book the location of the director in the field is sacrosanct never to be disclosed if theres the slightest doubt as to the bona fides of the inquirer this man didnt have any doubts hed been told by his dif to expect someone sent in from rome by mr croder and id satisfied him on that and id also known the code name for the mission he was just getting a bit of his own back that was all i respect your reticence i told him there was still nothing more than the glint of reflected light in the shadow of his brows but itd save me having to call london sorry he said thats all right i went over to the shape in the sack and put my hand on it a shoulder i think and held it for a moment requiescat in pace so forth there but for the grace of god then i came away and asked fry how many missions have you been with four this the first crash second oh jesus two out of four what stinking luck i touched his arm hang in there it gets better as we go along i moved away along the line of trucks towards the passenger station and heard his voice behind me hotel constanta i turned and nodded and walked on again moscow he opened the door but not much just his tense grey eyes in the gap and i went through the introductions and he let me in and said he was on the line to london so i shut the door behind me and slipped the lock and waited watching him an angular man with thinning hair and a straight uncompromising back and expressive hands using one of them now cupping the air with his fingers to hold out his explanations until they were ready to accept them london pritchard i suppose because he was the control for longshot or perhaps croder had taken over and was perched there under the bright lights of the console in the signals room with his metal claw scratching at his knee the only evidence that he was in a towering rage because thered be nothing in his voice except the cutting edge of his careful articulation as he skinned this poor bastard alive no sir there was no question of that i just told the support group to wait thirty minutes and if the executive hadnt reported that the rendezvous was established then they could go in with the utmost caution and find out what had happened holding his own not flustered even with the angel of death at the other end of the line copybook phraseology rendezvous was established utmost caution so forth drive you mad in the ordinary way but he just wanted to show he was still in control i rather liked him you give a man like this a jodan zuki and you wouldnt get feathers out youd break your wrist yes sir i understand that hed dropped his right hand spilled his explanations all over the floor croder wouldnt buy them he should have known that croder wouldnt buy a box of matches from you even if you were starving yes hes just come in he looked across at me and held out the telephone cos chief of signals croder i took the phone good evening there was silence on the line for a couple of seconds while croder wrenched his mood round and put his towering rage onto the back burner for a while this was my impression when croder and i made contact with each other we both had to keep our cool we shared what some people called a flint and tinder complex im most grateful to you he said at last for giving up your holiday in rome at such short notice i wish i could say it was worth it theres nothing i can do here we thought there might be time yes i understand that are you keeping the mission running the green led was glowing on the scrambler to show that it was in synch with the unit on the government communications hq signals mast at cheltenham and the red led was unlit we werent being bugged but it always worries me to trust a telephone with ultra sensitive information no croder said im taking it off the board so wed lost the russian contact zymyanin and for the record book under longshot mission unaccomplished executive deceased then blame cot norfolk i told croder no one else i didnt say that for the sake of the man standing over there watching the street from the window id been wrong this crash hadnt been turners fault even though hed been the dif running die mission locally hornby had just gone and got himself killed because he hadnt secured his approach to the rendezvous couldnt have done please explain that croder said on the line no edge to his tone he just wanted to get things clear and so did i id been in a towering rage myself ever since id picked up that mans head from the dirt in the freight yard because you could still see the youth in his face the clear skin the smoothness around the eyes in my opinion i told croder the chief of training at norfolk is sending people into the field too young and too soon i looked across at turner how old was hornby dyou know he turned from the window oh early twenties theyre sending out kids i told croder and theyre getting them killed the chief of support down there in the freight yard had looked even younger could have been nineteen in a moment croder said your comments are noted all i get and i let it go in the meantime you should know that the soviet zymyanin has signalled us and given his whereabouts oh really he arrived in moscow twenty minutes ago intact there could have been some shooting down there at the rendezvous point yes hes quite experienced an older man well trained bloody norfolk i waited a tram went moaning through the street below turner watched it not actually seeing it i knew that he was trying desperately to pick up what information he could from my end of the conversation with croder hed been the dif for the mission but i already knew more than he did about the crash i cupped the mouthpiece and told him zymyanins alive and well itd help him to know that his executive hadnt compromised the contact and got him killed too he shot me a look of relief and i lifted the phone again we would like you to meet him there croder was saying meet zymyanin in moscow bloody nerve someone else could do that we could see carmen tonight shed said at lunch today at gasparis if you would like that i have a permanent loge at the opera house valeria lagorio her huge dark eyes glowing two locks of black hair damped and curled into perfect circles against her shadowed alabaster cheekbones you dont go to rome do you my good friend to wade through the ice cream wrappers in the coliseum as things were id had to break my date with valeria when the embassy had phoned my hotel and that was going to take a dozen very expensive gardenias and a champagne supper at the palazzo di firenze just to get things back on track again youve got plenty of people in moscow i told croder who can look after zymyanin it was only three weeks since theyd pulled me out of the atlantic with a helicopter and not in terribly good condition id got another week to go before they could put me in a briefing room again officially and we can always ask for more time if we dont feel weve got our nerve back go into a new mission with your scalp still tight and youll crash somewhere along the line i felt fit enough but i wanted my final week it was in my contract and id already done my bit instead of sitting in a plush and gilded box at the opera tonight with the totally breathtaking valeria lagorio id been grubbing around in a freezing freight yard stuffing a body in a sack not quite my idea of a holiday zymyanin croder was saying is an important man and we think hes carrying an important message was carrying it to the executive in bucharest and may still be able to give it to us if we show willing i didnt say anything so he knew hed got to go on give me the whole thing its not you see just a case of someone anyone looking after this important soviet contact in moscow since the rendezvous with the executive in bucharest was set up a great deal of raw intelligence has been coming in for analysis and i should tell you that if wed known as much as we do now about zymyanin we wouldnt have left it to a minor cell to find out what information he has for us we would have asked him to make the contact in moscow not bucharest and we would have sent in someone of very high calibre to meet him one of the windows vibrated as a truck rumbled past the hotel and i watched its brake lights come on at the intersection we would like croder said to do that now i said i hope it all goes well theyll use you those bloody people in london theyll use you like a pawn on a chessboard if you let them this man was pussyfooting me into going out again putting his cold steel claw into a velvet glove and stroking me with it our intention he said carefully is to put a new mission on the board and bring a high echelon team together i would undertake to control the new operation personally and i have asked ferris to direct for me in the field a beat he has agreed the lights went green and the truck pulled away through the intersection a big round cabbage dropping onto the street and rolling into the gutter it looked sickeningly like a head im still on leave i told croder we always played this game and he always won but i still put up a bit of protest because there was usually something i could get out of him in exchange this time i had something important i am aware of that he said and of course i apologize you dont take an apology lightly from chief of signals its like god apologizing for the flood i watched the woman at the opera house valeria lagorio one pale ivory arm resting on the crimson plush of the loge her huge eyes intent on the stage then the picture faded as i said ill do a trade with you id consider anything you suggest of course i want you to bring the chief of training norfolk onto the carpet at the bureau and i want you and the whole of the administration including senior executives and directors in the field to confront him with the present situation namely that there are people being sent into the field without a hope in hell of completing their missions before theyre killed turner had come away from the window and was leaning with his back against the wall head lifted watching me through narrowed eyes i listened to the static on the line there was a gale blowing across southern england and the north of france id heard at the airport in rome and the communications mast in cheltenham would be swaying in the dark i will give you my guarantee i heard croder saying that your demands are met it had been a lot to ask and his answer told me something about the size of the new mission he was mounting within a week from today i said in a moment one cant always command the immediate attention of the administration but i shall within a week i said he could get those pontifical bastards out of hibernation sooner than that if he turned on the heat within a week he said very well as it happens i share your concern in this matter but thats not to say i shall find it easy to persuade them im sure you give them the facts show them the records for the past five years tell them to count the increasing number of times weve seen executive deceased on the bottom line i can only promise you to do my utmost thats all i ask i said croders utmost could push a building down where do i report for clearance and briefing i think it surprised him it was a couple of seconds before he answered im very pleased he said im really very pleased let me switch you through to holmes it took half a minute and while i was waiting turner came away from the wall and dropped into a chair and just sat there with his hands on his knees staring at nothing i blocked the mouthpiecedont feel youre to blame for hornby i told him he was in the field not you and he made a mistake that was all he turned his head slowly to watch me didnt say anything ive tried that death on my hands bullshit and it doesnt work drives you up the wall holmes came on the line and i looked around for a scratch pad md found a bit of paper in the drawer of the phone table with suzana pm on it and turned it over and found a bright green plastic ballpoint sorry to keep you waiting holmes said got a bit of a flap on here doesnt surprise me theyve roped you in only the best for our mr c the thing is weve got to find you a plane right away how are you i asked him oh absolutely ripping old fruit you god knows dont worry itll be all right youve got ferris no less and mr c is extremely pleased youve agreed to take this one on its in the m group by the way meridian codename for the mission he got things worked out within fifteen minutes sometimes using another phone to get information while i stayed on the line by the time i reached the airport here in bucharest thered be a reservation for me on aeroflot flight in the name of viktor k shokin from the moment i checked in i would use that as my cover name and adopt the identity of a soviet citizen and would if necessary claim only a rudimentary knowledge of english i would be met at sheremetievo airport in moscow and taken immediately to the british embassy for clearance and briefing i put a few questions and got the answers and shut down the signal and left the scrambler on turner was sunk into himself and i couldnt think of anything to say that wouldnt sound like a trumped up sop to his misery so i just told him i was using the honda and his people could pick it up at the airport keys in the usual place then i shut the door quietly by in the morning i was in moscow there was a girl in a navy blue windcheater and fur gloves and zippered ski boots in the transport area and i went through one of the doors and walked with a slight limp as far as the comer of the terminal building and she caught up with me there and gave me meridian in a soft clear voice and said her name was mitchell viktor shokin i said and we got into a dirty brown trabant and drove through the deserted streets under light flurries of snow theres been a change of plan the girl said taking a fur glove off the wheel and wiping her nose on it they decided they didnt want you seen going into the embassy she had a small pale face with intent and intelligent blue eyes sometimes i thought her teeth were chattering there was no heating in the trabant and the snowflakes werent melting on the windscreen just clogging the wiper blades she stopped twice on our way through the city and i got out and unstuck them and scraped the glass a bit clearer with the edge of a notebook she had in the glove pocket she drove me to a decrepit three storey building in basovskaja ulica and parked the car on a patch of waste ground burying its nose under a hedge and bringing a small snowstorm down from the leaves it helps keep the engine warm she took me into the building and up two flights of rickety stairs under the light of a naked bulb hanging from the floor above the reek of cooked cabbage was sharp enough to clear the sinuses they wanted to put me into one of those ghastly rectangular brown brick workers complexes a bit nearer the embassy but i said id prefer a bit of old world charm thank you even if it was falling apart at the seams nearer the embassy i said she swung a quick look at me in the gloom as we stopped outside a yellow painted door im actually bureau agent in place but i work at the embassy in the cypher room dont worry nobody in this building understands english i made sure of that on my first day here stood on the landing and shouted fire but nobody came out this is my place she led me into a sitting room with a put u up couch and a kitchenette in the corner and a door leading off it make yourself at home can i call you viktor me jane would you like a drink or some coffee or are you hungry did you manage to get any dinner last night i said i was fine she unzipped her ski boots and pulled them off and padded about m her thick red woollen socks going across to a table in the corner and checking for messages the telephone and the answering machine were linked up with a desk model scrambler and the green light was on im going to make some coffee anyway she said as she came away from the phone got to keep my wits about me havent i have you had any sleep tonight it was now gone half past two oh a couple of hours before london came through im compos mentis dont worry a sleepy looking girl in a thick dressing gown appeared in the doorway by the kitchenette its all right go back to bed jane said whos this the girl wanted to know an old friend sleep tight youve got to be up early the girl gave me a lingering look of curiosity and then went back into the bedroom and shut the door dont worry jane said quietly shes totally witless and never talks to anyone she wouldnt know what to say shes at the embassy too makes the tea you want to report in or shall i do it do you go through an operator god no we can dial direct now through the new exchange she went into the kitchenette and i got on the phone and told signals i was in moscow i didnt know who was on the board at this time of night but it sounded like medlock ill tell mr croder he said meanwhile were waiting for zymyanin to contact us again and tell us where he wants the rendezvous and when hes still in moscow as far as we know youll hear from us as soon as weve got anything for you everything all right there i said yes and shut down the signal i hadnt caught anything in medlocks tone but he was probably worried and so was i zymyanin had got here soon after eleven oclock last night he arrived in moscow twenty minutes ago croder had told me when i was at the hotel constanta in bucharest and he should have oven us his ideas for a rendezvous before now one of the reasons why he hadnt done that could be because hed been frightened off by what had happened to hornby and he might even think twice about contacting us again there were other possible reasons and one in particular that i didnt want to think about would you like a cup now ive made it jane had put a tray on the long carved stool one of its legs had been mended with glue and string its not chippendale she aid she was a quick observer but its better than the plastic able i found here when i came shed taken off her windcheater and was suddenly thin boyish in a ballet top under a black cardigan i said i didnt want any coffee there might be a chance of some sleep they gave me instructions she said to clear you for the ussr since it looks as if theyll be running the mission here youre completely fluent and can pass for a muscovite is that right yes she fetched a couple of faded blue cushions and dropped them onto the floor one on each side of the stool or do you want to sit a the table no okay she lugged a weathered black briefcase from under the stool and flipped the buckles open this will be yours to keep as well as the stuff inside she pulled out a thin typed file and a map and turned them to face me light cover you probably wont have enough time to study anything deeper will you the maps only a few months old when were you in moscow last before yeltsin been a few changes yes i hadnt seen any kgb when id come through the airport and thered been no concierge on the ground floor when wed come into the building theyre surface changes jane said at the moment the kgb are meant to be calling themselves the mps ministry of public security but of course most of them are still very much kgb under the skin think of the power they had and a lot of them are just going through the motions of being nice to the proletariat while they wait for another coup and there you think theyll get one coups and rumours of coups someone sounds the alarm about once a week for obvious reasons unless the russians and the satellites can get through the winter with enough food and the basics theyre liable to storm the government offices and demand a coup just to get yeltsin out this is mainly embassy gossip but everyone knows there are something like three million die hard apparatchiks holed up across the country with a hammer and sickle behind the curtains we cant let our guard down yet thats all with a shrug but i expect you know all this from the stuff going through the london signals room its a help to have it confirmed in the field a quick smile thank you shall i get you cleared she didnt have any printed forms here so i gave it to her verbatim and she made notes no medical problems date of last vaccination no request for a codicil bequests unchanged then she made some notes of her own and i signed them active service waiver in the event of death responsibility for expenses incurred the undertaking to protect secrecy most of the forms they had for this kind of thing at the bureau were from the foreign office and totally out of date and every time we ask them to do something about it guess what happens i made the final signature and jane asked me do you want a capsule her eyes widened a little as she watched me ask them to send one out with my dif i shouldnt need one before then she looked down or at all i hope she made a note and shut the pad they probably told you that as far as we know youll be operating in the ussr so theres a good little second hand clothes shop for men i can take you to first thing in the morning theyve got shoes as well and you can start letting your nails grow and dont wash your hair too often work up a bit of stubble but im sure you know all this youre very reminders are invaluable she suddenly drew in a deep breath and let it out again youre being terribly polite but its just that you know i dont get many people coming through here with your track record and i think im rather desperate to get everything right blown my cover not really she finished her coffee and said okay ill get you some blankets and well pull out the couch bathrooms through there you wont disturb amy she levered her legs out of the half lotus and took the pad over to the phone table and put it into the drawer and locked it and came back you do ballet i asked her shows in my walk yes a wry smile always tell a beginner cant you we overdo it hoping people are going to notice not many things in moscow thatll give you status unless youre in the nomenklatura and then youd be in a zil prance along with your feet out and your pony tail dancing and youve got it made she went over to the put u up and i helped her stinks of mothballs but i suppose there are worse things she brought a white patched sheet and some blankets if you feel like some food just help yourself from the pantry the fridge is empty doesnt work its only local fare but the breads terrific of course youll take the call right yes she watched me for a moment her young and intent blue eyes showing the concern of a mother youll be all right there are more blankets if you need them but the stove keeps in all night get some sleep jane she gave a little nod and went across to the other room her feet out and her pony tail swinging i went over the map and opened the thin typed file and gave my cover a first reading viktor k shokin forty two married to natalia yelina nee maslennikova two children boy and girl yuri and masha six and seven brief history of schooling university first job as a stringer for a local newspaper and then a stint as copy boy in the pravda overseas office before joining the reconstituted toss agency a lump of coke fell inside the big cast iron stove and sparks lit the mica window i thought i heard jane and amy talking or it could have been some people in another flat favourite sport football no hobbies slight knowledge of english russian orthodox it was just gone when i dropped the file onto the floor and switched the lamp off and heard a spring twang as i lay down and started memorizing the cover giving it another ten minutes the voices had stopped and through the small high window the snow drifted in silhouette black against the haze of the city lights and the last thing i saw was the steady green glow of the led on the scrambler over there and the last thought i had was about the other reason that might have delayed zymyanins getting into contact with us again he could have set up the kill himself at the rendezvous in bucharest and could be busy setting up another one for me rossiya i broke k she said and tilted the frying pan to get the butter over the eggs oh jesus i said and you were trying to impress me by walking like a duck thought id kind of steal up on you k was a hands on but much used soviet code that the people in codes and cyphers at the bureau had been trying to break for three years i knew it had been done but id thought it was in london another egg jane asked if you can spare one no problem she said blackmarket i didnt know when i was going to eat again thered been two signals from control earlier this morning but zymyanin still hadnt made contact it was just gone eight and the clothing shop wouldnt open until nine even if then jane had said we might have to bash at the back door you worked on it at the embassy here i asked her on k yes id be an infant prodigy in maths if i were an infant when i was six i used to finish dads crossword puzzles for him when he was at the office made him furious and they were in the times at the scrubbed pinewood table she said ketchup i also created mystere she watched me for my reaction did you now mystere was also a hands on code non computerized and c and c had brought in a man from the foreign office to try breaking it he hadnt managed it so far but when he did wed destroy it because if he could break it so could the soviets or someone else i got it from my typewriter jane said or that started me off i use a canon ap iii and i was changing the ribbon when i noticed the characters on the old one its a wide ribbon and theyre not in a single line row it prints three characters vertically shifts wait a minute she reached for her pad and got a pencil it prints three characters vertically downwards then shifts one space to the right and prints upwards again three she glanced up at me am i being an infant prodigy all over you ive worked on codes i said im interested all right three down then shift three up shift three down again like this and if you read it like that it makes sense but we always read in a single line from left to right and that looked like gibberish and it suddenly struck me was looking at a code she put the pencil down and bit on some toast and munched it but if we say typed the words oh i dunno if you like the y comes at the bottom of the first vertical and the o comes at the bottom of the next one and there arent too many ordinary words beginning with yo except for you and you start getting the drift so at the top and bottom of every vertical i inserted a blind character to break the rhythm and that was much nicer she sat back and looked at me had enough no glutton for punishment so i m reading three horizontal lines of code and im not picking up clues from the verticals because of the blinds at that stage it would have taken a bright teenager maybe half an hour to break so i threw in a reverse direction read out and put it on the standard grid and went for three character alphabetical substitutes and froze it mystere she shook her pony tail god dont tell the man in london her eyes were suddenly deep their colour darkening or anyone im offended i said sorry she drew a breath let it out i want that one to run for ever it probably will i shouldnt think so i mean basically its terribly simple but it touched my funny bone to think of all those typists out there its probably the same with any typewriter not just a canon using the basis for mystere when theyre ordering another consignment of paperclips or whatever more toast no ive finished are you working on anything new at the then the phone rang and i went over to it while jane cleared the table weve found zymyanin it wasnt medlocks voice this was the man on the day shift and i recognized him because hed been on the board for solitaire name was carey hes still in moscow he made contact no we had him traced he went to his base in lenin prospekt hes worked with us before in a moment hes bureau but rather a lone wolf he didnt query the fact that i hadnt been briefed on zymyanin didnt want to tread on any toes weve got a watch on him and when he moves well let you know we think hes frightened you see yes it was possible that jane didnt know zymyanin and couldnt have briefed me croder would have assumed i could trust him to know that the soviet was reliable but it made me uneasy i didnt much care for lone wolves in a sensitive field like moscow but he should come round in good time if he doesnt ask for a rendezvous youll have to make your own way well keep you posted as to his movements dont leave the phone i told him id got to go and find some clothes okay but theres an answering machine right yes keep as close as you can though in case he suddenly takes off somewhere i said id do that any questions carey asked me no but you can look after a couple of things for me was hornby married yes send some flowers will you how much for oh twenty pounds name on the card put anything she doesnt know me will do and tell accounts we owe the romanian ministry of agriculture for a sack of grade a rye grain lbs thered be a squeal from that acidic old bitch in the counting house because shes always touchy about passing anonymous funds into moscow without any explanation but the rule is that if we damage any property weve got to report it and its got to be paid for and in any case this was nothing the last thing id stuck accounts for was a smashed mercedes anything else carey asked me i said no and we shut down this was at it was mid afternoon when london came through with instructions medlock was back at the board zymyanin has booked out on the rossiya to vladivostok please stand by for chief of signals jane had been typing a report for the embassy and stopped leaving the room quiet the sky in the high narrow window was already darkening toward nightfall even at this hour the snow had eased off soon after wed got back from the clothing shop i heard croders voice on the line your instructions are to board the train and try to make contact with him with zymyanin i asked croder he signalled you no we had his movements monitored we think he finally decided against making a second rendezvous zymyanin is not normally a nervous man but it seems he was frightened off by the bucharest debacle it didnt surprise me you dont need to be nervous to get clear from a blown rendezvous with no intention of trying your luck again its simply a logical precaution this trades chancy enough without begging for an early grave but what i didnt like was the idea of forcing zymyanin into a rendezvous he hadnt asked for because there were a lot of risks and some of them could be lethal and if it had been anyone but croder giving me these instructions i would have turned them down ive taken lethal risks all my life with the bureau its built into the business but i always need to know in each particular case whether its worth it whats the situation i asked him the situation is that we still think zymyanin has something of major importance to give us if we can persuade him i dont need to tell you of course that he may be very difficult to handle by now yes indeed it looked as if the soviet had got clear of the bucharest thing and was simply unwilling to take any more risks but that was an assumption and assumptions are always dangerous you mean i said he might not have got away clean quite so he may have been tracked from bucharest to moscow tracked by the people whod killed hornby he could in effect be still on the run that is possible i watched the sky darkening in the window he could have been caught i said caught and turned and given new instructions is that what you mean by difficult to handle something along those lines hes got a dry thin voice croder its more like the sound of a paper shredder and if you listen very carefully as you should if you are talking to the chief of signals you can almost hear those little bright blades in there cutting the words out for you the sibilants sharp and clear something along those lines i wasnt going to let him get away with that i wanted him to know i was quite aware of what he was asking me to do he could i said zymyanin have been told to stay out of contact with london and try and draw me into a trap in a moment that is also possible there was a sharp ringing sound in the room i think jane had gone into the little kitchenette and had dropped a spoon or something i didnt like the way it touched my nerves vladivostok was nine or ten thousand kilometres from moscow on the sea of japan and it would take seven or eight days to get there straight through the heart of siberia in terms of security a moving train comes right at the bottom of the scale call it a super trap croder was waitingthe thing is i asked him is it worth the risk zymyanin was said to be bureau but at most he was an agent in place or a roving watchdog he wouldnt know much about london and if the opposition had in fact caught him and put him under the light and burned everything out of him they wouldnt have finished up with anything major if they did the same thing with a senior shadow executive hed blow big ben into the thames if he couldnt get to the capsule fast enough its a built in risk factor and well recognized at the bureau the longer an executive runs and the more he knows the more valuable he is to the opposition nobody likes this but theres nothing we can do about it except take out insurance and the only insurance you can take out is not to send him into the field again croders voice came i was expecting your question whether it was worth the risk this time around yes we believe its worth it i didnt ask why croder gives no easy answers he thinks them out and he must have been thinking this one out ever since longs hot had crashed all over the signals board in london and sent people running for cover he had also been getting input from bureau agents in place in moscow on the general intelligence background there and he had finally put zymyanin into the overall picture and come up with his findings that it was worth risking the life of a senior shadow and worth risking that shadows getting seized and interrogated and thrown onto the trash heap with nothing left in his skull but the burned out circuits of his brain so it was a risk but a calculated risk and those i will accept without them no executive can function all right i told croder and he asked me to stay on the line for briefing i looked round for jane im taking the rossiya to vladivostok she came back into the room what time i dont know a voice on the line said are you there yes it wasnt holmes this time have you been on that train before i said i hadnt all right the one the subject is on will be leaving yaroslavl station in moscow at about hours local time the effect of the long distance plus the scrambler units made him sound like a robot i cant be more accurate than that because those trains are usually late and this one ran into a snowstorm soon after it left st petersburg if it in fact leaves at hours well be running things rather tight so were calling on the embassy for help we dont normally do that any of our overseas missions can end up messy in the extreme with bodies lying around and the host country police and secret services asking a lot of questions and the embassy regards the bureau understandably as a stinking fish but theyve got to give us assistance if we ask for it because we answer directly to the prime minister i blocked the mouthpiece and told jane hours she nodded and got her notepad and sat on the floor cross legged by the long carved stool were going to fax you the man in briefing said three mug shots of vladimir zymyanin to the embassy right away were going to ask them to send a courier to yaroslavl station and get you a ticket for vladivostok hopefully soft class if theres one available thats a two berther if we i want you to make certain i told him that i go soft class understood well do our very best no i said i want you to make certain for security reasons very well they could do it if they tried if the train was full and there wasnt a berth available theyd have to buy someone off and a soft class passenger would ask for more cash but theyd have to pay it it wasnt a question of comfort although eight days on a train would be a sight more bearable with only one companion it was a question of routine mission security id be operating under light cover and three passengers would be less easy to convince than one theres an embassy car on its way to you now the man on the line said with the complete travel package visa maps vouchers cash questions where do i find my director for debriefing were putting him into novosibirsk where the train makes a stop look for him near the main booking office youre mutually recognizable i understand yes further questions no just put me back with signals medlock picked up the line and i asked for croder in a moment cos no support i told him unless i ask for it ive ordered none i know you prefer that thank you we shut down he was being distinctly cooperative croder i usually have to fight control and the dif over the deployment of support groups because they think the shadows safer with a whole bloody platoon in the field but it doesnt work that way it works the other way jane got off the floor as i came away from the telephone theres a list of dos and donts she said on the pad here for you to read ive been on that train she fetched her windcheater and shrugged her small thin body into it i m going down to warm up the car and bring it round we need to pick up some other things but we can do that at the station food toilet roll rubber ball stuff like that she found her black fur glovesstay here and get your gear together and be ready to leave at the door she turned with a swing of her pony tail her eyes dark and intent theyre running it bloody close but well manage snow had drifted among the streets but there was no more coming down the sky was oppressive bruise blue and swollen among the spires and minarets and rectangular termite nests of the housing complexes jane was watching the mirrors from habit i thought as we turned along kirov ulica past the ministry of works shed had field training wasnt just a codes and cyphers specialist at the embassy i felt safe in her hands dont always with strangers there was a traffic jam outside the enormous redbrick station and when we left the car we were immediately among a crowd of milling people most of them staggering under the load of blankets and clothing and a weeks supply of food a man in a royal navy dufflecoat broke from the crowd and brush passed a package to jane and melted again he would have been from the embassy ill see you at the end of the platform jane said and gave me the package the trains in its that one the second along but weve got a bit of time because theyre still loading stuff into the dining galleys ill go and do the shopping i made my way through the huge cavernous hall to the nearest lavatory edging among caucasians indians mongols a lot of chinese the rossiya was going to end its run in beijing their faces jaundiced in the sulphurous light of the massive chandeliers that hung below the roof in the sooty haze there was an unoccupied stall and i stood with my back to the door the lock was broken md studied the three mug shots of vladimir zymyanin turning them to catch the light from the flickering tubes in the ceiling and learning the bony compact face with its tight mouth and its blank uncompromising eyes the jaw thrust forward a little and suggesting belligerence the face of a man not to be found off his guard who would not hesitate for a second if in the course of his business he deemed it necessary to kill necessary or expedient to save time or to save trouble even a little time a little trouble i knew his kind as well i should he was one of us and of this i would have to beware i dont need to tell you of course that he may be very difficult to handle by now croder shredding his words carefully into the telephone i put the photographs away and went back through the crowded hall not missing a face as i made for the end of the platform jane was already there youll have to make room for this the food on the trains not uneatable providing you feel like boiled chicken twice a day for eight days she stuffed the bulging plastic bag into the zipped case wed bought this morning i thought i saw him zymyanin turning away from the ticket gate and going down the platform but wasnt certain he could have been caught and turned and given new instructions is that what you mean by difficult to handle something along those lines whistles had begun shrilling faintly from the front end of the train and others sounded getting nearer women with coats over their white aprons were still heaving crates and containers into the dining galleys and gusts of steam came clouding from some of the windows theyve got the samovars up to scratch jane said itd be a good idea if you went aboard now youve got everything and you wont be lonely six hundred people this ones full she stood looking up at me her black fur gloves held together in front of her like a muff her small face white and pinched in the cold first class i said what you did a first class job oh thank you she looked down then up again her eyes going dark good luck and everything she turned and walked as far as the end of the platform and didnt look back i picked up my bags and went along to car no six hundred people and one of them zymyanin he could have been told to stay out of contact with london and draw me into a trap that is also possible the provodnik clipped my ticket and i slung my bags aboard and climbed into the train night music slavsky boris he put out a pale bony hand shokin viktor i said he was tall hungry looking his dry hair thinning the dark framed glasses too big for his face his body curving in an academic stoop have you done this trip before no he reached up to the shelf over the doorway and pulled down a paper bundle and slit it open and dumped it into my arms bed linen heavily woven the real thing none of your fancy nylon he got his own bundle down and opened it and shook out the sheets i do this trip three times a year he said and looked towards the open door of the compartment lowering his voice so let me tell you something we have to be nice to our provodnik a little tip here a little tip there you understand he had the tone of a lecturer was waiting for me to say i understood i said i did i know most of them he went on nodding his domed head but not this one she must be new youve seen her of course bit of a battle axe wouldnt you say she was the woman i supposed whod checked my ticket when id come aboard large heavy boned lavishly lipsticked and with hair the colour of a copper samovar the shoulders of her blue uniform unnecessarily padded the brass winged wheel emblem glinting on her forage cap her small bright eyes taking me in as id squeezed past her with my bags she didnt look easy to tame i told slavsky ha well put but it has to be done it has to be done he started making up his bunk thumping the massive pillow our berths were on each side of the narrow gangway with a folding table under the window and ajar with some rather pretty blue flowered weeds in it the most one could ask for probably in the depths of a russian winter there was more than enough space for our bags we could have brought a truck load and the compartment in general looked habitable even for eight days at a stretch the only critical problem was the lack of security once anyone saw you going into the compartment or coming out of it they had your address and there was no back door dont be upset slavsky said as he peeled off his jacket about the heat in here the windows are sealed to keep the dirt out and nothing can be done about it people were moving along the corridor heaving bags and packages among them an english couple with their voices raised on the understanding that since the natives couldnt speak their language they couldnt be heard but george youll have to look at things the way clarence does he says this is world adventure number one thats exactly how he put it last night world adventure number one the trans siberian express clarence is out of his bloody mind about bloody trains a group of chinese struggled past with little red and white flags sticking out of their knapsacks then there were a few passengers on their own and these i noted one of them looked in and gave me an expressionless stare and lumbered on with his body angled under the weight of a black canvas bag this was why id asked croder not to put any support people on this train if anyone took an interest in me id know they werent bureau did you bring some food slavsky asked me yes and toilet paper rubber ball yes then you booked through a good travel agent yes the main thing to remember he said and then broke off and staggered suddenly as the floor jerked under our feet and the heavy steel couplings out there took up the slack and rang like a peal of bells under the huge roof of the station and the crowds lining the platform started calling and waving and holding children up and the passengers filling the corridors waved back and i never came to know what the main thing to remember was but i thought slavsky would tell me sooner or later through the windows of the corridor the hazy glow of the station gave way to a string of lights lining the track and when the acceleration had evened out i told slavsky i was going to stretch my legs but he was buried in a book under the reading lamp and didnt look up people were going back into their compartments and leaving the corridors clear but some girls in grey overalls with the state insignia on them were washing down the walls and others were trundling vacuum cleaners in and out of the compartments nearer the dining car how many carriages are there i asked an apple faced woman with a mop on this train twenty two a lot of carriages a lot of work i stepped over her grey galvanized bucket and went through the rubber walled booth into the next carriage taking my time noting every face looking into the compartments when the curtains were open scanning the faces of the men who stood in the vestibules at the end of the carriages coughing in the clouds of smoke from their cigarettes twenty two carriages six hundred people and i might have to walk the entire length of the train a dozen times fifty times before i found him zymyanin a lot of work yes indeed you were right little mother he would know zymyanin that the bureau would have wanted to bring him to a second rendezvous with a second contact because the information hed got for us was still shut in his head he would know that when hed failed to signal london to set up a new rendezvous control would make it his business to put a watch on his movements and have the new contact standing by to force him into a meeting if he could he would know that i was on this train im sorry i said babushka as i got in the way of her mop i shouldnt be working as late as this a stainless steel tooth flashed in the bluish light it was the snow after st petersburg that held everything up he wouldnt recognize me zymyanin had never seen me before and would not have been given the photograph of a high echelon shadow executive but he would come to know me come to know who i was who i must be when he noticed i was searching the train for someone and once hed got a fix on me id move immediately into a red sector if that man had in fact set up a kill for hornby in the freight yard in bucharest and had now set one up for me that would be all right in the streets of a city or in open countryside where there was adequate cover the risk would be calculated the kind we thrive on if we play them right but here in his long thin tube stretching through the wilderness there were risks dependent on sheer chance and at any given time zymyanin could catch sight of me from the far end of a corridor before i saw him then hed bring me under his surveillance and i might not have enough time to realize it before he made his move the thing is id asked croder is it worth the risk i was expecting your question yes we believe it is it was the only excuse id got for taking it the only justification croders word when i came back to the compartment the night sky through the windows of the corridor was sable black and jewelled with stars as the rossiya ran through open country and the dark slavsky was asleep i think he didnt say anything when i changed into the track suit wed bought at the used clothing shop this morning in moscow and stretched out on my bunk the heating bad been turned off not long before midnight and now the air was cold and tainted with the constant smell of disinfectant from the lavatories id strip washed half an hour ago using the big iron bucket in the nearest toilet the water rust coloured and near freezing but that hadnt been the main problem which was to keep things from dropping through the big uncovered drainpipe onto russian soil artifacts for posterity but the little black rubber ball had worked well enough in the handbasin a stand in for the missing plug in the last five hours i had covered the whole length of the train three times waiting in the queue for a late supper in the nearest dining car and surveilling for more than an hour and then moving on using other passengers caucasian and in groups when i could find them as mobile cover wandering with them along the rocking corridors and meeting with bands of gypsies some americans with the stars and stripes sewn proudly onto their jeans a french army colonel in full uniform a gang of russian hooligans shouting the odds about the coming revolution gaggles of winsome little ballet students on their way to the academy of dance in novosibirsk a scottish highlander in a campbell clan kilt and a party of singing drunks i had also met our senior provodnik again galina the muscled redhead and chatted with her for a while before she signed off her shift putting reasonably direct questions about working conditions on the train and especially the rate of pay and expressing mild shock at its inadequacy considering the daunting responsibilities of her job there was no excuse for crossing her palm with silver at this stage but expectations were carefully stirred it wasnt that i felt the need for extra comforts of any sort but for a recruitable agent in place with an unbreakable cover who could ferret out information for me that might indirectly further my progress in the mission or even protect my life because there was a second possible scenario in my mind zymyanin might be perfectly reliable a good agent understandably scared off by the bucharest thing and unwilling to risk another rendezvous in which case he was no danger to me but if the opposition had tried to kill him off along with hornby in that freight yard they might have followed him onto the train to try again zymyanins own life could be in hazard as the rossiya plunged headlong through the night and if i made contact with him it could be lethal a thousand roubles in galinas bank account to buy her secret services could prove a profitable investment and to hell with that carping old crone in the counting house we play our little games we the brave and diligent ferrets in the field with wit and sinew as our weapons when we can but if base money can provide the means of our salvation as we burrow through the dark and treacherous labyrinths then we will use it were not proud my good friend we are not proud we find we live longer if we are practical on my way through the corridors tonight i stopped to talk to any of the staff who had the time though not many did one of them a weary eyed girl with calloused hands and stained overalls with the seam torn at the shoulder told me that the coach attendants security guards waiters cooks and cleaners worked for nine days at a stretch on the run from moscow to beijing then took a week off in moscow or vladivostok in turn but the pay is good she said pulling a lock of damp hair away from her eyes i earn roubles a month with free keep thats quite good i said it was terrible but so you should she dragged chips of wood from the rocking floor of the galley and pushed them into the furnace below the huge copper samovar yes and then one day i shall be a provodnik in a uniform i spent more than an hour in the dining car because of the three men there and watched the waiters tussling with a pack of beatniks who were trying to hog a table for a game of cards swigging their beer from the bottle and making up a dirty song about the revolution id seen them before along the corridors the three men were in their fifties their faces sharp boned and weathered their dark woollen suits well cut and their shoes polished four other men younger and quiet faced observant seemed to be in the same party although they were sitting at different tables two of them on each side of the table where the older men were one of them the quietest with the totally expressionless eyes of a wolf dining car and surveilling for more than an hour and then moving on using other passengers caucasian and in groups when i could find them as mobile cover wandering with them along the rocking corridors and meeting with bands of

although they were sitting at different tables two of them on each side of the table where the older men were one of them the quietest with the totally expressionless eyes of a wolf he could have been told to stay out of contact with london and draw me into a trap that is also possible even though i had narrowed my eyes he would catch the light on their conjunctivae the man out there the range was short and he could see the target the point between my eyes and behind it the brain he would need only one shot and couldnt miss i watched the outline through the gap in the curtains waiting for it to move for only a part of it to move the gun hand tanya the man was standing near the lavatory at the end of the second carriage along waiting to go in i suppose watching the first light of the morning on the snows one of the cleaners passed us lugging a box of rags and then i went up to the man and stood behind him longshot i said close to his ear he wouldnt know meridian hadnt contacted london but hed known longshot had seen it crash he didnt turn his head he was the man id been watching last night in the dining car the one who was sitting alone he was zymyanin i saw the reflection of his face in the window sharp boned the mouth tight as in his photographs i need more he said in a moment still not turning watching my own reflection bureau more he said softly zymyanin he turned his head now and looked at me his eyes were wary but not afraid even though he knew id caught up with him i would think these eyes had never been afraid only alert wary like this watching for a way out if he thought he needed one wherever he was i knew that look had felt it in my own eyes here was a brother ferret are you replacing him he asked me hornby no i said theyve taken that one off the books im just here to talk to you thats all he didnt say anything a bolt banged back and the door of the lavatory opened and a man came out one of the bodyguards id seen in the dining car last night i turned my head away until he was halfway along the corridordo you want to go in there i asked zymyanin what no it can wait the smell of urine and disinfectant came drifting across i touched his arm and we moved farther away past the two cleaning women who were bent over a stain on the carpet rubbing at it with a block of dark yellow soap ive got nothing to tell you zymyanin said and i heard anger in his voice though he kept it very soft you people have got a mole sniffing around surely you know that i russian i said hed switched to english was fluent but it didnt tally with my cover theres no mole they dont exist in the bureau cant exist the security checks are like x rays in that place theyve got to be were not the foreign office it was just incompetence and inexperience hornbys hed let a word drop somewhere full of excitement its happened before id picked up the vibes from turner his dif in bucharest when id been with him in the hotel constanta hed been holding himself back sick about hornbys death but wanting to blame him for what had happened had stopped himself id admired him for that the train rocked across points and buildings swung past the windows blocks of darkness lumped together on the snow some with lights showing pale in the dawn incompetence zymyanin was saying all right it was incompetence he got to the rdv early you understand that early i understood yes its one of the cardinal errors a potentially lethal mistake and what guarantee have i got that i can trust you he wanted to know how do i know how competent you are how do i know you havent brought half a dozen opposition hit men onto this fucking train because of your incompetence had a bad scare hed had a bad scare this man in bucharest no fright in his eyes but it was still down there in the gut i quite understood id been thinking he was a potential danger to me and hed been thinking i would be a danger to him if we forced him into i rendezvous and now wed done that it couldnt have been him last night standing outside my compartment if hed known i was in there he would have run to the far end of the train i know exactly what you mean i said it was no good telling him i was a senior executive weve had one or two senior executives found in some foreign clime with their brains raked out of their skulls and the capsules still in their pockets i had to remember it was only two nights ago when this man came close to getting blown into christendom like hornby this isnt a rendezvous zymyanin said watching me his eyes bright with nervesi didnt ask for one and i dont want one is that understood i dont want you to come anywhere near me again i want you to keep out of my way right out of my way someone else went into the lav down there and slammed the door hit the bolt it must be wine one of the cleaners was saying her voice shrill with vexation a pink knee showing through the hole in her black stocking as she knelt on the floor with her bar of soap it must be red wine again look its not coming out some drunk the other woman said a drunk did this id have to talk him round somehow zymyanin get his confidence back but i didnt trust him at the moment and he didnt trust me now that hed seen my face hed remember seeing me last night m the dining car then a stranger he would be wondering why i hadnt followed him out of there when he left and revealed myself then instead of waiting until now hed know id realized what hed been doing in the dining car who are they i asked him hed been keeping observation on the three men my question didnt surprise him he would have been expecting it sooner or later i was here to get the information he had for us and it obviously concerned the men hed been watching would be watching again in a moment he said they are former general kovalenko and general velichko of the army high command and special purpose militia detachments respectively and former general chudin of the kgb however well a spook is trained and however experienced he sometimes finds it irresistible to tell what he knows to someone hes at least expected to trust if what he knows is of great importance and theyre now in the podpolia i asked him the underground of course he said impatiently he was impatient with himself not with me hed revealed his flaw and knew it i didnt say anything waited for him to tell me other things now that hed started this is so dangerous he said and looked along the corridor again i agree whos in your compartment with you three ukrainians metal workers they never leave there theyve brought enough food for the whole trip play cards all the time ive only got one in with me i told him ill find out when hes going to stretch his legs and let you know we can talk in there it was a risk i hadnt wanted him to know my compartment but he could find out if he wanted to id got no cover and in any case he seemed ready to talk now and i had to catch him while he was in the mood listen he said on an impulse you must have recognized me last night in the dining car you must have been given a photograph so why didnt you follow me out of there when i left i thought of lying but if i lied hed know it and id lose what trust hed got in me if he had any at all i had my reasons i said he let his eyes stay on me not showing anything but his nerves trying to see what was in mine seeing nothing i think it angered him listen if you want a rendezvous itll have to be somewhere off the train when we stop for a break there are two breaks a day jane had put in her notes for me when you can stretch your legs and breathe some air unless the trains running so late that they cant manage it there wasnt any point in trying to rush zymyanin itd have to be drawn out when did you first pick them up i asked him he might be in more danger than i knew than he was ready to tell me id have to get what i could as soon as i could i cant tell you that at least not yet we you were going to tell our contact hi bucharest no then what were you going to tell him he swung his narrow head up to look at me a sprig of his dark unwashed hair bobbing as he turned i was going to tell him only that those people would be on this train i you didnt need a physical rendezvous for that i said you could have just signalled london he looked away again staring through the window picking at his short ragged nails a factory of some sort swung by its chimneys pouring a long dark cloud across the snow covered roofs of the buildings listen he said this is all i can tell you for now the bureau should do everything everything to keep those people under surveillance thats why im here of course but im also here because theres a cell in moscow his head swung up again to look at me a completely unacknowledged unofficial cell whose purpose is to seek find and expose the active members of the podpolia wherever they may be many are known of course and the kgb is watching them closely but some are not known and those we are looking for that is also why i am here there were voices behind me but i didnt turn round just watched zymyanins face his eyes as he looked along the corridor they were mens voices speaking in russian growing louder as they came past zymyanin showed nothing turned his head to stare through the window again and last week he moved into a new apartment shall i tell you about it no itll make me sick of course itll make you sick in his new apartment he has to share one bathtub with thirty other people and his kitchen is an electric hot plate that never gets hot enough to boil water i thought yeltsin was going to make a few little changes here and there didnt you for gods sake snow had begun whirling past the windows we were running into another storm that is all i can tell you zymyanin said for the moment he turned away and took a few steps turned back his nerves still bright in his eyes when ive got something more ill contact you in the meantime keep your distance he turned and walked on and in a moment the door of the lavatory banged and the bolt went home later in the morning i got out the briefing jane had given me and went through it and reinforced the mnemonics and folded the three sheets and took them along to the first provodniks station i could find unattended and pushed them deep under the trash in the waste bin and heard someone coming and got a cup from the shelf and filled it from the samovar that is for me to do the provodniks tone shrill and indignant i cant leave this place for half a minute without someone coming in here and meddling i told her she made the finest tea in all russia and said i would tell my grandchildren about it in the years to come so forth and she took a pinch of it as a compliment and told me to be off with my wily charm i should be peddling butter in the black market most of the stuff jane had given me was standard tourist information and i spread out the maps in my compartment and looked them over they showed the route and schedules of the rossiya and vignettes of tyumen novosibirsk irkutsk khabarovsk and vladivostok with the major streets named a group of youths trooped past the open door and i went out and stopped them picking two of the brightest looking and giving them twenty roubles to split and telling them what i wanted then i looked for galina and found her blasting a pallid and red eyed girl in a torn smock the bulkheads in car no were filthy and this was the third time the passengers had complained and who would take the blame when the reports were sent in she galina ludmila makovetskaya would take the blame who else since she was the supervisor for cars no and when the girl had gone i looked into the small bright still enraged black eyes of galina ludmila makovetskaya and asked her how everything else was and did she think the snowstorm would cause any problems and learned that this was a bad day for her because her ingrowing toenail was beginning to give trouble just like the doctor had told her it would but it would mean an operation only a minor one but the thought of it terrified her then i offered her a hundred roubles and explained that since i was a journalist as she knew my whole livelihood depended on sniffing out stories and perhaps she could help me in this the three men i said for instance who were in the dining car last night they looked important she braced her large body against the bulkhead as the train rocked and took out a packet of cigarettes you smoke im trying to quit she lit one with a match from a monogrammed book with the winged wheel on it and blew out smoke and looked at me with her eyes no longer enraged but sharp now bright with conspiracy they used to be somebody now they are nobody they used to fly everywhere now they take the train she gave me their names and former ranks and they tallied with whatzymyanin had told me its rumoured that two of them the army officers were arrested and tried for supporting the coup but were acquitted a shrug of the big padded shoulders who knows who knows who is who these days or who they were or what they were doing half the army and the kgb has gone underground as you know even though theyre still marching about for all to see she dropped ash circumspectly into a tin tray with the ubiquitous emblem on it and opened a steam valve on the samovar the heating system for this coach had broken down soon after breakfast this morning and the warmth was welcome in here you wish me to make discreet enquiries about those men the faintest of smiles touched her heavily lipsticked mouth softening her looks even though she would smile like this as she buried the knife deep between my shoulderblades if she saw in me an enemy or even thought she saw this was my impression very discreet i said very discreet enquiries yes i asked her other things and when people came past us or asked for some tea we talked about the snowstorm and the shocking price of everything now that demokratizatsiya was rife in the land before i left her she said of course i shall have to satisfy others you must understand her eyes glittered in the folds of flesh squinting at me through the smoke from her cigarette no others i said no others galina ludmila this is very strictly between you and me is that clear a shrug very well i pulled out another hundred which was what she was after anyway no others she said there was no one of interest at lunch in the dining car when i passed through it and later came back the generals werent there or zymyanin in the afternoon the rossiya drew its great and massive length into a village station and most of the passengers dropped from it and stood in the flurries of snow that came blowing under the red painted wooden canopy that hung over the platform it wasnt a scheduled stop i was told we were being given a break the first and last of the day because we were running late i saw slavsky doing his knee bends hed been trying it on the train but couldnt keep his balance and a party of chinese went jogging through the snow outside the station their little flags jerking on top of their rucksacks while the petits rats on their way to the academy of dance in novosibirsk went prancing off in the other direction with their pony tails flying and their laughter echoing under the canopy like the cries of birds a drunk was throwing up at the end of the platform and i turned and walked the other way keeping up what pace i could among the crowd and trying to find some fresh air to breathe not easy because most people were smoking with fierce concentration to make the best of the break i saw nothing of zymyanin or the generals but the young woman in the silver grey fur hat was walking alone through the snow her fur lined boots crunching along the cinder pathway it was evening when i next saw her slavsky liked the compart ment door to be open when we werent sleeping or changing our clothes and i didnt argue because i wasnt there for most of the time one of the youths showed himself in the doorway and jerked his head and i followed him along the corridors to the dining car the other youth was standing in the queue behind the young woman and gave me his place there was only one table for two at the far end and i joined her there even though there were other places and she seemed to want to be alone we sat opposite each other she was facing the bulkhead while i could see down the aisle beyond her it was a small table and it would have been difficult for us to sit in silence during the meal but even so i think she would have preferred that tanya rusakova i believe i leaned towards her a little as i said it i hope im not wrong then her eyes were on me for the first time a shimmering and iridescent green widening in surprise yes shokin i said viktor shokin you wont remember mebut i think we live on the same street grafskij prospekt ive seen you there sometimes and i passed through your office the other day you re at the ministry of transport motor division yes im sorry but i you were busy at your desk i came in for a new driving licence that was all i see she wished i hadnt recognized her wished i werent here when the waitress came we tried to get her to bring us anything except boiled chicken but it didnt work it was all theyd been given she said wearily when the caterers had loaded the galleys in moscow youre going right through to beijing i asked tanya while we were waiting no she hadnt smiled yet even as a social gesture perhaps found it difficult even impossible because of her state of nerves and the overwhelming hatred she felt for general velichko vladivostok then i said making it an amusing guessing game she didnt answer looked everywhere but at me im a journalist you see and were always asking questions arent we im afraid the media hasnt got a terribly good reputation for the preservation of privacy im going to beijing have you been there no she was studying the menu using it as a refuge general velichko is going there i said and she swung her head up and stared at me more than surprised shocked that was my impression i dont know him shed said it too fast with her mouth too tight and those fine sensual nostrils had flared and the light in her eyes was still burning the hot light of the hatred id seen when shed been looking at him ad am hall at general velichko here in the dining car last night her eyes looking down most of the time but on occasion drawn to him as he sat five tables down the aisle hed been the only one of the three facing her the other two had been sitting side by side with their backs to her that was why i could be quite sure theyd been for velichko no one else those sudden looks shed given him precipitate spontaneous and so very dangerous though shed been unaware of that i would have felt afraid for her if i hadnt also seen last night that she could dissemble tanya rusakova when she wanted to had given the good general the faintest of smiles as shed left her table and walked past him along the aisle what you would call the suggestion of a come on she wasnt a tart there were a few of them on the train but she wasnt one of them she wasnt an actress even though that smile for the general however tenuous had taken talent to produce considering what she really felt for him she was as galina had found out for me a government clerk in the motor division of the ministry of transport living alone on grafskij prospekt thirty two unmarried her destination was novosibirsk not beijing or vladivostok as id known her brother an army captain was stationed there general velichko was also going to novosibirsk and id known that too and that was why id thought it very interesting that look of shock in the flashing green eyes when id said just now general velichko is going there too id been looking for a reaction and id got it and it had been more extreme than id expected most of it was because id suddenly spoken the very name of the man who inspired so much hatred in her but it must have been partly because of the deliberate dropping of disinformation id been prepared for her to say no hes not going to beijing something like that but it hadnt happenedshe didnt want to talk about that man not a word had been tempted surely to get up and find another table if she could or leave the dining car and this damned journalist with his damned questions was she worried that i might be right that shed been mistaken hat general velichko wasnt in fact going to leave the train long before beijing at novosibirsk how important was it to her plates suddenly dumped onto the table in front of us and the unappetizing smell of boiled chicken none too fresh thank you we said shed been quick the waitress even though the car was almost full and the other girls were flying around with trays and dishes and jugs of beer the fat uniformed supervisor watching hem hands on her hips i wished our food had taken longer i wanted as much time with tanya rusakova as i could get zymyanin had wanted to know why i hadnt followed him out of here last night since i must have recognized him it was because id wanted to stay until the young woman with the silver grey fur hat left her table in case i could learn something the bureau should do everything zymyanin had said to keep those men under surveillance apart from that hed given me almost nothing that could have been because he didnt know anything yet anything major perhaps this woman did they were there tonight the men i called the generals six tables along the aisle did she know tanya did she want to look round to see if they were there if he were there velichko they werent talking they hadnt been talking last night they sat with their food eating it as a necessity looking up from the table very seldom when someone went past them along the aisle they were the sort of men whod want to know what company they kept but here they didnt show concern they had their bodyguards i didnt think zymyanin had noticed tanya rusakova last night except as a woman as any man would look at the eyes the cheekbones the infinitely attractive mouth but hed been concentrating with his oblique and casual glances across the dining car on the three men and hadnt caught i believe the expression in tanyas eyes when shed looked at velichko im going to spend a night i said in novosibirsk this chicken really was bloody awful god knew what theyd done to it down there in the galley wiped it all over the floor conceivably she was taking her time perhaps wouldnt say anything at all yes she didnt lookup she was wondering how to ask me the question that was burning to get out why had i mentioned general velichko quite out of the blue just to break the journey i said i wouldnt think thered be much to do in a place like novosibirsk would you the rossiya blew its whistle just then and the sound came with the shock effect of a scream in the night and she almost flinched and i wanted to comfort her in some acceptable way put my hand over hers just for an instant she wasnt having much fun tanya rusakova sitting here with her nerves like an open wound sensitive to loud noises to the sudden mention of a name theres an opera house she said oh really then she covered it too late so i believe an attempt to disassociate herself from the city of novosibirsk to be noted are you fond of the opera i quite like it yes prince igor she put her knife and fork together her chicken unfinished and got her grey leather bag giving me a glance in passing with nothing in her eyes except perhaps distrust goodnight she said and slipped gracefully between the bench and the table it was a pleasure but i broke off starting to rise and then stopping at once but not before she noticed it i caught a look of surprise it was so easy to forget and it could be so dangerous behave like a russian be like a russian think like a russian she walked down the aisle and i watched i watched very carefully the man sitting six tables along heavy faced broad shouldered impressively tailored he glanced up as tanya rusakova passed him and by his expression i could see that there had once again been a smile for the general shot they have asked for a new compartment galina stood watching tic im relocating them from car no to car no they say theyre too near one of the lavatories the dark was coming down on our second day out from moscow the rossiya had ploughed through nearly two thousand kilometres of steppes and the ural mountain range and now we were running through forests of birch and pine and cedar standing draped in snow under the endless leaden skies we were due in novosibirsk tomorrow galina had shown herself in the doorway of our compartment a few minutes ago glancing across slavsky who was reading as always and giving me the slightest movement of her head i had followed her to the provodniks station they object to the smell she said simmeringso what would they expect look what the passengers do in there all day are they rose gardens would our friends perhaps prefer the smell of roses so would i but youve agreed to move them she lit a cigarette its black tobacco glowing as the flame of the match went out it smelled of forest fires i have decided to accommodate them yes she said there are three compartments in car no nearer the locomotive occupied by chinese tourists her small eyes kindled sparks of light certain favours were exchanged as you will understand our friends are not ungenerous and the chinese are indigent being chinese thus there is no problem she had started yesterday to talk of the generals as our friends without my prompting she would train well if she ever wanted to enter the shadowed nether world of covert operations youre moving their entourage i asked her as well but of course she watched me steadily squinting in the smoke from her cigarette i thought you should be informed yes do you think their reason for wanting to move was genuine a shrug with men of their kind who knows what is genuine and what spurious they had power once now they have no power but they think they have their ways are devious i drank some tea with her as the train plunged into nightfall through the dizzying snow that drove past the windows piling against the frames she told me that she had chosen to supervise the switching of compartments personally and would report to me of anything she observed or overheard in the evening i shared a table in the dining car with boris slavsky and listened to his views on the future of the cis if as he said it could be considered to have one he spoke well marshalling his facts but my attention was less with him than with general velichko and his companion tanya rusakova smiling and attentive at the table for two wed been sitting at last night galina searched me out an hour before i turned in she had nothing to report except that during the changing around of the compartments shed learned that the former general velichko had been made a hero of the soviet union for gallantry in afghanistan and then was stripped of his rank and honours following the coup i didnt see her again until soon after dawn the next morning when she came to our compartment bringing tea for us and the news that one of the passengers in car no nikolai vladimir zymyanin had been found shot dead he was lying on his back with his face to the ceiling and there were powder burns around the blood filled entry wound in the right temple flecks of blackening flesh and splinters of bone were scattered across the floor from the exit wound the bullet had gone straight through his skull the gun was also on the floor not far from the open drain a short barrelled heavy calibre revolver perhaps army surplus he shouldnt be in here one of the security officers said to galina he was looking at me we were in the lavatory for car no and the security people had got the provodniks to rig up a makeshift curtain of sheets around the door to give them more room and keep people out there was a piece torn from a cardboard box pinned onto one of the sheets with instructions chalked on it out of order use lavatory in car no or he is an important journalist galina told the officer from moscow he is known for his crime reports in all the papers they were young the security officers and her tone was perfectly pitched she spoke not as someone in uniform with responsibilities on this train but as a stern and implacable mother the ultimate authority i squatted down and the reek of the disinfectant burned inside my nostrils i was looking for signs of torture on the face and hands and wrists burn marks the red pinpoint of a needle puncture anywhere it had been set up as a suicide but that wasnt in character and zymyanin had been left handed and the entry wound was in the right temple what i needed to know was whether hed been put underpressure very great pressure to talk before they shot him and whether to expect the same kind of thing if in fact theyd broken him and hed blown my cover but there werent any marks and the conjunctivae of the eyes that stared at the ceiling showed no damage i made notes for the look of things jane had put a shorthand pad into the briefing bag but i didnt ask any questions now that id seen what id come here to see i wanted to slip back into low profile and disassociate myself from the dead man i thanked galina and pushed the curtain aside and started back along the corridors the snowstorm had moved south and a wintry sun was hanging above the pines on the eastern horizon like a chinese lantern hed died scared zymyanin the bucharest thing had shaken him and more than hed shown though hed shown a little thered been a note of panic in his voice when wed been talking about hornbys fatal incompetence and what guarantee have i got that lean trust you how do i know how competent you are how do i know you havent brought half a dozen opposition hit men onto this fucking train because of your incompetence that hadnt happened id been totally clean when id come aboard the rossiya in moscow thered been no one surveilling me on the night flight no one tracking me from the airport when id got into janes car id made absolutely certain of that had needed to make absolutely certain because if the shadow executive for meridian had landed for briefing in moscow with even the smell of the longshot thing on his shoes we would have gone into the mission compromised and endangered at the outset i hadnt brought any opposition hit men onto the train but zymyanin had he must have done i hadnt contaminated him but he could have contaminated me in his last hours not his fault that is all i can tell you for the moment when i have something more ill contact you in the meantime keep your distance i would slip galina another hundred when i saw her again tell her to play down the fact that id wanted to view the body it had been a risk id had to take a calculated risk thered been no choice i sat down to some eggs in the dining car when the first calls for breakfast came i wasnt hungry but wanted to take in protein there was only one topic of conversation among the other passengers and they spoke in low voices you mean hed been lying there all night long but surely someone would have heard the shot poor man and we were all sleeping peacefully i dont think i can manage any more julia do you mind if i leave you here i went back to my compartment soon after eight oclock and found boris slavsky with sheets of writing paper laid out on his bunk like cards in a game of patience he looked up at me his eyes wide behind the thick lenses what have they found out he meant the security people nothing as far as i know i hadnt told him id been to look at the body they still think it was suicide i dont know i havent asked them he went back to his papers he was a professor of biology hed told me at the academy of sciences in akademgorodok south of novosibirsk just before ten an announcement was made over the public address system this is the chief of security we shall be stopping briefly in half an hour from now at thirty minutes past ten oclock nobody will be permitted to leave the train and passengers are instructed to keep away from the doors i will repeat no passengers will be permitted to leave the train i was reminded again that if anything went wrong with the mission if i needed continued freedom of movement to keep it on track and make progress i might be forced to do it in the confines of these narrow corridors and might find that when id boarded this train in moscow i had walked into a trap the only way out of it even if i could reach an unattended door was across the limitless wastes of siberia therell be a full enquiry slavsky said i imagine yes i said in twenty minutes the huge momentum of the rossiya began dying and the beaker of water on the small collapsible table was sliding gradually towards the edge a distant scream came from the locomotive ahead of us and the steel couplings began banging as the tension came off would this be a town i asked slavsky hed said he did this trip three times a year yes looking up from his papers a small one there are several between tyumen and novosibirsk small buildings swung past the windows many of them with their blue or green paint faded and peeling away we heard geese raising a clatter and the faint shout of a farmers boy inside the train people were crowding along the corridors staring through the snow encrusted windows we will repeat our previous announcement no one will be permitted to leave the train when it comes to a stop passengers must keep the doors clear boris slavsky was shuffling his papers into some sort of order and stuffing them into his big leather case i hope this enquiry wont hold us up he said theyve got a little dinner party planned for tonight in novosibirsk he trailed off with a modest mumble celebrating my homecoming how nice for you i said there wouldnt be any celebrating in london tonight if i could send a signal through from novosibirsk when the rossiya made its stop the board for meridian would be looking bleak under the floodlights russian contact deceased opposition hit suspected executive assumed in hazard that would depend the hazard thing on whether any serious notice had been taken of the fact that id talked to zymyanin not long before he was killed it would also depend on whether the opposition had in fact struck some kind of spurious deal with zymyanin perhaps for his life and got him to talk before they killed him and finally it would depend on how well or otherwise my cover would stand up to a homicide investigation i have two grandchildren slavsky said he was perched on the edge of his bunk and looking up at me with his eyes magnified by their glasses you dont look old enough i said thank you he looked down modestly id begun to find boris slavsky rather charming and it would have been nice to talk to him some more between here and novosibirsk i didnt think that was going to be possible the couplings out there raised a whole peal of bells as the carriages started shunting and i braced myself against the bulkhead as the train came to a halt i got a towel and cleared a hole in the fogged glass of the window and saw two police cars standing in the snow beyond the rustic platform their coloured lights revolving dark figures moved about i couldnt tell whether they were in uniform a generator began running and hydraulic pipes hissed the people lining the windows of the corridors were talking their tone quietly excited reminding me of a murmuration of starlings along a telephone wire then there was the tramp of boots on the platform and voices sounded some of them from inside the train then finally a door was slammed shut are they the police slavsky asked yes i said it was when a provodnik put his head into our compartment a man not galina shokin viktor yes i got up id been looking at one of slavskys books at a coloured illustration of the nervous system of the drosophila melanogaster while i was mentally going through the details of my cover i followed the provodnik along to the dining car the corridors were almost empty thered been repeated announcements asking passengers to keep to their compartments unless it was essential to leave them the rossiya had taken on a different atmosphere since wed stopped at the small town something like that of a ship running into trouble in mid ocean we were now halfway from the town to novosibirsk and moving into the half light of darkening skies it was said there was another snowstorm a big one hanging over central siberia the tables had all been cleared in the dining car except for their white linen cloths some of them still stained the smell of sour cooking seeped in from the galley you are shokin viktor sergei yes there were something like twenty uniformed policemen dispersed among the tables sitting in their booths opposite the passengers with big yellow notepads between them some of the trains security guards were protecting the exits sit down please i am chief investigator gromov a man in his fifties thick bodied and square faced a black mole near the side of his nose his eyes bland and patient as he studied me hed left his greatcoat on despite the steamy heat in here i sat down a chief investigator this table was at the end of the dining car the one where the major interest was centred perhaps theyd been sifting through probably two or three hundred passengers since theyd come aboard and hadnt even reached car no two along from my own id been specially selected do you know what has happened on the train yes i said tell us what has happened please two other investigators were at the table one sitting beside me and the other opposite the one opposite was quite different from his chief lean and pale faced with colourless eyes a thin line for a mouth a sharp nose bone he was also much younger would have come up fast through the ranks to be sitting here with the chief of homicide investigation a dead man was found i said early this morning was it an accident his eyes were a nutty brown the chiefs with gold lights in them they could be the eyes of your favourite uncle the one who always brought you things when you were a whipper snapper and he came to pay a visit but sometimes as he watched me the eyes of gromov deadened and the light in them went out and that was when i felt worried because he was slipping a mask over them there are a lot of rumours i told him some say he committed suicide others say he was murdered and which dp you think is the truth youre asking me to choose between rumours he picked up a pen a cheap red ballpoint with a tuft of frayed string on it perhaps hed pulled it away from something he began making notes on the big yellow pad not all the time just now and then as i went on giving him the answers to his questions as best i could he talked to me as if this were the first id heard of any incident on the train and i understood why he wanted to see if i knew something that none of the other passengers did and hoped id let it out unintentionally did you see this man zymyanin when he was alive id already told him id asked galina to let me see the body and make some notes and hed thought it not unreasonable for a diligent journalist to do that i saw him a couple of times i said along the corridors his carriage was two away from mine or thats what i assume since he was found in car no did you ever speak to him once gromov looked up from his pad oh i think he was where was this in car no i think he was waiting to go into the lavatory there because someone came out while we were talking what were you talking about i told him zymyanin had asked me what i thought of the new economic bills theyd just signed in parliament whether i thought theyd do any good get any food on the shelves he kept on circling this incident gromov wanting to know the time when id talked to the deceased what id thought of his demeanour did he seem depressed anxious about anything the other man never took his eyes off me never made notes chief investigator gromov made quite a lot covering half the first sheet of his notepad then he switched to a different subject and i didnt know how well or how badly id done so far it hadnt actually been a hurdle the question of whether id ever talked to zymyanin several of the cleaning women had seen us together and so had the man whod come out of the lavatory one of the generals bodyguards id had no chance of lying do you know gromov asked me suddenly how the body of die deceased was discovered i said no but you saw the body he left his patient brown eyes on me that didnt tell me how it had been found he looked down again at his notes i didnt like these little traps he was setting for me giving me a chance to say yes the deceased had looked very depressed possibly suicidal asking me to choose the truth between rumours it was quite probable that hed spent his whole career as an investigator setting little traps did it in his sleep because hed found they sometimes paid off but he wouldnt have done this with the other passengers unless they were already suspect i was right this was the table where the action was where they brought people straight through the queue as a matter of doubtful privilege to be put under intense examination however patient his eyes gromovs however they reminded you of your favourite uncles i was suspect he was saying nothing waiting forme to volunteer some kind of information waiting for my nerves to set little traps for myself on their own wasting his time the younger man the thin one didnt take his cool pale eyes off me they were fixed at the edge of my vision field and if they moved id see it happen i turned my head a little and looked through the misted windows the world had become black and white out there with the sky towards the east brooding in darkness and the snow covered flatlands beneath it catching the last of the daylight by the rocking of the train i would have said we were running flat out again at something like kph according to slavskys figures you have nothing more to say i looked back at chief investigator gromov im here i said to answer questions of course let me tell you then comrade sho excuseme mr shokin how the body of the deceased was discovered it might prompt your memory the my memorys very good chief lnvestigator my work demands it he inclined his large square head i was forgetting he said he wasnt the deceased was found in a lavatory as you know the door was not bolted from the inside though it was closed one of the passengers tried to go in there since the sign was set at vacant the bolt being in the withdrawn position but they found what they described as some kind of obstruction and assumed that someone was inside and had forgotten to bolt the door and was simply pushing against it to disallow entry and ensure their continued privacy this happened with three of the passengers and after a time one of them told a provodnik that they thought someone might have passed out in the lavatory the provodnik then used his weight against the door and managed to get it halfway open and saw the deceased lying on the floor he raised the alarm i waited i was here to answer questions the two security guards at the far end of the dining car stood aside to let one of the passengers out a short man almost round in a dark coat that hung from him as if someone had thrown a black cloth over a ball another passenger was brought in tanya rusakova no coat a white heavy knit polo sweater and black leather skirt fur lined boots a gold chain swinging from her neck as she slipped into the booth and looked at the investigator there her eyes guarded does this suggest anything to you gromov asked me the fact that the door had not been bolted from the inside i leaned back resting one arm on the table at my ease its still a question of taking your pick isnt it chief investigator it could suggest homicide since nobody could have shot the victim and then bolted the door from the inside when he left but a suicide wouldnt necessarily have bolted the door either before he shot himself the kind of evidence youre looking for is quite outside my knowledge even though i viewed the body and what kind of evidence is that circumstantial the basics youll have got it by now of course were there fingerprints on the gun that werent the victims or was it wiped clean or did it look as if his fingerprints had been impressed on it by someone else was the deceased left handed according to the measurements youve had taken of the musculature on both arms since the shot went into the right side of the head things like that of course i cant give you the answers his eyes deadened the tiny gold lights going out and you are ad am hall not trying to teach me my job i assume he wasnt being stupid he was trying to get my goat that was all start an argument in the hope that id trap myself in the heat of the moment you had me brought here to answer questions chief lnvestigator you asked me what kind of evidence it was that i considered was quite outside my knowledge that was my answer i waited again it still worried me that he was setting traps because it looked as if hed been given some kind of evidence against me and had got me here to pick at my brains until i broke and confessed and id have to watch it watch every word every move i hadnt shot zymyanin but id been seen talking to him and id asked to view the body and i couldnt afford i could not afford to let this man put me in handcuffs and under guard on a charge of suspicion meridian was running and hornby had been killed and the soviet contact had been killed and the only lead i had would be taken away from me if gromov took away my freedom your answers are appreciated he said in a moment and looked at his assistant the thin man and back to me you speak well viktor shokin you answer questions adroitly i let that one go the thin man got up and left the table his thigh catching the corner and sending chief investigator gromovs red ballpoint rolling across his notepad he picked it up and wrote three more lines his large head tilted as he watched the thin spidery script forming along the lines on the pad then he looked up at me again there are two witnesses he said slowly who have given evidence concerning you viktor shokin that i find significant they then he broke off as his assistant came back bringing two people with him the generals bodyguard whod come out of the lavatory when id been talking to zymyanin and galina ludmila makovetskaya the red headed provodnik this man the chief investigator said claims that when he came out of the lavatory in car no yesterday he saw you talking to the deceased as you have admitted but he says that your voices were raised and that you seemed to be threatening him what have you to say to that i looked up into the face of the witness saw no expression a nondescript face the eyes giving nothing away as i would have expected of a former red army generals bodyguard possibly a former member of the gru trained to keep his thoughts out of his eyes hes lying i told gromov the large head tilted a degree he also claims that shortly before midnight last night he heard what he thought was a shot coming from somewhere in car no and that he saw you in the corridor there hurrying away from the lavatory what have you to say i looked down at gromov hes lying you should check his story chief investigator you should check it very carefully gromov dropped the red ballpoint onto his notepad and swung his heavy head up to look at galina this provodnik has also stated that she saw you in car no which is not where your compartment is immediately after she heard what sounded like a shot he looked down at me what have you to say i felt a vibration on the air created by the nerves i suppose as i heard in my mind the bang of the trap shutting shes lying i told gromov theyre both lying perhaps he said perhaps but until i have satisfied myself of that i am placing you under arrest viktor sergei shokin on a charge of suspected homicide the officer beside me nudged my arm and i made a token of protest as would be expected of me and then let him put the handcuffs on and snap them shut pride what was the town back there where the train stopped if you talk the officer said you may incriminate yourself his name was konarev that was what chief lnvestigator gromov had called him he was my guard and he had the key to my handcuffs it was on the bunch dangling from his polished black belt his gun was in its holster i couldnt see whether it had a safety catch he was in his thirties his leathery face still pocked with the ancient scars of adolescent acne hed sliced his chin this morning or perhaps yesterday morning with his razor his eyes were hard so hard that they had surely never softened even when hed met his first love or his last love or his wife whatever if the question ever arose of his having to shoot he would shoot to kill there were two other officers in here they were sitting on one of the benches going through sheafs of paper the first statements made by the passengers conceivably two security guards were in the corridor both wearing bolstered guns the train was moving at optimum cruising speed or close by the feel of things it was by my wristwatch the kanovia watch that jane had bought for me a russian model everywhere else on the rossiya the clocks would be showing seventeen minutes past noon moscow time they would be showing moscow time when the train rolled into beijing the time wasnt critical but i noted it because it could become critical later in the day in the night everything in this situation could be considered critical in the extreme if there were going to be a chance of regaining my liberty it would probably be the result of my having noticed something perhaps something very small officer konarev had a slight cold for instance and his reaction time would be a few degrees slower if he had to move quickly do you live in the town where we stopped i asked him or in novosibirsk if you talk you may incriminate yourself he blew his nose again i appreciated his official consideration couldnt fault it we were in a compartment not far from the locomotive the bunks had been ripped out and the bulkheads were partially repainted i think thered been a fire in here there were areas of discoloured and bubbling paintwork and the lingering smell of burning there was no heating either it was broken down or the cleaning staff had turned it off wanting to cool down after their labours in the rest of the train where the heating was tropical this was a staff carriage and the banging of buckets and the light cries of the womens voices above the rumbling of the train were a constant background id put on my padded jacket over the track suit the gloves were in the pockets thered been a penknife in one of the track suit pockets but theyd taken it away also the cheap plastic handled knife that jane had packed for me in the food bag the rest of my baggage was in here with me two officers one of them gromovs thin and pale eyed assistant had searched it in front of me a man in a blue coat and trilby hat had come in with a small attache case and opened it up and taken my fingerprints giving me a small sealed alcohol swab to clean my fingers with afterwards i had no alibi the sky out there must have some light left in it to the west in the track of the train perhaps the sun had found a hole in the overcast on its way to the horizon it was leaving a pale unnatural light across the snows that i could see to the north through the window making them seem like frosted glass faintly lit from beneath above it the sky was just as unreal not quite dark but with no light in it an awesome shroud across the evening thrown by the coming of night it looked inhospitable out there not a place where one would think of going of setting out alone not in the ordinary way but then of course one must on occasion leave room for the extraordinary mustnt one when the devil drives no alibi at all slavsky had gazed wide eyed at chief investigator gromov a dry nervous hand adjusting his glasses and said no he didnt hear me leave our compartment after last night when hed gone to sleep leave it or come back to it or leave it again nothing hed heard nothing he slept soundly always and was used to the noise of the train it wouldnt have mattered much what hed said because the generals bodyguard and galina ludmila makovetskaya had both sworn to having seen me near the scene of the homicide and having heard a shot i had been outbid she hadnt had much time for the generals galina they had power once now they have no power but they think they have their ways are devious but they still possessed the power of money and it had talked it had said that shed seen me there last night where the dead passenger was found with the generals bodyguard thered been no money involved the underground faction the podpolia had put hornby out of the way in bucharest and they had put zymyanin out of the way on this train and they had driven me into a trap that i wouldnt get out of and whatever i said against them whatever i knew about them couldnt do them injury it would be taken as an attempt to clear myself theyd needed a scapegoat someone for hanging to draw attention away from themselves over the shooting of zymyanin and one of them had seen me talking to him in the corridor within hours of their killing him and i had become a suitable candidate and galina was dead wrong the generals the clandestine and omnipresent podpolia had power besides money immense power in the land this had been the thrust of zymyanins mission itself clandestine to attack that power im also here because theres a cell in moscow a completely unacknowledged unofficial cell whose purpose is to seek find and expose the active members of the podpolia wherever they may be are you married i asked konarev my guard have you got children he told me i could incriminate myself but theyll usually start talking about their children give them long enough of course he might not have any or even a wife could well be devoted exclusively to his police work i watched the other two for a moment at work on their papers and then the noise started a distant but enormous whoomph like a heavy calibre shell bursting and then just the rumbling of the train for a second two seconds before the big steel couplings began banging and the carriages started shunting and the iron buckets in the cleaners quarters went wild and i saw konarev do a half turn caught off his balance and hit the wall with his hands going up to save himself as i pitched sideways and crashed into him and he got his gun out very fast and pushed me away while the other two policemen hit the long plate glass window and bounced off it with their papers whirling upwards and then drifting like leaves as the red came the huge red glare spreading across the snows through the windows of the corridor outside the women were screaming and one of their buckets came rolling past our compartment door as the whole train went on shunting and konarev and the other two found their feet and i got off the floor with a certain amount of caution because of the gun he was still holding it on me but with both hands now i think hed knocked his head when hed crashed against the wall and was feeling a bit dizzy didnt want me to take advantage and try something fancy but that was out of the question because the rossiya was rolling like a ship in heavy seas and nothing looked certain it had been doing a hundred and fifty kilometres an hour before the explosion had happened and there was a fire raging back there half a dozen carriages away or perhaps closer than that all i could see was the bright orange glare across the snowfields and its light flickering on the faces of the two security guards in the corridor as they picked themselves up and stared into the compartment with their mouths open the floor shifted again under our feet and we landed against the forward bulkhead as the train went on decelerating in massive jerks obviously the carriage back there had blown up and jumped the rails and pulled the adjacent ones with it and the locomotive was under the brakes as it dragged the train behind it like an injured snake through the snows one of the women went staggering past in the corridor with blood running from her face perhaps in shock and moving instinctively away from the fire dont move konarev shouted above the noise and i noted this too as well as having the beginnings of a cold he was more nervous man id thought him to be didnt want me to get too close while hell was breaking loose like this id lurched into him that was all couldnt help it and there was nothing i could do in any case bring the link between the handcuffs down across the gun yes but id only get shot in the leg when his trigger finger reacted and he wasnt the only armed man here there were four others and he didnt seem to realize i hadnt the slightest chance of getting away the train was still shuddering the carriages shunting as the speed came down more progressively now as small buildings began swinging past the windows dachas i think and a pall of smoke started rolling across the snow with its shadow meeting it the last time id looked at my watch it had shown and the city of novosibirsk would have been a hundred kilometres to the east i would now put it at something like thirty perhaps less and that was why we were running through scattered buildings on the outskirts though none of them had lights in the windows a lot of noise as something smashed behind us closer than the explosion it sounded like the whole side of a carriage being ripped away could have turned over snapped the couplings the speed was right down now we were crawling and smoke began blowing through the corridors the two police officers went out there and one of them shouted oh my god and they started running aft to help people and the security guards followed them as the shunting got a lot worse for half a minute and then we stopped and konarev and i hit the bulkhead again and i kept my distance as best i could because he might pull off a shot by mistake his finger was inside that bloody trigger guard dont move he said again and i shook my head and stayed exactly where i was my back to the bulkhead and pain moving in on the nerves now there was time for the organism to pay attention the left shoulder had taken the worst of the impact when id hit the bulkhead the first time there was an iron bracket sticking out of the wall where the bunk had been ripped away for replacement and i must have torn my thigh on it because there was blood creeping down my leg i could feel it but it didnt worry me because it wouldnt stop me running if i had to if i could its the only thing we think about when were in a trap if we can get out of it can we run people were coming past the doorway now more security guards and provodniks some of them with blood on their hands or their faces one with her uniform ripped off at the shoulder the smoke was thicker along the corridor and a man went past with a handkerchief pressed to his mouth and konarev looked at me and jerked his gun and said out it was very cold we were standing konarev and i a hundred yards from the train he was behind me and had prodded me with his gun as a reminder that in spite of everything that was going on i was still a prisoner under guard the security people and the provodniks and some of the cleaners were bringing the dead and the injured out of the train onto the snow making a temporary first aid station while people still inside were pulling sheets and blankets and pillows off the bunks and passing them down to the others the carriage that had blown up the twelfth back from the locomotive was still on fire and small figures in the distance black against the snow were forming a chain brigade with water buckets and waiting until they could get close enough to use them smoke still lay in a dark swirling shroud to the north of the train and above the distant snows the sky hung black and enveloping part of it rust red from the glow of the burning carriage a kind of silence had moved in now that the train was standing still and voices carried through the freezing air mostly those of the rescue crews the train staff was shouting instructions and information as they herded the passengers across to the comfort station they were setting up no one was allowed to go back into the train even to fetch their belongings since it was possible there might be further explosions a radio message had gone to the army barracks hospital staffs and emergency services in novosibirsk and medical rescue helicopters were already known to be airborne there would shortly be enough blankets available from the train to provide warmth for every passenger and a soup kitchen was being set up something was on my mind are you injured konarev asked me what he was looking down at my fur lined boot the blood had reached there now no when i looked up again and across at the train i realized it was galina the large woman id been watching as she helped with the rescue work her back braced to lift the smashed bulkhead that had come down across a passengers legs while someone pulled him clear she would be good at that galina the morals of a toad but with a streak of crude humanity in her that was brought out by crisis but it didnt excuse her the bitch i was standing here with these handcuffs on because of her odious greed and i could have raised the bidding if only shed asked me given her double what shed been paid by the generals wouldnt she like to know that something was on my mind and i knew what it was now the burning carriage was the twelfth back from the locomotive and that was the one where the generals and their bodyguards had been before galina had moved them at their request im relocating them from car no to car no they say they re too near one of the lavatories two provodniks were swinging one of the huge copper samovars down from the train smoke curling from the furnace underneath others were bringing wooden trays of cups following the path of the samovar across to the comfort centre the sweat bright on their faces in the light of the fire children were crying their voices thin and piping shreds of sound in the night their cries torn from them from their pain would zymyanin do this to children oh yes hed been a man with a cause when you set explosives you know you wont be there when they go off it gives you the same feeling of remoteness a bomber pilot has when he watches the patchwork streets of the enemy city come into the sights he too is a man with a cause and the cause is his country and that is enough but i didnt think it had been zymyanin his business had been intelligence not terrorism or political assassination it had been someone else and they wouldnt have wanted to take the risk of getting killed if the whole train ran amok and if theyd been on the train they would have known that the generals had moved out of car no someone screamed and went on screaming as part of the wreckage collapsed and two or three people went over there from the rescue squads but there was too much to do and not enough hands for christs sake i said to konarev cant we make ourselves useful instead of just standing here you can leave these things on me no it was the first time hed said anything except to warn me that i could incriminate myself if i talked stay where you are look i said you can keep your rucking gun on me while im working what more do you want no bastard he was nervous because i was on a capital charge and hed be entirely responsible if i got away from him chief investigator gromov and his team were helping with the rescue work id seen two of them carrying a body in a sheet over to the place where theyd set up a morgue zymyanins possibly the screaming went on and i turned my back it was all i could do and konarev told me to stay where i was and i told him to fuck himself and i added that in front of the whole court i was going to let it be known that while people were trapped in that wreckage and dying for the want of help hed been content just to stand here and do nothing nothing but he just went back to his broken record i could incriminate myself bastard you could turn your back on the train but there was nowhere you could look where there werent people injured or in shock or crying or standing with their arms round someone else and trying to comfort them id seen tanya twice tanya rusakova shed been helping one of the stretcher bearers and then id seen her working with some other passengers pulling wreckage clear where someone was calling for help i hadnt seen the generals the bureau should do everything to keep them under surveillance zymyanin had said then i would have to do that get rid of this bloody peasant and look for the generals and keep them in sight wherever they went it had been all zymyanin had left for me as a focus for the mission i looked into konarevs flat square face and saw the nerves in his eyes listened to that man screaming over there the one who was trapped havent you got any bloody humanity it would have been dangerous i think if hed warned me again about incriminating myself because that would have blown all my fuses and i would have incriminated myself all over the stupid bastard and he would have ripped off a shot and that would have brought people running people in uniform end of mission finis he didnt say anything watched me with his eyes flickering slightly worried about me he should be i can tell you he bloody well should be then people began looking upwards as the first flakes of snow came drifting out of the dark belly of the storm the rossiya had been running into it when the bomb had gone off and the train had come to a halt but the storm itself was moving westwards across the city and into the open steppes and the snowflakes were big ones eddying out of the silence of the sky then in the distance i saw the faint flashing of strobes as the first helicopters came in low guided by the glow of the fire where the rossiya was lying crippled gypsies had wandered in from their camp nearer the town and stood watching the scene then dogs barking in excitement two of the security guards passed us going to talk to them possibly to ask if they could bring some of their tents here to give people shelter someone was trying to break into one of the darkened dachas shouldering the door until the lock broke with a bang they were summer places shuttered for the long winter season none of them had lights in the windows the strobes glittered in the east much nearer now and lower still and the beam of a floodlight came fanning across the scene from the wading helicopter people called out to one another and some of the children waved i would have to do something soon now if i could do anything at all time was becoming critical investigator gromov would bring his team away from the train as soon as the reinforcements arrived and i would again become the centre of their attention and when that happened thered be nothing i could do nothing at all the chopping of rotors came in and the shadows shifted across the scene swinging as the floodlight turned and the helicopter put down in a whirling flurry of snow two more landed three and the snow became blinding until the rotors came to a stop i could kill konarev but there was no case for that it couldnt be justified as self defence i could overpower him but there was the risk of his gun going off and if that happened it would bring down meridian in the instant because i wouldnt have any chance left of finding the generals and keeping them under surveillance another helicopter put down near the compound where most of the passengers were huddled against the cold and the snow whirled upwards blotting them out of sight two of the machines were military with the insignia of the russian air force on their sides the other two carried a red cross konarev was watching them and i looked at him at the angle of his head and the set of his body left hand hooked into his belt right hand with the revolver in it finger inside the trigger guard there was no safety catch it was ready to fire i would have to use both arms together for whatever action i could take because of the handcuffs and that would make things more difficult but not impossible i was just running the whole thing through my mind that was all i probably had another few minutes before i actually needed to do something if the risk was worth it i didnt think it was gromov and his team were less than a hundred yards away still working with the rescue parties and close enough to hear a shot theyd turn and start running across here and theyd be within optimum target range within fifty yards and when they saw me trying to get clear theyd shoot and theyd shoot to kill two more helicopters landed huge machines with twin rotors troop carriers and the dark figures of their crews came running from the haze of snow then i saw the generals recognizably moving in a group with their bodyguards away from the train and towards the helicopters they were thirty or forty yards away their faces not distinct but the cut of their greatcoats clear enough and their air of purpose the three leaders were moving slightly ahead with their bodyguards holding off on each side it was almost a miniature parade i sensed konarev tested his aura let my nerves pick up his vibrations but the information i was receiving fine as gossamer was simply that he wasnt relaxed wasnt just standing there he was ready for me if i made a move the generals were talking to one of the military pilots showing him papers the snow drifting across their dark coats and settling on them as the edge of the storm reached us the pilot was looking at the papers turning them to catch the light from the helicopters that was still flooding the scene i didnt need the light i needed darkness i needed to be able to get clear of this man konarev and follow the generals they were asking the pilot to lift them out with the first of the passengers and the injured what else would they be asking him the gun was six inches from my body konarevs gun that was too close the bureau should do everything to keep them under surveillance noted but the pilot was giving the generals their papers back and pointing to one of the helicopters with the air force insignia on its side then cupping his hands and shouting to one of the crew then he turned back and nodded and the generals began moving towards the helicopter their bodyguards closing in theres an edict taught at norfolk and even repeated to senior and experienced shadow executives during refresher courses on the subject of risk taking in the field at a crucial phase of any given mission when the executive is tempted to take a risk that would seem ad am hall likely to place that mission in hazard he is expected to bear in mind that his life is to be counted more than the mission itself on the premise that he may well survive to bring future missions to successful completion and recoup the loss to strip this edict of its bureaucratic terminology we are asked to sink our pride and not to act the bloody fool but to get out with a whole skin if we can and leave the mission to founder but its extraordinarily difficult to put into practice and we argue the toss about it in the caff and the briefing rooms quoting from the records which show that the executives have so far got away with something like fifty per cent of the decisions made in hot blood and carried the mission with them sometimes with a bullet in them somewhere but not where it could incapacitate sometimes with a flesh wound and blood loss but nothing critical and the reason why this kind of decision making is so difficult is nothing to do with the risk itself nothing to do with its technical configuration or the balance of its calculated profit and loss its to do with personal pride i watched the generals they were picking their way across the snow their bodies leaning forward their shadows thrown by the floodlights as they neared the air force helicopter other passengers some of the walking wounded were following them as the pilot beckoned them on chief lnvestigator gromov was still working in the vicinity of the train his officers with him the man had stopped screaming some time ago either theyd got him clear of the wreckage or he was unconscious or dead i watched the injured passengers one of them boris slavsky blood soaking into the bandage round his head when eight or nine of them had reached the helicopter i saw the generals and their bodyguards go aboard then the pilot helped the injured to climb the short iron ladder so it wasnt konarevs gun that was the danger here it was personal pride above the cabin of the military helicopter the rotor had started naming and a puff of dark smoke clouded from the exhaust the bureau must do everything but the bureau could do nothing i the appointed agent of the bureau in the field could do nothing perhaps i had ten seconds left to deal with konarev and get across to the helicopter and go aboard if the pilot would take me but the risk of this mans gun going off and sounding the alarm was too high and even if i could reach the chopper the bodyguard whod given false evidence to the police would recognize me and id be back in a trap finito the rotor was spinning now and the whole machine vanished in a vortex of flying snow and then its strobes lifted and traced an arc across the night sky before they were slowly blotted out by the storm as i stood there watching with my life vouchsafed and my pride in rags as meridian died its death execution adiutorium nostrum in nomine domini qui fecit caelum et erram the priest made the sign of the cross again and moved on to the next body a nun following him a thick woollen robe over her habit a voice sounded faintly from nearby and she went over there hes coming she told them the father is coming other priests were working here other nuns they had arrived in the police vans and the ambulances and on the fire trucks finding what transport they could the snow ploughs had got here first an hour ago clearing the cinder roadway alongside the track for the other vehicles to follow two bulldozers were working at the wreckage aft of car no and a crane was lifting debris from the rails someone had cried out as one of the carriages was rolled back onto its wheels and a doctor went over there taking a nurse with him there were still people buried under the wreckage the snow was heavy now driving from the east and covering the length of the rossiya and the passengers still huddled in the compound waiting for transport into novosibirsk there were no more helicopters airborne now two of them had collided soon after takeoff and one of the snow ploughs had swung in a half circle and begun clearing a path for an ambulance dominus vobiscum et cum spiritu tuo the priest and the nun moved on i was looking for tanya shed been working on the wreckage of the train with the rescue crews until half an hour ago and then id lost her but i must find her again and stay close tanya rusakova had become important could perhaps offer me a chance in a thousand that was my thinking i went across to the head of the transport line where the trucks were still coming in to evacuate the able bodied passengers she hadnt left here yet tanya id watched every truck as the people had piled onto them id watched from a distance because chief investigator gromov was there with a cadre of his officers checking the people too as they clambered across the tailboards looking for me i had a scarf across the lower half of my face many of us did it was quite the fashion because of the bitter cold wheres my mummy what i looked down i cant find my mummy a small pinched face with the tears frozen on it a look in his eyes beyond desperation i picked him updont worry shes here somewhere i carried him across to one of the nuns and left him with her and went back to the head of the transport line watching from a distance i had not been gentle my good friend with konarev he had got my goat if you remember i had needed a diversion of some kind had been waiting for it waiting with great patience and then the helicopters had collided and people had started screaming and the snow plough had swung round and throttled up with a roar and i brought the handcuffs down across konarevs wrist and the gun fired once and missed the target and i smashed my head into his face and fell across him when he went down into the snow and used a sword hand to the carotid artery with enough force to stun and felt for the keys on his belt and tried five of them before i found the right one no one was looking in this direction the only people i could see were half lost behind the dazzling curtain of snow in the floodlights so i bent over konarev and brought down a measured hammer fist to the frontal lobes to produce concussion and got him across my shoulders and took him to the ambulance station where they were putting the injured on board told them it was a head trauma case that had been thirty minutes ago and it was then that id started to watch the pickup trucks looking for tanya and by now i was beginning to think id missed her but that idea was unthinkable because of the last possible chance drowning man shuddup clutching at a straw shuddup and leave me alone then i saw tanya she must have gone back to the train to find her suitcase they were helping her swing it aboard the next truck in line i turned and walked across the area ahead of it where the snow had been packed down by the vehicles coming in had to watch my step it was like a bloody ice rink now theyd have to start breaking it up with a bulldozer i went fifty yards and saw the truck coming at a crawl slewing all over the place and when it was close enough i clambered over the side and they made room for me i still had the adamhall scarf across my face and i dont think tanya recognized me didnt want her to she was at the rear and i faced forward getting down behind the cab to keep out of the wind as the truck found better terrain and gunned up with the headlights dazzling against the curtain of snow they hadnt seen me gromov and his men but theyd go on looking for me and when they finally gave up and made for the city theyd fill the streets with militia patrols to help them and there was the other thing didnt know how long itd be before konarev regained consciousness but when he did hed let out a big squeal and that wouldnt help id have to be very careful go to ground if i could find some kind of a bolt hole ferris wouldnt be waiting for me at the station in novosibirsk as arranged hed have got the news by now and sent off a signal to london reports are that rossiya has crashed whereabouts and condition of executive unknown hed look for me in the town wherever the transports were going to drop us off and id watch for him too but i didnt think much of our chances in a crowd this size wed have to do it the other way through signals try and set up a rendezvous it was a bomb what the scarf was round my ears it was a bomb back there on the train he was a youngish man but with his face prematurely weathered by the siberian winters his eyes squeezed almost shut against the wind of the trucks passage his nose leaking mucus was it i said no question i am a linesman i work on the track it doesnt take much you see at that speed at a hundred and fifty kilometres an hour for the wheels to jump the rails we were lucky it wasnt worse very lucky i said revolutionaries the truck hit some ice and we grabbed each other as it slid and found some cinders and came straight again with a jerk people calling out behind us they should be shot if i found out who it was i would shoot them yes i said but i didnt think it had been revolutionaries the target had been car no where the former hero of the soviet union velichko had been earlier and it could be that the bomb like the smile had been for the general the citys authorities had commandeered a public gymnasium for the passengers of the rossiya those who hadnt already been taken to the hospitals and women were carrying mattresses and blankets inside unloading them from trucks with the municipal insignia on them city of novosibirsk the transports just in from the scene of the train disaster were dropping people off in a small square near the gymnasium and loudspeakers were announcing the immediate and gratis availability of shelter bedding food and limited washing facilities for those who preferred not to go to a hotel the loudspeakers were crackling and cutting out altogether a lot of the time and upwards of five hundred people the uninjured survivors of the crash were crowding around the entrance doors and it looked as if it were going to be hours before thered be enough bedding in there for them all the blizzard had stopped as the storm moved on to the west but snow ploughs were in the streets and emergency vehicles with chains were moving in behind them above the buildings the sky was black and the stars glittering but it was cold in winter jane had noted for me the night temps can go down to so be prepared for closed streets and frozen plumbing but the main streets in this area were open their surfaces rough with sand and the ploughs were working through the smaller ones their engines booming among the buildings and their headlights flickering i was on foot and had so far made two turns to the right and three to the left tanya seemed to know her way and was walking quickly where she could though her suitcase looked cumbersome for her i could have brought one or both of my bags from the train konarev would have allowed that but there was obviously going to be the need to travel light she turned to the right again and i moved faster until i reached the corner we were now in ob prospekt named after the river that had turned novosibirsk into a major inland port halfway along she crossed over dropping her suitcase into a snow drift and heaving it out again she looked back for the first time since wed left the square but i just kept on walking the distance was adequate and there were other people in the streets in this time zone more than three thousand kilometres from moscow it was now and the lights in most of the hotels were still burning the one she was making for was the hotel vladekino a small three storey red brick building at the corner of two side streets and i went past and came back and gave tanya five minutes to check in and went up the steps the hotel is closed the woman behind the counter said and watched me with eyes tired of looking at strangers the lift was still moaning and as i got my wallet out i heard it stop tanya was known here had been made welcome in the stairwell i heard the lift doors opening on one of the floors above youre in the best place mother i said and put a fifty rouble note onto the counter its cold enough to freeze a brass monkey out there the russian translation was less coarse could be used in talking to a woman are you from the train she eased her bulk out of the worn red velvet covered chair and came to the counter folding the note and tucking it away no i said id used snow to wash the blood off my boot it was blown up it was terrible have you heard yes terrible people killed she said and opened the register the last entry had been made out for room you must fill in the form she said and i picked up the pen that was tied to a big brass paperweight on the counter and i must see your papers you are from moscow yes you have the accent i couldnt tell from her tone whether it was a compliment or a reproach is there a phone in the room i asked her there are no telephones in the rooms a distinct reproach this time as if id said i needed to contact a call girl i completed the registration form and she pushed my papers back across the counter where do i phone from mother in the corner there she copied my name into her book and put the room number it was too close for safe surveillance work because tanya would recognize me if she saw me but i didnt ask the woman to give me a different room because it would bring questions and i didnt want that shed be one of the people in this town whod be asked by the police if they knew anything of a man named shokin viktor sergei perhaps a few minutes from now a few hours from now certainly by the morning id taken the lesser risk using my cover identity rather than alert her at the outset by saying id lost my papers where is your baggage theyre still looking for it at the airport id seen three jetliners lowering across the city since id left the rossiya and two taking off so theyd managed to keep at least one of the runways clear in spite of the snow they must be used to it had got things worked out i need to make a phone call i said to london in the united kingdom her eyes widenedto where i told her again im a journalist as you know it was on my papersi want to file my story on the train disaster ive heard there were some british passengers on the rossiya in a moment you speak english a little it was another shocking breach of security but there was no option i had to phone london and i had to do it from here because if i went to another hotel to put the call through id miss tanya if she left here wouldnt know where shed gone and she was the only chance id got of putting meridian back on the board in london and even then i couldnt do it without a safe house and a director in the field and they were here forme somewhere ferris was in this city or should be lets hope to god let us hope my good friend to god what number is it the woman asked me i wrote it down for her on the curling sheaf of old registration forms she used for a notepad there was no risk this time the number was protected untraceable it will take time the woman said its long distance i put another fifty roubles onto the counter and said tell them its urgent mother give them some of your tongue you know how to ginger things up this is a news story and i could be the first with it in london she watched me with her eyebrows raised and her faded blue eyes wide open shed got a face like a withered apple round and red and wrinkled but she wasnt your favourite aunt any more than chief investigator gromov had been your favourite uncle her eyes had the stare of studied innocence and she could recognize a piggy bank when she saw one ill do my best she said and lumbered across the creaking boards of the floor to the telephone in the corner where a dead plant dangled from a chipped earthenware pot through the brass entrance doors i saw a militia patrol car bumping across the ruts in the frozen snow but it didnt stop not this one not this time i had a few more minutes a few more hours before one of those patrols would stop and theyd come in here with snow on their boots and ask to see the register it is urgent the woman was saying and not for the first time it is urgent i tell you earning her fifty roubles as best she could while i stood halfway between the telephone and the glass doors ready to move if one of those cars pulled up outside the hotel and started spilling uniforms there was a corridor off the lobby lit by one glass shaded lamp in the ceiling and there were two recesses one of which would lead to the rear of the hotel there was no way out of the lobby except that one the corridor the stairs and the lift didnt interest me i would cripple my chances at that moment inevitably when the militia came up the steps and opened the glass doors i would bring them closer even as i got clear of the hotel by the very act of vanishing but id have no choice if they came you are the newspaper the woman was shouting into the phone theyd say yes the switchboard in london will say yes to anything when a call comes in from overseas because they know the ferrets in the field cant always use a telephone in privacy and may have to throw them any name or the name of any organization adamhall on the spur of the moment you can ask them if they re tootsie and theyll say yes and tune in and take it from there listening between the lines it is the newspaper my little mother said and i went across to the telephone and thanked her and stood half turned so that i could keep the mirror in sight the huge pock marked mirror with its gilded plaster frame that gave me a view of the glass doors and even patches of snow in the street below the steps this is shokin i said into the telephone it smelled of garlic have you got a story for us yes i have story but shall i tell now or give to your agent here in novosibirsk it was a hundred to one shot that the woman knew any english even though she worked in a hotel and a thousand to one shot that she knew it well enough to tell whether i was fluent or only spoke a little but you keep to your cover when you can as a routine exercise you can give it to our agent the man in signals told me i recognized matthews voice hes at the hotel karasevo ask for tk trencher ferris a snow plough went past the hotel and everything vibrated the tarnished brass shade of the lamp over the desk the glass front of the fire extinguisher cabinet the chandelier in the ceiling in the mirror i saw that the woman was watching me then i will give to agent i saidstory is about train crash the rossiya very bad people dead matthews would be watching the signals board as he spoke to me and croder would be standing somewhere close listening to the low volume amplifier including the subject matthews asked me yes the subject was zymyanin the soviet contact dead this wasnt the time for details the chief reason for this call was to find out where ferris was my director in the field i would fill them in later through him zymyanin hadnt died in the train crash hed been shot probably on the orders of the generals in a moment and how are you thank you very good except arthritis cold here in the established speech code vocabulary arthritis is a signal to control that the executive is wanted by the police of the host country we can run the gamut from arthritis to rheumatism but rheumatisms not often used because it means the executive has finished up with his back to a wall somewhere with his escape routes cut off and the opposition forces closing in on him and this is the last signal london is going to get will you be sending in more stories matthews asked i thought it over carefully before i spoke perhaps not sure its in the book at norfolk the executive is required to give as accurate a picture of his situation as he can when threatened with any opposition action whether it be from the operations of a private cell or the police intelligence or military forces of the host country sometimes an apprentice spook will ask for it to be spelled out and the instructors play it straight it just means that if youre in the shit then youve got to tell control exactly that weve had cases where the shadows got himself right up a creek but hell try and put a bold face on it and tell signals he hasnt got any problems and thats just plain bloody stupid weve lost people that way if you dont tell control youre in trouble how can you expect him to help you get out of it what matthews had asked me was whether i thought there was any future more stories for meridian since my soviet contact was dead and the militia were hunting for me and id had to give some thought to his question because if i lost track of tanya rusakova no i didnt think thered be any future for the mission i would have reached a dead end and the only thing left for me to do would be to try getting out of siberia through the militia net and report back to london it all centred on tanya she was the key but there is chance i said into the telephone there is perhaps chance of more stories all right matthews said in the meantime is there anything we can do for you no you have agent here that is good we shut down the signal and the concierge looked up at the clock that hung at an angle on the wall three minutes she said and came heavily across to the telephone her massive bunch of keys jingling where they hung from her waist against her black silk dress the call had been much less than that but i wasnt going to argue the more i let her pick out of the piggy bank the more value id have for her it occurred to me that there could even be a price we could put on her silence on her passive cooperation when the militia came banging in here with their boots scattering snow a thousand roubles i had that much in cash and ferris would have more available five thousand possibly ten but shed have to make an alteration to the register and theyd be looking for things like that and in any case this woman my apple faced little mother with the faded blue eyes could take the money and still expose me to the militia without even blinking galina ludmila makovetskaya wouldnt be the only jezebel in siberia three minutes i nodded and left her asking the operator the rate for the united kingdom i pushed the worn brass button for the lift and heard it begin whining inside the shaft novosibirsk is a modern city but it sprang up around older buildings and the hotel vladekino had fanlights above the doors of the rooms three of them were showing a light as i walked down the corridor on the third floor one of these was room when i used the big deadlock key in the door of room it turned with a lot of noise but the door hinges didnt squeak when i went inside and that was much more important the single window overlooked the street where the hotel had its entrance a truck was bouncing over the ruts its tailboard banging and a militia patrol car was behind it it didnt stop outside the vladekino but it might have this place was a trap and i went out of the room and left the door unlocked the boards squeaked in the corridor but there was nothing i could do about it the light still showed in room and it was still on when i looked up at the third floor from the bottom of the wrought iron fire escape that ran down outside the building i didnt think tanya rusakova would leave her room until morning but i had to keep her under constant surveillance in case she did the steps of the fire escape had been covered with snow from the storm that had driven across the city tonight and the small square yard down here was the same with crates and refuse making humps against the building there was a light on the ground floor at the back and i kept clear of it pulling open the door in the wall of the yard that led to the street it opened only an inch or two and then the snow blocked it and i found part of a broken crate on one of the rubbish heaps and worked in silence and with care checking the light in the window of room at intervals when id cleared enough snow away from the door to the street i latched it again this wasnt the street where the hotel had its entrance it was at right angles and there were three cars and a truck parked there offering cover ill i went back to my room and pulled down the blind on the window to keep out the light from the street id left the door of the room an inch ajar and through the gap from the bed i could see the door of room and would hear it open tonight i wouldnt be sleeping the pipes behind the wall banged and juddered when i turned on the hot water it ran cold for half a minute and then turned scalding hot the paper around the small cake of soap was printed in chinese and the soap was dark brown and smelled of tallow ten minutes later i was lying on the bed with my back to the wall and my boots off watching the door across the passage through the gap in my own and slipping into the limitless repertoire of the memory at first working over the events that had taken place since id boarded the rossiya in moscow then analysing them looking for insights then taking a break and starting a search through the memory for the stimulus i would need for keeping sleep away the pipes banged again behind the walls and i heard voices from the hotel lobby rising in the stairwell as some people came in one of them sounded indignant was my little mother telling them the hotel was closed i would think so they werent the militia these people the militia would send a different and distinctive sound through the stairwell with their boots and their sharp questions their tone of authority i would recognize them i have lain on beds like this one their springs musical under the slightest movement their sheets reeking of strong soap or camphor or disinfectant or the stale scents of the human animal asleep or at play have lain listening so many times god knows how many times for the sounds of my pursuers the baying of the hunt the people below in the lobby went away a mans voice raised enough for me to understand that first thing in the morning he would be reporting my apple faced little mother to the inspectorate of hotels and lodging places she made no answer that i could hear in the room next to mine there was a commercial traveller counting his samples which were made of glass and had glass lids i welcomed the sound it would help to keep me awake though by midnight the hotel would have fallen quiet and then would come the need for mental concentration i was not here to throw away my thousandth chance of keeping meridian alive by going to sleep on the job but then she surprised me tanya rusakova because when the door of room came open and the light was switched out i looked at my watch and saw it was still only local time i saw her briefly in the passage as i pulled my boots on and when i reached the top of the fire escape i could still hear the moaning of the lift the night was still clear with the galaxy strewn like gossamer across the tops of the buildings and the moon low in its third quarter the air was numbing to the flesh from the comer i watched tanya going down the steps of the hotel and turning along the street towards me so that i had to move back and use one of the parked cars for cover then she passed the end of the street her grey fur gloves held against her face and her boots slipping sometimes in the snow and i followed she was standing in a doorway her gloves still protecting her face and it was quite clear that she was waiting here for someone it was an intersection of two minor streets one of them kurskaja ulica by the sign below the lamp and i had taken up station obliquely across from her in a doorway much like hers but deeper in shadow the night was not quiet a snow plough was on the move along the major street that wed crossed on our way here i could see its warning lights reflected in the windows of a laundry trucks were still rumbling perhaps delayed by the snowstorm and working late she was not only waiting here for someone tanya rusakova but the rendezvous was clandestine precisely pinpointed on the map at the intersection of two minor streets but otherwise without identity or landmarks no hotel no cafe no building even with any lights still burning a clock had begun chiming the hour of eleven its strokes booming from the gilded dome of a church two streets distant and as the last note died on the air a russian army staff car turned the corner and pulled up sliding a little in the frozen ruts and tanya came into the light and walked across to it as the front passenger door came open she looked inside the car saying something could hear her light clear voice and it seemed she was about to get in but a figure had broken from the shadows and reached the car and snapped the other door open dragging the driver out and using a vicious stomach blow to soften him up then he hauled him across the ruts and threw him against the wall and pulled a gun out and took aim i think it was velichko the man reeling against the wall general velichko and he was trying to say something asking for mercy i would think his hands flung out but the man with the gun was talking to him not shouting but spitting the words out pig as the first shot went into the generals body and he tried to cover his face with his hands then something about my father and then pig again bastard as the next shot banged and blood burst from the generals face and he staggered with his arms flying out as the third shot blew half his head away and his legs buckled and he pitched across the snow fugue the airport i told the driver and he set his meter going tanya rusakova sat with her head back against the upholstery and her eyes closed her face was so pale that even her lips had no colour one of her legs was straight out in front of her the fur lined boot against the back of the drivers seat the other was bent at the knee she was sitting sideways a little id noticed it in the dining car on the train why are we going there she asked me her mouth moving as if it were numbed i only just heard her the taxi was running on chains making a lot of noise as we hit the ruts of piled snow and bounced out again trust me i said i didnt think she did i wasnt even sure she understood the danger she was in when the general had pitched down onto the snow shed turned away and started running and that was when the militia patrol had swung round the corner its headlights flooding across her it hadnt been responding to the scene couldnt have been unless theyd been tipped off given the location of the rendezvous and told that something might happen there but i doubted that even if velichkos companions had suspected anything they would only have warned him they wouldnt have exposed the assignation he would have killed them for that he has a reputation as a ladys man galina had told me galina ludmila makovetskaya that perfidious bitch tanya was saying something too quietly for me to make it out what i am not leaving novosibirsk dont worry i said were not flying anywhere with our voices at this pitch the driver couldnt hear anything in any case i thought i heard him singing to himself just below the noise of the chains not a care in the world id caught a whiff of his breath when wed got in there were no lights in the mirror not yet two more patrol cars had passed us going the other way flying their colours i didnt want to know what our chances were of getting clear tonight chief investigator gromov would have heard by now that id made it as far as the city and he would have concentrated the hunt with the vladekino hotel as its epicentre a second hunt would have been mounted with its focus on the rendezvous point where general velichko had lain slumped against the wall only three or four blocks away id told our driver the airport simply because it was a good hours run on a night like this and we needed distance as much as we could get i also needed a telephone she had run into an alley tanya and id intercepted her at the other end shed just been running blindly not away from the militia i thought but away from the man lying back there with his face on the ruddled snow away from what had suddenly happened in her life this was my impression shed struggled when id held her and tried to make her understand that she was in the most appalling danger and that i wanted to help her help get her away she hadnt listened until id told her she had to go with me for her brothers sake she had listened then once when we were slipping and lurching across the snow wed passed the end of the street where the hotel was the vladekino and seen three or four militia patrol cars outside with their lights flashing so one of the crews had gone into the hotel earlier to look at the register and seen the name shokin viktor sergei there on the page and got on his radio the taxi had been outside another hotel the first in the rank and tanya had got in without protest the traffic was light at this hour by the clock on the dashboard but there were snow ploughs still churning through the streets and produce trucks running late because of the storm tanya was saying something and i leaned closer im sorry how did you know i have a brother in novosibirsk a provodnik told me how would a provodnik know they know everything galina had telephoned moscow from the train she still hadnt opened her eyes she was trembling id heard it in her voice i pushed myself forward on the seat and spoke to the driver have you got a drop or two of vodka on board he swung his head round with a look of great surprise id get arrested look weve been freezing to death out there trying to find a taxi and my wifes starting a cold come on be a hero ten roubles a shot he reached for the glove compartment and fished out a plastic flask from among all the camouflage and passed it to me i got the cap off and wiped the neck on the end of my scarf best i could do and nudged tanya to get her eyes open no she said i dont want any this is medicinal youre in shock she took the flask in her gloved hands and tossed some of the stuff back and choked on it but i made her have another go then i gave the flask back to the driver and he put it away theres no more flights tonight he said i suppose you realize that yes we work at the airport we thought wed have a night on the town and then the car broke down in a moment tanya spoke again you said i was in danger why the lights changed and we slid to a stop halfway across the intersection and when we got the green and the chains started thrashing again i moved my head close to tanyas youre in danger because that militia patrol back there caught you in its headlights and when they found that man lying there they would have started looking for a woman walking alone in the streets walking or running or trying to hide your name is in the registration book at the vladekino hotel where you saw those other militia patrols crowding around outside and the concierge would have told them youd left there fifteen minutes before because theyd have asked her a lot of questions and that would have been one of the answers and by this time theyll have made the connection between the young woman leaving the hotel on foot and the young woman seen running from the scene of a shooting only a few blocks away you also made a statement to the investigators on the train and that too will be on record did you tell them youve got a brother in novosibirsk yes then she saw the problem and said defensively i had to they asked me if i had any relatives so what else could i say if you lie to those people they can find out and then youre in trouble i didnt say anything the driver was singing again and the sound of his voice against the demented percussion of the snow chains lent eeriness to the night why are you helping me like this tanya asked me she hadnt closed her eyes again after drinking the vodka she was sitting straighter now watching me the green shimmer dulled by the shock that was still going through her but a bit of colour had come into her cheeks and the trembling had stopped because i need information there were lights flashing ahead of us and i watched them i need information about general velichko and the other two in a moment she said is this for a story a what no you told me youre a journalist a whole circus of militia patrols along there half a mile away some kind of road block i didnt tell the driver to take a side street because hed wonder why and if anyone along there saw us running for cover theyd send out a patrol to cut us off and ask questions and the only papers i had on me were in the name of shokin viktor sergei yes i told tanya im an investigative journalist with political interests i dont know very much she said about the generals but enough to want one of them killed what was velichko talking about i asked her when you had dinner with him on the train he was telling me she said with contempt about his heroic deeds in the war with afghanistan nothing else no i heard something in her voice and when i looked at her i saw she was frightened because of the lights up there dont worry i told her theres probably been an accident there were still three stationary patrol cars ahead of us and i leaned forward and got a hundred rouble note from my wallet and held it out to the driver i should have asked you before this is the smallest ive got do you have enough change he broke off his singing and turned his head not for a hundred no well look hang on to this and well work something out later he hesitated then took the note if you say so i sat back again it had been simple routine we might need him as a friend is that a road block up there looks like it theyre always cluttering up the streets one way or another dont give us no peace were fair game see taxi drivers when they want to pick on someone i felt tanyas hand on me cant we turn off somewhere no its too late for that her eyes were still frightened and there was something id been trying not to think about this woman had exposed herself to tremendous risk when shed set up the general for assassination but she might have got away with it if my name hadnt been next to hers in the hotel registry the militia would still be on the watch for the woman theyd seen in the headlights but she might have been able to get back to the hotel and go quietly to bed the concierge wouldnt have faced a barrage of questions if viktor shokin wanted for murder hadnt followed tanya rusakova to the vladekino they were a quarter of a mile away now the flashing lights and the driver began slowing i leaned forward again and spoke into his ear whats your name my friend nikki listen nikki shes not my wife as a matter of fact this is a pickup and i could get into a lot of trouble you know what i mean he was holding his head turned to listen and gave a nodso what about just keeping mum nikki if those buggers ask you any questions i mean forget about our car breaking down and everything all you know is that we got into this cab and i just asked you to drive us around a little how does that sound he began slapping the rim of the wheel softly with his gloved hand and said in a moment nothing about going to the airport nothing about that he was still slowing his head turned a little but his eyes on the street and the flashing lights i told him again we just got in and i asked you to drive us around a little nothing else he gave it some more thought but there wasnt time for that and you keep the change nikki all right he jerked his head round another inch and then nodded fair enough there were things he still didnt understand but those were the ones id paid for youre a good friend nikki i told him and sat back again and looked at tanya gave her the briefing this is the story yours mine and the drivers i went through it twice and she said she understood then i saw the flashing baton ahead of us and we began sliding across the packed snow as the militiaman directed nikki into a side street shouting something about a detour and i saw a whole mess of telephone posts and wires blocking the street behind him with the snow piled in a massive drift after the storm and when i looked at tanya she was sitting with her head back against the upholstery and her eyes closed and tears of relief streaming on her face as we throttled up again and the flickering light from the patrol cars faded against the buildings can i look at your phone book he was still half asleep a boy in a rumpled uniform the collar unbuttoned id woken him when wed come into the hotel it was a mile from the airport as far as it was safe to go i found the number and gave the boy some money and asked him to let me use the phone on his desk tanya was sitting in the corner of the foyer watching me and i wondered what would happen if i turned my back for a moment whether shed slip out of the hotel and go her own way even though id told her that she was in danger that i wanted to help her that she had to stay with me for her brothers sake she hadnt asked me what id meant by that but she would the number wasnt ringing there was just a click then silence i dialled for an operator this number is private she asked me no its the hotel karasevo hes at the hotel karasevo matthews had told me when id phoned london this evening ask for t k trencher ferris there are times when you can get through half a mission more than that even the whole thing without needing to call on your director in the field for help this wasnt one of them there was a meter running like my good friend nikkis out there in the cab ticking away the time it couldnt be long before we opened the wrong door tanya and i turned the wrong comer and ran straight into the militia we had to get off the streetsdid you say the hotel karasevo the woman sounded as if id woken her up at the switchboard as id woken the boy here it was past midnight now yes i watched the street through the windows saw nikki sitting there in his cab with his head back and his mouth moving presumably in song if i could pick up another taxi id tell him he was free that wed decided to put up here for the night fresh horses break the scent the lines are down the operator said you cannot call the hotel karasevo she sounded pleased try again i told her shocked silence and then the lines are down didnt you hear me the snow has brought down the lines in that area how long has the hotel been cut off this is colonel mashakov novosibirsk militia headquarters there was another silence there has been no communication by telephone colonel since seven oclock this evening i regret that the novosibirsk telecommunications utility was unable to disperse the snowstorm colonel before it could damage our system but we shall try harder in future in the name of the new demokratizatsiya the boy behind the desk had buttoned the collar of his uniform and pushed his fingers through his hair was watching tanya from the corner of his eye seeing a plaything for his manly lusts to your knowledge i said to the woman on the telephone are there men working on the lines she used her silences with skill measuring them for their effect but you may be assured colonel that we have men working on the lines we do not expect at the novosibirsk telecommunications utility the lines to restore themselves unaided to their former efficiency i put the phone down and spoke to the boy in uniform tearing him from his licentious dreams can i get a taxi from here it took him a moment to work up interest in anything so mundane its late he said but i can try i put a twenty rouble note onto the desk and went over to tanya i couldnt tell what it was she had in her eyes as she looked up at me from the black vinyl settee nothing i could read as trust those tears in the taxi had been of more than relief i thought now a few might even have been for the general from the little id learned about her i didnt think shed been involved in an assassination before or even seen a man killed shed stopped trembling but mentally she could still be in shock there are militia patrols out in strength tonight i told her quietly as you know if they come in here and theres time you simply leave the foyer take that passage over there if theres no time to do that dont come near me im a total stranger i heard the boy talking on the phone behind me it sounded as if hed managed to find a taxi that goes i told tanya for whenever were in an open space like this keep your distance from me if you see any militia how are you feeling she didnt seem to know what i meant it hadnt been a stupid question she was feeling terrible of course but i wanted an answer of some kind whatever kind to find out at least something of what was going on in her mind in a moment she asked me in a dead tone do you ever have nightmares all the time that is how i am feeling the boy called from the desk i can get you a taxi you want one when can he get here five minutes yes i want him the boy was watching the cab outside nikkis as he spoke on the phone the obvious question in his mind we already had a taxi so why did we want another one it was the sort of thing hed remember but there was nothing i could do about it we were going to leave a trail tanya and i wherever we went tonight until i could raise ferris and tell him we needed shelter it was tempting of course to go there to the hotel karasevo and call him from the foyer and tell him to get us off the streets but unless your director in the field actually asks you to visit him at his base you cant go there because you can never be certain you re not being surveilled that you might not be leading the opposition or the host countrys police or intelligence agents to your directors base and that base is sacrosanct the dif can only run you from a position of total impregnability he is the anchorman the signals centre your only link with london and with the support in the field expose your dif to the opposition and youll cut your lifeline and even if you can manage to limp home from the wreckage of a crashed mission youd be advised not to do that because if youve blown your dif theyll flay you alive at the bureau before they throw you into the street hes on his way the boy called from the desk and i went outside and told nikki wed decided to stay here for the night and wouldnt need him anymore he made a token gesture of getting me what change he had but i sent him away tanya had got up from the settee when i went in again and was standing with her back to the boy at the desk i want to phone my brother she said in an undertone i took her across to the far corner of the foyer for his sake youve got to remember that for the moment youre a danger to him how long had you planned to stay in novosibirsk only for a few days i have to get back to my job the lights of a vehicle swung across the windows when had you planned to see your brother next he just said when the smoke had cleared she spoke as if she were drugged or disinterested sooner or later she was going to break there was too much going on inside her and she was keeping it under too much control the vehicle stopped outside the hotel i could hear the tyre chains grinding under locked wheels as it slid to a halt theres your taxi the boy called from the desk you were lucky to get it i gave tanya my arm as we went down the steps the ice crackling under our boots she held my arm lightly without trust still afraid of me of what i could do to her do to her brother because i was a witness to what had happened tonight you are safer with me i told her carefully than with anyone else in the city it wasnt saying much god alone knew but it was still true for what it was worth she didnt answer glanced at me as we got into the taxi that was all didnt believe me it was a diesel this one shaking and rattling across the ruts and the patches of ice the driver working hard to keep the thing more or less straight id given him the name of a hotel id seen on the way here the great iberian a red brick hulk with no lights in the windows only the sign hanging above the doors with its capital s missing almost certainly closed at this hour possibly derelict it didnt make any difference there was nowhere we could stay tonight until i could raise ferris nowhere in this whole bloody city taking these cabs was bad enough theyd be canvassing every driver all through the night giving them my name and the description theyd have got from chief investigator gromov also advising that i might be with a woman companion one tanya rusakova i didnt think our good friend nikki would hold his peace because id been generous to him it had been worth trying that was all its closed for the night our driver said i suppose you know that the big wrought iron s was hanging from a railing i suppose someone had picked it up and put it there wonder it hadnt brained them i looked at the meter and paid him i know the concierge i said hes my brother in law chips of ice flew against our legs as he gunned the engine spinning the wheels until they found traction the night reeked of diesel gas i got tanya to hold on to me for a while as we started walking partly to persuade her that i was all right to touch to trust but she let go as we turned a corner and the wind came against us and walked with her gloves against her face the sky was black the starfields strewn across it the three quarter moon casting stark shadows across the snow the air was freezing she didnt ask me where we were going she didnt speak there were snow ploughs still working their din filling the night between the buildings the drifts breaking into waves as the huge blades bit into them we passed three abandoned cars and a truck one of them skewed against a wall with its windows shattered and a wing torn away sometimes a taxi went by but there was no other traffic until a militia patrol swung out of an intersection in the distance and i pulled tanya into a doorway before its lights reached us it was there after the patrol had gone past us without slowing that she finally broke and i stood holding her as the sobbing began her body shaking with it her tears streaming jewelling the fur collar of her coat in the moonlight all the fear and the misery and the loneliness coming out of her over the minutes until at last the force of her anguish broke through the protective shell of my reserves and reached the heart phantoms our father was shot a siren had started up in the distance keep that door shut one of the women shouted from behind the admissions desk and a thin boy in a tattered white coat went hurrying past the line of people and there was a slam that echoed around the dog kennel green walls and another flake of paint floated to the floor spinning like a leaf in the glare of the big tungsten lamps a young peasant woman came through the doors holding a baby wrapped in a red shawl only its face visible it was hot in here airless wed been freezing out there in the streets only minutes ago now we were baking tanya had taken off her sheepskin coat but still couldnt sit up straight on the bare wooden bench shed walked with her arms crossed in front of her on our way here gathered into herself and id thought it was against the cold but now i realized it was to protect herself against the phantoms of the past that still came after her he was taken to an underground room she said and executed without trial her father why for his ideals i listened to the siren people were still coming in and the thin boy an orderly was standing by the big entrance door slamming it shut after them a man went reeling to the end of the queue blood caked at the side of his head the neck of a bottle sticking out of his pocket the woman with the baby kept her distance from him the babys face was pinched colourless a wax dolls face its mothers was haunted her hollowed eyes looking from the child to the women at the admissions desk as she thought about going straight past all the other people because this was urgent her baby was ill when was this i asked tanya four years ago four you neednt think she said with a look at me that everything like that stopped when gorbachev took over even now there are secret executions the worst of the stalinists and hardliners have been sacked from the kgb but theyve gone underground and there are still scores to settle she made an effort to sit up straight pulling the hem of her white polo neck sweater down leaning her head against the wall its always like that when a new regime takes over the siren was loud now and lights coloured the windows youre talking about the podpolia she looked at me again yes id seen intelligence reports going through the fax machines in london for a year now since the days of the coup the podpolia the new underground was thought to have thousands of members possibly tens of thousands a lot of them still in office going through the motions of embracing democracy and being reinstated who the hell knows how many there are id heard croder saying as he watched the signals coming in how can you count the heads in the cellars on foreign soil was general velichko in the podpolia i asked tanya yes but that isnt why your why he was killed tonight no it was because hed ordered our father shot they were his orders she straightened her right leg spread her hands across her thighs looking down at them and a shudder went through her i thought it was going to to liberate me seeing him die helping to make it happen i thought the act of revenge would give me relief i wanted to see it happen my brother told me that all he wanted me to do was identify that man make sure there wouldnt be any mistake and then run away but i wanted to stay there and when the shots began i felt i felt just a flash of the most bitter satisfaction but then when i went on watching she broke off and squeezed her eyes shut and her body began shaking again it was your father you saw her head came lower and she clawed suddenly at her thighs yes yes it was my father i saw a door banged open somewhere and the thin young orderly went scurrying past the line of people and into the corridor the engine of the ambulance throbbed for a minute and then stopped and i saw two men go past the doorway with a stretcher a third holding a drip feed above it i didnt know whether the hospital was normally as busy as this at two oclock in the morning or whether the storm had brought accidents into the streets it was too far north to take in people from the wreck of the rossiya id seen the lighted windsock of the helipad on the roof of this building when wed passed the hotel siberian and noted it a hospital was about the only place that could give us shelter what is your brothers name i asked tanya she didnt hear was watching the man against the wall with the bullets going into him her father understanding for the first time that he was not only dead but had died and like that the woman with the baby had made up her mind and gone to the admissions desk and a couple of youths in black leather coats were chivvying her one with an arm in a sling then some women began going for the youths in support of the mother and i caught a glimpse of the waxen face of the child in the midst of the scuffle its closed eyelids calm as if it hadnt the strength to squeeze them tight against the light and the voices then my mother died i heard tanya saying i didnt think it mattered to her if i were listening or not she needed to say these things hear them again for herself she drank cleaning fluid a year ago a year ago this month on the fourteenth they couldnt save her she didnt want them to it had been a long marriage i said she turned her head i think surprised to hear that i was listening theyd been together thirty nine years when my father was killed and she missed him too much we all missed him too much tanya said or my brother couldnt have done what he did tonight and nor could i he what is your brothers name i asked her again she hesitated vadim you can trust me with everything i said for your own sake and for his you have to understand that she stared at me for a moment and then looked down i want you to know that he is not the kind of man who who kills other men without thinking about it when as a soldier he hasnt seen action she didnt look at me but her mouth tightened was there nothing i didnt know he was in afghanistan yes but he has never taken a life in peacetime it was a very emotional thing for us very impulsive she swung her head to look at me he heard that that man was coming here to novosibirsk where vadim is stationed and he wrote to me asking if i wanted to help him and i said yes of course i said yes it was only afterwards tonight when i realized what we had done i you destroyed a brute i said and not only for yourselves your father wasnt the only one to suffer for his ideals he couldnt have been you know that you did a great job and so did vadim youre to be honoured she watched me for a moment and for the first time i thought there was no dislike no distrust in the lambent green eyes i cant think of it like that she said i know but youve got to try i got up and went across to the payphone telling her not to move thered been a man there for the past ten minutes trying to get through to someone wanting to tell them where he was there are lines down he told me as he came away from the phone lines down everywhere but i put two kopeks into the slot and dialled for the hotel karasevo for the third time since wed got here and stood waiting looking across at the young woman in the fur hat and the white polo sweater one leg straight and the other bent a little her head down as she went over it all again giving herself no peace and i knew id have to let her see her brother vadim as soon as it was possible as soon as it was safe because only he could do anything for her help her battle the phantoms i checked the environment again main doors an archway behind the admissions desk forget that one the archway into the passage where id seen the stretcher case go by the opening of the corridor six feet from the bench where tanya was sitting now they were the only exits the huge windows were high in the wall with their catches rusted solid there was nothing but a faint crackling on the line and i pushed the coin return and went back to the bench we had with luck until daylight before i would need to do something dramatic to get us both off the streets without ferriss help if i still couldnt raise him the three matrons at the admissions desk had got their hands full and no one was likely to come across here and ask any questions there were some other people along the walls two or three of them lying on the benches trying to sleep until they could get some kind of attention one of them a drunk spreadeagled on the worn linoleum with a bottle of blackish wine locked in the crook of his arm we were safe here but i didnt want to wait for daylight to do anything dramatic not with tanya rusakova in my care drama is the last resort when you re in the labyrinths the desperate sauve qui peut that nine times out often will leave you dead on the field and above all ive told the bright eyed and eager novitiates at norfolk above all avoid drama its a one way street and as often as not a dead end derring do wont get you anywhere youve got to think your way out easily said yes but what else can you tell them when theyre out there at last with the hags of hell at their heels theyll do whatever they have to we all know that are you hungry i asked tanya no her stomach was empty the last time shed eaten must have been on the rossiya but she couldnt even think about food and that was understandable you could sleep i said if you wanted to shed have our coats for a mattress on the bench ill be here no that too was understandable the phantoms of the delta waves would be worse than the ones who were haunting her now and shed have no control over them you told me i had to go with you she said in a moment for my brothers sake i dont know what that means it means that if you get arrested by the militia youll give him away her eyes flayed me i would never do that have you ever been questioned by the militia she hesitatedno but she knew what i was talking about by the kgb then yes what did they do to you she took a breath looking down they beat me up because of your father yes i protested in public after theyd shot him then you know what i mean tanya the militia are no different even now theyll get everything out of you once they start and that is why you have to stay with me she didnt answer still didnt believe she would give her brother away even though she was sitting here with one leg straight and the other crooked and had scars on her body must have after what theyd done to her the big entrance door came open at intervals and i watched the people coming in some of them injured and with blood visible on them most of them sickly shielding their eyes against the glare of the lights in here two doctors one of them a woman had come through the archway from the emergency unit where the ambulance had driven up and were checking the people in the long straggling queue at three oclock i tried the phone again and drew blank and soon after that i saw the woman doctor examining the white faced infant at last and heard her say to the nurses behind the admissions desk but how long has she been here this baby is dead the mother screamed once twice and then began moaning as they hurried her through the archway and a murmur of shock broke out among the people in the queue i began trying the phone at thirty minute intervals but at half past four there was still nothing on the line to the hotel karasevo but a faint crackling and i thought jesus id better start trying to raise london see if the long distance lines were down too soon after five in the morning i pushed the two kopeks into the slot again and drew blank and went through the archway to look for a lavatory and when i came back the entrance doors were both wide open and the place was full of militiamen and tanya was gone sleep were waiting for dr kalugin i said id passed a door with his name on it hell be another hour the nurse said at least another hour with all these accidents coming in her hair had come loose from her white cap and her eyes were red rimmed from fatigue nevermind i said well wait olga a voice called and she left us saying we could go into the examination room if we liked there was no one in there i left the door open needing to hear distant voices catch what they were saying learn who they were and if they were coming closer get out of here if there were time what were they doing in there i asked tanya the militia she leaned her haunches against the examination table folding her arms hugging herself locked in with other thoughts im not sure she said i didnt stay long enough to hear but i think thered been a bus accident and theyd followed the injured in there to take statements dont worry then id unnerved her telling her theyd force her to expose her brother if she were arrested but id had to do it because it was true and if the worst happened shed never forgive herself it had also given her a healthy fear of a militia uniform shed followed the instructions id given her earlier out there in the waiting room if even one of them comes in here go down that corridor and wait for me at the other end get out of his sight thered been five or six of them when id come back into the waiting room peaked caps greatcoats and black polished boots belts night sticks holsters and guns five or six of them in the waiting room and hundreds more outside in the streets right across the city a minefield on the move i switched off the tubular lights to lower the stress on our nerves by a degree it wouldnt hurt i told tanya to lie down for a while no anything can happen she was watching my face listening to the voices of the militiamen at the far end of the corridor to the unmistakable tone of their authority then she surprised me wasnt it terrible about the baby what yes terrible i went to look for a telephone and found one near the emergency rooms and got out my two kopeks again and dialled and stood waiting the sharpness of ether on the air and the ring of a scalpel in a metal dish the moaning of someone in pain and then the click on the line and a womans voice and i asked to speak to t k trencher in a moment yes executive what can i do for you get me off the streets his name was roach and he was a small man with a round pink face and baby blue eyes that never looked at you or at anything for more than a second or two his attention constantly on the move and his hands never still their short pink fingers playing with each other the nails ragged and bitten a mass of nerves i would have thought and not therefore reliable but ferris had told me he was firstclass hed worked with him before in moscow more blankets in the cupboard there he said if you need them the usual toilet things but not much soap i didnt know you were coming his eyes taking tanya in again but fleetingly just a quick snapshot nothing personal lots of tinned stuff in the kitchen though youll be all right for grub theres no heating or light because of the storm no hot water but if you feel like braving the shower turn it on slow or itll blow you out of the bathroom anything else i dont think so ill be on my way i went into the passage with him and saw the door to the fire escape near the stair head and tried the handle to make sure it wasnt locked then i went down the stairs with him and asked him where the nearest telephone was its in the building the end of that corridor you got enough coins let me have what you can im being picked up roach said so you can use my car dark green skoda out there he gave me the number and dropped the keys into my hand you want to debrief yes he said you probably would make a rendezvous a woman in a bright red headscarf came out of one of the apartments and went through the main entrance shouldering the spring door open yes i told roach for i needed sleep thats in what he checked his watch six hours time okay how far dyou want it from here give it a couple of miles he stood bouncing gently on his toes tapping the tips of his middle fingers together as he stared through a window okay make it at perovski street and volnaja south west comer theres a pull in for deliveries you got a map yes hell be in a black peugeot front offside wing bent in a bit hell lead the way all right we synchronized watches and i went back upstairs and heard tanya in the bathroom the water running and got out the map and checked the rendezvous point and folded the map again and put it away as tanya came into the room shed taken off her coat and boots and looked slender in her sweater and black leather skirt would have seemed younger if it hadnt been for the fatigue in her face the ravages of the long nights ordeal sleep i said she didnt move stood watching me there was a narrow vinyl covered settee with a soiled cushion on it against the wall and i got the spare blankets from the cupboard and caught a whiff of camphor and thought briefly of jane in moscow and dropped them onto the settee going over to the window and pulling the heavy velour curtains across to shut out the leaden sky turn off the light when you want to i told tanya i shant need it i went into the bathroom and picked over the toilet things the toothbrush had a wooden handle and real bristles and the plastic cups were in a bag from the hotel mokba and the soap was a dirty yellow the same colour as the stuff id seen the women washing the floor with on the rossiya the water was numbing and the copper shower head rimed white with calcium gave a kick when i turned on the tap as roach had warned the blood from my leg pooled rust red diluted on the chipped ceramic tiles the light was off when i came back into the room and in the gloom i saw that tanya was lying on the bed with her legs drawn up in the foetal position hadnt felt able to get between the sheets with a stranger here so i took the spare blankets off the settee and laid them over her her head moved youll be cold she said ill be all right no you must share the blankets with me so i lay down with her back curved against me and eased my arms around her and felt her shivering then after a while the warmth came into us and the shivering stopped but later i felt her hands giving sudden little jerks as sleep came to her at last and she was dragged out of my reach and beyond my help into the first of the nightmares that would be lying in wait for her in the years to come debriefing christ what is it i meant the smell a dead dog ferris said probably another rat dropped from the shelf onto the piled garbage they were coming in through a hole in the wall a gap in the boards the garbage had been dumped in here from trucks i would imagine half filled the place it was a warehouse though not quite that too small a bloody shed then things dont look terribly good i said it was gone noon id left tanya sleeping theyre not ferris said id meant that things couldnt be terribly good if this was the best he could do for a rendezvous and hed known that he was squatting on a broken crate thinning straw coloured hair and a pale face and amber eyes behind a pair of almost square tensed academic looking glasses thin bony trussed in a surplus red army coat with the insignia torn off you saw a lot of them now he would like to be thought of ferris as some kind of university professor and thats more or less what he looks like and youd never believe hes got a reputation for strangling mice in the evening when theres nothing worth seeing at the globe he was sitting there with his hands dug into the pockets of the coat watching one of the rats he wished hed got a brick in his hand so that he could let fly with it and splash one of those little buggers all over the wall and i knew this because i knew ferris i found another crate and perched on it it was meant for the markets he said all this stuff but it was already rotten when it finally arrived from the farms so sayeth the sleeper whos in charge of this place his adopted name is vladimir tchaikovsky bom in birmingham a real tease but totally reliable when a dog gets in here to stuff itself on the garbage the rats form a pack and stuff themselves on the dog food chain thing how much sleep he asked me with a swing of his head have you been getting ive just had five or six hours ready for duty then where is the woman at the safe house why arent things terribly good ferris has what looks like the hint of a cynical smile on his pale face the eyelids a fraction squeezed and the mouth a fraction compressed ive never known whether its just the set of his expression or whether theres a continual peal of hellish laughter going on inside his head as he surveys the human condition because novosibirsk he said has become a distinctly hot zone in the past few weeks di is here in force working with local agents in place and so is the cia all the government offices are under covert surveillance by plain clothes peeps and as soon as i got here i shut down the only two safe houses we had because they were no longer safe yours was established only two days ago but as far as we know you can rely on it at least for a while as far as we know one of the rats screamed as they fought among themselves the only light in here came from a square of cracked glass set high in the wall when id got here the noon sky had been a dirty grey sheet the wintry sun staining it with sulphur as the smoke drifted upwards from the docks and factories should i move the woman i asked ferris he looked at me with that stillness of his that can be unnerving ive got surveillance on the place of course what the hells the good of surveillance if the militia roll up in a bloody jeep and go in there he waited until the slight echoes died giving me time to listen to them and realize that id just thrown him a lot of information how valuable to you he asked gently is tanya rusakova i said it slowly for him she is the key to meridian his narrow head tilted you mean that of course i didnt answer he knew i meant it he was just absorbing the information then we must try he said in a moment to find her somewhere a bit safer but i need to know things first debrief all right i said and got off the crate moving around to keep the circulation going it was freezing in this bloody place in the whole of novosibirsk the whole of siberia i took it from bucharest and he didnt interrupt because he would already have been called in on the debriefing of turner the director in the field forlongshot then i began filling him in on zymyanin he was tracking two former red army generals i gave him their names they were with a former kgb general on the train id say they had him shot just as they had hornby put away in bucharest they zymyanin didnt set the bomb he couldnt have he was out for information the bomb was meant for the generals yes why didnt it kill them i told him i told him why the generals aides had set me up for the killing of zymyanin because id been seen talking to him that was enough ferris asked me the whole cells very professional and their securitys first class theyre in the podpolia the underground zymyanin said so ferris hadnt moved was still perched on the edge of the broken crate i dont think he needs to keep his circulation going in the cold i think hes cold blooded he said who placed the bomb i dont know but i think theres a rogue agent in the field he looked up sharply oh the bomb could have been set and timed when the train was in moscow or anywhere along the line where it stopped but ive been sensing an agent on the loose ferris didnt ask me what i meant he knew what i meant theres a very great deal of tension in the air when a missions running and youre close to the opposition and your senses pick up things theyd normally miss the shadows and the whispers and the faintest of scents in the labyrinth the echoes and the wraiths of things gone by warning of things to come you sensed him on the train ferris asked me no after the crash i saw a man taking a lot of trouble to get past the checkpoint theyd set up and into one of the transports just as i was doing this bloody smell was getting on my nerves if theyd killed that dog it must have been days ago we support things like bad smells or too much noise with less tolerance dont we when the nerves are touchy and mine were like that now because in any given mission the presence of a rogue agent in the field can burden our operations with the need to find out who he is and what hes doing whether hes dangerous it can sometimes crash the whole thing for us if he thinks we re getting in his way and manages to put a bullet into the shadow executives back theyre difficult to see those people difficult to catch because they havent got a cell running them hence the name we give them rogue and they flit from one sector to another like a bloody bat in the dark so he must have been ferris said on the train you just didnt sense him there he got off the crate and walked about minced almost taking tiny steps head down and hands behind his back your archetypical professor on the lecture platform it had got him worried this rogue agent thing i said yes he must have been one of the passengers i think i saw him later in the town he to recognize ferris swung his head up no you dont see much of anyones face in this weather i think i recognized his walk the way he moved id seen him on the way to the hotel when id been tracking tanya but not after that even though id started watching out for him in a moment ferris looked at me and said paranoia it was a legitimate question paranoia becomes part of your psychological makeup as you go through the missions you see shadows hear footsteps possibly i said but the man avoiding the checkpoint out there was real could have been anyone yes i think ive got a gap ferris said in the debriefing why did you follow the rusakova woman to that hotel i lost track of the generals when they were choppered out and i thought there was the slightest chance that shed agreed to meet velichko in novosibirsk shed an assignation yes shed been having dinner with him and it looked rather cosy not a bad shot ferris said it didnt pay off the minute i caught up with him he was dead then why is tanya rusakova still the key because she could put me in contact with her brother he could know something about the other two generals hes in the army and might have his ear to the ground or might be persuaded yes you think the generals are here to meet some top brass in the russian army impossible ferris didnt answer took a turn and minced for a while with his back to me didnt want to point out how very thin our chances were of picking up the track again i went over to the big timber door and found a gap in the boards and stood there with my nose to it breathing in the sooty smell of the city instead of the sickening stink in this place freezing my sinuses until my eyes watered couldnt win a rat screamed and my scalp drew tight how long have we got i turned away from the door and looked at ferris have we got any kind of a deadline he stood still feet together thinking it out there was a whole mass of undigested information in his head culled from the stuff that had been flooding signals and codes and cyphers in london since longshot had crashed in bucharest and every bureau sleeper and agent in place had been called on to send in whatever they thought was useful ferris wouldnt be giving it to me en masse it would clog my perspective in the field and the field is local and the executive must concentrate totally on local events what ferris would give me if he decided to give me anything at all would be a minuscule condensation of the heap of raw intelligence that was burying the analysts in london as the uncut rolls of print came out of the fax machines by the mile yes he said at last we have a deadline its zero i listened to the echo of his voice a zero deadline means just what it says whatever we have to do will have to be done within every next minute no leeway no rest and no respite the generals were zymyanins target ferris said for information thats what he told you before he was killed they arrived here yesterday we dont know that they might not have already finished what they came here to do they could be leaving novosibirsk tomorrow morning or tonight or tonight or they might be on their way out of the city now i waited until i could get some kind of conviction in my voice all right well take it from there ill try to get tanya to put me in touch with her brother ferris watched me didnt answer wed worked together half a dozen times and this is the man i always ask for as my director in the field but dont always get he is the man those bastards at the bureau offer me when theyre trying to con me into a mission that nobody else will take on i like working with ferris because he knows how to get inside my head and i know how to get inside his which is ironical because we both cherish privacy but we can cut comers he and i dispense with the bullshit and the rigmarole and come down to the bone without touching the flesh and i knew exactly what he was thinking as he stood there watching me in that reeking hell hole he was trying to decide whether to let me go on running with meridian because the chances of making any progress with it were critically slight and the chances of my getting picked up by the militia before he could fly me out of the city were infinitely strong even the safe house hed put me in was a hazard you dont normally put surveillance on a place like that theres no need there was something else on his mind and i knew what that was too if i had to work with a zero deadline i was going to feel the pressure and take risks when he spoke i think it was to break my train of thought how do you feel he asked carefully about tanya rusakova roach told me shes rather a stunner guilt i said i feel guilt chiefly because you exposed her in the debriefing id told him wed both checked in at the hotel vladekino so he knew our names had been together in the register because i bloody well exposed her yes my anger against myself was information for him and i meant it to be he needed to know my frame of mind because his job was to handle me in the field nurture and protect me as best he could and pull me out alive if that were possible and he would be quite aware that my anger would diminish my instinct for survival by a degree and the risks i decided to take would be greater the obvious had to be put into words to give it weight to offer me atonement bring the anger down lessen the risks but of course ferris said you wouldnt have checked in at that hotel if youd known rusakova was spotting the target for an assassin all right i said i would have kept clear yes but that isnt in point of fact what happened is it he paced for a little time and i waited hoping for more sops for my conscience but he did better than thatsee if shell put you into contact with her brother he said gently and then ill do what i can to fly her out of the city and ask control to keep her safe in london or the country then you can clear your mind he was being too bloody accommodating listen i said and went up to him looked into those quiet honey coloured eyes that can conceal his thoughts so well that it seems hes not even thinking at all that youre looking straight through and into an empty skull are you going to let me go on running nothing changed nothing in his eyes even though id just asked him in effect whether meridian had quietly crashed here in this freezing rat infested hole because of the debriefing because of his assessment of it he said at last thats a good question and i took it in the stomach he turned away and watched a rat fretting with something at the bottom of the garbage its big tail threshing as it worked and then i saw what it was working on the entrails of the dog i looked away looked at ferris for christs sake leave those fucking rats alone i told him and he turned to look at me with the faint cynical smile touching his mouth give a lot he said for a brick i know he turned his back on the garbage and took two seconds to put the whole thing into shape and said the thing is i cant get you enough support we i dont want support you know oh yes ferris said you do if i let you go on running youre not going to bitch me about like you do other people remember me all right id agree to support in the field since this man was running me he knew how to handle things how to keep them out of my way until i needed them and how to get them to me in five seconds flat if things got sticky i didnt say anything didnt tell him that he knew it we cant move too many people into this town because with all the frontier feuds going on across the whole of eastern europe theres been a drain on manpower executives directors and support groups you were lucky to get me for this one you were a bargaining chip you know that he left it the thing is your chances arent terribly good are they are you talking about timing partly he meant the zero deadline thing what else youre being hunted actively by the police and the militia and theres a murder charge on your head that alone means that you cant even show yourself on the street without very high risk youve also come close enough to the opposition the generals to be recognized by their aides who in fact engineered that murder charge against you and if you go closer to them again which youll have to if youre to pursue the mission youll be up against a group of military professionals and if christ ive been inside lubyanka and got out again remember me ferris tilted his head youre very competent i know i also know from experience that you possess a pathological fascination for the brink thats my problem he turned it instantly i agree he gave it the weight of silence then apart from the russian police and militia and the generals aides you have a rogue agent in the field if youre right about that and i suspect you are and a rogue agent difficult to track and difficult to trap can be more dangerous to you than all those other adversaries put together a beat you know this i didnt say anything it was perfectly true he wasnt telling me anything i didnt know he was just telling me things i didnt want to know ferris waited then gave the slightest shrugto make contact with captain rusakov he said without even being able to show yourself on the street is i think close to impossible without the extreme risk of getting caught or trapped or shot out of hand if you look i cant work like that if i stopped to think of the bloody risks id never leave london ferris took a turn and came back hed lost the stillness id seen in him earlier and it worried me for this man to get up and walk about was like anyone else climbing the walls with their teeth he sat down on the crate again and i felt a frisson hed been reading me finally he said your target for information captain rusakov is at risk himself and hed also be the subject of a manhunt if his sister got herself arrested and they put her into an interrogation cell he couldnt go near you and you couldnt go near him and i would have to get you both off the streets a wind had got up a light wind and it was fretting at a bit of loose corrugated iron on the roof it would also bring a chill factor across the city and the air was going to skin us alive out there when we left this place extreme cold can work on your system in so many ways numbing your hands and your thoughts and whats left of your ambitions but it wasnt the cold really that worried me it was simply that the director in the field for meridian was telling his executive to drop the mission and go home that was the real chill factor i looked at ferris and asked him what are you going to tell london he took his time what do you think i should tell them say that if you dont keep me running ill go underground i think he drew a deeper breath his body straightened a degree as the lungs filled then he said youd do that to me ive no choice but it had taken some saying if i broke contact with him and got off the streets and went underground found a foxhole somewhere and operated from there theyd give him hell in london the dif is totally responsible for the man hes running in the field and if that man breaks off and goes solo it means his director hasnt done his job hasnt protected him hasnt kept him on track hasnt even managed to bring him home if you go underground ferris said you wont have a chance then keep me running screaming broke out and slashed at the nerves id have to tell london how things stand ferris said and you know croder hell instruct me to pull you in it wouldnt work youd never find me i said hell instruct me to convince you that you must break off the mission you can still be useful to the bureau theyre not ready to throw you out that wouldnt work either why should they be youre not easy to control you know that they like discipline in the field this time you could blow your credit thats a bloody shame he got off the crate and stood there with the light slanting across his glasses and i couldnt see his eyes it didnt matter they wouldnt have told me anything i want you to report to me he said as often as you can if i decide to put support into the field i want you to accept it and i want you to bear in mind that the minute you let yourself fall for the death or glory thing i m going to cut you loose and throw you to the dogs ill toe the line no he said you wont the wind cut between the buildings and blew flotsam across the snow bits of paper and a milk carton and a plastic bag i left roachs skoda on some waste ground half a block away from the building where the safe house was and approached it slowly making a circle the early afternoon sky pressed down on the city leaving the pale orb of the sun sinking towards the west as if through dark water ferris had come with me to the door of the shed and it had taken both of us to wrench it open on the frozen runners as soon as youve made contact with rusakov ill get his sister out of novosibirsk it was the last thing hed said to me the wind brought the river smell from the east foul water and coal smoke tar and diesel gas the ob wasnt far from this part of the city three or four miles earlier id heard an ice breaker working its engine roaring as the bows thrust and drew back and thrust again i moved in closer completing the circle traffic was thin most of it trucks no one was walking in the streets all id seen on my way back were a drunken militiaman throwing up in a doorway and a pack of stray dogs lurching from one garbage bin to the next ravenous and out of luck it was winter and times were lean the peep was standing in a doorway hed seen me from a distance and hadnt moved out of shadow but now he lit a cigarette and in a moment flicked it away the glowing tip tracing an arc through the lowering light before it hit the snow and went out i kept walking and crossed the street stopping when i reached the doorway ive got surveillance on the place of course ferris had told me the man took a few steps to meet me everything all right i asked him nohe said the womans been arrested whores what that man roach hadnt known when hed told me there was a telephone booth in the building was that the cord had been cut by hooligans and i had to drive two miles before i found a booth that didnt have the glass smashed or the cord cut i didnt expect to find a directory took the phone off the hook and dialled for information the wind fluting through the gap in the door yes military barracks which department administration wait i waited arrested mother of god i could look along the street from here both ways id left the skoda round the comer where i could see its reflection in the window of the no dock workers union of novosibirsk meeting rooms someone had carved some crude letters on the tarnished aluminium panel behind the telephone where is the food jabbing at the panel slashing at it with the force of desperation here is the number the woman said on the line she rang off before i could repeat it or thank her i hadnt any one or two kopek coins so i used a ten and dialled not at the safe house she hadnt been arrested at the safe house tanya shed left there soon after i had the peep told me when id gone to meet ferris at noon the peep had followed her he was surveillance not support he would have told us where shed gone that was his function and hed had no instructions to stop her but she hadnt gone anywhere hadnt arrived she was crossing the street hed told me down by the bus station and the militia stopped her and checked her papers a patrol on foot yes then he used his walkie and called a car and they put her inside and that was it got to a phone by but the dif didnt answer because hed been with me in that stinking shed ten rings twenty they were taking their bloody time this was so very risky military barracks i want to speak i said to captain vadim rusakov wait so very risky because i couldnt get an introduction to rusakov now from his sister id be talking to him cold and when i told him what had happened he could duck out and run for cover in case she broke and talked and exposed him i wouldnt expect much chivalry from a man whod talked a woman into spotting the target for him bringing her right onto the scene of the shooting anything could have happened and he must have known that the wind gusted through the gap in the door flapping at an official notice that said vandals would be arrested for damaging the property of the intercity and international telephone service of novosibirsk that did not say that accomplices in the assassination of former red army generals would also be arrested and would face imprisonment for life were they going to answer this bloody telephone or werent they steady there yea verily but time was of the essence once they put tanya rusakova under the five hundred watt lamp in militia headquarters it wouldnt be long before she told them what they wanted to know before she blew her brother and the safe house and meridian i had to make contact with rusakov before that happened ordnance unit three i asked again for captain vadim rusakov wait it was going to be like this until at some hour in the future i would secure meridian and keep it running and find the means of bringing it home or leave its ashes here in this dark and frozen city and make my way out with luck with luck and nothing more nothing to show them in london captain vadim rusakov is not present i cut in fast before she could ring off when will he be there this is a matter of urgency i cannot say do you know where he is is there another number i can try he is not here the line went dead i dug another ten kopek piece out of my pocket dropping a glove and bending to pick it up caught my temple on the corner of the metal shelf and felt the freezing draught against my face from the gap in the door straightened up and pushed the coin into the slot and dialled it was the last one i could use in a telephone id have to get change as soon as i could hotel karasevo i asked for gospodin t k trencher yes ferris you heard the news i asked him a brief silence then tell me he would have gone straight back to the hotel after leaving me because he was the signals centre for the field but it could have taken him longer than id taken to reach the safe house and the peep hadnt yet made his second call i told ferris what had happened silence again then he asked questions but all i could tell him was what the peep had told me a militia patrol car had turned out of the intersection half a mile away and i watched it what are your plans ferris asked me at last im trying to contact her brother he could be at risk yes before long im going to use him if i can hes in the military he might know where the other two generals are it sounded thin a last desperate chance it was the safe house could also become hot ferris said he wasnt impressed with what id said about using rusakov yes the militia patrol car was heading in this direction going slowly but then all the traffic was going slowly because of the snow and the ice ill find you a new safe house ferris said youll need somewhere to stay while i make plans to fly you out under a new cover he was speaking in a monotone tanya rusakova had been the key to the mission and he didnt expect me to rope in her brother as an ally without her introduction his hands were still red and hed startle easily there was a man walking alone past the dock workers meeting rooms head down and hurrying and when the car was alongside it dipped on its springs and slid to a stop and a militiaman got out im not ready i told ferris to fly out yet itll take time he said your new papers will have to come in through the consulate we havent anyone here who can do that kind of thing for us the militiaman was asking the civilian to show his identity novosibirsk was a big city but the militia had thrown a net right across it in the past twelve hours because zymyanin had been shot dead on the train and then the train had been blown up and the man whod been charged with zymyanins death had escaped custody and general velichko had been gunned down and a red alert had gone out to all forces militia police investigative and the army it was understandable theyre stopping everyone i told ferris on the and broke off because of the click on the line dont worry ferris said ive got sniffers out line detector bug detector theyre stopping everyone on the street i said checking identities i know where are you in a phone booth in a moment ferris said ive already ordered your new papers i told control it was fully urgent the civilian was walking on again tucking his wallet away and the patrol car had started off was rolling nearer the phone booth the glass hadnt misted since id come in here because of the freezing draught i had my back turned to the street all i could do tell london i said that im working on rusakov in a moment ferris said if you had the freedom of the streets id let you keep things running but you havent youd have to trap that man before hed even listen to you i could hear the tyres of the patrol car the ice crackling as it broke the frozen ruts the smell of the exhaust came into the booth through the gap in the door the nape of my neck was flushed i stood as if expecting a bullet there but of course there was no danger of that theyd simply heave the door open and ask for my papers and all id have time to do would be to whisper mayday into the phone and hang up ferris would know what had happened id just told him they were stopping everyone on the street ice crackling outside if i can manage to contact rusakov i said into the phone ill tell him his sisters been arrested and that im going to get her out if hes got any feelings for her that should make him listen to me ice crackling and the tyres slipping on the walls of the ruts a shadow was moving across the scarred aluminium panel behind the telephone not actually a shadow the soft reflection of the patrol car as it came past the booth i stood breathing in the exhaust gas give that to me again i heard ferris on the line what you said something about getting rusakovs sister out yes the shadow moved across the aluminium panel the reflection theyll have taken her ferris said to militia headquarters yes exhaust gas stronger now and sickening youre going to get her out of militia headquarters yes then the shadow moved on and the panel was clear again and the crackling of the ice grew faint the line was quiet he would tell me ferris that he was pulling me out of the mission he would instruct me to signal him again at thirty minute intervals until hed got anew safe house forme then hed tell me to go there and stay there until he had my new papers and a plane lined up he would make quite sure that i didnt go through with what he would call the death or glory thing and finish up chained to the wall in militia headquarters a blown executive of the bureau in london today a prisoner facing trial in the months ahead and after five years ten years fifteen a remnant of humanity breaking stones and hauling timber in the far reaches of siberia a creature of the permafrost living out its token life until that too was gone we have to meet ferris said there isnt time the patrol car was fifty yards away now and still rolling and i pushed the door of the booth open a bit to let the sickening smell of the exhaust gas out and then with a soft shock of surprise i heard ferris saying all right youll have my full support the taxi slid to a stop with a front wheel buried in a drift how far are you going the driver asked me through the open window the nearest red light district he hawked and spat you want class no just a country girl get in he had pointed ears like a gnomes and shiny patches of ointment on his face red raw fingers poking from mittens with the black wool unravelling a watery blue eye watched me in the driving mirror they could all be shut for all i knew the brothels in the early afternoon of a day like this the libidos would be frozen right across the town theres a girl i know the driver said peasant girl shes half you know circling a finger against his temple but with a body like he tried a whistle but couldnt make it his lips were too dry im looking for variety i said whats your name mikhail you could get her for mikhail i said and passed him fifty i want you to stay with me all right keep the meter going the front of the trabant bounced and we slid off course skinning a sand bindead dog mikhail said they got nothing to eat keep the meter going i said thats right give me some change will you i want to make some phone calls on our way you want twos ones twos fives whatever youve got he raked in his pocket and the glint of metal came into his hand like scooped minnows ahead of us through the windscreen the sky leaned across the street like a fallen roof heavy with winter it suited me i wanted the darkness to come down on the day we are more used we the brave and busy ferrets in the field to the stygian shades of night than the light of watchful noon i phoned the army barracks again at a booth on a corner asked for rusakov he is not present there were canned goods meant to be coming in on a freighter mikhail said when i got back into the car did you know told him i didnt salmon mikhail said and hit the brakes as the truck in front of us slewed suddenly and wiped out a snow covered volkswagen leaving it piled against a lamp post with a door burst open and the pink plastic rattle from a babys carrier rolling on the ice theyre always doing that mikhail said bitterly truck drivers are the sons of whores he gunned up and span the wheels and found traction on some sand and shimmied his way round the truck which had gone ploughing into a snow drift the office of foodstuffs and domestic supplies announced there was a shipment of salmon coming in on a freighter from kamen na obi but theres been no sign of it they were lying theyre always lying they too are the sons of whores i phoned the army barracks again from a sub post office where there was a woman squatting on the steps with her onion pale skin half buried under shawls handing out bones as clean as a skeletons to a pack of dogs he is not present in another mile we stopped outside a square sandstone block of flats with some of the windows already showing warm pink lights behind drawn curtains she is the best this one mikhail told me and got a small round tin out of the glove pocket touching his raddled face with ointment she tells the girls to let the clients take their time get their trousers back on properly before they go down the stairs her name is yelena he put the little tin away i would have to make contact with rusakov soon if i couldnt warn him that tanya was at militia headquarters they could drop on him at any time if shed exposed him and throw him in there too i couldnt get both of them out you cant get her out even you re mad shut up i got out of the taxi and went up the hollowed steps of the building you re out of your mind you know that bloody well shuddup the place smelled of wood smoke and vodka and cheap scent and human sweat the heat washed against my face suffocating after the numbing chill of the streets i stayed ten minutes talking to yelena a woman with an auburn wig and blackheads and a cough she couldnt control but i couldnt budge her took it up to three hundred four hundred five no dice shed be scared she said and called two of the girls as i was leaving told them to show me their breasts he looked surprised mikhail when he saw me coming down the steps so soon none i fancied i told him and the rheumy blue eye in the mirror had puzzlement in it as he drove off again hed always thought a whore was a whore was a whore i phoned the barracks again from a dockside bar and asked for captain rusakov he is not present she was getting used to me that woman in uniform at the switchboard for ordnance unit three getting tired of me couldnt i take no for an answer or what and as i got back into the trabant i felt the onset of premonition and confronted for the first time the fact that it was already too late tanya rusakova had been broken under the light and had told them what her brother had done last night and theyd sent a van with metal grilles at the windows to pick him up finis finito you want another place mikhail asked me what yes another place i would go through the motions in the mistaken belief that it wasnt already too late i would follow this path through the labyrinth as if it could lead me somewhere until the knowledge came to me from the other world source beyond the senses that i was wasting my time performing an exercise in futility running around like a chicken with your head cut off shuddup the draught from the open window cut across my face and i sat with my gloved hands covering it as tanya had done when shed walked from the hotel vladekino to the place of execution last night cant you shut that window i called to mikhail above the din of the snow chains its got to stay open he said over his shoulder theres a leak in the exhaust manifold the gaskets gone wed both be found with our toes turned up if i shut the window be a gas chamber in here he reached for his little tin again she wouldnt hear of it either olga sitting in watch over her gaggle of sluttish girls in the next place we stopped at i took it to seven hundred and she wavered then but i didnt press her because she could chicken out when the time came to go through with it and that would be dangerous for gods sake i told mikhail theyre like cows in there he shifted into gear with a clashing of cogs you said you didnt want class you get what you pay for this area now i can take you to i need a phone i told him the sun had lodged among the black frieze of cranes along the dockside their thorns cutting across its red swollen sac as the dark sky deepened night would come soon now in the late siberian afternoon flooding in from the steppes there was a line of booths near a bus stop one of them with the cord still intact and the two kopeks rattled into the almost empty coin box mikhail was watching me from the taxi hed asked for another fifty roubles to keep the meter going and id given it to him he would be my companion in the coming night providing me with wheels and shelter and a shut mouth id mentioned to him that the militia seemed busy of late and hed said they were always sticking their snotty noses into other peoples business they also were the sons of whores she would be frightened tanya as they worked on her at militia headquarters she would be wondering how she could have ignored my warning would have realized now that id meant what i said that i knew and should have been trusted to know more than she did it couldnt have been easy for her to leave that building and make her desperate run for the nearest telephone that would work that would bring her the voice of her brother and the comfort she hungered for she would be frightened now under the blinding light i didnt want to think about that ordnance unit three i asked for captain rusakov said it was a matter of urgency mikhail had left his engine running hed said the starter dog was worn and that it had let him down twice he couldnt trust it the booth stank of vomit thered been a drunk here i kept the door cracked open with my boot she would be frightened at the thought of what she might say of what they might make her say about her brother frightened and alone and god knew how long it would be before i could reach her if i could reach her at all have you ever been questioned by the militia no by the kgb then yes what did they do to you they beat me up then you know what i mean tanya the militia are no different even now theyll get everything out of you once they start and that is why you have to stay with me the glass panels of the booth were filthy and one of them had words scrawled on it by an angry finger gorbachev murdered the motherland beyond it the sun was down crimsoning the earths rim as its sac burst at last and spilled its blood across the horizon there was so little time the line clicked captain rusakov speaking lipstick are you alone in a moment he said i dont understand are you alone in the room yes who is this your sister has been arrested i heard him let out a breath and then there was another brief silence before he asked me again who is this there was caution in his voice now and an undertone of shock in the last few seconds his life had lurched write this down i told him theres a rooming house with a bar at pier on the river the west bank the bar is called harbour light wait for me there at where are they holding her listen carefully i told him weve got to cover the important things first in case were interrupted a militia patrol car had crossed the intersection a minute ago eastwards towards the river you should know that i am your ally and that im going to try getting your sister free tonight now i want you to wait for me at a table at the harbour light bar at pier on the west bank of the ob at eight oclock this evening you should give me your name he said not too bright this army man trained to respect discipline to have his life run for him on rails didnt care for anonymous phone calls but hed at least had the imagination and the necessary passion to set up an assassination and bring it off a private enough act he hadnt done that to orders or had he the thought came at me like a stray bullet and i filed it that had been the second attempt on the life of general velichko rusakov i said if you waste my time you could wreck our chances of getting your sister free shell be under interrogation now and may at any moment expose you under duress as the assassin of general gennadi velichko are you prepared to cooperate with me a huge shape was on the move beyond the filthy window of the booth and i watched it what i didnt want him to do was panic and put the phone down and run for some kind of cover he would have got the point by now it didnt need a lot of intelligence the instant his sister told the militia who had shot velichko thered be a telephone call from the officer commanding militia headquarters to the officer commanding the russian army garrison with a request that captain vadim rusakov of ordnance unit three be placed under immediate arrest on suspicion of murder pending the arrival of prisoner transport and an officer bearing information if rusakov ran i would lose the second key to meridian the dark shape moved slowly past the gap between the rooming house and a stevedores gantry and its port riding light bloomed like a rose in the river fog a freighter bringing salmon perhaps canned salmon from kamen na obi in the south for my friend out there in the taxi i am going there now i heard rusakov saying going where to militia headquarters his tone was strong adamant thats where they must be holding my sister i will give myself up rusakov i will give myself up and tell them she had nothing to do with it rusakov listen to me they wont take your word for that theyll get at the truth and the truth is that she was an accomplice she i must help her she is my sister god give me patience if you go there rusakov you will both be held for enquiries and by midnight tonight theyll have got the whole thing out of you and therell be nothing i can do for tanya you will have condemned her i waited emergency numbers it said on a panel by the phone fire service militia ambulance it is not necessary to use coins why should i believe you rusakov was asking suddenly why would i call you and warn you to lie low if i didnt want to help you waited again time was running out would go on running out as the minutes and the hours measured the long nights passing and i did what i could what i must before it was too late i wanted to shout at this man force him to understand what hed got to do but that wouldnt work i had to appeal to his intelligence his voice came again why should you want to help me it would take too long rusakov to tell you im going to give you a last chance and remember that the longer they keep tanya there the worse its going to be for her and that i alone can hope to get her free now write this down i went over it again the name and location of the bar and the time of the rendezvous go there in civilian dress i told him not in uniform you should i am on duty until midnight then request immediate compassionate leave say that youve just heard that your sister was injured in the crash of the rossiya and you must visit her at the hospital immediately can you do that yes good you should put on your oldest clothes the harbour light is a seamans hangout when i go in there to find you i shall look for a pair of slightly odd gloves lying on the table beside you now give me your description he took a moment to think i shall be wearing a colour of eyes what green i took him through it clean shaven height one metre ninety two weight one sixty medium build no visible scars i didnt need all that for the rendezvous in the bar but i might need it later if he didnt show up or panicked and went to ground or made things tricky for me until he was ready to trust me all right youll be wearing dark blue duffle coat dark woollen hat with ear muffs dont forget the gloves now listen i dont know if i can make it there by eight oclock but you must wait and go on waiting unless the bar closes it could be open all night with shipping movement going on dont leave there and dont go back to the barracks until ive talked to you i took a moment to check his thinking do you know why he found it difficult to say but he got it right if if my sister is made to talk i would be arrested right at the barracks or in the open street or anywhere you habituate but youll be safe enough at the bar if it closes book in at the rooming house next door and use a false name give them some money instead of your identity therell be drug traffic on that river and theyll be used to people wanting privacy then i told him if i havent reached you by midnight either at the bar or the rooming house itll simply mean i cant and you should then consider getting out of novosibirsk by ship theyll be watching the airport and the train stations and the roads he thought about that but didnt take long i shall remain here and give myself up and try to help my sister i heard a warning note and thought of telling him to shift the deadline to beyond midnight but left it if i hadnt got tanya free by then itd be no go when did you see her last rusakov was asking this morning she was trying to contact you when the militia picked her up bite the bullet rusakovhow do you think shed stand up to interrogation i heard him let out a breath again she she had a bad time with the kgb a few years ago since then shes been afraid of getting hurt again he should have thought of that before he got her involved in an assassination that is why i tried to keep her out of what happened last night so why couldnt you she insisted shes very obstinate id seen his photograph many times but she said that wasnt good enough she was afraid i would make a mistake a beat she was also very determined that we should go through with this thing i thought that was interesting rusakov do you know why those three men came to novosibirsk mikhail shut off the engine of his taxi and silence came in a tugs klaxon sounded from down the river like a night bird croaking no rusakov said but hed taken a long time to think about it do you know where the remaining two of them are mikhail got out of the trabant stood stamping his feet looking towards the phone booth i think rusakov said i could find out theres a lot going on i felt a booster kick in for meridian be there at eight i told him and remember there must be some way i can help you rusakov said quickly ill go with you to militia headquarters that would blow up the whole thing you must realize how i feel i love my sister im not good at waiting doing nothing when be at the rendezvous if im not there he said it will mean i changed my mind and the line went dead theres only one more mikhail said in this district theres always a girl here and there in the bars of course if you lets go to the last house there was another street closed telephone wires festooned like a spider web across the snow drifts and the small dark figures of men working on them trapped like flies warning flags hanging limp and a flare burning black smoke standing in a thick column from the oil barrel the wind had dropped and the night was quiet except for the rumbling of snow ploughs across the city the frayed wool at the wrist of mikhails right mitten trembled to the vibration of the trabant as it rocked across the ruts with the ice popping under the tyres shes very obstinate rusakov had said she was also very determined that we should go through with this thing id thought that was interesting because all id known of tanya rusakova was that she was unskilled in subterfuge had given general velichko for instance the name of the hotel where she was staying her obstinacy had shown itself perhaps when shed left the safe house despite my warning but the same trait together with her determination could help to save her now at militia headquarters by dragging out the interrogation process until i could move in you dont need to go there now you re wasting your time bloody little organism starting to panic of course im not wasting my time you should meet rusakov now as soon as you can he thinks he can find the generals thats your objective dead wrong he wont do a thing for me until i can get tanya out of there you re rationalizing an icicle as long as a spear dropped from a guttering and crashed onto the roof of a parked car scattering rainbows in the headlights first get tanya out then work on her brother you should be working on him now you should have told him to meet you right away hes the key now not her if i dont get tanya out hell try to help her by giving himself up then ill lose him and the missions gone you havent got a chance of going in there and coming out again you know that scares you doesnt it you re doing what ferris said you might its the death or glory thing go dashing in there like a white knight on horseback and carry the maiden off you want your fucking head tested youre shit scared thats all i know you of old walking into a lions den you ii get eaten alive shit scared bloody little organism the tyre chains dragged on the snow and the engine idled names marina mikhail said his rheumy eye in the mirror cunning old cow you should watch it keep your wallet in sight know what i mean she was sitting in a huge carved ottoman chair a woman with three chins and enormous breasts trapped in a rusty black satin decolletage and hips that bulged across the arms of the chair four rings on her thick fingers three dirty diamond solitaires and a black tourmaline her feet squeezed into splitting court shoes on the stained kazakhstan carpet i have the best she said huskily the best in novosibirsk the youngest the heat pressed against my face sucking the moisture from my eyes and leaving them dry the smell was the same here as it had been in the other places but with something added sharp and indefinable reaching from the lungs into the gut i have chinese girls marina said thirteen fourteen years old you should see them they are like porcelain ill show you she picked up a brass bell engraved with dragons and the sound seemed half muted in the stifling air you can have two in a bed marina told me her small eyes like sparks in the thick folds of her flesh three in a bed as many as you want what about a boy you like variety or i have whips here chains you like that perhaps it was stale blood the sharp iron smell on the air i let her go on talking because i wanted to know what my chances were mikhail had said this house was the last one in the district and god knew how far wed have to drive to find the next a whore came through the red velvet curtains and stood looking at me her thick white body wrapped in a soiled nightdress and her coarse dyed hair lying across one shoulder her lips parted to show the tip of her tongue her eyes narrowed fear in them fear of the gross woman in the chair she can go i told marina im not here for that i told her what i was here for you must think i m crazy she said i started at three hundred implying i would go to five a drunk was in there somewhere and a girl was squealing and the sound pierced the nerves like chalk on a blackboard how do you expect me to do that the woman asked me say its your birthday come on youre smarter than i am i would lose my licence she said you havent got a licence not for the whips and chains she offered me vodka i havent got long i said one thousand take it or leave it i got up to go she watched me still as a toad are you on the run no youll have to tell me more about yourself theres nothing to know one thousand cash fifteen hundred ill do it for that a thousands all i have i got as far as the door and suppose i get into trouble with this she asked me if you dont know how to keep out of trouble marina nobody does let me see the cash she counted it all right her face began creasing and a wheeze started coming out of her that almost sounded like laughter i would have done it for half she said and tears glistened in the folds of flesh i know i said but the other five is to make sure you dont cross me i went close to her and smelled her foul body smell as i looked into the little black slits of her eyes if you cross me you fat stinking bitch ill see that you croak theyll find you sitting in this chair like a stuck pig with your throat cut and your blood running under that door and into the street for the dogs to drink i told mikhail to drive me back to within two city blocks of the safe house and check for a usable phone booth on the way ferris answered at once ive got things set up i told him there was a short silence he hadnt known before the phone had rung that i wasnt already in a red sector at militia headquarters and desperate for help i havent told london he said he meant he hadnt told london i was going to try getting tanya rusakova out of militia headquarters control would have wanted to talk to me direct on the phone and i didnt have time for that he would have said no in any case would have gone through the roof and ordered ferris to call me in would have created a strictly monumental fuss and id started moving too fast now for london to block my run of course ferris hadnt told them he knew better than that he was a seasoned director in the field and quite possibly the only dif who was in fact capable of running this particular shadow executive through a mission without calling on london for instructions because this particular shadow executive is difficult to control as ferris himself has said isnt amenable to discipline so forth is not your most popular ferret in the bureau and that is a bloody shame i am a little nervous my good friend as perhaps you note we are going in very soon now it hadnt surprised me when ferris had said id have his full support hed had no choice hes run me before and through some extremely sticky operations mandarin northlight and hes learned to read what it says on the bottom line if ive decided to take a mission into a new direction with some really significant risks attached i m not going to back off if the director gets cold feet im going to do it anyway and if i cant do it with his support ill do it solo ferris understands that but i felt for him he wasnt going to get any sleep tonight and when i signalled him again he would pick up before the second ring whats the score he asked me now his tone was particularly cool and i heard the control in it ive made contact with rusakov i told him and weve got a tentative rendezvous theres no time to go into details now here it is need two support men and two cars the first one is to pick up tanya when she leaves militia headquarters the second one is to do a relayto take tanya over from the first one and leave a cold trail timing ferris asked me ill come to that id have to work it out it could be two hours from now three hours four midnight possibly even as late as that itd depend how things went you should deploy the first car just off the square in front of militia headquarters out of sight and in a street with a clear run i went over the details with him told him the car should be parked facing away from the square told him how i wanted the relay set up though it wasnt really necessary to spell it out a relay is a relay and its designed to do one thing to throw off pursuit what else ferris asked me thats all we just need to get tanya clear and into your safe keeping will you be going with her no ill be making my own way out in a moment when do i send in the support i gave it some thought make it an hour from now no later than that five forty one i checked my watch yes im synchronized tentatively ferris said you know dont you that if you get stuck in militia headquarters therell be absolutely nothing i can do i translated that in my mind was i prepared to push the mission right to the edge at this stage and risk sending it over because the director in the field for meridian would be put through a rigorous debriefing when he got back to london and control would want straight answers yes i warned the executive that thered be nothing i could do for him if he placed the mission in final hazard the thing is i told ferris there are no options were working with a zero deadline and we cant slow up weve just got to go for it the executive felt there was no choice but to proceed with the mission despite the risks im sure youll do well ferris said and i didnt like the polite formality it showed nerves i left it final thing i said im going to call the peep off the safe house its going to get blown in any case sometime before midnight he took it cold didnt ask why but you still need a new one yes with spare clothes provisions the usual thing ive been working on it then its over and out i told him and put the phone back onto the hook in the crown of the night sky the stars were huge fading as they sank into the smog that clouded the city the snow was brittle under my boots as i finished circling the block and closed in on the safe house youre free to go i told the man in the doorway report to the dif by phone he was huddled into his coat his eyes peering from above the scarf hed wrapped round his head no one relieving no go and get some grog he left a patch of bare wet concrete in the doorway where hed cleared the snow with his heels i walked on and checked the windows of the building and then went in the bedclothes were still rumpled and tanyas bag was gone but shed left the toilet things in the bathroom and a message on the mirror scrawled with a lipstick thankyou forgive me tanya i wiped it off with some toilet paper and flushed it and looked around there were no other signs that a woman had been here the shower head in the bathroom was dripping rhythmic as the ticking of a clock it was time to go you re mad you know that youve gone mad shuddup you ii be walking straight into a trap oh for christs sake shuddup and leave me alone i took a last look round and left the curtains almost closed and the light on and the door unlocked and went down the stairs and into the street and across to the skoda and started it up letting the engine warm while i scraped away the ice that had formed on the windscreen then i drove three miles east towards the suburbs and left the car on some waste ground and locked it and had to walk nearly five blocks before i saw a militia patrol car and stopped it and told the driver i was viktor shokin the man they were looking for violets you are giving yourself up no the colonel looked at me his head going down a degree and his eyes remaining on my own the light wasnt too bad in here this wasnt an interrogation room just a holding cell by the look of it with a small barred window and a steel door with a look through panel in it the door wasnt closed there was still quite a bit of bustle going on out there militia tramping about phones ringing i heard my cover name several times viktor shokin was quite a catch then why are you here the colonel asked me he had an intelligent face unsurprisingly in terms of his rank and didnt seem to think i was playing the fool when id told him i wasnt giving myself up if hed thought i was playing the fool he would have given immediate orders to have me beaten into a different frame of mind youve got a woman here i told him tanya rusakova is that correct he went on watching me while he thought it over he was a big man bigger still in his greatcoat and had the kind of eyes that would be able to watch a war trained doberman tearing a fugitive to pieces for instance without showing anything except possibly a hint of amusement yes he said at last that is correct i want her released colonel i left it at that for the moment i wanted to feed information into him slowly so that i could catch and weigh his reactions because this was the man who was going to decide at some hour of this long and perilous night whether he was going to let me walk out of here or hand me over to homicide investigation and start the machinery of justice rolling over me someone in the passage outside was asking where colonel belyak was and in a moment a junior officer was standing in the doorway glancing at me and away again telephone colonel in your office who is it oic catering sir take a message are you monitoring my telephones yes sir then go on taking messages and dont come to me with anything unless it sounds urgent are those not the orders passed on to you yes sir im catering is not urgent you clod get out everyone brought themselves an inch straighter the junior officer and the two guards at the door and the sergeant who stood behind and to the left of colonel belyak the sergeant was a short square man with a pock marked corpse coloured face its eyes lost in hollows its nose broken and its jaw skewed he hadnt spoken since id been brought in here ten minutes ago he watched colonel belyak when he asked me questions and watched me when i answered them he would be the one this sergeant who would be ordered to beat me up if i looked like playing the fool or refused to give the information the colonel was looking for or in any way tried bitching him about so you want the woman released belyak watched me steadily with the polished black stones in his face yes why because shes innocent of any wrongdoing she was set up explain that for me she was set up as bait in the assassination of general gennadi velichko he brought his head down a degree and left his eyes on mine a mannerism i was beginning to understand id caught his attention continue he said his voice had the tonelessness of a surgeons asking for another scalpel i must have moved on the chair because it creaked it was a straight backed kitchen chair and id noticed stains on it when the colonel had told me to sit down ive seen chairs like this one before stained and gone in the joints professional interrogators all over the world use the same tricks and one of them is to sit the detainee down so that he has to look up at the other people which makes him nervous and so that hes conveniently positioned if they decide to make him still more nervous by smashing him backwards onto the floor chair and all they use the back of their fist or their boot or whatever they choose and although i know how to stop that kind of thing right in its tracks i never do unless theres a chance of turning the odds and getting clear tonight there was no question of that id come here of my own freewill im not going to tell you very much at this stage colonel belyak first the woman has to be released we shall need chief investigator gromov here wont we for his authority he is on his way the colonel said how long will it take him to get here why do you ask because weve got to hurry colonel belyak lifted his head slightly still watching me id seen him do that before when id told him something he didnt intend to take we have all night mr shokin he used gospodin as chief inspector gromov had done on the train when hed questioned me its closest equivalent in the west was mr tovarishch was out now in russia a quaint leninist trapping we have as long as i decide we shall have the colonel said he was standing with his feet apart the polish on his jackboots glinting in the light from the bare electric bulb overhead his shadow huge against the wall his hands were behind him and there was nothing in them theyd been empty when hed come in here there was nothing in the sergeants hands either he was a man who liked the feel of bone on flesh when he went to work a former pugilist with the gloves off now and real toys to play with i want you to realize i told the colonel that youre going to be very pleased indeed with the information i shall be giving you eventually once gospozha rusakova has been released im not setting any kind of deadline you see its just a fact of life we cant afford to waste any time not in fact true certainly i was setting a deadline because i had to keep up the pressure if i gave these people all the time they wanted theyd simply put me through intensive interrogation and id come out days later with not much more than pulp where the flesh had been with a torn urethra and clouded conjunctivae and the kidneys contused and pouring blood into the urine and my sight gone and my brain out of synch and meridian blown to hell there was also the risk of tanya rusakovas brother losing patience im no good at waiting doing nothing hed said on the telephone if im not there at the rendezvous it will mean i changed my mind he could wreck everything i was trying to do if there were any deadlines to be set colonel belyak was saying i would set them myself of course he was touchy and id have to watch it i had begun paying out a thread so fine that one wrong word could break it tell me what you know the colonel said about the assassination of general velichko there was the sound of snow chains locking across concrete outside the building and the slamming of doors so i took a chance and left the question unanswered turning my head as the tramping of boots loudened and voices began echoing along the passage and chief investigator gromov came in shouldering his way between the guards and nodding briefly to the colonel and staring down at me with his hands dug into the pockets of his coat so we have you cold air was still coming in from the passage laced with exhaust gas not quite that i said what then i missed the patience in his caramel brown eyes that id seen on the rossiya hed had all the time he needed then but now he was more energized hed thrown a net across the city of novosibirsk and here suddenly was the minnow squirming and he wanted facts and he wanted them fast i decided to come here of my own free will i told him to obtain the immediate release of tanya rusakova she did nothing wrong intentionally and i want her out of here i spoke carefully articulating it wasnt a time for misunderstandings i will then deliver into your hands if its not too late the man who shot zymyanin on board the rossiya the night before last who also set a bomb in one of the compartments with the intention of killing general velichko general chudin and general kovalenko and having failed shot general velichko to death last night in the street the cell was very quiet there were telephones ringing in the offices along the passage and boots sounded constantly over the bare boards shut that door colonel belyak told one of the militiamen and stay on guard outside he swung his head to look at gromov wanting to tap into his thinking but gromov had his eyes on me in the case of zymyanin he said you had witnesses against you on the train they were lying but please remember that i just told you i can deliver the actual perpetrator if there is time i gave it a beat when i last talked to him i checked my watch forty two minutes ago he was making plans to set another bomb colonel belyak was first where i cant tell you he thinks he knows where the other two generals are and he still means to kill them do you know where they are gromov asked quickly no i asked him but he refused to tell me belyak who is this man i looked at my watch again with respect gentlemen you will have to use your heads i cant give you this man if we stay here talking nor can you hope to stop another tragedy like the one on the rossiya with further loss of innocent lives the responsibility is yours silence came in again it was warm in here with so many bodies and the sweat was beginning to run on me the thread was still intact but id have to go on playing it out in the hope of drawing them with me and thered be a lot of strain why should we release this woman the colonel asked because shes done nothing she thats beside the point why do you want her released shes been traumatized by the whole thing and the whole thing velichkos death he was right id stopped choosing my words and we couldnt afford misunderstandings you may consider it beside the point that youre holding an innocent person here and putting her through further suffering but i do not the release of tanya rusakova is my only condition but if you dont meet it i wont deliver the agent into your hands but of course he could have left his base by now they didnt react wouldnt be hurried if i finally got them with me one of them would look at his watch it hadnt happened yet are you in love with this woman gromov asked me no shes remarkably attractive yes i wish i had time in my life to fall in love with every attractive woman i meet id been listening for her voice in the building she couldnt be far from here because shed be in a cell too and this was the detention area all other things being equal a womans voice carries more clearly than a mans id heard nothing gromov looked at the colonel is this man your prisoner or mine hes mine at this point but im willing to hand him over i dont want him wasting time yes i told belyak you do he watched me with his black polished stones explain the agent is a former militia officer majors rank he was sacked for persistent drunkenness and killing three men on the firing range by culpable negligence since then hes been taking on clandestine operations one of which has so far included the death of zymyanin on board the rossiya and the bombing of the train and the shooting of general velichko here in novosibirsk if you dont pull him in as soon as you can your heads going to be on the block and the people of russia are going to lose a great deal of faith in their militia whose job it is to protect the peace the people of russia are in a touchy mood these days another vehicle pulled up in the forecourt of the building and i felt the thread in my hand grow taut as the door banged open and boots clattered along the passage im here to demand the release of my sister tanya amelia rusakova and to make a foil confession in the death of general gennadi velichko i waited why have you decided to betray this agent colonel belyak asked ive been considering it ever since he bombed the train he took innocent lives its not my way he needs stopping now or god knows what hell do boots tramping im no good at waiting doing nothing the gallant captain rusakov all right gromov said tell us where we can pick up this man ill have to take you to him why hes violent if you put him in a trap hell try to shoot his way out boots tramping passing the door not stopping others have tried that too the colonel said look i told him you can go hi there with as many men as you like but youll end up with a messy operation and get half of them killed unnecessarily or you can take me with you and ill talk to him first and set him up for you and therell be no bloodshed i can promise an elegant copybook operation which i would think is more your style i waited again watching the colonel and the chief investigator in turn seeing first one and then the other start looking at his watch seeing it again and again in my mind but only there a cell door slammed shut along the passage and the boots sounded again belyak opened his mouth but gromov was first what is your connection with this agent we were collaborators in what the same clandestine operation its purpose to sabotage the podpolia that got a reaction as id known it would the hardline communist underground was known to exist and the russian and commonwealth police militia and mps were known to be smoking out its leaders but some of its leaders were firmly ensconced in the russian and commonwealth police militia and mps which made things difficult id glanced from gromov to belyak when id said what i had but couldnt catch anything they were both trained to remain deadpan whatever was in their minds gromov or belyak could well be a member of the podpolia unknown to the other but it didnt make any difference each of them had a job to do and hed get a great deal of kudos within his department if he could pull in the man who had bombed the rossiya whether he was in the underground or against it the charge against him would be one of mass murder you believe then gromov said that general velichko was in yes and you would furnish me with a full accounting of both your own actions and your collaborators once he is taken a full accounting in the expectation of leniency for myself the colonel looked across at gromov again we should confer he said i agree then belyak looked at his watch im glad to see colonel i told him that youre aware of the passage of time its critical as ive warned you gromov opened the door of the cell and the colonel followed him out and the door banged shut again the look through panel vibrating in its runners the militia sergeant had come to attention when his colonel had gone out now he was standing at ease hed been sorry i knew to hear i was ready to give a full accounting of my actions he would have preferred orders to tear it out of me word by word as the blood came running i thought of talking to him asking how the sweet peas were coming along but he wouldnt have answered me i was a dog brought in here from the streets and he didnt talk to dogs it would have been pleasant to stand up and stretch my legs and have him order me to sit down again and refuse and give him the excuse to drive his fist into my diaphragm so that i could parry the blow to the left and open him up and go in with some fast centre knuckle jabs to paralyse the major nerves and finish up with a back fist to stun the pineal gland and take him gently onto the floor it would have relieved the tension in me and i could have used that but of course it wouldnt have done any good because when they came back the colonel and the chief investigator theyd have thought id been losing my temper and wouldnt have trusted me anymore theyd been gone three minutes i was sitting with my legs crossed and my left hand on my right thigh with the fingers spread out so that i could look down at my watch and check the time without moving three minutes was too long one minute was too long because we had two deadlines running at any time at all captain rusakovs patience could break and he could come storming into the building or his sister could talk under interrogation and give the lie to everything id been telling these people and in either case my fragile thread would finally snap finito four minutes and the sweat came springing itching on the scalp you do much quilting sarge keep your mouth shut yes sarge five five minutes there was only one real chance of pulling this thing off and i started running it through my mind over and over to keep the nerves under control they were crying out for action and in the quiet confines of this bloody cell there was the itch in me to provoke this sergeant and melt him down and that was dangerous the only chance of pulling this thing off lay in the fact that id given colonel belyak and chief investigator gromov an offer theyd find difficult to refuse theyd nothing to lose six minutes i could smell the sergeant feet most of it filthy socks typical of the breed theyre not the ultra sensitive among us these paid professional body busters ive known some i tell you ive known some and ive left stains on their kitchen chairs and all im looking for is any excuse to plug this bastards nervous system into some really high voltage centre knuckle techniques and for christs sake watch it or you ii blow the whole thing perfectly right seven minutes theyd nothing to lose they could let tanya rusakova walk out of this building and through those rusting iron gates and across the square and they could get her back in five minutes deploy patrols and cover the environment theyd be quite sure of that wrong but sure unworried and they could escort me to the place where i would direct them and surround it with half a regiment of armed militia before they let me in there nothing to lose they could pull me out again and slam me back into the patrol car or shoot me down if i resisted whatever they chose to do nothing to lose if they agreed to the deal at all that would be their reason eight minutes and the sweat reached my chin and i brushed it off and the sergeant caught the movement and i saw him tense the scarred leather skinned hands lifting a fraction and the fingers forming claws ready to grab me and send me spinning backwards on the chair you try that you stinking bastard and i ii steady for the sake of god youll blow meridian i want her out of here thats all shes had enough nine nine minutes are you in love with this woman no shes remarkably attractive yes indeed that is indeed so you look into those green and shimmering eyes and watch the soft and subtle play of that perfect mouth as she speaks and youre moved you cant help it moved as a man as a male of her species this is the way it is with tanya rusakova but that isnt why i came why i want her out of this bloody place shes innocent you said and shes had enough well yes but the main thing is that if they keep her locked up here long enough that gallant brother of hers is going to bare his breast for the bullet and ill lose the only key ive got left for meridian so youd have come here then for anyone a man youd have risked all this for anyone keep your bloody questions to yourself touchy arent we shuddup ten ten minutes voices outside the cell no louder no nearer just voices i could hear the sergeants breathing smell his breath the taint of tobacco on his breath he was standing with his arms hanging like an apes and his feet astride something on his boot on his left boot something hed spilled hed been slopping soup around or this was perhaps vomit another mans a man in a stained kitchen chair or it was something else you couldnt hope to tell what sordid business had soiled this uniformed whoresons boot you stink you know that you stink like a pig steady lad steady yes i know i know thats a nice cologne you use sarge is it violets or shut your fucking mouth sorry sarge then the voices outside stopped and the door opened and they came in colonel belyak and chief investigator gromov and looked down at me dog pack we were set out like men on a chessboard in front of militia headquarters our shadows slanting across the wet concrete from the big wrought iron lamps over the gates gromov and two aides standing beside one of the patrol jeeps belyak positioned near a prisoner transport van drawn up at the front of the building its engine had been running but now it had been switched off and it was quiet here in the forecourt with only the drumming of a snow plough in the far distance it was very cold an icicle dropped from the eaves flashing in the light and then hitting the ground with the music of breaking glass a voice sounded over the radio of one of the patrol cars standing outside the railings and a militiaman answered and the night was quiet again but there was the sweet and sour smell of carbon monoxide on the air there was an engine running somewhere perhaps on the other side of the building that was to be expected chief investigator gromov rolled his shoulders inside his greatcoat again as id seen him do before i suppose the coat was a bad fit or he was just trying to keep warm he would have been awake for most of last night supervising the city wide manhunt for viktor shokin and would be tired now the three quarter moon clung to the heights of the southern sky bone white and mottled its light casting prismatic colours across the snow covered roofs a horned owl was calling from the bare trees of the park with the note of a bamboo flute she came out of the building tanya rusakova walking alone not looking around her yet taking care with the steps her boots grating on the sand that had been thrown down over the hard packed snow then she reached the bottom and walked a little way into the courtyard looking around her now confused her face drawn and her eyes wary then she saw me and came on again and i took a few steps to meet her this was what i had asked for that she should have no escort out of the building and that i should be the only one to speak to her her eyes had surprise in them now the last time shed seen me was in the safe house and she couldnt understand why i was still apparently a free man surrounded by uniforms but at a distance why are they letting me go her breath clouded on the lamplit air i asked her quietly what did you tell them she tensed remembering the past hours i suppose nothing about you or my brother shes very obstinate her brother had said perhaps it was that walk through those gates i told her and into the park a man will meet you there and look after you hell tell you his name is georgi do everything he says the militia will try to bring you back so be careful this time i stood drowning for a moment in the shimmering green as she went on watching me still confused you are not coming too no remember what i said tanya and be careful i turned and walked a little way towards the building and then turned again and watched her going through the big iron gates she looked back once her face pale in the wash of the two big lamps then walked on again across the churned snow of the roadway and into the trees of the park somewhere on the other side of the building i could hear a vehicle of some sort moving off through the gears it was probably the one that had been sending the smell of carbon monoxide across the courtyard colonel belyak get that vehicle stopped he swung a look at me but did nothing stop that patrol car or the deal is off you understand he left the black stones of his eyes on me for a little while and then made a quick gesture to the driver of the prisoner transport van and we heard the squelch of his transmitter belyak turned pacing away with his head down hands behind him pacing back in the distance i heard the patrol car halt and the sound of its engine die away i didnt believe belyak could have ordered something so crude wed made a deal purportedly among gentlemen the only kind that would work perhaps some minion had thought of trying it on and belyak had done nothing to stop him seeing it as a test for me to find out how much confidence i had how id respond to the challenge colonel belyak did you give the orders for that he stopped pacing and looked up at me from under his big round cap said nothing for a moment and then lets get on were wasting time i looked at my watchten minutes remember that was all i asked for and you agreed he moved away from me impatiently crunching across the snow to talk to chief investigator gromov no one else moved and there was no more sound of engines or anything else no sound of a shot one of the uniformed militiamen was stamping his feet over by the black iron railings he was nursing an assault rifle they all were slung low and at the ready a dozen of them were positioned outside the gates all of them facing the courtyard facing the prisoner viktor shokin the night was quiet still except for the snow plough in the distance six minutes had passed and there was still no sound of a shot that was what i was waiting for hoping against seven minutes and the radio in one of the patrol vehicles opened up and i went across there straightaway to listen through the drivers open window to base this is come in im stuck on the ice at st petersburg ulica and boronov prospekt base told him they were sending help and the call was shut down it hadnt been anything to do with this driver here the radio was on open network id checked the call as a routine and it was all i could do if colonel belyak or chief investigator gromov had set up a multi vehicle tracking operation on the little park to keep tanya rusakova monitored thered be no signals on the air they would have ordered radio silence nine minutes and another big icicle came away from the eaves of the building lancing through the lamplight and splintering against the bottom step it had touched the nerves a little because if the sound of a shot came from across the park it would be a signal that the support man couldnt get tanya as far as the first car couldnt get her clear and if that happened thered be no further options if these people werent prepared to let the woman prisoner go free in exchange for what i could do for them i couldnt force the issue i heard the horned owl call again from the trees the ushastaya sova its notes soft and echoeless the snow plough had stopped working over there in the distance and the winter silence grew vast across the city there had been no shot colonel belyak turned to face me ten minutes are you satisfied stop i told the militiaman at the wheel the safe house was two blocks from here eastwards towards the river belyak spoke to the driver from beside me on the rear seat give the signal for deployment the man opened up his radio id counted seven unmarked patrol cars on the way here from militia headquarters some of them tailing us and the others keeping abreast along streets running parallel to our route i hadnt given directions when wed started out this too had been finally agreed belyak had raised objections at first but id waited for him to sweat it out because the situation was quite clear if id given him the location of the safe house he could have left tanya in her cell and put me back into mine and sent in a platoon and evacuated the building and taken it by storm its the concrete block of apartments straight ahead of us i told him two blocks down we will wait he said wed agreed that i would take him to within two blocks of the safe house and give him time to deploy his forces in a ring at that distance from the building before i went in microphone he told the driver and the man passed it back commander to all units keep your engines as quiet as you can no lights he smelled of cigars the colonel cigars and boot polish he was an easier man to handle than chief investigator gromov belyak was paramilitary trained within the narrow perspectives of the soldier hed be less likely to spring a surprise than gromov a subtler and an older man more of a chess player than a tin drum major gromov was in his own car but his radio would be linked with the colonels network and hed be listening to the moves static came on the air to station and halted colonel belyak sat with his bulk in the corner between the seat and the door the microphone in his hand he wasnt worried about my attempting an escape this area was already a super trap and if id wanted to escape i wouldnt have set it up for my self and so far id got him to believe in that to station and halted engines sounded everywhere in the quiet of the streets a background murmur normal traffic had been stopped and there were no lights moving anywhere only the blacked out shapes of the patrol cars dogs loped past us singly and in packs hollow flanked and with their heads down scenting this wasnt far from the big no meat market closed because there was no meat but still attractive because of its smell to station and halted the time on the dashboard clock was the colonel flipped the mike open what units are still moving there was only static and some faint morse we were picking up from another band if any unit is not yet deployed report immediately static belyak looked at me you are ready yes he got out of the car with me bringing a walkie talkie with the antenna extended and i took him to within a block of the safe house it looks i told him as if hes still there its the fifth room along on the third floor the chink of yellowish light showed clearly enough through the gap in the curtains i looked at my watchdo you have i do youre giving me fifteen minutes that was agreed it was then you can send your men in at if i havent brought him out if i can get him under control before then youll see the light in that window go out and you can expect both of us to leave the building by the main entrance you wont need to order any rush ill have a gun at his back i couldnt see the colonels eyes in the shadow of his cap knew only that they were watching me very well and whether you bring this man out or not you understand that you will remain my prisoner that also was agreed yes i understand i turned away and began walking and heard the sound of boots over the snow as my two escorts began tailing me at a distance there would be others as i moved closer to the building and once i was through the entrance door they would close in from all sides with their assault rifles covering every exit and every window the edges of the snow ruts broke under my boots as i kept on walking from somewhere over to my left i heard a radio come to life and faint voices then it was quiet again he had done well belyak i could only see two of the patrol cars from where i was now and their crews were inside them keeping a low profile but thered be upwards of thirty vehicles forming the peripheral ring at two blocks distance because it would take at least that number to seal off the area effectively when wed left militia headquarters id counted five personnel carriers and there could be others here so that the actual number of armed bodies within and around the ring was probably in the region of two hundred if i tried to break and run at any time at any time at all i would have as much chance as a rat in a dog pack it was when i reached the building and kicked the worst of the snow off my boots and went through the entrance door and heard it swing shut behind me lights ferris caught it before the second ring things went off all right i told him in a moment he said ill tell london he just meant he was pleased that was all because he hadnt believed id got a ghost of a chance of going into militia headquarters and coming out again of my own free will there was nothing in point of fact to tell london the purpose of the exercise had been to stop captain vadim rusakov from going down there and offering himself as the sacrificial lamb in order to get his sister out i needed him i hadnt advanced the mission id simply averted the terminal damage that tanya had come appallingly close to causing when shed walked out of that safe house in spite of my warning but that was something at least we hadnt crashed meridian though it wasnt the kind of signal the director in the field could flash to control in london novosibirsks just come in sir weve still got a mission running croder would freeze him with his obsidian eyes how nice were expected to do rather better than that we the brave and underpaid ferrets in the field but i had felt something move softly within when id seen her look back just that once before shed vanished into the trees of the little park you could call it joy of some kind i suppose or as close as i can ever get to such a thing inside the cold and scaly carapace of my defences as close as ill let myself get you read well my good friend between the lines i blew the safe house i told ferris it was full of militia when i left there they were looking for you yes whats your location now im about three miles away at iskitim prospekt and wait a minute the glass panels were steaming up iskitim prospekt and borodin ulica and ive got the car here id just walked across the patch of waste ground where id left the skoda earlier this afternoon youve got tanya in safe keeping here at the hotel for gods sake try and make her understand i said that if she goes off on her own again we wont be able to help her lights swept across the telephone booth and i turned my back until theyd gone i wouldnt have long theyd be spreading the hunt shes hating herself ferris said feels she let you down then maybe shes learned i tried to remember the names of the major intersections east of here but a lot had gone on since id studied the map of the city on board the rossiya look im still a bit too close to things at the moment so im going to start driving eastwards from here as soon as we shut down have i got a new safe house yes nothing posh ill take anything i need someone to intercept and lead me there you should also send someone to the harbour light bar on the river i gave him the location captain rusakov should be going there in a couple of minutes from now i repeated the description rusakov had given me of himself and told ferris about the recognition mark the odd pair of gloves he should be told as soon as possible that his sisters free and in safe keeping and that ill meet him there as soon as i can wheres the safe house i could hear the faint crackling of a map on the line five kilometres from the harbour light downstream on the river what sort of place is it in a moment its an abandoned hulk we didnt have much time to find anything better no problem but it wasnt good news if the best the director in the field could find for his executive was an abandoned hulk on the river it meant that the local support people were not only spread thin on the ground but couldnt come up with anything safer it was the nearest they could get i suppose to a bloody cellar therell be a change of clothes forme there i asked ferris the collar of the uniform was rough and my neck had started itching clothes ferris said food oil stove oil lamp bedding the usual supplies there hadnt been a trace of satisfaction in his tone but i said more than i could have hoped for considering thank you look im still a major target and theyll start spreading out from the safe house the minute they find out im not there so i want to get off the streets as soon as i can let rusakov know that ill try and meet him at the harbour light by nine oclock noted and tell the support man ill start driving east from borodin ulica along iskitim in two minutes from now and ill expect him to flash me when he intercepts ferris acknowledged and we shut down the signal and i shouldered the door of the booth open against the heavy spring and waited until a dark blue van went past with only the left headlight going then i walked across the street to the patch of waste ground and got into the skoda the clock on the dash was three minutes slow and i adjusted it to read and started the engine and moved off along borodin sitting with my neck forward a degree to keep it clear of my collar not my collar in point of fact the whole outfit belonged to the sallow faced and brutish looking militiaman whod come sliding in there an hour after id finalized the deal with that fat stinking bitch shed looked shocked at first when id told her what i wanted sitting there like a great female buddha in her rusty black satin dress her rings glinting on her fat fingers and her mouth hanging open but i couldnt ever do such a thing shed get arrested and shot so forth hamming it up because shed already scented money in it perhaps quite a lot if she played hard to get id had to start from there but they come in here dont they the militia just for a quickie it has happened she said cautiously all right ill give you three hundred roubles for the uniform off the first militiaman my size who comes in here the hat and the boots included the whole kit three hundred the huge ottoman chair creaked as she shifted her weight in it settling herself for the struggle how could i possibly get such a thing for you oh come on marina how long have you been running a whorehouse tell him its your birthday give him two or three girls and a bottle of vodka and slip in a mickey finn her fleshy mouth opened in shock you want me arrested rhetoric i didnt answer can you imagine what they would charge me with physical assault on an officer of the law attempted bullshit he couldnt tell them where it had happened you know that tell them hed gone into a brothel and got drunk on duty and theyd give him a year in the brig her right foot began tapping on the stained kazakhstan carpet and how would i get him out of here you expect me to wrap him in a blanket and dump him into a taxi she looked as if id gone out of my mind and the price went up another hundred and how would he ever find another uniform she couldnt care less but i said hed buy one or steal one the door from the street opened and a man came in turning to look behind him before he shut the door a gross creature with the veins on his face broken into a purple network and one eye dulled unseeing the other too bright by far too hungry marina jerked her head and the man parted the slit in the heavy red curtains and pushed his way through them i have chinese girls this woman had told me thirteen fourteen years old you should see them they are like porcelain but this is a mans world my little slant eyed alabaster loves and theres no hope in it for the likes of you im waiting i told the woman and though id said it quietly i saw a leap of fear in her eyes at something she heard in my tone its too big a risk she told me five hundred i would lose my licence one thousand i told her take it or leave it id given her cash and shed counted it and it had been an hour before the sallow faced militiaman had come through the door and now i could smell the vodka on his uniform as i drove east along iskitim watching the mirror a blade of freezing air cutting through a gap where the window rubber had rotted away the heater pushing oil fumes into the car from the engine compartment the mirror trembling to the vibration two militia patrols both coming past from the opposite direction two militia patrols and a bus crowded with fur hats and featureless faces behind the steamy windows a truck lurching half across the pavement to keep out of its way ten blocks eleven twelve and support still hadnt intercepted a dog loped into the roadway and i felt the bump and the front end of the skoda slid across the ruts in the snow and i brought it back again thirteen blocks fourteen until i could see the red lights winking at the top of the radio masts where the land rose towards the river and fell away again he found me at the twentieth block and flashed me and i put a hand up to steady the mirror and took a look at him and slowed and let him go past and took up station fifty yards behind him he was in a two door trabant with most of the paint gone and a strip of adhesive tape slanting across the rear window and one of the tail lights flickering nothing posh as ferris would have said dear jesus i was beginning to realize the kind of operation london had thrown that man to direct in the field meridian was not your fancy west european parlour game with elite status supports and backups and courier lines and signals facilities by courtesy of the british embassies in berlin paris and rome this was a strictly cut price package trip through the frozen hinterland of siberia at a time when even the dogs were too thin to be thought worth catching for the pot something came into the mirror and i held it steady and saw the front end profile of a truck against the glare of its lights i was checking it from habit that was all because the rogue agent i suspected was in the field may have been interested in me on board the rossiya and could have closed up on my movements since id arrived in novosibirsk but when id taken tanya rusakova under my protection after the velichko killing id gone through the rest of the night in a complex travel pattern that no one could have tracked unseen and when roach had picked us up at the hospital in the skoda wed been absolutely clean i knew that so lights in the mirror now wouldnt mean anything but we always check them we the paranoid ferrets in the field with a devotion to ritual worthy of a priest the trabant turned south and east again and the mirror went dark i found the switch for the heater and turned it off the air inside the car was thick with oil fumes and i cracked the window open on the passengers side another militia patrol car passed me this time at right angles across an intersection i didnt know if theyd taken the name of shokin viktor off the all points bulletin board at militia headquarters when id reported there but it wouldnt make any difference because by now they would have taken that whole building apart where the safe house was and set up the hunt again and put my name back on the board it didnt worry me at this point i was running unseen and within reach of shelter and my main concern was to get out of this bloody uniform but i mustnt complain it had served me well id asked that elephantine harpy for something to carry the uniform in when id left the brothel and shed given me a brown paper bag and id put the whole kit still unwrapped in the wardrobe of the safe house and left it there when id gone to find a militia patrol and turn myself in when i was taken back there under escort id told colonel belyak to give me fifteen minutes before he sent his troops in but it hadnt taken that long to get into the uniform and id stowed my clothes under the handbasin in the bathroom and was down the stairs before the headlights of the vehicles outside came flooding through the windows and i heard a chorus of shouted commands i was in a janitors room at the end of the main corridor on the ground floor when they hit the entrance doors open and filled the place with the clatter of boots i gave them time there was a picture on the wall of the room where i was waiting a faded photograph of former president gorbachev of the ussr being greeted at the airport in novosibirsk by girls in white skirts belled out around them as their leader presented a huge bouquet of flowers one little girl among the youngest stood watching the presentation with a contemplative finger up her nose which i thought gave the whole scene a unique charm plekhanov take the stairs by the sound of their boots the corridor was filling up and i could hear doors opening and a womans shrill voice and then a mans demanding to know what was going on and i waited until the first wave had passed the janitors room and then went out and joined the tail of the advance group and started hammering on doors telling people it was the militia open up the vanguard of the group on the ground floor was spilling at right angles into a passage leading to the yard outside id checked the layout of the building after roach had left us here this morning kuibyshev take your men into the yard and stake out the perimeter and leave two men guarding that door i went out with the main group and took up station by the gate the whole street on the far side of the building was a blaze of light as the militia vehicles were brought in from the surrounding streets by radio to complete the total containment of the area and through the ground floor windows i could make out the civilian residents of the apartment block being lined up for questioning open this gate people banging at it from the other side i didnt do anything wed need a sergeant to order it done glass smashed somewhere and i looked up and saw what looked like a struggle going on in a room on the second floor a man was trying to get out onto the fire escape and they werent letting him let me go so forth i suppose that if you turned any given apartment block in this city upside down and shook it youd find the odd drug dealer or black market capitano with evidence he couldnt get rid of at short notice i havent done anything so forth and i felt a touch of queasiness in the stomach because when i was growing op id seen flies on a web and had watched them buzzing and buzzing as the spider darted from its lair and the delicious chill of horror had trickled down my schoolboy spine sergeant in charge open this fucking gate come on the nco heard the order this time and gave a shout and two of us went for the wooden bar and swung it back and got the gate open and i stood clear as a body of men came plunging through and split up and started climbing the fire escapes against the wall of the building while i went through the gate and turned and held my revolver at the ready two men were bringing the civilian down going against the stream i suppose it was the quickest way out of die building with all that fuss going on inside and when theyd got him as far as the gate i turned again and took up the rearguard in case he managed to break loose we took him to one of the vehicles half a block away i think it was the prisoner transport van that had come with us from militia headquarters earlier there was less light here and i left the escort party and took up station at the end of an alley facing the street to watch for anyone attempting to escape but the focus of action was still down there at the apartment block and nobody was looking in my direction so i turned and walked into the alley the boots a bit on the loose side even though id pulled the laces tight its important in this trade that our feet are comfortable because sometimes we need to run and run flat out and if we re not fast enough we can lose the whole thing that had been at and it was now and they wouldnt give it much more than an hour down there gromov and belyak and there was something id have to remember thered only been one way i could have got out of that place and as soon as they gave their minds to it theyd put shokin viktor back on the ap bulletin board described as possibly wearing militia uniform they were there again the lights the support man was driving cautiously and i liked that you could wipe out the front end of whatever you were driving on streets like this if you didnt watch it clouds of steam and rusty water pouring onto the ice and the timing gear pushed through the cylinder block and in these boots i didnt feel like walking and that was the second time i edged the throttle down a fraction to pull up on the trabant in front of me and watched the mirror it was the second time the car behind had gone through a red light oh quite possibly yes with so little traffic on the streets after the storm there wasnt much attention being paid to the lights just slow down a bit and take a good look and off you go again if there are no police around on the other hand its the first intimation you get when a tracker comes up on your tail he cant afford to stay too close and go through the intersections i with you but he cant afford to lose ground to a red light and watch you sail away all i could see from the profile of the vehicle behind me was that it was a private car not a van or a truck or anything with emergency lights on the roof unlit or otherwise but you said you werent worried about lights in the mirror i wasnt you gave us all that bullshit about watching mirrors with the ritualistic devotion of a priest just because you thought it sounded good and now bloody well shuddup there was no way that anyone could have tracked us last night from the velichko killing site to the hospital without my knowing but i used the throttle again and fought the ruts and pulled alongside the trabant and signalled the driver to stop his offside wing caught the side of my door as he slewed on the snow but it wasnt more than a bump and then we were stationary side by side and our windows were down and we started talking ive got some lights in the mirror i told him they were still there in the distance but the car had stopped the support man was watching me a stubbly face with unsurprisable eyes under a black leather ski cap was he there before i intercepted he could have been thered been more traffic earlier hes not mine the support man said i got there clean there was a note of censure in the tone as if hed just noticed i hadnt washed wheres the safe house i asked him you peeling off i might have to our engines idled echoing from the wall alongside two kilometres east of here and youre on the river its the wreck of a coaster single mast with four deck hatches and the starboard bow stove in the m v natasha but you cant make out the name very well shes on the west bank three berths down thats south from no granary novosibirsk black clapperboard with the russian flag painted over the main doors recently done he waited watching me his eyes in the shadow of his cap vessels on either side of the wreck another coaster north and a dredger with a list on it place is a graveyard the lights were still in the mirror all right stay where you are and if im wrong ill be back and we can keep going give me half an hour you need help no it had better be done solo i knew what had happened now and the chill of the night air was creeping through the skin and reaching the nerves because it might not just be a case of throwing off the tracker and resuming operations without him meridian had been compromised and even ferris could be in hazard it was perfectly true that no one could have tracked us through this city last night that wed been absolutely clean when roach had picked us up at the hospital but the lights back there were still in the mirror and now i knew why there must have been surveillance on the skoda when id picked it up twenty minutes ago and theyd started tracking me were behind me now but they couldnt have found it there by chance on that patch of waste ground in a city this size theyd been surveilling this car since id brought it away from the safe house and before then theyd been surveilling it when it had been standing outside the apartment block after roach had left it there for me to use and before then theyd tracked roach to the rendezvous at the hospital must have got onto him when hed started out to meet us there the thread went back and back as far as the unthinkable i looked across at the support man change that i called to him above the drumming of the enginesdont wait forme getaway from here and watch your tail hed caught my tone lifted his head an inch like an animal scenting signal the dif as soon as you can i told him make sure the lines not tapped tell him i think your whole support base could have been blown and tell him to look after roach if its not too late blood lights flashing it looked like a militia patrol crossing the intersection behind us and coming this way so i got into reverse and tucked in behind the support mans trabant the coloured lights began filling the mirror it should be noted that the wanted man is possibly wearing a militia uniform at this time id taken the fur hat off as soon as id got into the skoda but if a patrol took an interest in me and looked down through the window hed see the uniform but they couldnt be on to me yet oh yes they could theyve had quite enough time to shuddup and sweat it out you snivelling little bastard flashing lights filling the mirror and reflecting in the windows of die factory and the bus garage opposite colouring the night then it was passing us and i heard banging and a voice raised a muffled shouting a drunk perhaps trying to break out of the car giving the boys a hard time the support man waited until it was out of sight and then started up and wagged his tail a bit over the snow and found traction and took it away slewing into a side street and vanishing the car behind me hadnt moved was still standing a hundred yards away its lights in the mirror i reached across and put the window up on the passengers side and got into gear and left the back end to dig for traction with the chains and then got a grip and moved off going three blocks before i started playing with the gears and looking for patches of sand and using them for acceleration while the headlights fanned from side to side across walls and doorways and parked and stranded trucks cars and carts and the characteristic bric a brac of the dockland environment while the tracker fell behind for a minute or two before he saw i was onto him his own lights began swinging across and across the mirror as he went into a series of slides and then got a grip and lost it and found it again and started to close up a little i chose a side street where the snow had piled into a drift against the wall of a warehouse and used it to get me through the ninety degree arc letting the rear end hit the snow and kick the skoda straight again as i found traction in patches and put fifty yards behind me before the trackers lights came flooding into the narrow street and threw my shadow ahead of me against the snow it happens it happens sometimes the director in the field sets up a model deployment of his shadow executive and his support group and his contacts and couriers and whatever he needs for a given mission spinning his small and delicate network of resources and testing it out for strength and making changes where potential danger threatens sitting back in his inner sanctum plugged in to his communications system with its portable scrambler and its bug monitor and taking signals from the shadow out mere and relaying them through the mast at cheltenham to the signals board in whitehall the whole thing running like silk through a loom and then one man and one man alone can suddenly send the web shaking because hes made a mistake talked to the wrong people exposed a password missed the half seen face in a doorway or the figure humped at the wheel of a parked car or the broken hair across a drawer in the hotel room and the network becomes an alarm system and all we can do is shut down signals to prevent interception and get out of the safe house before its blown run for cover go to ground hole up somewhere as the smell of the smoke starts drifting through the field where the fuses have blown and someone reaches for the chalk in the signals room in london and writes it up on the board mission compromised clear all channels and stand by it was happening now the shadow of the skoda was flitting across the snow and the buildings ahead of me like a bat out of a nightmare as both vehicles swung and corrected and swung again over the treacherous surface there wasnt any question of pushing the speed to more than thirty or forty kph through streets like this with dead traffic all over the place parked or abandoned or stuck in a drift there was only a question of the leading cars ability to outstrip the one behind and it was already becoming clear that whatever the tracker was driving it was more potent under the bonnet than the skoda possibly a merc or a porsche or a mazda with tight suspension and a pinpoint steering system all i could hope to do was let him close in and then try to fox him with tricks i kept seeing roach a short man with bright blue eyes and a round pink face his fingers playing with each other as he transferred nervous tension his nails bitten to pieces id wondered about him when hed shown us into the safe house but ferris had told me he was totally reliable and had worked with him before he wasnt a mole roach he wasnt a changeling we dont have any people like that in the normal way of things because the bureau is conceivably the most elite intelligence organization in the western hemisphere officially non existent and responsible directly to the prime minister of the uk and there are as many traitors in our ranks as there are in the sas whose number is reputedly sub zero i didnt think roach was a traitor i thought hed made a mistake but in practical terms it didnt make a lot of difference meridian was in hazard dont think about roach think about survival the side street opened onto a major road and i touched the brakes trying to get as much deceleration out of the drums as possible before they locked but the speed wasnt coming down all that much and id have to do better than this because a truck was passing the end of the street and thered be other traffic on the move and i didnt want to splash this thing all over the side of a heavy duty haulage rig or anything else for that matter so i put the nearside front wheel into the deeper snow along the kerb and felt the drag and touched the brakes again but the surface was more or less pack ice and we span full circle and fetched up with the back end clouting a sand bin that was all right because it brought the speedwell down and the major road was fifty yards ahead and it didnt look as if i still had enough momentum going to hit anything out there but i was losing ground in terms of getting clear of that bastard and if i led him into the major road hed overhaul me without any trouble because his car was out of an elite sports stable of some kind and the skoda was made for taking the kids to school in comfort and running aunt gertrude home so i did the only thing that was available to me and sighted him in the mirror and swung the wheel and bounced the skoda against a drift and swung through a hundred and eighty degrees and gunned up and got smoke out of the rear tyres as they bit through the ice and reached solid tarmacadam and pushed the car back the way wed been coming part of the whole thing was going to depend on luck but i found enough steering to take the skoda through the gap between the other vehicle and the sand bin there was a lot of blinding light as we closed up and i think i heard a shout he hadnt been expecting this and i suppose it worried him we missed a total head on thing but the sand bin was solid and the skoda ricocheted to a certain extent and tore a door away from the other car and smashed quite i a lot of glass and i felt the sudden drag of deceleration and the skoda span half round and i saw the other car swinging much too wide and i much too fast and one of the wheels came spinning past me as his front stub axle sheared and he hit the wall of a building and bounced i back and then went into a slow roll with the engine screaming and the bright red of a flame popping from inside the engine compartment as a fuel line was torn apart and a spark from the ignition found the engine went on screaming until the fuel in the injectors gave out and then there was silence of a kind and when i hit my door open it raised an echo in the narrow confines of the street he was still inside the tracker sitting there like a crash test dummy with blood coming bright from a head wound seeping across his face black smoke was rolling from underneath the car as spilled engine oil took fire and i went for his seat belt but it had snapped at the buckle so that was what the head wound was all about i dragged him out of the car and across the snow and pushed him into the front of the skoda on the passengers side and got in and span the rear wheels to get the chains through the snow and finally got moving and started looking for cover as we drove any sort of cover where i could pull up and talk to this man i wanted information can you hear me he didnt answer just keeled over a bit that was all so that i had to push him upright again i had time now to realize that his head was a mess and by this time most of his face was covered in blood lights washed across the buildings from behind but thered be no traffic coming this way the burning car was on its side and blocking the street can you hear me nothing only the metallic smell of his blood filling the car the warehouse wed passed coming the other way had a wide entrance and i pulled in there cutting the engine and feeling for the carotid artery in the mans neck finding it and sensing shifting my fingers and trying again finding no pulse beat trying again watching his face seeing how pale it was now between the streaks of blood moving my hand inside his coat and sensing again over the heart shifting and sensing and finding nothing nothing at all there was mostly sand on the ground where theyd cleared the entrance way and i got him out as gently as i could and laid him on his back and held one hand behind his neck to tilt the head and put my mouth over his and began breathing for him his blood sticky on my face sticky and cold now dear jesus i wanted information out of this man lights again and a pick up truck rolled past the warehouse no chains the tyres crunching across the ruts as the driver slowed seeing the wreckage ahead of him along the street breathe one two three heel of the hand on the chest someone was running down the street boots clumping across the snow two people two youths their voices excited breathe one two three and press on the ribcage the sound of an engine the pick up truck reversing couldnt get through his mouth cold against mine the mans mouth two three come back you bastard i want to talk to you press on the chest his blood glutinous now and pulling at my mouth as it congealed i want information two three as the pick up truck went crawling past the entrance in reverse the smell of its exhaust gas on the air dont go yet you bastard i want to talk to you the back of his neck cold now under my hand his eyes open a pair of black buttoned boots behind his head standing there on the snow and i looked up at the old woman dumpy in her shawls her eyes staring down at us at our faces at the blood babushka i said go and phone get an ambulance babushka the black boots turned quickly scattering snow press on the ribcage and breathe two three but i believed now that i was wasting my time i would have liked to leave him there but they might have some basic resuscitation gear on the ambulance so i kept going using deeper breaths deeper and slower as he watched me two three as he watched me perhaps from a little distance puzzled by my efforts and already wishing not to be pulled back to it all by this busy stranger press on the ribcage until at last i heard the ambulance klaxon echoing between the buildings and felt for his wallet and found it and straightened up lowering his head gently and going down on my hands and knees like a dog at a water hole scooping up snow to wash the blood off my face and rinse the rich salt taste out of my mouth i went back to the skoda and got into motion and reached the end of the street and did a skid turn and gunned up through the gears as the ambulance arrived on the scene with the blare of its klaxon filling the night with alarm christmas night and silence i stood in shadow smelling the river smell ice drifted on the water breaking away upstream and floating down through the channels gouged by tugs and dredgers and coasters big enough to make headway the ice made soft xylophone music as the floes touched and bumped together i had left the skoda half a mile away buried under an iron roof that had slid at an angle when the walls of a shed had collapsed some time ago perhaps under the weight of snow to lie like a broken box in the thickets of weeds it was almost invisible the skoda but i had no illusions that was a hot car it had been under extensive surveillance ever since roach had blown his cover and got into it and picked up a tracker without knowing it im not blaming him support people dont get the training they give the shadow executives at the bureau though some of them apply for the higher echelons and graduate dark shapes moved as i watched a small high decked freighter with coal smoke curling behind it on the motionless air to lie in skeins along the water a truck on the far bank sliding among the wharves its diesel rattling nearer to where i stood nothing moved but i had no illusions about that either watchers keep still the motor vessel natasha lay in her berth some sixty or seventy yards distant from the stack of rusted freight containers that i was using for cover i needed to know if the natasha were being watched the sensible thing to have done would have been to phone ferris and ask him to send someone out with another car leave the skoda back there in the side street and take over whatever they brought me but the time for doing the sensible thing had run out now because meridian was compromised and the new car they brought me could be hot too the subject of undetected surveillance i would think that yermakov had been the only man tracking the skoda and that it was therefore safe to use for the moment it was still hot because it could be recognized later but it could only be by chance and that chance i was ready to take that was his name dmitri alexandrovich yermakov his wallet was still in my pocket i didnt think hed been the rogue agent loose in the field the surveillance of the skoda had been the work of a cell at least of a cell possibly of an organization it had needed at least two peeps to maintain the operation because that car had been watched for more than twelve hours from the time when roach had picked it up to the time when id driven it away from the patch of waste ground at two minutes past eight tonight a rogue agent would work alone it is their nature a night bird screeched and a ring of light flashed inside my skull and died out like a firework id seen cormorants earlier wheeling under the lights of a warehouse crane i had been here for twenty minutes and hadnt moved i too was a watcher and kept still there are good and bad among the ranks of the peeps some can stay silent for hours on end moving only by indiscernible degrees when they have to flexing the leg muscles to keep the blood flowing and the brain supplied turning their heads as slowly as the hands of a clock sweeping the environment continuously others less professionally trained cant go for long without needing to release tension and theyll shift their feet or yawn or cough or even stretch their arms and theyre blown night and silence who is here a rat ran squealing in the shadows and the light flashed again behind my eyes it didnt worry me it was reaction that was all i hadnt expected to get out of that place out of militia headquarters but i was only aware of that now the heat was off and the blood was cooling and looking back at the whole enterprise it seemed as if i must have been clean out of my gourd to have taken a risk that size i told you i said youd gone mad but you wouldnt listen nor will i ever you little shit you can get away with things in hot blood thatd never work if you thought about them ask any tightrope walker they never look down the broken ice rang like a peal of bells in the distance as a tug moved upstream towing a barge blacking out the lamps along the far shore and then relighting them but nothing was moving had moved closer than that i believed the natasha was clear and i broke cover and walked across the snow covered boards of the quay the gangplank had been cleared by whatever support man had brought the provisions here for me and he hadnt found it an easy choice to leave evidence that the hulk was in some kind of use or to leave me to make footprints on the snow and testify to the very same thing i dropped onto the deck and stood there watching and listening again the cabin had been wrecked and there was no door just a hole through smashed timbers i would have thought a crane had toppled or the boom had run its brake discs coming down on the cabin snow had drifted inside the wreckage its minuscule facets diamond blue under the light of the moon something splashed into the water and i swung my head and saw ripples crossing the surface some distance away near the third vessel downriver a sailing boat with the mast lying like a dead tree across the quayside yellow light came from its dark hulk burning steadily and i turned my head away watchers do not burn lamps to mark their presence nor throw garbage out the support man had dropped a rope mat over the snow where the lower part of the steps was still solid and i went down into the smell of rotting timber and rope and lamp oil ducking my head under abeam and seeing the glow of a night light showing the way to the stairs down to the lower berths i stood listening again hearing nothing but the slap of water against the vessels beam the light grew stronger as i went below there was a brass hurricane lamp burning with a good flame on the table of the main cabin below deck with supplies stacked around it black bread cheeses canned milk dried fruit half a dozen military issue cans of self heating soup a plum cake and i felt a moment of warmth for ferris all hed been able to scrounge in the way of a safe house for me was a rotting hulk among the ice floes but hed told the support man to raid the black market for what he could find to make it look like christmas on this unholy night i could still taste that mans blood in my mouth and i got the little black iron kettle and filled it and put it onto the butane stove for warm water to wash with and brush my teeth we are not here to stint ourselves my good friend its christmas remember and have you ever tried to clean your teeth by biting on bloody icicles on my watch and i did only the necessary getting out of the uniform and putting on warm sweaters and sheepskin boots there were no rats here but they wouldnt be long in coming once they caught the scent of human habitation i stowed all the vulnerable food packages in the cupboard with the torn poster on the door girl in a fur hat and slacks and fur boots to the knee i think it says a lot for a country where the women can look sexy in the depth of winter without a single bikini in sight i turned down the wick of the lamp and looked around for a bit of rope and took the militia uniform and boots on deck burying the standard issue malysh little boy automatic pistol inside the clothes and weighting the whole bundle with a rock id marked down when id crossed from the skoda to the ship then i crouched at the quayside watching the bubbles break surface under the light of the moon at signalled ferris location the harbour light id taken fifteen minutes to check the environment when id arrived here but it was simply an exercise in security any danger would come from inside the bar have you met rusakov ferris asked me not yet ive just got here then i said theres a man gone dmitri alexandrovich yermakov he was tracking me i told him what had happened hes down as a pipe fitter on his papers he couldnt have been operating solo id say he was in the podpolia two men came from the quay hands buried in the pockets of their padded coats boots clumping across the snow im surprised youre still there i told ferris im taking all precautions the two men hit the door of the bar open and bundled in this phone booth was outside at the end of the wall where the door was there werent any windows on this side taking all precautions well all right but god knew where roach had picked up that tracker it could have been outside the hotel karasevo where ferris was i didnt want him blown from under me we lost roach i heard him saying merde i thought we might have i said they trapped him and there was a shoot out those shifting eyes yes and the nervous fingers trigger sensitive we dont often get a shoot out because weaponry isnt normally part of our stock in trade we prefer silence and shadow the soft shoe retreat but roach would have carried a gun yes i could believe that had spent his life looking over his shoulder had found sleep difficult until now as long as you think youre safe there i told ferris meaning for christs sake dont blow the nerve centre for meridian and wishing instantly i hadnt said it because when the executive starts worrying about the safety of his director in the field it can only mean hes starting to feel mission pressure relax ferris said quietly on the line did i say something not really someone had used his finger across the grime on the glass panel of the booth fuck yeltsin many kind thanks i said to ferris for the plum cake nothing too good i made the effort and asked where is tanya rusakova it had taken an effort because i was worried about her too didnt want to hear him say wed lost her again relax yes ive put her in a room on the same floor here only three doors along two people on watch hed heard the effort id had to make he hears everything ferris if the lines good enough he can hear you taking too deep a breath to quiet the nerves he can hear goose flesh rising under your sleeve i need to talk to her i told him i know shes waiting here now hed known id have to debrief tanya before i talked to her brother to find out what shed said in militia headquarters what his situation was now and ferris had brought her into his room to wait for my call saving a few minutes delay as i stood here in a telephone booth with glass panels and no identification papers on me that i could show anyone now that is direction in the field hello her voice soft her green eyes shimmering behind the notice that said you didnt have to put coins into the receptacle when summoning the fire brigade ambulance or militia are you comfortable we say strange things when not knowing what to say yes and filled with remorse and gratitude been rehearsing ittanya i said what did you tell the militia as briefly as you can just the essentials she went straight into it had been briefed by ferris they asked me why i had come to novosibirsk and i told them it was to see my brother as i always did when i had leave i knew they would telephone moscow to ask about me and would find i had a brother here i said i met general velichko by chance on the rossiya and he proposed an assignation when we arrived in the city he seemed quite a gentleman and said he would like to please me by arranging early promotion for my brother she was surprising me tanya rusakova it would have taken courage in that interrogation cell at militia headquarters to admit that shed made plans to meet a man who was later shot dead against a wall but shed had no choice she couldnt have explained otherwise why shed booked in at the hotel vladekino and then left there soon afterwards under the eyes of the concierge i told them that when i met general velichko at the appointed place i was shocked and horrified to see a man force him from his car and shoot him down i ran away terrified but the man caught up with me and threw me into another car where i was blindfolded he took me to a house and kept me there of course i realized he was protecting himself id seen what he had done and could recognize him again i was listening with much attention shed taken things right to the brink because shed known shed have to shed invented the simplest way to explain her known movements on that night are you still there yes i said go on i told them that the man had kept me tied to a bed all night but the next morning when he was away from the house i managed to escape and then when i was safe again in the street i was stopped by a militiaman and arrested because of my papers there was silence on the line so i said and they asked you to give a description of the assassin of course i said he was short but very strong with greying hair and a scar underneath his left ear he spoke with an estonian accent and they tried to break your story but yes they tried very hard and hadnt succeeded because for a few days it would have remained unbreakable until theyd taken their investigations to the point where they could destroy it word for word and get to the truth did you bear any kind of grudge against general gennadi velichko were you aware that he was the head of the regional state security office in krasnogvardeiskaya at the time when your father boris vladimir rusakov was rumoured to have been executed without formality didnt you in fact request five days immediate leave on medical grounds due to uterine cramps at the time when general velichko was about to visit novosibirsk i didnt know what exact questions would have been asked but that would have been their tenor and she wouldnt have had any answers that would have kept her out of the penal servitude camps for life on a charge of being an accessary to premeditated murder you did well tanya i said i wanted very much to keep your name out of it all im indebted to you no but perhaps it made up a little made up for her leaving the safe house and getting herself arrested of course tanya stay near the phone for twenty minutes the door of the bar swung open and crashed back against the wall and a man came out with his hands covering his head two others after him and catching him up landing a kick and sending him sprawling setting on him as he lay on the ground fucking jew you come here again and you ii finish up in the river cock sucking jew boy the pamyat brigade goodbye stalin hello hitler le plus ca change so forth when shall i see you again tanya asked me i dont really know i said shed turned over sometimes during the morning at the safe house and lain with her face against me not moving away moving closer she didnt wear perfume but i remembered her scent as soon as i can manage i told her put our friend back on the line would you the two men were crunching across the snow towards the bar one of them with blood on his wrist when ferris came on the line i just told him that if rusakov was in the bar id call back in twenty minutes and let him talk to his sister for a moment ive got to have his trust and her voice will give him proof that ive got her into safe hands well stand by for you ferris said and then ive been doing a bit of research by the way on your rogue agent there was a man in the ministry of defence called talyzin who spoke out rather too loudly against some of the die hard generals and they put him into a psychiatric ward when no one was looking after six months he escaped and from raw intelligence data going into london he might be your agent why three reasons its believed he came out of the psychiatric ward with some of his marbles gone two of the generals who put him in there were kovalenko and chudin and hed served hi afghanistan as a mine sweeping engineer knows explosives yes another case of revenge then if he blew that train up attempted revenge weve had reports of hundreds like that following the coup old scores to be settled theyre still working on it forme in london and if i get anything more ill pass it on that name again talyzin yes he spelled it forme then control has also been in signals with me asking for a progress report bloody croder so what did you give him there was nothing there was nothing to give control i just said that progress is being made its the stock diplomatic answer the director in the field some times uses when london asks whats happening and theres nothing positive to offer the shadow can be crawling on his stomach out of a wrecked support car with his clothes on fire and the host countrys security forces moving in on him with war trained dobermans and if control wants a report hell be told that progress is being made if only by the fact that the poor bloody ferret has managed to crawl another six inches with his smashed leg as the heat of the flames reaches his skull and his brain begins going into short circuit as a prelude to the big goodbye i dont mean to dramatize but that is exactly what happened to siddons when he bought it in beirut while his dif was reporting progress to that bastard loman in london compared with which of course my situation was decidedly cushy i was only holed up in a phone booth in siberia watching that poor bugger out there struggling to get up before he froze to death but all the same i didnt take kindly to croder chief of bloody signals asking for a progress report from a director in the field who was notorious for refusing to call up london when there was nothing to tell them believing it quite rightly to be a waste of time may he get the pox i told ferris and shut down the signal and dialled the ambulance service and told them there was a man outside the harbour light bar on the west bank of the ob needing attention then i forced open the door of the booth against the rust on the hinges and went across to the jew and helped him onto his feet and told him there was an ambulance coming with any luck pulled open the door of the place and got hit by the reek of black tobacco smoke and straight spirits and human sweat the air hot against my face after the freezing temperature outside when my eyes adjusted to the smoke haze i saw a man sitting alone in a corner on the far side of the room from the bar a pair of gloves on the table different shades of brown he saw me come in but i looked past him and went over to the end of the long teakwood counter and ordered a vodka straight up pulling out a stool and settling down to check everybody in the place one by one i took fifteen minutes not hurrying because i didnt know captain vadim rusakov any better than he knew me and even though hed shot that general down he could still be working undercover for the podpolia or pamyat the extreme nationalist right and could have brought people in here to look me over or he could have picked up ticks in the army barracks and brought them here without knowing it and i just wanted to talk to him alone wasnt in the mood for a party bloody london rusakov was the only hope id got of putting meridian back on track and bringing it home but he might know nothing nothing at all six or seven tarts two of them chinese they brought them here regularly from beijing and vladivostok on the rossiya one of the taxi drivers had told me the other women were jealous of them of their slight and flawless looks blowing smoke over them from their lipstick reddened cigarettes to loud laughter from the men a huddle of russian naval officers round an illegal crap game three sailors drinking themselves under a table near the door one of them with a trouser leg soaked a lone militiaman in uniform too far gone to be on duty unless someone had slipped him a mickey for a giggle two dogs one of them with a broken leg snuffling and tearing at something unholy under one of the tables i poured the shot of vodka down the leg of the bar stool and put the glass back on the counter and left the change and made my way close to the walls until i came up on the table where the odd gloves were lying and pulled out the chair opposite captain rusakov and sat down and saw the chalk moving across the board for meridian in the basement in whitehall executive reports possible breakthrough is now in contact with valuable informer not really theres just a chance thats all the last weve got but remember were making progress vadim i saw you come in rusakov said some time ago why didnt you come straight over here you get served quicker at the bar he gave a slow blink perhaps of patience then went on watching me with a gaze as steady as a beam of light he had green eyes like his sister but you didnt notice that so much as the concentration in them hed be good at interrogation rusakov may have done a bit of that where is tanya he asked me want to talk to her his eyes lit yes i took him outside and along to the phone booth and dialled the number for the hotel karasevo with my back to rusakov and got ferris on the line and asked for tanya then i waited outside the booth watching the lights of the ambulance dimming in the distance through the river fog ferris allowed them a minute or not much more he would have briefed her not to tell her brother where she was since it was the nerve centre for meridian and the longer she spoke to him the more easily she might let something slip when he came out of the booth rusakov stood in front of me with his feet together advanced one pace gave me a bear hug retreated one pace and stood at ease you gave her freedom he said i cannot express my gratitude hed put on a seamans clothes as id asked him to but there was no disguising captain vadim rusakov of the russian army shell be all right i said shes in good hands we walked back to the bar she wouldnt tell me where she is no that wouldnt be a good thing the line could have been bugged you see then you will tell me id rather you didnt ask shes safe there thats all you need to know and it shouldnt be all that long before you can see her i gave it a beat it depends on how much youre willing to help me he pulled open the door of the bar and stood back boots neatly together as much as i am able of course but there was a note of wariness in it he didnt like my not trusting him with his sisters location didnt like to think she was in a place where the lines might be bugged back at the table we ordered bowls of gruel and some bread and i listened to rusakov until it arrived because i wanted as much of his background as i could get without asking questions and his attitudes towards the present day regime in russia but first he had to unload some of his guilt i should never have involved her in such a thing she alerted me that he was coming to novosibirsk fine i should have taken the matter from there and told her to remain in moscow it wouldnt have been easy i said to get that man to an appointed place without tanyas help and to have him identified on the spot i should have thought of another way one of the dogs let out a yelp been kicked i suppose she wanted to be there vadim she had a lot of rage in her he levelled his gaze at me for a moment i didnt think of that theyre not meant to have any rage are they it might frighten the males of the species but its there all right he talked about his father showed me the photograph of a man in a badly fitting black suit some kind of decoration in the lapel the same penetrating gaze aimed at the camera no smile he was an individualist so they shot him i am an individualist but no one will be shooting me because i now live in the society for whose ideals he gave his life it wasnt the first time hed said that hed rehearsed it until hed got it right perhaps because he knew his father would have approved of the formality there was more room for pride now in vadim rusakovs heart since hed spent his rage in the rattle of shot last night when general gennadi velichko had slid onto the snow with his back leaving streaks of blood on the wall behind him this new society i asked rusakov when the food arrived is it going smoothly here in novosibirsk he looked surprised then said of course you only arrived here yesterday yes the new society is going smoothly on the surface a few growls here and there a few complaints but no food riots no looting of shops no angry mobs yelling outside the government offices he lined up the yellow plastic salt cellar with the bottle of sauce doing it carefully but under the surface there is a great deal of tension you know among the people and among the soldiers among the soldiers the tension is deeper since soldiers are not allowed to think but it is there his eyes suddenly on mine there have been cases of unexplained deaths i have investigated some of them the dead were all devoted democrats rabid one could say sick and fed up with the way the army has gone down and down under the communists until drugs drunkenness and desertions have become the order of the day reflecting the awareness of the military that theyve lost the respect of the people in the streetsspreading one hand of course the new democracy has brought new problems the army is now forced to grow its own vegetables and milk its own goats since food is scarce these deaths i said whos doing the killing you cannot guess the podpolia but of course the podpolia he lowered his voice there are the two factions at my barracks just as there are in the streets those who are ready to tighten their belts and support yeltsin and his programme and the core of die hard communists who want the old order back how strong are they they are not strong in numbers but they are there working in secrecy id got enough background and broke some bread and started on the gruel it was still hot salty and had a flavour i didnt recognize didnt particularly like dogs were at a premium this winter in novosibirsk if they had any flesh on them i avoided the lumps of meatvadim i said your sister told the militia only that she came to novosibirsk to see you as she always does when she gets leave they cant ask her any more questions now but theyll be pushing on with their enquiries especially in moscow they hadnt known when she was at their headquarters that her father and your father was ordered shot by general velichko four years ago or they certainly wouldnt have released her at my request as soon as at your request he said slowly his eyes boring into me you have the power to request such a thing from the militia i broke more bread leaving the gruel i havent the power to request anything of anyone but i wanted your sister out of there so i had to devise the means my next concern is yourself as soon as they dig up the information that you and tanya bore a grudge against general velichko theyll ask the army to arrest you and hand you over this could happen when you go back to your unit the military police may well be waiting for you outside your quarters his eyes deepened hardened i see then he said and tanya i liked him for that shes in the safest possible hands dont let it worry you i assumed i could say that for the moment but someone had killed roach the support man and roach might have gone too close to the hotel karasevo nerve centre for meridian and at any given time ferris himself its director in the field could need a safe house and urgently it might have happened before in the annals of the bureau that the dif of some mission had got blown but its never happened when ive been in the field the dif is sacrosanct untouchable he has to be he holds the lifeline for his executive you are in rusakov was saying some kind of he spread his hand intelligence branch the mps not the mps i operate pretty well on my own and you should know that if you find yourself in trouble ive no authority of any kind to pull you out of it i looked across at the door of the bar as a man came in you should also know vadim that at this moment im the subject of an intense manhunt by the militia the police and the kgb or the mps as were now meant to call them his eyes deepened again id seen the same thing in tanya so he said with a brief nod the man looked all right merchant seamans rig and cap bundling across to the bar freezing desperate for a rum grog i looked at rusakov again i think i told youdidnt i that i saw your action of last night as a matter of summary justice when tanya told me what velichko had done to you both i was kneading a small piece of the dark heavy bread moulding it into a disc with a point on each side like a spinning top your quarrel i said was with general velichko and not can i assume with the other two generals chudin and kovalenko but do you happen to know if theyre still here in novosibirsk i felt time slowing down how long have we got id asked ferris in that rat infested shed where wed made our rendezvous have i got any kind of a deadline hed thought it out taken his time yes we have a deadline its zero the generals had been zymyanins target for information that was what hed told me before he was killed theyd arrived in novosibirsk and gone to ground and we had to find them take up from where zymyanin had left off that was still the focus of meridian zymyanin had believed that the generals had information of a kind that would trigger the alarm bells throughout the intelligence organizations of both hemispheres we needed that information we dont know ferris that they might not have already finished what they came here to do they could be leavingnovosibirsk tomorrow morning or tonight they might have gone by now and i waited to hear rusakov say precisely that he didnt general chudin and general kovalenko are at present the guests of my commanding officer i span my little top and watched meridian start running again oh really i said the official guests no not official but its known to all ranks that theyre at the camp it would be difficult to conceal it rumours are the lifeblood of the barracks but nothing official has been posted in daily routine orders or anywhere else youve seen them the generals only once and at a distance crossing from a staff car to their quarters i picked up the little top again and span it have you any plans to wipe those two out as well vadim his head came up in surprise why should i i wondered if they were party to velichkos orders to have your father shot no it was velichkos personal order i know the facts had been rooting for those facts for four years perhaps until he was sure then hed asked tanya to keep watch on velichko as best she could in moscowdo you know i asked him why those two generals are visiting your co he himself is in the podpolia has he got any power in surprise he is the commanding officer put it this way if he tried to bring the whole battalion into the podpolia what would happen there would be mutiny he is known to belong to the hardline communists but he darent come out into the open that is why the visit of the two generals is not being publicized theres a security guard around their quarters yes we doubled it after a man was seen watching the area with field glasses from a car outside the camp when was this soon after the generals arrived the observer drove away before he could be challenged did he really now i put some money onto the table vadim ive got to make a telephone call you want to wait here i will leave with you we pushed our chairs back and rusakov said thank you for the he gestured towards the table for the dog soup my pleasure he was at the door first holding it open for me and the black freezing air hit us in a wave as we went outside wheres your car vadim over there the army jeep i will wait for you i felt a lift of relief when ferris picked up the phone at his end which wasnt reassuring if theres one thing the executive in the field has to count on its that his director is always at the other end of the telephone inviolate but the roach thing had changed that bit of debriefing i told him good he didnt give it a cheerful tone nothing hearty id havekilled him for that and he knew it he wasnt expecting any kind of breakthrough at this stage of the mission there was too much stacked up against us with the executive on the run and a wreck on the river for a safe house but at least there was this the two remaining generals i said are still in novosibirsk theyre guests of the co of the russian army unit unofficially and under special protection i filled him in with the details this is quite good ferris said when id finished in point of fact yes wed caught up with the objective for meridian which was the information buried in the heads of those two men the problem was that they were behind the wire fence and the sentries of a fully manned and equipped army battalion no real case for dancing in the streets when london received ferriss signal rusakov i said is now an ally i would think so im going to get him to keep the generals under observation while theyre in camp hes got men he can trust so ill need you to move your best support man into the immediate field as close as you can to the safe house i could see rusakov through the grime of the glass panels sitting at the wheel of his jeep he could be useful to us useful in the extreme but he was a stranger not of the bureau untrained and unpredictable i was quite sure hed do very nearly anything i asked him to do because of tanya but simple gratitude doesnt have the high tensile strength that underlies our neurotic devotion to the sacred bull and the more reliance i put on captain vadim rusakov the more dangerous it would be how far can we trust your captain i heard ferris asking it wasnt telepathy we both knew the risk of using strangers i dont know him well enough to answer that all i can do is be careful how close can you get your support man to the safe house five kilometres ferris said he had the map in front of him with a secure telephone yes he gave me the number all right and ill need a mobile radio link noted and a map showing the location of the army camp when he approaches he should whistle the fifth then i asked ferris hadnt meant to how are things your end you worry too much right you do not ask your director in the field how things are with him he must be seen at all times to be as secure in his sanctum as is the oracle in delphi i wouldnt have asked him perhaps if tanya werent also there he would know that ferris knows everything we shut down the signal and i forced the door of the booth back and went across to the jeep and got in vadim would you be able to keep the generals under covert observation while theyre in camp use some of your men that would be quite easy their quarters are in a separate building from the barracks then i want you to do that look we need to write things down is there here he reached across the seat and got a clipboard from the rear of the car and pulled the pencil out of its slot i gave him the phone number id got from ferris and told him to write it down vadim that number is classified understand that he looked at me in the glow of light from the dashboard i understand you may trust me do you know that he waited of course its just that if you found yourself forced at some time to answer questions it might be difficult you may trust me in any circumstances his eyes held mine fair enough so look if you find anything to report to me on the generals phone that number and give your name hell be our liaison your name is also classified so dont worry i want to know whenever those people make a move when they leave camp i want to know where they go can you have them tracked rusakov thought about that stroking a circle on the lined yellow clipboard sheet with his finger muster all ranks b platoon hrs for kit inspection had been written across the top then crossed out it might be difficult he said at last to send out a vehicle at short notice id have to submit an order for it beforehand and give the destination and purpose except in an emergency of course but it would be difficult again to claim an emergency at a time when the generals were initiating transit yes blow the whole thing then see what information you can get hold of before they leave camp see if you can get their destination from the transport section that would be easier yes two men came out of the harbour light slamming the door behind them one of them bent over laughing the other one taking a leak against the wall steam clouding up in the lamplight all right i said to rusakov ill leave it to you anything you can do to get me information will be a blow against the podpolia but youll have to keep in mind the fact that sooner or later the militias going to ask the army for your arrest i looked at him in the glow of the dashboard have you any kind of bolt hole you can go to in the town he thought about that too yes where he looked down the house of a friend shed be ready to shelter you keep you hidden he was silent ive got to know i told him because i want to keep in contact he looked up again she would help me yes he wrote on the pad and tore a strip of it off and gave it to me her name is raisa the two men were lurching across the snow to a pick up truck with a mast lying across the rear a furled sail round it the domed glass of the lamp at its head caught the light from the bar a ruby eye in the fog creeping from the river i put the strip of paper away is there a fellow officer i asked rusakov or one of the men under you who has your absolute trust yes this time he hadnt had to think about it a master sergeant all right if you cant avoid arrest can he take your place make contact with me in a moment i will ask him youre not sure hell i will ask him as a formality but he will do it name bakatin master sergeant bakatin then but i must tell you rusakov said his eyes suddenly on mine i shall resist arrest i shall resist very strongly of course you put an apparatchik thug out of the way no earthly reason to suffer for it i took my glove off and offered my hand keep in touch then i put the skoda in the same place as before under the cover of the fallen roof of the shed and walked the half mile to the river taking time to check the environment and going aboard the hulk just after half past eleven with the moon floating above the dark skeletonic arm of a grain elevator downriver the starboard bow of the natasha had been stove in when shed been wrecked and i spent an hour shifting loose timber stacking it against the bulkheads to form a tunnel that ran aft from the entrance to the cabin below deck and led to the smashed hatchway at the stern rats ran in the beam of the flashlight they couldnt get at the provisions but theyd scented them and moved in to reconnoitre when the tunnel was finished i tested it out checking for loose boards that might make a noise leaving the flashlight in the cabin and feeling my way through the dark towards the hatch at the stern i didnt think id need an escape route to deck level because ferris would have tightened the whole support network after roach had been blown but these were confined quarters and if anyone came down here with a gun i wouldnt have any answer except to get out before he could use it its just a touch of the usual paranoia thats all get out of my bloody life i went through the escape tunnel half a dozen times in the dark to get used to it the feel of the timbers and the lie of the ground the smell of rope in the chain locker and the crack of light between the boards just below the deck where a lamp on the shore made a gleam establishing my bearings making the journey twice as fast and in more silence the last time through heating some water and washing i tried to feel that meridian had got back on track tonight the generals were still hi novosibirsk and i had their exact location and it looked as if we could rely on rusakov at least to signal a warning when they made a move and that was about as good as i could expect at this stage of the mission i dont know if id managed to convince myself about this but it didnt really matter because it was less than an hour later when i heard the first four notes of beethovens fifth symphony come whistling softly through the dark and the support man came below deck with the radio for me and said he couldnt raise ferris any more on the telephone the night porter at the hotel karasevo said that room was empty now rogue he stood there watching me frome hed said his name was the wavering light of the candle moving the shadows across his face its reflection in his eyes two pale flames his breath clouding on the air floating ice colliding with the stem of the hulk rang in the silence and the woman i asked him rusakova shes gone too he watched me hands in bus drivers gauntlets hanging at his sides moisture glistening on his fur hat where hed caught it i suppose when hed ducked down through the hole in the timbers up there bringing away snow and all measures are being taken i said a statement not a question something to say while i thought things out of course all measures were being taken to find the dif at least find his tracks i felt like an astronaut this is the nearest i can get to the idea of what its like losing one end of his life line when hes out there on a space walk floating away did he leave anything in his room i asked frome i dont know what about her did she leave anything i dont know he said again then what the bloody hell do you know ice clinked out there on the river he watched me frome the two pale flames in his eyes sorry i said thats okay i mean theres not much to know see i tried phoning him several times and the switchboard said he couldnt be in his room so i went round there and checked found his door unlocked and the room empty same as hers on the same floor no signs none i could see i took a good toilet things still there so were scrambler gone yes and the bug sniffer it didnt mean much if anyone had got in there and managed to take ferris theyd have taken those things as well they werent cheap and youd never find any more like that in russia bitch isnt it i heard frome say what yes he was still standing there you want to sit down no i dont like leaving the car out there too long bit of a giveaway try the walkie i picked up the unit and switched it on and moved the dial off the squelch and pressed call and said meridian a couple of times and got a response from support base executive i saidtwo numbers for you rusakovs at the camp and his woman friends in the town if rusakov cant signal a man named bakatin might come through replacing him any news of ferris hed know that no ill raise you if he calls the minute he calls remembering to hope scratching around for straws they all were frame was i was any straw of comfort we could find all right yes thats putting it a fraction too dramatically about the astronaut thing i mean that poor bastards going to finish up somewhere on the far side of pluto one day with his super trained athletic body shrivelled inside its metal alloy shell and his wife remarried and his kids middle aged and when one of us poor bloody ferrets loses his dif he loses his life line in a way but its not that bad we can go on foraging for ourselves get home with our heads still on if were lucky its just that when the missions running hot we tend to get a bit edgy and the last thing we want to hear is that were cut off from our director and hence from london control make a note we should perhaps make a note here should we not my good friend to get it put into the training manuals at norfolk do not learn to regard the director in the field as your bloody mother ill need your radio manned i said into the unit round the clock yes sir understood i shut down the signal and looked at frome mind your head when you go back up there i should have got used to the broken bells by now but as the dark body of the river moved under its scales of ice the sound kept sleep away for a time and then i lay drifting at last the current turning me and turning me back as i kept the fur of the dead cat close against my face using it as camouflage to deceive the men who were waiting there along the bank with their guns swinging as they moved watching for the target for me on the surface of the river but that must be a dream perhaps of an earlier mission im always having them they never leave us ive talked about it to others in the caff and now the feeling of movement across the scalp the delicate exploratory scratching and then the fust nibble with the small sharp teeth rooting more boldly among the hair oh jesus christ and i swung up an arm and felt the soft warm body before it vanished into the shadows not a dream this time no and i got up and found a length of timber and lay down again with one end of it under my hand waiting but drifting down again after a while down into the lulling silence of the delta waves before i felt it again this time on my foot and i hit out with the bit of timber and felt a splashing across my cheek and hit out again and then sat up and saw it lying there big as a boot its blood pooling across the boards in the candlelight some of it on my face it was gone four oclock in the morning when i woke next time swathed in the extra blankets with a hole for breathing through i hadnt felt them again perhaps theyd recognized the scream that thing had given for what it was had heard death in it and kept their distance i impressed future time on the subconscious and it woke me accurately at seven an hour before first light for my breakfast turtle soup from one of the self heating cans with two hard boiled eggs and a slice of that christmas cake twas the season if not to be jolly to indulge the appetite on the sound and ingrained principle that i didnt know when i would eat again then i opened the map frome had brought me and spread it out in the candlelight walking my fingers around the wooded area where the army camp took up three quarters of a square kilometre it was served by two minor roads that joined and made a fork three kilometres from the main gates of the camp then i folded the map and picked up the radio unit and left the hulk and put meridian into extreme and imminent hazard because i had no choice the crackle of gunfire came again and the rooks took off from the poplars that laced the eastern horizon wheeling and cawing the rifle range was out of sight from here below a fold in the ground and the sound of the guns was muffled echoing from the long corrugated iron huts that formed most of the camp the new day was frozen as the days before had been the earth invisible under the snow the bare trees standing in a black iron frieze across the hill to the south the air was motionless its cold clamped to my face as i studied the landscape from beside the car gunfire again its echoes mimicking he could have been anyone the man theyd seen watching the camp from his car but i thought i knew who he was and if hed been there yesterday he would be there today hed driven away before he could be challenged but he would have come back must have come back standing off at a greater distance now finding cover in the trees theyd nothing to fear from him the soldiers in the camp they were an armed battalion they wouldnt have sent out scouts to hunt for him theyd been curious that was all he could have been anyone but i thought he was the rogue agent in the field talyzin if ferris were right there was a man in the ministry of defence called talyzin who spoke out rather too loudly against the generals from raw intelligence data going into london he might be your agent id sensed his presence in the environment ever since the rossiya had been blown up had thought id seen him once getting clear of the militia blocks at the scene of the wreck as i had i didnt think hed had anything to do with the death of roach hed had no motive and i didnt think hed had anything to do with the surveillance on the skoda that had brought that man yermakov on my track may he rest in peace but i thought he might have set that bomb the rogue agent and if so his motive would obviously have been to wipe out the three generals and their entourage because it doesnt take high explosive to destroy life force in a single human being velichko say you can do it with one bullet as rusakov had done so if it was the rogue agent who had set that bomb then he would still be locked onto his private personal mission the death of the two generals who were still pursuing their own operation in novosibirsk pursuing it just over there in point of fact behind the wire fence of die camp so i would expect him to be here the agent somewhere in the immediate environment observing the generals perhaps that mar on the hill between the trees sitting in the car hed been there before i arrived or i would have seen him drive up he would have had to use the further road branching from the fork and i could see its whole length from the fork to the hill the minor road didnt go up the hill only around it but he was nevertheless on higher ground there with a good view of the camp he was also in rather good cover buried among the trees and i wouldnt have known he was there if i hadnt been looking for him hadnt caught the glint on the windows of the car as the strengthening light of the day came creeping across the land from the east a crackle of gunfire stitching the silence id etched the configuration of his car by now on the visual memory and if it changed i would detect it at once if for instance he opened one of its doors on this side i would have put the distance between us at close to half a kilometre but could see that he was sitting in the front of the car because his dark coat altered the reflective value of the window glass the distance from his car to the nearest line of huts in the camp was more like a kilometre and a half so that hed have to be using at least a pair of x s to pick up anything useful he could have been must have been there all night unless he had anyone in support which i didnt believe a rogue is a rogue and works solo they re a breed apart often neurotic occasionally psychopathological you cant ever trust them even if you can persuade them into working with you with your cell or your network you cant turn your back on them theyll slip a knife in if it suits them sometimes for kicks ask that bastard loman hed been running fairfax through tigerfish in the south china sea when that executive had been found floating among the off shore trash in saigon and it hadnt taken the bureau five minutes to find out that fairfax had been using a rogue agent who knew the area and that the said rogue agent had decided to take a hundred per cent of the credit for the successful completion of the mission and the only way to do that was by putting a bullet into the executives brain and dropping him off a pier a glint came from the trees on the hill this time in motion brightening and dimming out i hadnt seen that before it was difficult at this distance to understand what that glint had meant it wasnt the degree by degree passage of the morning light reflecting from the windows of the car up there it was smaller the glint more focused and then i got it because when it moved again i saw it had a twin i couldnt see his eyes but i knew they were on me now pressed to the x s crackle of gunfire and this time the nerves reacted a little goose flesh under the sleeves the sudden contact that only the eyes can make at a distance between two creatures is intimate and dramatic when that incredible girl looked up remember from halfway across the crowded room and saw you watching her there was a rush of hormones wasnt there as the glands kicked in it was like swallowing all the perfumes of araby in one gulp i know the feeling but that wasnt the feeling i had now as i sat in the car among these alien snows and kept still perfectly still submitting to a hostile scrutiny i couldnt escape it wasnt unexpected id known that if the man with the field glasses were watching the camp again today he would also make frequent checks on his environment and my cover wasnt as good as his there were no trees here and all id been able to do was squeeze the skoda in between the ruined hulk of a barn and the dry stone wall that ran past it not even cover call it camouflage it wasnt unexpected but there was engagement now contact had been made at a distance between these two creatures out here under the early morning sky and the scene had changed he wouldnt just leave things like this the agent up there among the trees he wouldnt want to be watched he would need to make a move but it wouldnt be like yesterdays because yesterday he would have had a whole battalion to contend with if hed stayed his ground and today there was only one man he would be a violent antagonist if he chose to confront me that would be his nature he was a rogue and he would be armed their lives in the field are short but theyd be shorter still without the advantage of weapons id known this when id left the natasha an hour ago and put the mission into hazard but id had no choice i still didnt know whether i had any chance at all of monitoring the movements of the generals and infiltrating whatever operation it was they were running but i knew at least that id never be able to do it if a rogue agent were in the field and moving ahead of me with the intention of finishing what hed started on that train of killing them off listen zymyanin had said as the corridor of the train had rocked under our feet this is all i can tell you for now the bureau should do everything everything to keep those people under surveillance that was why i was here this morning with the ice caking the windows and the rasping of the digital clock on its worn bearings stressing the silence inside the car to reach the objective for meridian if i could and get the information to london id lost my director in the field but id set up a close support base with communications and liaison for rusakov but it would all be useless if i let that man on the hill take over the action id found him now i had to stop him get him out of the picture he was here to follow the generals when they left camp and in this we had the same purpose but i believed it would end there he had their death in mind and when hed followed them far enough from the camp to do the thing without bringing all hell on his head then he would do it or it could be a suicide run he was here for and the moment the generals left camp through those gates across there hed move down from the hill and intercept and pump a volley of dum dums into them as the alarm was sounded and the first of the armoured cars was started up and sent in pursuit he wouldnt get far and he would know that but a suicide run would fit quite well into the thinking process of a typical rogue agent and he could be one of the psychopaths capable for instance of bombing a crowded train with no thought for the women and children and if that was his plan the hail of dum dums would not only obliterate the generals it would blow meridian into christendom he was still watching me the field glasses hadnt moved since id seen them lock onto the image of the skoda gunfire echoing from the huts i kept still watching the twin glint from among the trees staring him out he would have plans for me too now that hed seen me it had been the major calculated risk id had to take if he were here to wipe out the generals with a burst of fire he would do the same with me immediately afterwards because id present a threat at the least i would be a witness to his act of assassination and at most i might intercept him when he left the hill and block his run leave him set up for the armoured cars but perhaps he wouldnt wait for that perhaps he would deal with me first soon get me out of the way as a spider moves onto the web and removes a foreign object that has fallen there and then goes back into cover to wait for the fly that was the risk but it was calculated its the only kind ill take and i had options perhaps for instance i could talk to him he was still watching me so i started the engine he hadnt swung the field glasses away was still wondering who i was and what i was doing here i wanted him to see me move off so that he could follow me with the glasses know that i was coming i didnt want to surprise him he might react and lethally i had to approach him overtly he knew that i knew he was watching me i wouldnt be some honest burgher out here to admire the view because all the honest burghers in novosibirsk were in the queues for a loaf of bread poor buggers be there all bloody day he would know that man on the hill that i would be one of his kind up to nothing innocent and perhaps might sense a kindred spirit in the field a touch optimistic this morning arent we shuddup the snow broke under the tyres as i moved down to the fork in the road and the bodywork creaked as we shimmied over the ruts i had options yes but there werent any others could choose at this particular time they were for later if he proved a danger to meridian as i believed he was then i would try to get past his weapons and contain him bring him away from here take him to the support base and tell them to look after him get him medical attention if that were necessary if he put up too much of a struggle and had to be subdued with some of the more extreme techniques i wished him no harm be this noted in looking for the death of those two generals he would im reasonably sure be seeking to dispatch them to the same elysian climes to which they would have dispatched others perhaps hundreds in the execution yards the late gennadi velichko with at least a rusakovs blood on his hands had been their close confederate the snow crunched under the tyres the chains clinking now on the roadway where military traffic had pounded the surface and reached the hardtop i couldnt see from here whether he was still watching me i didnt need to see he was watching me very carefully i knew that and a tingling sensation began in the exact centre of my forehead it was familiar and didnt rate any attention this wasnt the first time id moved deliberately into a potential line of fire and felt the phantom impact of a bullet perhaps this time a dum dum not my favourite they blow the whole thing into a chrysanthemum nothing left but the stalk i was halfway there now a quarter of a kilometre from where id last seen him a snow bank had blotted him out as i climbed the hill he would use this if he were trained to change his position and turn the car to face my direction so that he could see me through the windscreen when i appeared or he might get out and stand there with the assault rifle ready to swing up into the aim as soon as he saw me then thered be the delicate business of going closer to him under the gun close enough to talk to him and then if the talk broke down and he told me to get out of this area on pain of instant death close enough to get behind the weapon and effect a change in things that would be the tricky bit i kept a steady pace in low gear bumping over the ruts watching for him among the higher trees dont like this you wont have a chance if he oh piss off watching carefully now trying to find the profile of his car or part adamhall of it enough of it to know if hed turned it round or got out to wait forme watch carefully the snow crunched under the wheels you wont have a chance if he ive told you before piss off crackle of gunfire and sweat broke instantly the rooks flew up from the camp keeping a steady pace up the hill any change in the scene at this point sudden acceleration a burst of speed could trigger his nerves and the gun there were widening columns of light now between the trees where id seen him last but the configuration of his car wasnt there he might have turned it so that its narrower front end profile would be presented but i thought i should see it even then id marked his location at the outset where the branch of a tree had hung down at an angle broken by a storm hed moved the car this was where hed been less than a hundred yards away and then i saw him moving in the distance along the hill road and i gunned up and lost the rear end and steadied things and gunned up again more carefully and started building up the speed saw him again as the road straightened saw that i was holding him now at a distance but holding him the observer drove away rusakov had told me before he could be challenged skittish then he was driving something european not soviet possibly a saab but nothing fast like a porsche the speed factor didnt come into things in any case id simply have to gain on him by playing with the gears to get as much traction as possible on the snow keep the skoda on the road keep him in sight until i could draw close enough to see where he was going catch him if i could yes but in these conditions it wouldnt be easy he was still the same distance ahead of me when the road dropped from the hill and straightened out and i was trying to bring the speed up a degree when i saw he was pulling away not fast but gradually taking me three kilometres four into the desolate open ground between the military camp and the suburbs of the town and it was here that he slowed and then swung in a u turn until he was facing me and the first shots hit the front of the skoda low down and began smashing their way upwards in a raking volley of fire as i dropped below the windscreen and it was blown out and the shots began hammering into the metal roof in a deafening percussion storm that blanked out conscious thought i was only aware of closeness to death could only see the snow and the sky revolving slowly as the skoda rolled and churned among the drifts and hit rock and bounced and rolled again rearing now with the front end going down and the whole thing swinging over over and down crashing amidst whiteness whiteness and silence and then a sunburst sounds dying away zombie it had happened before fell forward forward and down fell forward lying with my face in the snow freezing cold cold iron mask on my face get up something was down there important down in the snow i got up and the sky reeled and i sat with my back to the engine again important i reached down and dug around in the snow and found it walkie unit dropped it i had dropped it mustnt must not do that again the sky steadied it had landed on its side the skoda and the bonnet had burst open so id been sitting with my back to it not very warm any more long how long thirty two minutes patience my good friend hurt anywhere a long icicle was hanging from the middle of the radiator where the fan had been driven into it by the impact the engine bearers had sheared yes head hurting a bit not skittish then no hed led me away from the camp hadnt wanted anyone to hear the noise when he pumped that bloody toy he tried to kill me you know that very cold out here it was very cold yes a violent man the agent didnt give anyone a chance kerboom and rat tat tat dont get in my way not one of your more subtle espions lacked reticence car coming but also cocky like all violent men they never doubt themselves or anything they do he should have come back here and taken look at me made sure i was lying in the car there with only the stall left not then a professional crunching over the dry brittle snow the car in the high pale light of the morning it wasnt the agent he would have come back here straight away this would be support id signalled them but i watched carefully as the windscreen showed above the fold in the land the light flashing across the glass it was a minute before i could see the whole vehicle not a saab the agent had beet driving a saab i got onto my feet and the sky swung full circle and the snow came up and crashed against my face sound of engines two cars christ get him up i didnt want that they could keep their bloody hands off keep your bloody hands off anything broken i got up by sliding my back against the roof of the skoda while they stood watching me frome and another man has the dif signalled yet i asked frame not yet has rusakov signalled no jesus the other man said what was he driving he was looking at the mess that gun had made all over the skoda its a bit of spook vernacular some of them affect he was driving an ak that sort of thing i asked him what his name was oh dover sir you all right are you he stood staring at me bland faced where did they find him for gods sake which car is mine i asked frome id signalled him for a replacement take your pick but the mercs more comfortable it was a four door sel too big less easy to hide than the shitty looking little trabant head was throbbing the seat belt had snapped when wed come down i asked frome how serviceable is the trab oh top line she just looks like that ill take it then i was face down on the snow again and they were helping me up and i didnt say anything this time wed got a mission running and if this was the only way we could run it then all right well get you into die car frome said i can walk its a head thing thats all bit of concussion yes we picked our way over the snow towards the cars when the dif comes through tell him it was the rogue agent i was trying to make contact with him and he didnt like itdebriefing not much to say and not a great deal to show for it except a bloody headache but that wasnt the problem i couldnt monitor the agent any more hed never let me get close going down and i grabbed for the door handle of the trabant but couldnt find it snow came up again in a white wave what time is it frome said his shadow huge on the wall thrown by the lamplight ice rang against the beam of the hulk i was facing the ceiling flat on my back been out a couple of hours how dyou feel all right has he come through yet ferris not yet rusakov no but i must tell you i shall resist arrest i shall resist very strongly fine but it would be a question of numbers when it came there wouldnt really be anything he could do call him frome asked no i sat up and swung my legs over the edge of the bunk and stayed like that waiting for things to steady i didnt want to call rusakov hed think we werent sure of him make some tea for you frome asked what no get back to base he didnt move was watching me i think you need a doctor the whole bunk was shifting but id got control of things now i could shift them back if i kept still enough im through it i told frome he let out an impatient breath clouding the air in the lamplight you go flat on your face again in here you hit the wall or the floor and youll bash your head again that what you want look i said and stood up and the lamp circled slowly finally stopped im through it now so get moving i want you back a base the lamp had started circling again but i found that if moved my head with it i could get it to stop frome was watching me do it shit he said if the dif ever finds out i left you here looking like a zombie hell have my balls ill put in a good word for you i told him and he turned and i went out clumping up the companionway i woke three times before dark and finally felt hungry and heated some soup this was at in the evening meridian i said hear you frome any signal from ferris from rusakov there must have been after all this time no you all right now yes then i said youd better tell london there was a brief silence before he said will do i shut down the radio and saw them in the signals room their heads turning as they heard frames voice coming over the amplifier dif went missing last night no signal since strictly no dancing in the streets the floes rang and rattled against the beam of the natasha and i went up the companionway and stood on the deck leaning against the mast for cover the air was calm and the stars clung to the haze over the city like fireflies trapped on a web there was still traffic on the river a motor barge pushing its way through the white crust of the ice smoke from its funnel lying in a dark rope across the water i could hear a woman laughing somewhere perhaps on board the wreck of the sailing boat farther along the quay where a light was showing below deck it was a wonderful sound coming softly through the night through this of all nights when joy was hard to come by it came again and i sipped courage from it feeling release and renewal not surprisingly i suppose given the natural grace of womankind to succour the needy i stayed for minutes there clamped by the cold but letting the energy gather not wanting to go short while i had the chance then i went below deck again and before id reached the cabin the radio started beeping and i opened it up executive support ive got a signal from captain rusakov you want to write it down i dont think so head had started throbbing again i suppose because the pulse was faster this could be a breakthrough the two generals are going to be leaving the army camp at hours armoured transports have been ordered for that time in nine minutes from now armoured transports that should take care of any suicide run by the rogue agent does rusakov know the destination yes theres a building on the road east from the town kievskay a ulica its a mansion used to be the residence of the state governor the generals are going to have some kind of meeting there i opened the map with one hand and spread it on the tabledid he give you a reference for the location its setback in a park a kilometre west of the power station ive got it have you yes there was silence while we both worked on our maps twenty kilometres from the camp twenty five from here right i wouldnt be able to reach the camp before the generals left but i could reach the mansion before they did if the road wasnt snowed under how soon can you get here i asked frome gimme ten minutes bring the mercedes the little trabant out there didnt have enough ground clearance got it i checked the time listen were cutting it very fine i want you to do a running drop and put me outside that building before the generals arrive oh jesus he said i better move it voices the dark pressed down across the snows from horizon to horizon and our headlights cut a dazzling swathe through the landscape the back glare painful against the eyes i had asked frame to drive he knew the car and i was still slipping focus now and then there was a certain amount of discomfort hanging around the seat belt in the skoda had snapped while we were going through the final crunch and the impact had opened a thigh wound and left sundry bruises but the pain was a help keeping the organism aware of itself during the time when consciousness wavered have you done a running drop before i asked frome seen a couple the front end of the mercedes hit a transverse rut where tracks crossed the road and we slid at an angle until frome got it worked out i didnt say anything he already knew we were running things critically close and that if we lost even five minutes having to dig ourselves out of a drift wed be too late and blow the drop the generals transport column would be somewhere to the south according to the map and heading for the mansion in the park along a road more or less parallel to ours and it shouldnt be long before we picked up their lights in the distance the meeting would obviously be policed by the military contingent on board the transports and once they were deployed in a ring round the building i wouldnt have a chance of getting inside there could be security guards there now and that was why id decided to do a running drop wed better go through it i told frome first if it doesnt look as if ive got a reasonable hope of making it dont do it at all jus back off and get clear second when you give me the signal keep running straight for at least five seconds given a speed often c twelve miles an hour dont turn earlier than that the top of the windscreen began coming down across my eyes and i realized my head was tilting backwards against the padded rest as the sound of the car faded sat up straight and got focus again third whatever happens dont go back if theres any opposition around leave me to make my own way out lets run through it again dont do it frome said parrot fashion if it looks dicey don turn for five seconds dont go back if theres a crowd got it i checked the time at and twisted in my seat to watch the south the lights of the city slashed the dark along the west horizon the rest of the world was a snowfield ghostly pale under the stars shit frome said and played with the wheel as the merc drifted the winter stems of a copse swinging across the windscreen the lights throwing their shadows in a moving frieze against the snow i picked up the convoy to the south two minutes later a thin chair of lights lying across the steppe were well ahead of them i told frome another minute and we reached the east west road out of the city and the trees of the park lifted from the landscape silver grey snow covered not far from the two chimneys of the power station to the east anywhere here i told frome and he pulled up on the churned surface of a truck exit to minimize wheelspin later i got a tyre lever out of the boot and dropped it onto the passengers seat and stood for a moment watching the string of lights to the south it was near enough to show movement now the transports had met the east west road and were turning towards the park is it a go frome asked me yes stand off somewhere outside the park if i need you later ill use the walkie i got down onto the snow and slid under the mercedes feeling for hand holds good enough to use with gloves on staying aft of the gearbox and to the drivers side of the propeller shaft away from the exhaust silencer finding a cross member with enough space above it for my hands and swinging my feet up getting one of them lodged above the chassis and kicking with the other one until my boot found purchase on the back axle casing light began flooding the road to the west and i could hear the rumbling of the military column the faint ringing of the snow chains on the smaller vehicles the drumming of diesels my right foot had slipped off the rounded axle casing and i shifted backwards swinging my boot up again but everything was blacking out and the sound of the transports died to silence and in the silence i heard fromes voice a long way off you all right my shoulders were on the snow and the nape of my neck was freezing but i couldnt move the intention was there but the muscles were numbed the light from the leading vehicle of the column was creeping under the mercedes you all right are you said yes but it didnt make any sound cold against the neck freezing cold and my left foot coming away from the chassis and dropping onto the snow the light crept brighter now we needed to be inside the mansion over there that was the objective for the mission for meridian to get the information that was in the generals heads send it to london but i was lying on the ground with the awareness floating insubstantially the awareness of the creeping light and the rumbling of heavy vehicles and the mans voice you got a problem i sensed him near me frome caught a glimpse of his face as he peered under the car felt the known world coming back into focus the strength moving into the muscles my fingers tightening inside the heavy gloves the lungs expanding against the ribcage look were leaving it too minute i said give me a minute reached for the cross member and got a grip on it with one hand both hands the headlights flooding the snow and the drumming of the diesels filling the night as i got my left boot lodged again and kicked upwards finding the rear axle shouting to frome get going his face vanished and the door of the car slammed above me and the engine gunned up and the rear chains cut into the snow as the wheels span and then got a grip and the tension came into my hands and i locked my fingers and closed my eyes we stay like this felt a drop of oil against my face as frome made the turn through the gates of the park we stay exactly like this with the fingers locked this is all we have to do someone shouting somewhere perhaps a guard at the gates is he armed and do we wait for a shot no we stay like this and think of nothing else nothing at all the gears banging as the military column slowed outside the park the transmission shunting the light brightening again as the leading vehicle turned then dimming out as frome took the mercedes in a curve alongside the building we stay like this until the time is right and he signals exactly like this the clinking of the mercedes snow chains echoing from a wall now from stone or brickwork my body swinging as the car straightened and i hung on if it doesnt look as if ive got a reasonable hope of making it dont do it at all just back off and get clear the tension in the fingers burning now and my shoulders brushing the snow and the light of the convoy spreading again and then going out as the double knock from the tyre lever sounded against the floorboards above my head and i let go and dropped smell of furniture polish leather ancient fabric wood smoke the first three doors id tried had been locked the fourth had taken me into a boiler room and this short passage had led from it to the huge rotunda two galleries circled it on the first and second floors the higher one set back from the lower by its own width their beams and pilasters deep red mahogany the windows of the rotunda were mullioned its doors gilded like the ornate balustrades of the galleries above the lower walls were silk panelled and boxed silk canopies overhung the doors logs burned in a huge open hearth in the centre of the rotunda at a ring of tables below three brilliant crystal chandeliers sat a group of chinese military officers most of them wearing the epaulettes of high rank and when the main doors of the building were banged open they got to their feet as the two russian generals came down the steps with their aides and bodyguards a chinese officer grey haired and with a generals flashes on his lapels left the group at the tables and went to greet the russians who returned his salute an interpreter from each party came forward and stood waiting slamming of metal doors and thudding of boots as the rearguard of the generals convoy halted outside shouts orders to deploy in the centre of the rotunda introductions were being managed with the aid of the interpreters much formality punctilious bows i recognized the aides and the bodyguards who had been with the generals on board the rossiya i was aware of the short passage behind me the one that had led me here i was aware of the shadows above the two galleries that circled the dome i listened for sounds for soft alien sounds alien to the voices of the international delegates in the centre the clicking of boots and the scrape of chairs for sounds nearer than that closer to where i watched because he was here in the building too the rogue agent talyzin was that his name there was a man in the ministry of defence called talyzin ferris had told me from raw intelligence data going into london he could be your rogue agent the saab had been outside buried among the trees when id rounded the building trying the doors i had looked for it or i wouldnt have noticed it it had arrived here only minutes before i did it must have the agent hadnt been waiting there on the hill road to launch an attack on the generals he hadnt been waiting to follow them here or wherever they might have gone all hed wanted to know was when they would leave the camp and the moment hed seen the transports gathering and the figures of the two generals framed in the field glasses he had left the hill road and driven here first ahead of them hed known that when they left the camp theyd be coming here and so i was aware of the passage behind me and listened for alien sounds marshal jia chongwu major general yang zhen lieutenant general zou xinxiong more introductions salutes bows and handshakes no smiles the atmosphere was heavy with significance these people werent gathered here to exchange courtesies they were here to work colonel rui zhong colonel wang yongchang their voices carried clearly under the immense dome of the rotunda and the scraping of chairs as they sat down would have pushed the needle of an audiometer into the high sector i would have to listen very carefully if i were to pickup any sounds the rogue agent might make security guards had taken up station on the ground floor all military all of lower rank three men in plain clothes were moving along the walls not going anywhere just stirring their feet as they watched the assembly in the centre they would also be security not civilian but mps former kgb officers or possibly gru the tables in the centre were not uniform had been pulled out of the rooms and offices leading off from the rotunda as a courtesy the most ornate pigeonhole desk had been offered to the leader of the chinese delegation and he was sitting behind it now flanked by an aide and an interpreter the desk was mahogany like the walls here and overlaid with gold scrollwork at the corners it was massive an important piece preliminaries were still going on and i went back along the passage and took the corridor that followed the curve of the rotunda doors were set in the wall at intervals some of them open to reveal offices i took care when i passed them but he wouldnt be in any of these rooms talyzin he would be watching the assembly in the rotunda and watching it from one of the galleries remote from the security guards below i believed he would have the assault rifle with him the one hed used against the skoda id been driving but even if hed left the rifle in the saab outside he would still be armed the staircase id been looking for was simple with a thin iron banister curving upwards behind the main wall of the rotunda it was used for service presumably for cleaners and maintenance crews id seen the main staircase to the galleries when id arrived here an ornate affair leading directly from the well of the chamber talyzin wouldnt have used that one he would have used this i tested every stair as i climbed putting my feet on one end against the wall voices came from below fainter now but still intelligible we have just learned that marshal trushin should be arriving very soon his plane was delayed by bad weather he is replacing general velichko and will receive a transcript of the preamble as soon as he reaches here i tested another stair i am asked by my colleagues first in mandarin then translated to offer our sincere condolences on the loss of the late general velichko in such tragic circumstances we feel personally bereft of a valiant comrade in arms i thought that was interesting because it was in line with the show of formality id seen before the salutes and the bows and thehandshakes despite the military uniforms these were the studied courtesies of statecraft it told me something it told me a very great deal more than i wanted to think about at this particular moment a stair creaked under my weight and i froze i didnt think the sound could have carried as far as the gallery above but i was moving into that deadly zone where a slight indiscretion a lapse in attention to even the smallest degree could be terminal this was the final phase of meridian and id broken into it before id realized and if i could send anything useful to london id be doing it within the next few hours that or lacking discretion lacking attention i could go down without feeling anything much just the instant inferno as the bullet hit the brain and blew the circuits and brought down the dark the nerves edgy that was all because those bloody things had come intimately close as theyd smashed the windscreen and ripped into the car your sympathies are appreciated gentlemen the voice of the chinese interpreter full of throaty aspirates took it up as soon as he got the drift but fortunately we are certain that marshal trushin a hero of the soviet union will be able to help us further our cause with a degree of courage energy and foresight equal to that of our late comrade our cause yes indeed our cause i would have given a great many roubles a great many yuan for a tape recorder here with me now i could of course raise frome on the radio and give him a short urgent debriefing for onward transmission to the signals board in london through the support base in novosibirsk russian and chinese repeat chinese military talks taking place novosibirsk subject a joint cause but id have to go down the stairs again and into one of the rooms below to do that and it was vital that i found talyzin first and in some way got him compromised made safe so that i could concentrate on taking in the information i was here to get the bureau should do everything to keep those people under surveillance zymyanin had he known there was to be a clandestine meeting in novosibirsk of great significance talyzin had known hed known the generals were coming here hed been here before i reached the fourth stair from the top my eyes level with the floor of the first gallery the scalp tightening the gallery was in deep shadow thrown by the chandeliers below i could make out the shapes of tables here and there of chairs above them catching the light leather bound volumes lined the walls if talyzin were here he would be here to watch the assembly down there and to watch it he would have to sit or stand near the balustrade where his face would also catch the light i couldnt see him it was necessary then to move higher to climb the last three stairs expose my head shoulders the heart area moving slowly watching for him tracing the curve of the gallery full circle and it is our conviction that the opportunity for us to assume joint command of all those territories hitherto known as the soviet union is immediately available to us and that such an opportunity is not likely to occur again within the foreseeable future the people of russia and the so called independent states are in a mood of imminent rebellion thanks to the catastrophic breakdown in the economy it is therefore the first step in our overall enterprise to oust the present government in russia and the so called independent states by inciting rebellion in moscow and the major cities and demonstrating to the people that we alone have the power to put bread into their cupboards and shoes on their feet to reinstate peace and stability and usher in a secure and promising future for their children and their grandchildren our troops and our tank will act demonstrably as the allies and the saviours of the people thus ensuring their loyal support as we gather the reins of power the two voices russian and chinese echoed among the shadowed reaches of the dome i could see the complete circle of the lower gallery now and if talyzin were there he must be well back from the balustrade watching perhaps through its polished redwood uprights crawl crawl then to the next curve of the staircase crawl in the shadow silent and dark garbed moving a centimetre at a time past the ornate archway a thing unseen a creature of the shades crepuscular a night crawler of harm to none yet with the hairs lifted at the nape of its neck and its arms goosefleshed its ears alert for the bang of the gun and the whine of the homing shot crawl we consider our opportunity propitious in the extreme the belated attempts of the government of the united states to buy the allegiance of our peoples at a time when they find themselves in need of the very basics of human life have brought the capitalistic empire mongers to their knees economically and their naive decision to reduce arms production in the imagined light of global rapprochement makes the way ahead for us the easier faint light slanted across the first four or five stairs and i crawled up them with the deliberation of a sloth getting onto my feet in the higher shadows i lost some of the generals preamble between the first and second galleries but it came in again as i neared the top of the staircase we fully understand the uneasiness of our chinese neighbours in view of the possibility that russia and her satellites might one day embrace capitalism and as a result cede their nationhoods to the west leaving china as the last bastion of communism on the globe isolated and beleaguered out voiced and outnumbered in the halls of international debate an island of a thousand million people in a hostile sea then their voices began coming out of silence and i moved my head trying to lift it off the stair nerve light flashing an awareness of time passing the pain of a splinter driven into my hand when id slumped losing focus again and that together as one ideologically homogeneous federation we would claim no less than one fifth of the earths total territory and comprise no less than one fourth of its population a potential work force of one thousand three hundred million people dedicated to the socialist cause i got onto my feet the flat of my hands against the wall stood there for a minute or two feeling my way back to full consciousness before i began climbing again in the future on the one hand the russians will enjoy free and unencumbered access to the whole of the eastern seaboard of china from korea to vietnam bringing hong kong and the philippines within closer reach while on the other hand the chinese will enjoy direct access to the borders of western europe including germany austria switzerland and italy once the independent states and the balkans have been brought into the protection of the federation the opening up of new channels for international trade and the physical presence of the forces of the federation in areas at present under the control of the west will be on a scale of unprecedented global significance i reached the higher gallery sighting along it through half its circle as the voices echoed from the dome of the rotunda i still couldnt concentrate on this preamble of theirs but it occurred to m that this wasnt normally the language of military men however high their ranking they were delivering this ground breaking address of aims and intentions with a phraseology sufficiently rounded and structured to bear repetition through those generations of children and grandchildren to be handed down through history with the weight and solemnity of the magna carta and the american constitution easy to see it as an expression of mass megalomania but in the still recent affairs of man the scions of a dozen nations had amicably established the most powerful union of states on earth nothing in the flux and turmoil of human enterprise could ever be termed inconceivable not mine thank god to ponder this was for london if i could manage to get it through for the presidents and their ambassadors and their ministers of defence if i could get it through i saw nothing here on the half circle of the gallery i could observe and when i moved with infinite caution to the point where i could see the whole of it there was still nothing that i could make out as a face and shoulders of a sloped barrel nothing i hadnt expected him to be here id expected him to be on the lower gallery and when id checked that one id had to check this in case id been wrong but he was nowhere nowhere in the entire building perhaps the nerves caught this thought in a closed loop reacting even before id had enough time to assess the conclusion the pulse was accelerating and the blood leaving the surface as the survival mechanism tripped in given the possibility that it had been talyzin who had bombed the rossiya i might expect him to go for the two generals surviving velichko in the same way and by the same method hed known where they were going when they left the camp they were coming here hed been here before then and if that were the case then he wouldnt be here now inside the building hed be somewhere outside wouldnt he concealed in the saab waiting with his hand on the remote control as the generals and their aides and interpreters sat together in the well of the rotunda around the ornate redwood desk with the gold scrollwork at the comers talyzin is a bomber that is his way everything slowing down he is waiting out there now with a remote control in his hand a detonator general kovalenko is sitting at the ornate redwood desk turning a sheet of paper i can see him through the bars of the balustrade what will i see first floating upwards into the great dome of the rotunda his head no their heads all their heads as the initial percussion at the core of the charge expands billowing outwards over the milliseconds its force thrusting its way hugely into its immediate environs finding the panels of the redwood drawer and sending their million splinters into the air an instant before they are consumed in the white and orange fire finding the live bodies of the men gathered there and blowing them into nothing more substantial than a fountaining of blood a flowering of crimson tissue and cartilage and skin the whiteness of bared bones a spark crackles in the hearth below and deafens me sending a shock wave through the nerves and then the whole building the galleries and the walls and the dome blowing outwards like a drum bellowing radiant with apocalyptic fire and the body of this hapless ferret too blown out of all proportion joke later and his voice woke me from nightmare we shall go into the details for you gentlemen the chinese interpreter rendering the last word as honourable comrades and specify the target cities where we shall incite simultaneous rebellion by the populace we shall present to you the blueprint if you will of our entire operation in order that you shall understand that for our par we are committed to an undertaking of heroic and historic proportions comparable with the equally heroic and historic decision of the chinese military authority not only to bury past disagreements but to submit their present format of socialistic ideology to the radical changes necessary to meld it with that of our own thus ensuring the unification of purpose essential to the creation of a federal world power of greater strength of greater resolve and of greater military capacity than has ever been seen before the echoes of their voices died within the hollows of the dome but then honourable comrades you are not aware are you that if such a grandiose enterprise should come to pass you will not be there to pluck its fruits tell them then go down there and push the armed guards back as they close in on you address the honourable comrades theres a bomb in that desk there and if you dont get out of this place as fast as you can run you ii go through the bloody roof or words approximately to that effect but they wouldnt believe me because the generals aides would recognize me as the man on the train theyd framed for the killing of zymyanin and theyd have me under armed escort in five seconds fiat all right then look in the bloody desk see for yourself but that might not do anything useful either because there could be nothing there the whole idea could be a product of my imagination but you dont think it is i can make a mistake you know like anyone weve got to get out of here before it goes off we oh for christs sake shuddup the sweat crawling on me because yes i thought it was true i thought there was a bomb down there and i hadnt got a great deal of time to think say two seconds you name it three not long enough so go down those stairs and out through the boiler room and work your way round that bloody saab and get him before he can press the tit wouldnt be terribly easy would it getting past the military guards out there they were surrounding the whole place so i cant get out of the building and i cant warn those people down there and i cant stay here and wait for the time to run out to the big ker boom so what action can i take survive go down the stairs and through the boiler room and tell those gallant soldiers out there that they can take me in charge blow meridian off the signals board and survive but tell one of them they really ought to pop in there and tell the grand architects of the new world order that if they dont watch it theyll go through that bloody roof i started moving towards the staircase might be time there might be time the scalp tight and a lightness in the chest everything still slowing down and then i saw him curtain call he was in shadow on the gallery below id expected him to be there but had still missed him earlier perhaps because of the angle of view i was watching him between two uprights of the balustrade sound of vehicles outside he was sitting at one of the little tables near some bookshelves watching the delegates below not waiting then in the saab waiting in here the vehicles were nearing the building snow chains ringing voices orders shouted the slamming of doors we have just learned that marshal trushin should be arriving very soon his plane was delayed by bad weather the thudding of boots on the marble outside a door banging open i used the background noise to move quite fast along the gallery until i was immediately above talyzin the bomber there was light on my face but no one was looking upwards they were watching marshal trushin and his aides making their entrance he was sitting at his ease talyzin and on the little table beside him was the detonator the time gap narrowed with a slam and i knew precisely when he would reach out and press the button it would be when marsha trushin sat down with the others but it couldnt be a suicide run there was no need for that talyzin could go outside if he wanted to the way hed come and make a run through the guards and press that thing before they could take him they wouldnt know what hed got in his hand theyd go for him because he was running that was all but hed use the remote and theyd be too busy watching the building go up to feel like running after him but he wasnt going to do that he was comfortable here the electric shock treatment and the sensory deprivation chambers and the other tricks theyd used on him inside the psychiatric hospital had left him just a teeny bit skewed in his skull still cunning enough but skewed and now that hed got all these old friends of his together he was ready to give them the message they shouldnt have done what they did to him it wasnt fair and he wanted to see it happen boots banging again down there snow coming away from their and glistening on the parquet floor chairs scraping back and people getting up marshal trushin let me present marshal jia chongwu of the chinese red army he wanted to be there when it happened he wanted to watch us all for those few milliseconds as the big ornate desk blew apart one the men around it began jerking backwards in a reflex action before the edge of the blast wave reached them and their uniforms began wrinkling he wanted to watch everything he could before he could see no more and since time has a way of slowing down when our attention is locked in with reality he might be given quite a show two or three minutes even as each minuscule stage of the explosion followed the last an hour even long enough to start a mini series major general yang zhen salutes bows handshakes while talyzin watched them from above a puppet master with their last curtain call in his hands he hadnt moved the detonator or reached for it yet he would wait for them to sit down he wanted them to be comfortable too lieutenant general zou xinxiong the voice of general kovalenko drifted upwards into the great dome of the rotunda left echoes rippling colonel rui zhong colonel wang yongchang then they were moving towards the chairs ushering gestures the order of the day as the senior ranks were given precedence and marshal trushin was invited to sit at the ornate redwood desk in the place of the chinese i cleared the balustrade and dropped talyzin had been directly below me on the lower gallery but i went down in a slight arc because of the balustrade and caught his shoulder spinning him round on the chair as his hand went out for the detonator he reacted with great strength empowered by shock rage dementia and smashed his knee into my ribcage as we went down together the breath coming out of me in a soft explosion as i twisted over and felt for a target not in the killing area because i didnt think it would be necessary just in the nerve centres to incapacitate heard shouts from below boots on the staircase talyzins hand on my throat and squeezing strongly triggering reflex and freeing my arm for an elbow strike that reached the side of his head and he lurched and went down and i thought it was over but he came up suddenly like a diver surfacing and went for the table and got his hand on the detonator and i couldnt reach it went for the throat for the kill the fastest way the only way to get the strength out of his arm out of his fingers as his weight dropped and the table crashed over and the detonator hit the floor and he reached for it again but his arm was exposed and i doubled it backwards at the elbow and heard it snap dropped him against the bookshelves and picked up the detonator and backed off as the first two guards reached the top of the stairs and aimed their rifles shouting talyzin didnt move one of you look after this man i told the guards hes injured but watch him i want the other one to follow me down the stairs now move there were more of them waiting for me in the well of the chamber but i told them to get back called out to the generalsyou know what this is held the thing up it seemed to fox them understandably here they were planning the creation of the new world order and suddenly there was a dishevelled looking clown standing in front of them holding up a remote control for their tv set no one said anything didnt matter id spell it out for them marshal trushin this is a remote control detonator for the bomb installed in the desk youre sitting at now i gave it a couple of beats to let him think about it and they woke up all of them i could hear the body movements going on the rustle of uniforms as they shifted on their chairs reacting i am not going to detonate that bomb if you agree to follow my instructions do you agree to follow my instructions marshal trushin in a moment he asked in a flat voice who are you do you agree trying to get my breath back under control i think he broke a rib up there talyzin with that knee strike the lung didnt feel as if it had much room on that side i waited if the marshal didnt agree i was done for i couldnt detonate that bloody thing anyway i wasnt tired of life and wed still got a mission running i wanted information out of these people the information that kovalenko had told the chinese delegates hed give them later but all he would need to say trushin was take that man and thered be nothing i could do behind me i heard the guard coming down the staircase his boots thudding laboriously under a weight talyzin i didnt know if the killing strike id made had got right through to the larynx hed moved a little after id made it tried to reach the detonator i took four paces back to bring him into sight he was hanging across the guards shoulder the broken arm dangling from the centre of the rotunda marshal trushin was staring at me stone faced jowls of a bulldog black eyes locked on mine as he listened to one of the generals aides the one who had framed me on board the rossiya for the death of zymyanin his voice was unintelligible at this distance because he was speaking softly urgently saying very much hoped marshal this man was on board the rossiya two days ago and could well have set that bomb perhaps we should listen to him a log tumbled in the hearth and i heard a man catch his breath i went on waiting marshal trushin was still watching me the aide was silent now i agree to follow your instructions et voila very good if anyone in this chamber leaves his chair i shall detonate is that clear silence is that clear it is clear marshal trushin said i turned round so fast that the guard flinched his eyes on the detonator make him as comfortable as you can i told himtell him theres a medical officer coming those bastards over there had wrecked talyzins brain and i didnt thank them there was a telephone in the first office i came to and i picked it up watching the well of the chamber through the doorway as i dialled military barracks the woman at the switchboard said i asked for ordnance unit three took an age stood listening to the static on the line i shall resist arrest i shall resist very strongly but it wouldnt do any good hed be outnumbered and captain rusakov vadim i said this is viktor shokin and im with the generals you know where they are yes a lot of energy in his voice a lot of questions i didnt have time to answer i need you here weve got to contain the generals military escort their orders are to protect the generals and theyre not goingto listen to me do you trust them vadim in a moment not necessarily how many trusted men can you muster for an emergency sortie two hundred under my own command tanks one squadron all right i need you to surround this building and take the generals out and put them into detention at the moment theyre inn under my control bring a medical officer will you weve got a man with a broken elbow and a bomb disposal unit ive got some work for them how soon can you get here allow forty minutes i can handle that any questions vadim even from your co tell the officer commanding the military police to put him under arrest this is a national emergency i understand i put the phone down and opened up the radio frome hear you where are you haifa mile from the building south edge of the park but listen the dif got through to base an hour ago wants you to signal ferris i asked frome for the number all right i said and shut down and walked as far as the archway the thing in my hand took a look saw that no one had moved they were policing themselves had to if anyone thought of trying to get out of this place before it went up theyd shove him back in his chair i turned and went into the office and picked up the phone again and dialled yes ferris executive im sorry ferris said they were getting a bit too close so i thought wed better move i told the support base as soon as i could they said youre very active i gave him the picture ferris is not easy to shake but it was a couple of beats before he answered ill report to london then whats your condition hed caught my breathing rhythm lingering concussion broken rib frome is still in support hes standing off but i dont need him look theyll know what to do in london but from this end id say they should get this to the russian president on the hot line and suggest he puts these people under the lamp without wasting any time because theyve set up this rebellion thing nationwide and it could be hard to stop noted then i think he said something else but sounds were fading and the floor was coming up so i got a grip on the desk and steadied things and put the detonator down on the flat solid surface took my hand off it we didnt want did we didnt want the whole thing to go ker boom by accident wouldnt even be good for a giggle sounds coming in again that poor bastard talyzin moaning out there something ferris was saying what i asked him london will be pleased oh those buggers greetings incidentally from tanya rusakova her image came in clearly surprising me the green eyes shimmering no longer wary of me shes safe i asked ferris and everything of course anxious to see you well then i said for the want of anything better listen those rusakovs get them out from under will you tell london to talk to moscow right away do it at high level give or take a bit of circumlocution theyve been instrumental in putting down this coup by wiping out velichko tell london theyre my friends and ive earned this much all right promptly and soberly ill treat it as fully urgent couldnt say more than that fully urgent means everyone stops what theyre doing and listens right up to the prime minister i think id been silent for a bit because he asked me are you all right what yes need to rest up a little as soon as i can get the heat off you locally through london and moscow we can find somewhere better for you dont worry i said im going to place myself under captain rusakovs protection until then all right i can reach you at the barracks yes through him but get the heat off him too soon as you can understood ferris said and we shut down they came soon after that rusakovs troops their lights flooding across the snows the night full of noise as the tanks rumbled through the trees of the park i thought id better reassure frome got him on the walkie dont worry these are ours jesus we got an army now rusakov dropped off the leading armoured vehicle before it had stopped his gun out of its holster who is the officer in charge no one answered no one moved the men watched rusakov lay down your arms and stand to they began looking at one another and then a sergeant brought his rifle up and rusakov saw it and used a head shot dropping him watching for other movement as one of the tanks rolled its turret and swung the machine gun up a degree firing a burst as a group of men brought their assault rifles into the aim at rusakov lay down your arms weapons began dropping as the smoke cleared and the men moved towards the tanks with their hands raised hydraulics hissed as the turret in the nearest tank rolled again the gunner watching for targets all right stretcher bearers then rusakov saw me and came over where is the bomb i told him and he waved a vehicle in black painted with the yellow insignia of a bomb disposal unit on the side i opened up the remote control detonator and pulled out the batteries and threw them a long way into the snow vadim i called to him we need to get the generals out of there first under your arrest he swung back to look at me on whose authority it was a reflex question out of the military code book that was all i could have told him on the popes authority or tootsies those generals in there had been the confederates of velichko rusakov also knew that id been able to request his sisters release from militia headquarters and he knew id been able to seize control of the generals here together with their entire armed guard so he wasnt going to quibble on my authority i told him the president of russia is being informed of the situation and i can guarantee his approval of any action we take meanwhile i assume total responsibility he turned away even before id finished shouting orders to his lieutenant and two sergeants and bringing a rifle platoon to the entrance of the building all right were taking prisoners block all exits when you get inside and hold your fire unless i order you to shoot he led them in at the double and by the time i got there hed drawn up his troops in straight extended order to avoid cross fire the generals and their aides were already on their feet some of the chairs overturned on the parquet behind them boots clattered to silence in the echoing rotunda rusakov took three steps forward came to attention and saluted gentlemen i have orders for your arrest please surrender your arms marshal trushin also took a few steps and the two russian generals followed flanking him there is a mistake captaintrushin was a bull of a man six feet six in his black polished boots battle ribbons ablaze on his uniform i shall hold you responsible for this intrusion and will inform your commanding officer that rusakov swung his head a degreetake aim the phalanx of assault rifles swung up and steadied captain you are exceeding sergeant bakatin and two men forward take their weapons trushin knocked the first mans hand away but the sergeant brought the muzzle of his rifle to rest against the marshals stomach while the soldier snapped open the polished holster and drew the revolver the hero of the soviet unions heavy face was white as the surrender began most of them were in a state of shock as rusakovs men worked their way among the prisoners taking their weapons vadim rusakov stood watching a hand on the gun at his belt i was slipping focus again and straightened up hearing the echoes in the great dome of the rotunda our troops and our tanks will act demonstrably as the allies and the saviours of the people thus ensuring their loyal support as we gather the reins of power another gun came out of its holster have your weapons ready gentlemen smarten up and another the opening up of new channels for international trade and the physical presence of the forces of the federation in areas at present under the control of the west will be on a scale of unprecedented global significance another gun was surrendered and then one of the chinese a general pulled his revolver and raised it to his temple and the shot blew his head sideways and he fell slowly the others too shocked to catch him before he crashed across a chair breaking one of its legs as he went down leave him there rusakov ordered secure his gun his men moved among the prisoners as blood crept from block to block across the parquet floor and the smell of cordite sharpened the air thus ensuring the unification of purpose essential to the creation of a federal world power of greater strength of greater resolve and of greater military capacity than has ever been seen before the last weapon was held butt forward in surrender by a russian colonel and as the prisoners were escorted outside to the vehicles i picked up the walkie and signalled ferris through the support base told him we were finished here the end
