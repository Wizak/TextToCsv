 ray bradbury the veldt george i wish youd look at the nursery whats wrong with it i dont know well then i just want you to look at it is all or call a psychologist in to look at it what would a psychologist want with a nursery you know very well what hed want his wife paused in the middle of the kitchen and watched the stove busy humming to itself making supper for four its just that the nursery is different now than it was all right lets have a look they walked down the hall of their soundproofed happylife home which had cost them thirty thousand dollars installed this house which clothed and fed and rocked them to sleep and played and sang and was good to them their approach sensitized a switch somewhere and the nursery light flicked on when they came within ten feet of it similarly behind them in the halls lights went on and off as they left them behind with a soft automaticity well said george hadley they stood on the thatched floor of the nursery it was forty feet across by forty feet long and thirty feet high it had cost half again as much as the rest of the house but nothings too good for our children george had said the nursery was silent it was empty as a jungle glade at hot high noon the walls were blank and two dimensional now as george and lydia hadley stood in the center of the room the walls began to purr and recede into crystalline distance it seemed and presently an african veldt appeared in three dimensions on all sides in color reproduced to the final pebble and bit of straw the ceiling above them became a deep sky with a hot yellow sun george hadley felt the perspiration start on his brow lets get out of this sun he said this is a little too real but i dont see anything wrong wait a moment youll see said his wife now the hidden odorophonics were beginning to blow a wind of odor at the two people in the middle of the baked veldtland the hot straw smell of lion grass the cool green smell of the hidden water hole the great rusty smell of animals the smell of dust like a red paprika in the hot air and now the sounds the thump of distant antelope feet on grassy sod the papery rustling of vultures a shadow passed through the sky the shadow flickered on george hadleys upturned sweating face filthy creatures he heard his wife say the vultures you see there are the lions far over that way now theyre on their way to the water hole theyve just been eating said lydia i dont know what some animal george hadley put his hand up to shield off the burning light from his squinted eyes a zebra or a baby giraffe maybe are you sure his wife sounded peculiarly tense no its a little late to be sure be said amused nothing over there i can see but cleaned bone and the vultures dropping for whats left did you bear that scream she asked no about a minute ago sorry no the lions were coming and again george hadley was filled with admiration for the mechanical genius who had conceived this room a miracle of efficiency selling for an absurdly low price every home should have one oh occasionally they frightened you with their clinical accuracy they startled you gave you a twinge but most of the time what fun for everyone not only your own son and daughter but for yourself when you felt like a quick jaunt to a foreign land a quick change of scenery well here it was and here were the lions now fifteen feet away so real so feverishly and startlingly real that you could feel the prickling fur on your hand and your mouth was stuffed with the dusty upholstery smell of their heated pelts and the yellow of them was in your eyes like the yellow of an exquisite french tapestry the yellows of lions and summer grass and the sound of the matted lion lungs exhaling on the silent noontide and the smell of meat from the panting dripping mouths the lions stood looking at george and lydia hadley with terrible greenyellow eyes watch out screamed lydia the lions came running at them lydia bolted and ran instinctively george sprang after her outside in the hall with the door slammed he was laughing and she was crying and they both stood appalled at the others reaction george lydia oh my dear poor sweet lydia they almost got us walls lydia remember crystal walls thats all they are oh they look real i must admit africa in your parlor but its all dimensional superreactionary supersensitive color film and mental tape film behind glass screens its all odorophonics and sonics lydia heres my handkerchief im afraid she came to him and put her body against him and cried steadily did you see did you feelits too real now lydia youve got to tell wendy and peter not to read any more on africa of course of course he patted her promise sure and lock the nursery for a few days until i get my nerves settled you know how difficult peter is about that when i punished him a month ago by locking the nursery for even a few hours the tantrum be threw and wendy too they livefor the nursery its got to be locked thats all there is to it all right reluctantly he locked the huge door youve been working too hard you need a rest i dont know i dont know she said blowing her nose sitting down in a chair that immediately began to rock and comfort her maybe i dont have enough to do maybe i have time to think too much why dont we shut the whole house off for a few days and take a vacation you mean you want to fry my eggs for me yes she nodded and dam my socks yes a frantic wateryeyed nodding and sweep the house yes yes oh yes but i thought thats why we bought this house so we wouldnt have to do anything thats just it i feel like i dont belong here the house is wife and mother now and nursemaid can i compete with an african veldt can i give a bath and scrub the children as efficiently or quickly as the automatic scrub bath can i cannot and it isnt just me its you youve been awfully nervous lately i suppose i have been smoking too much you look as if you didnt know what to do with yourself in this house either you smoke a little more every morning and drink a little more every afternoon and need a little more sedative every night youre beginning to feel unnecessary too am i he paused and tried to feel into himself to see what was really there oh george she looked beyond him at the nursery door those lions cant get out of there can they he looked at the door and saw it tremble as if something had jumped against it from the other side of course not he said at dinner they ate alone for wendy and peter were at a special plastic carnival across town and bad televised home to say theyd be late to go ahead eating so george hadley bemused sat watching the diningroom table produce warm dishes of food from its mechanical interior we forgot the ketchup he said sorry said a small voice within the table and ketchup appeared as for the nursery thought george hadley it wont hurt for the children to be locked out of it awhile too much of anything isnt good for anyone and it was clearly indicated that the children had been spending a little too much time on africa that sunhe could feel it on his neck still like a hot paw and the lionsand the smell of blood remarkable how the nursery caught the telepathic emanations of the childrens minds and created life to fill their every desire the children thought lions and there were lions the children thought zebras and there were zebras sun sun giraffes giraffes death and death that last he chewed tastelessly on the meat that the table bad cut for him death thoughts they were awfully young wendy and peter for death thoughts or no you were never too young really long before you knew what death was you were wishing it on someone else when you were two years old you were shooting people with cap pistols but this the long hot african veldtthe awful death in the jaws of a lion and repeated again and again where are you going he didnt answer lydia preoccupied be let the lights glow softly on ahead of him extinguish behind him as he padded to the nursery door he listened against it far away a lion roared he unlocked the door and opened it just before he stepped inside he heard a faraway scream and then another roar from the lions which subsided quickly he stepped into africa how many times in the last year had he opened this door and found wonderland alice the mock turtle or aladdin and his magical lamp or jack pumpkinhead of oz or dr doolittle or the cow jumping over a very realappearing moonall the delightful contraptions of a makebelieve world how often had he seen pegasus flying in the sky ceiling or seen fountains of red fireworks or heard angel voices singing but now is yellow hot africa this bake oven with murder in the heat perhaps lydia was right perhaps they needed a little vacation from the fantasy which was growing a bit too real for tenyearold children it was all right to exercise ones mind with gymnastic fantasies but when the lively child mind settled on onepattern it seemed that at a distance for the past month he had heard lions roaring and smelled their strong odor seeping as far away as his study door but being busy he had paid it no attention george hadley stood on the african grassland alone the lions looked up from their feeding watching him the only flaw to the illusion was the open door through which he could see his wife far down the dark hall like a framed picture eating her dinner abstractedly go away he said to the lions they did not go he knew the principle of the room exactly you sent out your thoughts whatever you thought would appear lets have aladdin and his lamp he snapped the veldtland remained the lions remained come on room i demand aladin he said nothing happened the lions mumbled in their baked pelts aladin he went back to dinner the fool rooms out of order he said it wont respond or or what or it cantrespond said lydia because the children have thought about africa and lions and killing so many days that the rooms in a rut could be or peters set it to remain that way set it he may have got into the machinery and fixed something peter doesnt know machinery hes a wise one for ten that iq of his nevertheless hello mom hello dad the hadleys turned wendy and peter were coming in the front door cheeks like peppermint candy eyes like bright blue agate marbles a smell of ozone on their jumpers from their trip in the helicopter youre just in time for supper said both parents were full of strawberry ice cream and hot dogs said the children holding hands but well sit and watch yes come tell us about the nursery said george hadley the brother and sister blinked at him and then at each other nursery all about africa and everything said the father with false joviality i dont understand said peter your mother and i were just traveling through africa with rod and reel tom swift and his electric lion said george hadley theres no africa in the nursery said peter simply oh come now peter we know better i dont remember any africa said peter to wendy do you no run see and come tell she obeyed wendy come back here said george hadley but she was gone the house lights followed her like a flock of fireflies too late he realized he had forgotten to lock the nursery door after his last inspection wendyll look and come tell us said peter she doesnt have to tell meive seen it im sure youre mistaken father im not peter come along now but wendy was back its not africa she said breathlessly well see about this said george hadley and they all walked down the hall together and opened the nursery door there was a green lovely forest a lovely river a purple mountain high voices singing and rima lovely and mysterious lurking in the trees with colorful flights of butterflies like animated bouquets lingering in her long hair the african veldtland was gone the lions were gone only rima was here now singing a song so beautiful that it brought tears to your eyes george hadley looked in at the changed scene go to bed he said to the children they opened their mouths you heard me he said they went off to the air closet where a wind sucked them like brown leaves up the flue to their slumber rooms george hadley walked through the singing glade and picked up something that lay in the comer near where the lions had been he walked slowly back to his wife what is that she asked an old wallet of mine he said he showed it to her the smell of hot grass was on it and the smell of a lion there were drops of saliva on it it bad been chewed and there were blood smears on both sides he closed the nursery door and locked it tight in the middle of the night he was still awake and he knew his wife was awake do you think wendy changed it she said at last in the dark room of course made it from a veldt into a forest and put rima there instead of lions yes why i dont know but its staying locked until i find out how did your wallet get there i dont know anything he said except that im beginning to be sorry we bought that room for the children if children are neurotic at all a room like that its supposed to help them work off their neuroses in a healthful way im starting to wonder he stared at the ceiling weve given the children everything they ever wanted is this our rewardsecrecy disobedience who was it said children are carpets they should be stepped on occasionally weve never lifted a hand theyre insufferable lets admit it they come and go when they like they treat us as if we were offspring theyre spoiled and were spoiled theyve been acting funny ever since you forbade them to take the rocket to new york a few months ago theyre not old enough to do that alone i explained nevertheless ive noticed theyve been decidedly cool toward us since i think ill have david mcclean come tomorrow morning to have a look at africa but its not africa now its green mansionscountry and rima i have a feeling itll be africa again before then a moment later they heard the screams two screams two people screaming from downstairs and then a roar of lions wendy and peter arent in their rooms said his wife he lay in his bed with his beating heart no he said theyve broken into the nursery those screams they sound familiar do they yes awfully and although their beds tried very bard the two adults couldnt be rocked to sleep for another hour a smell of cats was in the night air father said peter yes peter looked at his shoes he never looked at his father any more nor at his mother you arent going to lock up the nursery for good are you that all depends on what snapped peter on you and your sister if you intersperse this africa with a little variety oh sweden perhaps or denmark or china i thought we were free to play as we wished you are within reasonable bounds whats wrong with africa father oh so now you admit you have been conjuring up africa do you i wouldnt want the nursery locked up said peter coldly ever matter of fact were thinking of turning the whole house off for about a month live sort of a carefree oneforall existence that sounds dreadful would i have to tie my own shoes instead of letting the shoe tier do it and brush my own teeth and comb my hair and give myself a bath it would be fun for a change dont you think no it would be horrid i didnt like it when you took out the picture painter last month thats because i wanted you to learn to paint all by yourself son i dont want to do anything but look and listen and smell what else is there to do all right go play in africa will you shut off the house sometime soon were considering it i dont think youd better consider it any more father i wont have any threats from my son very well and peter strolled off to the nursery am i on time said david mcclean breakfast asked george hadley thanks had some whats the trouble david youre a psychologist i should hope so well then have a look at our nursery you saw it a year ago when you dropped by did you notice anything peculiar about it then cant say i did the usual violences a tendency toward a slight paranoia here or there usual in children because they feel persecuted by parents constantly but oh really nothing they walked down the ball i locked the nursery up explained the father and the children broke back into it during the night i let them stay so they could form the patterns for you to see there was a terrible screaming from the nursery there it is said george hadley see what you make of it they walked in on the children without rapping the screams had faded the lions were feeding run outside a moment children said george hadley no dont change the mental combination leave the walls as they are get with the children gone the two men stood studying the lions clustered at a distance eating with great relish whatever it was they had caught i wish i knew what it was said george hadley sometimes i can almost see do you think if i brought highpowered binoculars here and david mcclean laughed dryly hardly he turned to study all four walls how long has this been going on a little over a month it certainly doesnt feelgood i want facts not feelings my dear george a psychologist never saw a fact in his life he only hears about feelings vague things this doesnt feel good i tell you trust my hunches and my instincts i have a nose for something bad this is very bad my advice to you is to have the whole damn room torn down and your children brought to me every day during the next year for treatment is it that bad im afraid so one of the original uses of these nurseries was so that we could study the patterns left on the walls by the childs mind study at our leisure and help the child in this case however the room has become a channel towarddestructive thoughts instead of a release away from them didnt you sense this before i sensed only that you bad spoiled your children more than most and now youre letting them down in some way what way i wouldnt let them go to new york what else ive taken a few machines from the house and threatened them a month ago with closing up the nursery unless they did their homework i did close it for a few days to show i meant business ah ha does that mean anything everything where before they had a santa claus now they have a scrooge children prefer santas youve let this room and this house replace you and your wife in your childrens affections this room is their mother and father far more important in their lives than their real parents and now you come along and want to shut it off no wonder theres hatred here you can feel it coming out of the sky feel that sun george youll have to change your life like too many others youve built it around creature comforts why youd starve tomorrow if something went wrong in your kitchen you wouldnt know bow to tap an egg nevertheless turn everything off start new itll take time but well make good children out of bad in a year wait and see but wont the shock be too much for the children shutting the room up abruptly for good i dont want them going any deeper into this thats all the lions were finished with their red feast the lions were standing on the edge of the clearing watching the two men now imfeeling persecuted said mcclean lets get out of here i never have cared for these damned rooms make me nervous the lions look real dont they said george hadley i dont suppose theres any way what that they could becomereal not that i know some flaw in the machinery a tampering or something no they went to the door i dont imagine the room will like being turned off said the father nothing ever likes to die even a room i wonder if it hates me for wanting to switch it off paranoia is thick around here today said david mcclean you can follow it like a spoor hello he bent and picked up a bloody scarf this yours no george hadleys face was rigid it belongs to lydia they went to the fuse box together and threw the switch that killed the nursery the two children were in hysterics they screamed and pranced and threw things they yelled and sobbed and swore and jumped at the furniture you cant do that to the nursery you cant now children the children flung themselves onto a couch weeping george said lydia hadley turn on the nursery just for a few moments you cant be so abrupt no you cant be so cruel lydia its off and it stays off and the whole damn house dies as of here and now the more i see of the mess weve put ourselves in the more it sickens me weve been contemplating our mechanical electronic navels for too long my god how we need a breath of honest air and he marched about the house turning off the voice clocks the stoves the heaters the shoe shiners the shoe lacers the body scrubbers and swabbers and massagers and every other machine be could put his hand to the house was full of dead bodies it seemed it felt like a mechanical cemetery so silent none of the humming hidden energy of machines waiting to function at the tap of a button dont let them do it wailed peter at the ceiling as if he was talking to the house the nursery dont let father kill everything he turned to his father oh i hate you insults wont get you anywhere i wish you were dead we were for a long while now were going to really start living instead of being handled and massaged were going to live wendy was still crying and peter joined her again just a moment just one moment just another moment of nursery they wailed oh george said the wife it cant hurt all right all right if theyll just shut up one minute mind you and then off forever daddy daddy daddy sang the children smiling with wet faces and then were going on a vacation david mcclean is coming back in half an hour to help us move out and get to the airport im going to dress you turn the nursery on for a minute lydia just a minute mind you and the three of them went babbling off while he let himself be vacuumed upstairs through the air flue and set about dressing himself a minute later lydia appeared ill be glad when we get away she sighed did you leave them in the nursery i wanted to dress too oh that horrid africa what can they see in it well in five minutes well be on our way to iowa lord how did we ever get in this house what prompted us to buy a nightmare pride money foolishness i think wed better get downstairs before those kids get engrossed with those damned beasts again just then they heard the children calling daddy mommy come quick quick they went downstairs in the air flue and ran down the hall the children were nowhere in sight wendy peter they ran into the nursery the veldtland was empty save for the lions waiting looking at them peter wendy the door slammed wendy peter george hadley and his wife whirled and ran back to the door open the door cried george hadley trying the knob why theyve locked it from the outside peter he beat at the door open up he heard peters voice outside against the door dont let them switch off the nursery and the house he was saying mr and mrs george hadley beat at the door now dont be ridiculous children its time to go mr mccleanll be here in a minute and and then they heard the sounds the lions on three sides of them in the yellow veldt grass padding through the dry straw rumbling and roaring in their throats the lions mr hadley looked at his wife and they turned and looked back at the beasts edging slowly forward crouching tails stiff mr and mrs hadley screamed and suddenly they realized why those other screams bad sounded familiar well here i am said david mcclean in the nursery doorway oh hello he stared at the two children seated in the center of the open glade eating a little picnic lunch beyond them was the water hole and the yellow veldtland above was the hot sun he began to perspire where are your father and mother the children looked up and smiled oh theyll be here directly good we must get going at a distance mr mcclean saw the lions fighting and clawing and then quieting down to feed in silence under the shady trees he squinted at the lions with his hand tip to his eyes now the lions were done feeding they moved to the water hole to drink a shadow flickered over mr mccleans hot face many shadows flickered the vultures were dropping down the blazing sky a cup of tea asked wendy in the silence
