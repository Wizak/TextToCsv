 its not only dogs that have a sense of smell the ability to sense alien presence then i stopped thinking about the room because when i squeezed the toothpaste on to the brush an air bubble popped and i saw the stuff was too runny and i went suddenly cold and thought i dont mind them issuing cyanide capsules when they brief me in london but i dont like people putting the bloody stuff in my toothpaste adam hall the mandarin cypher quiller in hong kong chapter one mandarin it was three in the morning when she phoned me and i went straight round there through the pelting rain and found north slumped in a chair looking like death what happened he didnt answer i dont think he heard connie said thank god youre here and got some brandy and put it into tumblers shivering only a thin dressinggown round her shoulders hair all over the place and her big eyes frightened the rain hit the windowsills in sharp taps like someone typing its okay now i told north but he sat staring up at me with his face appalled as if id told him big ben had just fallen over but his pupils looked normal he didnt look doped and he certainly wasnt drunk connie brought one of the tumblers for me chipped round the rim and i held it for him come on slosh this lot down youre ten drinks short but he wouldnt take it didnt seem to catch on to anything was saying i didnt know him very well he was one of the new ones said to be brilliant specialized in the documentation snatch knew his kremlin had a lot of slav languages the one obvious thing about him at the moment was that he was recently back from a mission when did he get here about an hour ago he was still fully dressed his wet mack thrown over a chair bear the door people came to this place to have a drink and go to bed with connie and he hadnt done either he just sat there looking totally blank his tie pulled loose and blood on his knuckles what happenedi asked her again nothing really well how did he get like this was anyone else here no he was hitting things she said irrelevantly punching the wall and whats he been talking about i put it as just another quick question so that she wouldnt think it was significant the thing was that when a man came back from a mission a bit broken up he was liable to talk too much and blow the whole works he said something about nearly crashing and tentenths shit across the airport things like that nothing that made any sense i remembered she thought he was an airline pilot we always have to make something up it doesnt matter which girl were with they never know who we are nobody does did anything in particular start him off not that i can remember he came in looking sort of doneup and wouldnt have a drink and wouldnt say what was the matter then he slowly went wild she drank some more brandy and choked on it a little ive got to be up at six you know can you take him away so i can get some sleep i watched north for a bit he was looking more settled now with a strange halfsmile on his face as if hed quietly come round to thinking that the only thing to do was laugh the whole thing off the smile didnt look very good because he was still white to the gills youll be okay now i told him and looked round for the phone can i use this she nodded and i picked up the receiver while north pulled himself out of the chair and said excuse me and went quietly off to the bathroom and shut the door and blew his brains out by the sound of it connie screamed just once and i got across the room very fast and tried the bathroom door and found it locked and took three paces back and then went at it going in with a lot of momentum left with the door stopping halfway because he was on the floor then i came back and told her not to go in there and picked up the receiver from where it had dropped and dialled the number north has just killed himself and theres been a lot of noise so well need smoke out i gave them the address connie was hunched on the floor shivering badly couldnt take any more christ what a night i said dyou think you could get us some nice hot coffee give her something to do five minutes later i saw a black saloon pulling in to the kerb three floors below and i thought that was pretty fast even for the bureau but they were people in uniform getting out so i supposed one of the neighbours had called emergency when theyd heard the gun go off if hed been punching the wall there wouldnt have been much sleep for anyone and the bang in the bathroom had been the last straw in there i told the sergeant he must have come up the stairs two at a time quicker than the lift because he just nodded and blew out a lot of breath and went over and pushed the door open then he came back and asked if he could make a phone call and i said yes there was a nice smell of coffee now and i could hear connie getting through a lot of kleenex in the kitchen shed called out once why did he have to come and do it here which i suppose was a healthy sign johnson got here next looking very compact and noncommittal taking a look in the bathroom the sergeant had his notebook out and started with me will you give me your name and address no johnson said as he came back from the bathroom and pulled out his wallet and showed the sergeant his identity and then told me to clear out connie was in the kitchen doorway holding a green plastic tray with two cups on it looking at johnson and wondering who he was i called out goodnight to her and opened the door as johnson said look sergeant im going to call my chief then well work out the best way to handle this theres no immediate need for an amb then i shut the door and went down the three flights slowly pressing the timebutton to put the lights on nearly walking into someone whats the trouble a man in pyjamas redeyed from sleep just a family row the september rain was soft and freshsmelling as i crossed the pavement and got into the car connie wasnt one of my girls though id met her once or twice and i was on the list of names she had to call if any kind of trouble came up of course we can make what friends we like unless theres an actual detective warning us off and that only happens if by sheer chance weve taken a fancy to someone with a job in a foreign embassy or with their name on the books as a security risk all the same the bureau tries to steer a few girls our way clerks and secretaries working somewhere along whitehall or across at the foreign office civil servants with a known background one of our people i thing it was carslake said it was the bestrun callgirl system in the whole of london and a director heard him and got him hauled up on high because the bureau is terribly sensitive about things like that i went along there now turning through hyde park with the rain hitting the windscreen and slowing the wipers except for the fact that we worked for the same outfit i had nothing to do with north and he had nothing to do with me but some of his misery had rubbed off and i knew i wouldnt sleep if i went back to the flat and anyway we all seem to gravitate to that dreary bloody building whenever theres trouble comfort in numbers suppose when the nerves start playing up there wasnt anyone in field briefing or the canteen at this time of night signals was in full operation because of the irish thing but i couldnt talk to anyone in there theyd throw me out i found dewhurst wandering about morosely on the first floor when did north get back i asked him who north i took off my trenchcoat and shook some of the rain off it two days ago he looked at me in the bleak electric light trying to see if id heard the news i was there i said where in connies place oh my god were you he dug his hands into his pockets and stood with his shoulders hunched all i know is he got out of lubyanka about a week ago and came in by plane through antwerp next thing i heard he was picked up in st georges psychiatric department how the hell did he manage to fetch up round at connies we were standing outside monitoring and there was some stuff coming through on the shortwave something about streetfighting breaking out again in cyprus and dewhurst wandered off and i went with him wanting to hear more about north if he knew anything like scratching a sore since last week id been on a tenday call which meant two things they had a mission lined up for me and at any next minute they were going to shove it in my hands and tell me to get on with it and when youre on a tenday call your nerves are quite tender enough without some poor bastard like north blowing his head off right in front of you it was like scratching a sore because there wasnt any need for me to know any more about north on the shadowexecutive level we work in totally separate fields and theres just no connection how long had he been there i asked dewhurst where lubyanka oh i dunno really lubyanka is the place youre sent to if youre picked up on the wrong side of the curtain and they specialize in implemented interrogation and if you can ever get out of there alive then youll finish up like north there wasnt anything more i wanted to know about him the whole thing had suddenly turned my stomach sour we were standing by the stairhead now with the open space between the flights running from the top of the building to the bottom like a vertical tunnel the lowwattage bulbs throwing a depressing yellow light through the rows of banisters dewhurst quietly watching me youre on call arent you yes i said well i wouldnt let a little thing like this put you off your stroke he simply didnt have what it takes thats all he wandered off to see if there were any more signals for him and i stayed where i was for a minute looking into the shadows of the stairwell and thinking it wasnt the sort of epitaph wed ever want to be landed with he simply didnt have what it takes well fight like hell to go out respectably when the crunch comes and the last gate slams then tell us who your contacts are the bright lamp burning into your eyes and the bruises throbbing ive told you already i havent got any contacts on this operation the nightstick again on flesh already aching for peace but you were seen using a letterdrop the big white light coming through your eyelids and into your head and burning there you mistook me for someone else the stick or the flame or the jerk of the current or whatever it was they were using tell us using so expertly theres nothing their foul breath heavy and excited tell the light in your head screw yourself and reason beginning to go tell us the jerk of their hands no always the answer the same answer for as long as you can no no no till its over not because of any loyalty to the bureau nothing like that because by this time youre quite beyond any thought of alma mater and the team spirit and whatnot all youre trying to do is get yourself a halfdecent epitaph out of sheer stinking pride deceased during mission nothing spectacular found with security intact just something we can live with in the last few minutes before we die unlike that poor bastard we hope to prove to the clerks and the accountants and the operations staff and the whole bloody bunch in this building that when the crunch came and the last gate slammed wed got after all what it took i went down the stairs this place gave you the creeps at night shrugging my wet mack on passing one of the briefing staff in a lower corridor hello quiller what are you doing here none of your bloody business it occurred to me driving back to knightsbridge through the rain that i could be entirely wrong about this maybe north hadnt told them anything in lubyanka maybe hed stood up to it and got out clean and then just couldnt stand the reaction gone a bit too far there must have been something still left in him even in the last few minutes of his life because hed made an attempt to explain his misery to connie in terms of his cover nearly crashed and something about fog across the airport that hadnt been easy to do and hed done it so maybe theyd chalk up something decent for him as an official epitaph better than the one dewhurst had given him not that wed ever hear of him again outside the hermetically sealed circle of his immediate contacts his briefing officer mission controller and director in the field there wouldnt be any enquiry after tonight along those warrenlike corridors of that anonymous building in whitehall where no one officially exists even when theyre alive thered be no questions asked and the name of north would never be mentioned again in the bureau death is a disease with no complications the call came through over the weekend and i ducked down the steps below the leaky guttering and got into the car every bloody window misted up had to find the cloth and even then it wasnt much better the rain drumming on the metal roof and the street lamps just coming on as i drove through the park well over the limit and one eye on the mirror no real hurry but this was the sixth day of the tenday call and that meant theyd set it up in record time someone had been on the blower or thered been a bunch of signals in and parkis or mildmay or kinloch had looked at the picture again and said all right tell him to come in no real hurry but itd been nearly two months since id done a mission and id forgotten how it affected the nerves when the call came through nothing to show just an eyelid flickering a tendency to keep the foot down through the park that sort of thing because wed made it the last time and the time before that and it had brought us closer to the time when for one reason or another a wheel was going to come off and our name along those quiet and echoless corridors would never be spoken again nothing to show just an eyelid flickering and the sudden awareness of a composite personality we us our because the shadow executive creeping alone through the maze where his work has led him catnerved and ferretquick sniffing the damp and the dark and ready to run ready to kill comes inevitably to know the plurality of the creature that lives alone and close to death the mind busy with logic talking to itself and reasoning the way ahead while the flesh chills and the body pleads for life go back go back while theres time and the psyche calls for courage go on go on while we can calling sometimes for more than that for everything banners raised and bugles sounding forward my friend to a fools death and cheap at the price out of pride lights flashing hemming me in black plastic waterproof over his uniform can i see your licence please all right a temptation to flash the worn leather holder with the card framed in it the one that would get me through almost any door ten downing street or new scotland yard or chequers but you had to justify it later in debriefing and the bureau was fussy about it take your head off at the neck while you werent even looking dyou know what speed you were doing over the last mile flying too low was i worse for him than for me he was getting soaked out there served him bloody well right he shouldve joined the navy there was a parkingslot open for me in the yard behind the bureau they always see to little things like that when youre on call and in a way its infuriating because youre always trying to catch them out and never can i slopped up the worn steps one shoe leaking and pushed the door open nothing on it no name or number or brass plate or even keep out nothing at all and therefore perfectly appropriate to the business this building housed at this hour there were quite a few people about but the corridors were almost as quiet as theyd been the other night when id talked to dewhurst by the stairs the bureau is a government department but officially it doesnt exist and this nihilistic status has long ago cast a sort of creeping blight over the people who work here most of us dont know each other even by our code names because were a shifting population of rootless souls and our business is our own business and were not interested in anyone elses sometimes one of the directors will put a team together an active unit with field discretion on explosives and drop them into whatever banana republic or emergent nation is playing with the matches but most of the active staff are shadow executives singleobjective people with very specific orders pekin has appointed a new military attachй in sumatra go and vet him cuba has just put a unit of combat troops under secret training go and get pictures theres a member of the secretariat on his way to the border in berlin go and help him across exchange of vital information takes place between missions behind closed doors friendships arent discouraged there isnt any need because were dedicated professionals and all wed want to talk about is our work and thatd bore the bejesus out of us because a lot of the work is a strain and all we want to do between missions is try to forget it hes along at the lab tilson said who is egerton he watched me with his pink and amiable face tapping his fingertips lightly together not parkis then or mildmay or kinloch egerton its like pulling a name from a hat you never know who youre going to get the next time out where is it wheres what old horse the little bastard watched me amiably he knew what i meant but he was playing hard to get so i took a shoe off the one that was leaking and let the water out all over his nice parquet floor wheres he sending me i was showing my nerves because egerton would tell me quick enough where he was sending me but i wanted to know now the minute youre called in for a mission you become desperate to know everything whether youre going to freeze to death in moscow or fry in casablanca whether its a penetration job or a snatch or a radio tap whos to direct you in the field and whos going to try getting you out if you come a mucker you want to know everything and you want to know it as soon as you come in because i suppose the more you know about something the less youre afraid of it no earthly idea old horse so i put my shoe back on and did up the soggy lace and told tilson he could screw himself and he said thank you very much and i went along to the stairs and down two flights and right to the end of the corridor the red lamp over the door went out before i reached it that would be tilson told them i was on my way i went in shaded lights and a workbench and radio gear and a screen and some chairs and a long table where egerton was sitting one thin leg dangling he didnt look up one of the other people switched the red lamp on again and the man with the headphones adjusted the volume youd have to give me longer than that how much longer dont know id have to think egerton looked up is this the third cycle fourth sir can we have isolations the man with the headphones put the tape on fastforward and stopped and corrected i assumed the thing was a voice spectograph i i i i am am am am afraid afraid afraid afraid so so so so idiom all right but an englishman wouldnt say i am afraid hed say im afraid it didnt sound like a speech more like an intimate conversation how many have we done egerton asked seventyfour sir you mean altogether well the whole series of matching spectograms and then the fixed contexts we did the randoms yesterday egerton sat like a quiet thinlegged bird on the edge of the table looking at nothing saying nothing until after half a minute the man behind m gave a little embarrassed cough and in the silence i heard the cloth of his sleeve rustling as he moved his arm fingering his hair back probably not used to egertons holy silences what i didnt say anything sir ah yes he got off the table yes well thats fine do those again will you and double check the man with the headphones took them off slowly the whole seventyfour yes and let me have the report from williams somebody whispered oh jesus and flipped a switch rather sharply but egerton didnt seem to notice anything because he wanted the whole seventyfour comparisons done again so they were going to have to do the whole seventyfour comparisons again and that was the only thing that had the slightest interest for him did you want to see me quiller im called in hed taken to wearing glasses recently and his dull brown eyes wandered around the edge of my face as if he was trying to find the middle oh yes why dont we go upstairs in the corridor i asked what were the voiceprints ah well theyll be working on those so i shut up and we took the main stairs because the lift in this building gets jammed between floors twice a week and we just cant afford the time egerton had possibly been an owl in a previous life because hed picked a room on the top floor and turned it into a sort of nest lined comfortably with maps and books and posters of edwardian bicycle advertisements furnishing the rest of it with cherished objects a skull an abacus a bulbhorn that kind of thing possibly flying through the small high dormer window with them in the dead of night make yourself at home he said and draped his body behind the desk like a pile of bones when did you get back where from cyprus wasnt it i havent been out i said slowly for close on two months he reached over and dropped a folder on to his desk and said absolutely nothing for three minutes i threw my trenchcoat across the fireguard he used in winter and sat down on the louis quinze chair that years ago had been filled with stuffing the phone rang and egerton answered it well there were streaks of rain on the window and the glow from the street sent their shadows trickling on egertons face as if he were quietly crying and it suited him i thought they said his wife had committed suicide at some boardinghouse on the south coast not so long ago but nobody know if he was miserable because shed done it or if shed done it because he was miserable has mildmay seen him yet i could hear tilsons voice from the receiver so they were talking about styles just in from ankara a sticky debriefing session because we all knew that styles was in it for the money and one fine day the rusks or the turks or the arabs were going to make him an offer he couldnt refuse and hed blow the whole network if they didnt watch out not in my opinion or hed be found floating i cant see him at the moment im sorry he put the phone down and looked at the stuff in the folder again and sat back and said theres nothing concrete yet he expected me to say something so i didnt things are a little confused over there over in pekin he folded his thin raw hands studying the scars of the winters chilblains for a moment have you been briefed on china i got off the louis quinze chair and he looked up in surprise and i said i havent had a mission for two months and they put me on a tenday call and brought me in after six days and nobodys told me a bloody thing except that tilson says youre my control he gave me a bleak smile i know how you feel he didnt look i said have you got a mission for me oh yes i hadnt expected that i sat down again and a thought came at a tangent the second voice on that tape the one with the right idiom and the wrong tone i am afraid so could possibly be an educated chinese the problem egerton said apologetically is that they got the timing wrong it wasnt their fault he checked a sheet in the folder looking down through the lower lenses of his glasses and trying to get used to the focus we were all ready to send you in and now were not he shut the folder and slid it to one side oh for christs sake i got up again and squelched around in my leaky shoe not anyway he said for a few days a few days he looked surprised yes the thing is that after two months you get the feeling youll never be able to do it again unless you do it soon and it bring the nerves to the boil i thought hed meant weeks not days look if its pekin is it pekin yes if its pekin why dont you put me into hong kong so i can wait for the signal he looked up sharply why hong kong well id be right on the doorstep even to get out of london would be something id at least be on my way he was thinking it over so i sat down again and caught a spring of that bloody louis quinze right on the buttock bring me the blue file he told someone on the phone and put it down and looked at me and said frankly id rather you waited here were expecting signals he could switch them to hong kong it was a crown colony but it wasnt my job to remind him of that a woman came in brogues and a bun and a whiff of carbolic typical bureau staff and left a blue file on egertons desk and then of course i realized why hed popped a tuck when id suggested hong kong it looked as though they had something running there and he was wondering how i knew niavonvw he brooded over the folder slipping one sheet out at a time and craning his neck instead of moving it nearer he ought to have those things changed the tears running down his long thin face while the rain pattered at the window i wouldnt mind once i could get him off the pot once id elbowed him into putting me out there wouldnt mind having him as my london control he was a miserable sod and overcautious but he wouldnt ever make the kind of mistake that would leave you without a chance nibvcnvw you dont see with your eyes you see with your brain and while i was thinking about egerton there was peripheral cerebration going on trying to read the name on the folder typed in capitals and upside down from where i was sitting i gave it my full attention mandarin his thin raw hands moved softly shifting the papers the hands of a priest performing the last rites no he said slowly we could use you there for a day or two but i dont want to take the risk he put the last sheet back into the folder and closed it and pushed it to the end of his desk as soon as the signals come in you can take the first plane after all i drew a steady breath what risk well communications really i dont care to switch signals the risk of delay really i took another slow breath and let a couple of seconds go by because if you try jumping egerton he shuts like a clam be a delay anyway wouldnt there whats hong kong twentyfour hours a little more than that i rather think he phoned again and put the receiver back and took his glasses off and pinched the bridge of his nose wed save that much i said she came in again and he gave her the file did you want to see colonel fraser mr egerton not particularly hes waiting oh is he he put his glasses on again all right ill be along in a moment she went out and i didnt say anything because he might still be thinking over what id said about saving at least twentyfour hours if i went right away it would mean helping us out a little he said looking into the middle distance i wouldnt mind that i said like trying to get a bird to eat out of your hand its just a routine investigation a bleak smile not quite your field thatd be okay just for a few days he got his long thin legs together and stood up and wandered about for a bit finally stopping and gazing quietly at a young lady in knickerbockers holding her very own new bicycle well perhaps we could yes fit you in gotcha chapter two cypher i was still hanging around at midnight waiting for someone to take me in field briefing bangers and mash in the canteen when i finally got fed up then back to square one thinking i might have been a bloody lemon after all if this was the way they were going to play it there was a lot on of course and not all of it overseas those bastards had put one in st pauls nobody hurt a small one or not very efficient but that wasnt their fault then one of the staff at the palace had found something rigged up in the kitchens god knows how theyd got in there through doubled security lawson was in charge of the main counterterrorist unit and somebody had heard him say if he actually caught one of them at it hed spear the bastard bodily on the railings outside the tower and the thing we all knew about lawson was that hed probably do it signals was hard at it and all you could see were trays of tea going in but then signals was always manned even when most of the other sections were shut down there must be a whole unit going out for field briefing to keep me hanging around like this i didnt check with the upstairs people to see if egerton had changed his mind because he would have got a message to me he had good manners whatever else quiller dont tell me macklins ready for you i was in monitoring military communique from cyprus radio air attacks increasing around nicosia while the security council issued further appeals for a ceasefire the old lark all over again couldnt care less field briefing was the next floor up and i began hurrying and then remembered this wasnt really the outset of a mission i was going to have to piddle about in hong kong for a while looking at all the postcards well id asked for it macklin was buried in a filingcabinet and poked his head out and told me to sit down tilson had gone off hours ago and we were alone with the bright neon lighttubes buzzing in the ceiling and macklins ashtray thick with dogends he came over giving the metal drawer exactly the correct amount of push so that as he sat down opposite me it rolled shut behind him with a click not your kind of operation its just something to do out there while im waiting yes egerton mentioned he was sorting out the material one glass eye gazing slightly offcentre the hard neon light discolouring the scar so that it looked even deeper than it was hed been running an escape chain and got his minefields mixed up on the chart near hellingenstadt three months of plastic surgery so he wouldnt frighten the children any more then hed opted for an office job lucky to get it theres not much he said and slid the file across the desk to me never handed things to people if he could avoid it still had the shakes youd better curl up with it and give me a prod when youre ready one of his phones was ringing and he answered it and i opened the folder and went through the stuff george henry tewson five foot so forth several pictures last seen alive july tai tam bay hong kong three local fishermen saw him lose his balance in the boat and go overboard a big fish tugging at his line according to several other witnesses disturbance in water indicative of shark attack remains never found but wallet and some papers washed up on turtle cove bay unmistakably identified confirmed by wife i cant help that macklin was saying on the phone the whole unit has to get airborne at the same time do without the navigator if you have to and find a pilot who knows his maps it never occurred to me that it was a bit odd giving me a briefing officer like macklin to spell out this little job i was going to do for egerton strictly a gumshoe number maybe he was just filling in for someone as i was nora millicent tewson nee harmer now legally designated widow still in hong kong now resident present address listen i said i can read the rest of this stuff on the plane what plane thats what i mean there could be an early flight his glass eye looked at me dully slightly offcentre i remembered it was the left one you had to look at whats the rush i cant stand this interminable bloody rain he gave a sudden lopsided laugh and the scar went pink cant ever wait can you listen ive been out for two months shagging yourself to a standstill oh balls listen fill me in will you give me the main outline he flipped a switch and said how soon can you put a man in hong kong they said theyd call him back he looked at me again we just want to know a bit more about what happened to tewson on the face of it everything seems to be quite okay he and his wife were on a package tour holiday the third time theyd been to hong kong in three years and he went in for sport fishing its shark water and that kind of accident sometimes happens if they dont lash themselves to the boat all the same weve had a request to check on it and make quite sure it was an accident i didnt ask whod requested it after a few years at the bureau you learned the language and in field briefing their job is to tell you everything you ought to know and if they seem to be missing a few things out you dont ask questions because itd be a waste of time the mission controllers work on the principle that if you know too much itll get in your way some of the crudest operations like busting an opposition cell or getting a man across a frontier can carry the most complex political significance you can be quietly picking the lock of a dispatch case in an embassy in zagreb without the slightest knowledge that the imminent eastwest summit depends on whether you get it open or not and the people who structure policy feel that if you realized your responsibility youd probably break the hairpin we dont argue at times this sort of builtin reticence can be a bloody nuisance but in the long run theyre probably right what did tewson do isnt it in the file macklin asked no id read that far he gave a shrug spreading his hands so there it was again and i shut up mrs tewson is under then a buzzer went and he opened the circuit yes travel right depart heathrow by british airways arrive rome depart rome by british airways arrive bangkok following day depart bangkok by china airlines arrive hong kong london time local time macklin said all right and cut the switch and i looked at my watch it wouldnt exactly be cutting it fine but i didnt have to stroll can i do it that way if you can get cleared in time i spun the file around so it faced his way and he opened it and started flipping through the stuff but i could see he wasnt having to read any of it and i noted this mrs tewson is still very cut up started drinking now and then has our lot talked to her no but weve had her under surveillance just routine name of our man is flower specific who flower specific instructions share the surveillance advise and control flower report at discretion treat as highest priority preserve all cover utmost care in approaching hong kong police department or special branch certain officers suspected of links with communist china you can use are they satisfied it was an accident the enquiries are closed coroners verdict misadventure any valid suspicions of foul play none whatsoever of course i could have read all this for myself on the plane but he knew what i wanted the bare bones of the thing so that i could put any relevant questions on the spot you cant get cleared satisfactorily until you know what youre going into he still wasnt having to read anything just the odd heading to jog his memory he knew this material pretty thoroughly and i thought again about that an executive of macklins status and experience shouldnt be handling a minor operation like this one wouldnt have enough time to give to it the top briefing officers at the bureau dont work regular hours they wont even show up unless theres a big mission breaking but once they show up they wont go home again till the whole shows ready to run to look at him i would have said macklin had been working twentyfour hours at a stretch and he could have gone home and left a secondstringer to brief me on this squibsized assignment he hadnt with egerton it was different he was a top controller but would handle anything that came along up to half a dozen operations unless there was something really critical on the board you can use a safehouse macklin said if you need one i didnt ask him where it would be in the material theres a local contact at the safehouse whats his rating total reliability but not well informed hes all right on topography of course hes been there fifteen years can i have something again macklin something in specific instructions he went back to page two the paper making a soft scuffing tattoo until he pressed his hand against the desk report at discretion treat as highest priority preserve all cover but his eyes werent moving quite as fast as he was meant to be reading utmost care in approaching fine thats what i thought you said what the bloody hell did they mean highest priority signals through the admiralty and youd better pick up a cypher fair enough it was no good asking him and no good asking egerton whod probably gone home by this time past midnight macklin was a top briefer and shouldnt be handling this one and theyd used the very circumspect phrase highest priority for a distinctly lowkey operation but there was a plane for me take off in four hours from now get out of london and head for hong kong and stand by for egertons signal the real one thatd trigger the mission hed got lined up for me so dont start asking silly questions or theyd say we thought you were keen on going well you dont have to be doing it on my own doorstep fair enough i said again and got up youll be briefed on mandarin when you get out there thats the big one yes whos going to be my director in the field we dont know oh come on macklin really he said well probably fly someone in from pekin oh will you i thought there was only one place in pekin where they could get me a director and that was the embassy so they must have a man in place narrowed it down a bit i could even find out for myself if i got my phonenumbers right it was very important and normally its one of the first things you re told because you can refuse any given director if you dont feel you can work with him your lifes usually involved and you can get someone like loman brilliant but desperate for personal kudos talk you into a suicide bid if itll get him a medal it wasnt his fault id come out of tunis alive or someone like thornton totally dependable pull you out of the gates of hell if he can get there in time but short on ruskthink patterns and mission sense and therefore dangerous you can refuse anyone they want to give you and you dont even have to say why otherwise i suppose the insurance company would never stand for it macklin was stifling a yawn getting another cigarette i said been pushing you have they ive done my bit today old boy off home now you bet i said give my love to marcia that was his wife the security guard used his key and took me in all right sam she told him the guard went out snaplocking the door long time she said too long she spun the combination her back to me touching a hand to her greying hair waiting for the timer to stop the autodestruct warning buzzed and she threw the tumblers starting on the second combination what was your last one third series seventh the door of the safe swung open and she brought a single sheet across to the table a xerox copy in a plastic cover there were only three cyphers currently available which explained why macklin had been working the clock round there must be some special units overseas probably cyprus whats this one just come up gor blimey it was replacing a whole series the bureau hang on to their pet numbers till theyre too dogeared to use so it could only mean this series had been busted somewhere out there where the signals were hot and i just hoped it hadnt blown anyone through the roof fancy i said the thing was built up with extendedphase digits sometimes three or four to a numeral with reverse transfers and the alert provided by omissions in the blanks you just left out the space between any two phrases and forgot to reverse have they got someone new its mr hanbury she said rather sharply were never terribly impressed with the stuff they give us and it makes them touchy i said id take it and she picked out a box small flat waterproof fireproof neutral grey any acid she said but it takes thirty seconds all right if i worked at it i could probably wipe it out in rome there wasnt anyone in accounts till someone shot in from next door its common knowledge that anyone holding up a shadow executive on his way through clearance gets taken to bits and sold as meccano sorry sir hell dyou think this place is mi i filled in the form nothing of value no next of kin no messages tcs for five hundred pounds a barclaycard two hundred in cash it seemed a lot for the hong kong end but maybe itd have to finance mandarin as well you can obtain local currency anywhere sir day or night fair enough can i have the rates he gave me the booklet and i put it into the briefcase with the rest of the stuff in firearms they were well on the ball thered been a rush on from the mob macklin had sent out pack enough submachineguns on board and you have to leave the navigator behind weapons drawn none im rather a disappointment to them theyre always wanting people to try out the latest models for them capsules drawn none hed got them ready in his hand but put them away again in the locked drawer when he saw what id entered they never know what were going to do and sometimes we dont know ourselves it depends on so many things what field youre going into who your director is what degree of risk what info memorized so forth also its a peculiarly personal thing and involves much more than just life and death it raises issues like motivation the will the threshold of pain the question of identity itself what is this thing thats screaming like this and can it remain whole can it retain command of whatever it is i used to take capsules with me in the early days but after theyd roughed me up in leningrad and again in cairo i realized cyanide wasnt the answer because pain carries its own anaesthetic if you can hold on for the first few stages and they cant get anything out of you if youre unconscious or a gibbering idiot and they know that or at least the professionals do and theyre the people were usually up against another thing is that if they find a capsule on you they assume you must have some pretty interesting stories to tell so they go to work intensively all i needed from travel was the air ticket are you the one for hong kong yes i put it into my wallet what about china taiwan the mainland he went over to the files and checked and came back are you detailed for mandarin yes theyll fix you up in hk theres no regular visa youll be processed by the secretary for chinese affairs even if field briefing could have taken me earlier i would have had to hang around for credentials because theyd produced the complete works covering me for mandarin as well as the hong kong thing never thought wed get through in time marge was the only one at the bureau who could make you look round not that it was saying a lot china blue eyes and a big blonde wig and so much eye shadow it looked like sunglasses but the thing about marge was that if you came back after a years absence shed say hello youve changed your parting shes gone now seduced by the totally counterfeit charisma of mi she had everything laid in a row along the counter and i began on the left while she perched on her high stool like a lifesize doll and watched me passport clive wing border

austrian gold pieces centennial medallions and highvalue government proof sets sole representative for mendoza sa of buenos aires investment brokers a name like wing was to be expected perfectly

and bullion brokers in victoria and kowloon from mendoza sa latest issue of coin quarterly when did you lose the other one asked marge other what i signed for receipt of documents and started shuffling the stuff into my briefcase you had a beautiful blue parker behave yourself marge you dont have to advertise she swung her legs and giggled and i went out and that was the last i ever saw of her theres a typical number in there now lisle stockings and a slight moustache it was still pouring with rain and the wipers had a hard job coping with it on the way back to the flat i changed my wet sock and put some clothes in a bag and looked at my watch and thought no and then yes picking up the phone and taking the risk that shed mind being woken up at this hour burrburr there wouldnt be time to go round there even if she were alone burrburr she wouldnt be at the connaught or anywhere because she had to be on the set at seven tomorrow burrburr unless shed been hello sleep still in her voice a soft laugh of course she didnt mind long eyes and copper hair and the way she turned her head my god are you off again the whole of london suddenly full of moira and not far away no i said theres only just time to get the plane new york she hated quickies she wanted everything and champagne afterwards when will you be back not long i told her not long goodbye or maybe never which of course was why id had to ring her taking out insurance on the risk that one day soon i might get in so deep that i couldnt get out or cross their sights and not have time to hear the hum and go down wishing in the confusion of rage and fright and refusal to believe wishing id at least picked up a phone and said goodbye they say you always think of your mother but i dont remember mine but my god i know when it comes im going to remember moira at twothirty the phone rang yes dyou want some transport old horse tilson was back he was admin and worked shifts ill take the jag want it picked up if you will ok take care the line clicked severing the last connection and i went downstairs and threw the bag in the car the place was like a morgue only seven flights on the board and one man with a mop trying to get some of the floor dry before the next coach came in there was a blocked drain outside and the pavement was flooded rome yes sir there was no delay on the screen printout what time was this booked can you tell me he tore the perforation and used a stapler you mean when was the reservation actually made right he checked his books five pm yesterday sir thank you oh that bastard egerton on the way to the waiting area i saw a man who reminded me of someone pale face and a kind of lost expression couldnt think who then i remembered north getting up so quietly like that excuse me they do it so often in bathrooms i suppose because its messy i put a cheque into the interflora box and a message twelve red roses cheer up connie life goes on a high faint whistling from beyond the roof and a sudden rush of lights an entire italian family in the waiting area electing their next president their hands presenting inarguable arguments in the air taxiing to the end of the runway i got out my homework committing the thing to memory the extendedphase digits were in groups of vowels labial consonants labial and dental so forth and i ran off cheer up connie and egerton you bastard and reversed the transfers forgetting the alert mechanism and having to look this one wasnt going to be too easy old hanbury had done his nut getting the green from the tower the brakes came off and my spine began pressing into the seat reverse transfer and regroup try again but i couldnt concentrate because a top man like macklin doesnt normally handle a lowkey operation and theyd used highest priority in terms of cover security in a routine enquiry into an accidental death and now id got him egerton had booked me out to hong kong a full hour before id bust a gut persuading him to send me there jets roaring the shoulders pressed hard to the seat so i wasnt just helping them out and i wasnt going to hang around looking at the postcards till they switched the signals from pekin and triggered the real one for me the big one it was already running mandarin chapter three contact fettuccini si signore while i was eating it i reversed ten transfers switched all groups at random and dropped the alert in every time without making a mistake running off rome airport who the hell is fewson and why wont they tell me then i reached for the vinegar and leaked some into the little flat box and watched the plastic card slowly dissolve she was dead right it took a good thirty seconds not exactly the kind of trick youd want to leave till the last minute if you found yourself in a shutended situation most people keep the key on them throughout the whole mission unless they run into problems its as tough as a credit card and you can take it through fire and water and it wont break unless you actually stand it on edge at a bus stop but i like to get rid of it earlyit gives me the creeps because if they do happen to get to you before you can stop them they can begin reading your signals and sending stuff back and you wont necessarily live to know youve blown the whole operation si pregamo i passeggieri per bangkok di recarsi all entrata dimbarco numero uno final check for messages negative bangkok and the heat of a humid noon burnishing the gilded cupolas palms and tamarinds and somewhere in the reek of kerosene a hint of sandalwood inside the building a bunch of people mainly japanese were crowding the royal bank of thailand counter that would be the devaluazione monetaria featured in la strada nothing on the message board for clive wing there was a twentyminute delay on the screen at china airlines and i asked about it and they said the plane had come in late from tokyo avoiding a typhoon that was now moving northeastwards towards korea so i had time to walk around stiff as a board after twentyone hours up there and already feeling the disorientation as the metabolism struggled to adjust the windows full of jade and teak and silk the smell of incense and a display of gold pieces on black velvet and a board showing the world market mexico pesos tr oz us bid asked austria corona tr oz us bid asked the only two that interested me the prices much lower than in london or new york will passengers for hong kong please go to gate no twelvetwentyfive and the air steamy across the tarmac tso sun tso sun music tinkling from the speakers no smoking seatbelts so forth the thing was he probably thought id blow up in his face if all theyd had for me was a routine investigation into tewsons death and he was absolutely right i would have so hed had to catch me softlee softlee and not the first time it was egertons speciality and i would have walked out on him flat at london airport the minute i knew about the reservation except for two possibilities either george henry tewson was a top kick in some kind of specialized field or this operation was just too sticky or tricky or hairtrigger sensitive for anyone else to want to take on he could have gone right through the list without getting a bite because we can refuse a mission and theres nothing they can do about it so hed come down to the one man who might conceivably be persuaded the one whod been out of ops for nearly two months and was ready to take anything anything so long as they wrapped it up to look fancy silk and small hands a cherryred mouth would you like some tea eighteenforty and a cloth of gold flung across the window where i sat the humped green hills of two hundred islands growing nightblack before their time as the day lingered along the tropic of cancer we hope that you enjoyed your flight a rhythmic vibration setting in and the weight coming off the seat and will fly with us again on china airlines fishing junks below on the flat gold water sampans and a submarine and the chalkwhite wake of a hydrofoil as it settled to the surface in from macau will you be staying long in hong kong it depends on what business i find oh yes you told me you deal in coins coins and bullion theyre the best hedge against inflation ah yes he undipped his seatbelt smiling in tokyo we put our faith in transistors the white tiger balm pagoda across the window and victoria peak then boats coming past in a swinging blur as we flattened along the approach path tankers freighters two destroyers of the us th fleet and a group of junks from canton with the chinese communist yellowstarred flag and then the sub again s class with the union jack belts until the plane has come to a stop the hollow roar as the jets reversed and then the unaccustomed silence as the power came off leaving conversations suddenly exposed but heroins their worst problem even the schoolkids have started using it theyre not really poor darling i think they just like living on boats the prettiest girls in asia joe and im not kidding warmth underfoot across the tarmac and the air clammy against the face the end of a long days heat the sinuous flicker of her cheongsam ahead of us as she led the way against the frieze of ponderously moving shapes swissair lufthansa transworld and beyond them a curtain of jewels across the harbour as the island began burning in the dusk taxi cathay hotel take ferry no tunnel the cathay because in the dossier of nora millicent tewson her present address was given as jade imperial mansion ten minutes walk away besides if i chose anything more than seventy dollars a day those arthritic old tarts in accounts would bust a corset the place was near cat street and there was a boy outside roasting a duck over charcoal with a woman already waiting the clatter of a mahjong game sounded from a doorway farther along where a letterwriter sat with an upturned keg for her table i passed the shop twice wanting to familiarize myself with its environs and then went in the place was full of snakes a hundred of them i cant stand the bloody things mr kwan no younger born i am mr chiang he came out from behind his jars of snakes and stood with his hands together short and at first glance fat then if you looked again muscular will it rain mr chiang it has rained will the typhoon come it has gone how many brothers have you seven and sisters seven thousand what is the goose it is gold i showed him the scar under my wrist and he nodded going to the door of the shop and closing it and coming back the sizzling of the duck was no longer audible but the clack of the mahjong pieces came faintly through the walls dont these bloody things ever get out they have no wish they are fat now and ready soon to hibernate that is when the price will be high im happy for you he led me through the bead curtain and up some pitchdark stairs to a room under the roof the air heady with herbs there was dust everywhere from the sacks filling the shelves except on the radio which was as clean as if he polished it every day what are your main stations mr chiang pekin and of course taipei the embassies your embassy in pekin your consulate in taipei he went over to the set softfooted and eager to please you wish to make contact not now he was disappointed stepping back but still looking at the set as if it had suddenly stopped working when did you come to hong kong he swung his large head to look at me a long time ago from the mainland he looked away and in a moment went down the steep flight of stairs ahead of me his stubby hand on the rail yes from the mainland we swam across deep bay one night but i reached the shore alone who was with you my wife one of the snakes rose heavily as our shadows passed over it and spiralled round the big glass jar i could hear the dry scuffing sound of its skin as it moved mr chiang stood with his short black shoes neatly together that is all yes elder born he unbolted the door and i left him the duck was done but the boy and the woman were arguing about the price on the other side from where the letterwriter sat there was a jewellers and i went in and asked if i could use the phone mr chiangs number was among those id memorized from the briefing material and dialled it wai lee seensaang haishue ma neeshue mo yon sing lee doei mjue ngaw daap chaw seen i hung up and put a dollar on the counter but the girl shook her head so i circumspectly picked it up and thanked her and turned left outside the jewellers so as not to pass the snakeshop again when london sets up a safehouse abroad it doesnt fool around because the whole mission can sometimes be thrown in jeopardy by an unreliable contact and of course blown up if hes a double and they know that theyve known it for so long that a lot of us still survive it was just a reflex that made me do it and anyway it wasnt conclusive because if hed wanted to phone anyone to say that wing had arrived in hong kong he neednt have done it within three minutes of my leaving the place but that was when hed be most likely to do it id lowered my voice and all he knew was that one of the thirty thousand foreign devils in hong kong speaking atrocious cantonese had got the wrong number and all i knew was that for a period of ten seconds during the critical three minutes when hed been most likely to inform a contact that clive wing had arrived on the island his phone had been innocently disengaged most of us work on the principle that if youve got the time and the chance to check every step of the way its worth doing its a bore checking the ignition wires for tampering every time you get back into your car after youve had to leave it in a suspected area and i must have done it a couple of hundred times including the time in calcutta when i found theyd rigged a bomb i picked up a darkblue capri from fleetway rentacar in watson road and took it past the cathay and found some shadow where the trees in the park hid some of the light from the lamps jade imperial mansion was one block distant and went there on foot and saw him sitting in a hillman with the visor down but i didnt stop because this was completely unknown territory and i needed to feel my way in i didnt stop at the board in the lobby either because there were people about and i noted them there was enough light on the board to confirm in passing that was on the fourth floor and i took the lift to the top and went down seven floors by the emergency exit stairs finding the back entrance and going through the service complex and coming out by the park and getting into the capri putting the window up to leave a reflection and checking the time the parking slot for was on the far side of the building but there was only one exit and at i heard the hillman start up and a minute later the jensen came through the gates and turned west and then north and then west again into gloucester road and we were in business the traffic fairly thin because most people were in the theatres and restaurants and supperclubs at this hour and the only one i didnt like was the taiwanregistered toyota and took a right and a left and a left and came up on the lights at red and watched him go past no reaction whatsoever too far behind the hillman to be tagging that but it had been worth the risk of losing the jensen and having to find it again because the oppositioninplace in whatever city are very watchful and you can pick up ticks just by stopping to tie your shoelace in six blocks i came up on the hillman again and this time overtook it slotting in behind the jensen and noting the ashblonde peter pan head that never turned to look sideways the occasional glint of emerald below her ear the way her eyes flicked obliquely upwards at the mirror and down again once the flash of a gold lighter her movements deft and her driving calculated as we ran into harcourt road and bore left along cotton tree drive at the next set of lights i went past her and got a clear visual impression in profile thin bony ratfaced attractive her head not turning the flash of an emerald ring as she used the ashtray then i was past and put three private cars and a taxi between us before i peeled off and made a uturn and came back to wait flower should have been on to me by now but he was looking straight ahead as he cleared the lights and i made the turn and fell in two cars behind beginning to worry because hed looked so young the top security departments were taking them straight out of school these days and letting them loose too soon a right into garden road and past the hilton and left again and slowing taking the smaller streets she knew her way and didnt hesitate any more than nora millicent tewson ever hesitated i was beginning to think about anything the hillman tried to stop in time to pull in somewhere behind her when she began slowing but there wasnt enough room so he went on past and left her looking for a slot i backed up and couldnt find one and put the capri under a strictly no parking sign and found cover and waited there were a few people about and flower wasnt far behind her when she came into view and crossed the road and went into the orient club i gave it ten minutes and followed you are a member sir all smiles but standing right in my path no would you care to take out a membership please he went on talking while i signed the form nothing more than a formality of course police regulations licensed as a private club many apologies for the necessity so forth one hundred hong kong dollars imperceptibly he had moved out of my path as i reached for my wallet and i was ushered between heavy curtains into the traditional ambience of incense and candlelight not a large place but pretty full the tables mostly in alcoves the waitresses eurasian and topless the men mostly in white suits and djs the women discreetly glittering some of them wives imported floorshow edwardian vaudeville half a dozen longlegged girls kicking their net stockings out those were the days and all that they got me a table and i began working picked her out over there near the band still alone at a table for three watching the floorshow smoking smoking rather hard and sometimes looking around the earrings catching the light not looking for anyone but at them flower was nowhere near her but perched at the far end of the bar looking bored when i was sure i asked for a telephone and a girl came and plugged one in directory enquiry can i help you please id like the orient club which club the orient just a moment across in the alcove she was lighting another cigarette looking up looking around but not at people coming in through the curtains she wasnt waiting for anyone they were bringing her first drink no cherries or anything fancy for nora tewson it looked like straight scotch enquiry gave me the number and i dialled she began on the drink straight away shes still very cut up macklin had told me orient club id like to speak to mr flower had to repeat it then had to spell it he is a member yes hed come straight in it wasnt the kind of place where you went up to lonelylooking women and asked them for a dance but someone was doing it an elderly and elegant chinese she was shaking her head a little too emphatically and he took a step back bowing quickly dissembling i suppose hed thought that by her looks she had more breeding not a very good judge mister fowler not here sir so i spelt it again and said he should be there because hed asked me to telephone him there were probably a hundred people here a lot of them on the small dancefloor now the girls were taking a break and they didnt want to go and look i quite saw their point in five minutes they got him and the bartender showed him the phone in the corner just inside the curtains hello im from london i said i came in on flight fiftythree the codeintroduction for the first to the fifteenth was to throw in a random number and listen for two below and four above worldwide all missions it saved trouble thats how we missed each other he said i was on three seven he was turning round slightly just enough to keep his eye on nora tewson i asked him when did they start the tag he turned his back on the room again blocking his free ear because of the band when did they what i suppose he wanted it straight from the book maybe he was collegetrained norfolk when did the subject come under opposition surveillance he didnt say anything for a bit and i began getting worried because it wasnt possible for me to tell whether he couldnt hear properly or whether he was having to think something out there wasnt anything for him to think out id asked him a perfectly simple question dyou mean he said shes being dont look round i said it sharply because hed begun turning his head the other way and for a second i didnt believe it he turned back to face the wall and i hoped hed begun sweating as hard as i was in a minute i said you mean you didnt know there was a short silence then he said oh shit it was about all he could say because he was obviously straight out of training so theyd given him the simplest job on the list and london had sent him a topranking shadowexecutive all the way to hong kong to tell him hed mucked it up i felt for the poor little bastard but that wasnt the point he was dangerous i looked for a waitress and let my eyes pass across the table for two on the far side from the bar the man hadnt moved he glanced at the tewson woman every five seconds away to the dancefloor back to the woman every five seconds policetrained possibly special branch but macklin had told me the enquiry into tewsons death had been closed i was waiting for him to look across just once at flower he was the thin tubercular chinese with glasses id noted in the lobby of jade imperial mansion and again in the fourdoor honda that had been three cars behind flower when wed turned into gloucester road and again when id been waiting in cover across the street from here shut up i told flower he was trying to talk i gave it another full minute the man was like a robot every five seconds and never varying never interested in anyone else never looking at flower a professional amateur with precise instructions dont let her out of your sight and doing his job to the letter flower yes sir youre off the hook they havent seen you he said bitterly that isnt my fault give him credit at least for knowing what hed done but hed been lucky and that was what made it potentially dangerous if that little policetrained robot had got on to him he wouldnt have stood a chance they could have roped him in and put him under intensive questioning and blown his cover finis worse they could have tagged him to any rendezvous that he and i might have made putting surveillance on me and forcing me to show my hand by throwing them off of course there were builtin failsafe factors and even if theyd caught him and put him under the lamp he couldnt have exposed the bureau or anything to do with it because hed never been there they dont let a raw recruit go anywhere near the place till hes proved hes safe and i hadnt on principle gone near him myself when id seen him stationed outside jade imperial any more than id gone near him when id come in here but it doesnt matter how hard you try to keep the safety mechanism operative you can make a mistake or have some bad luck and then all you need is someone like flower and the whole things going to blow are you here in the club flower was asking me hed asked me before and id told him to shut up just keep on looking at the wall but i was ready to drop the receiver and put the phone on to the banquette below tablelevel in case he took it into his head to look round anyway because with his lack of experience i didnt want him to be able to recognize me at any time or in any place until i was ready all right flower i want a quick breakdown on her travelpattern a couple of seconds went by and i wondered if he was normally as slow as this or whether it was nerves she goes quite a lot to jewellers and places like which ones erm the house of shen that was this morning and a place called constellation thats in where else kaisers and i think thats all she does she always buy something you mean jewellery yes come on flower well i cant be sure whether she then you bloody well ought to be theyve got windows havent they where else does she go he didnt get any faster but it was no good my taking the pressure off because i wanted to know things a whole lot of things this wasnt really my kind of operation macklin had told me he must have known id have flower to deal with shes been to the bayside club the danshaku and gaddis he was speeding up a little now and by the way he was standing i thought hed got a notebook shes had dinner twice at the eagles nest thats at the top of hilton right companions contacts you mean who does she meet oh nobody nobody at all not that ive seen i was looking across at her they had a cancan number warming up on the floor and she was leaning back one arm lying along the top of the banquette her bare shoulders pale and luminous in the lowkey light and her small head poised as she watched the dancers i wasnt surprised the elegant chinese had risked a snub by going over to speak to her and not surprised hed got it from flowers observations she was avoiding men avoiding people altogether still upset by tewsons death two months ago but not wanting to wilt alone in her apartment maybe this was where they used to come together here and the other places whats her usual timepattern she never leaves her pad before ten or eleven am and shes usually back before midnight unless away all day lunches out dines out yes she never goes home before eleven or twelve once shes left there in the morning she youd say she drifts around spending money or windowshopping killing time that kind of thing yes sir id say that i never takes a trip only kowloon shopping again drifting yes once she stayed overnight at overnight yes last sunday at the golden sands hotel a break in the pattern and i pressed him on this did she stay there alone meet anyone talk to anyone in the lobby in the bar not that he saw what was her room number one hundred and ninetytwo a notebook yes went on pressing him what time did she get there what time did she leave got him to think up a few of the questions for himself before i had to ask finally drained him dry on the routine stuff like where she bought her petrol what hairdresser did she go to theatres walk alone in the streets at night ever take a taxi instead of the car watching her from where i sat and trying to learn the things i couldnt see the things id have to know to reduce the risk of losing her when i took over the tag for a stretch then i let him go all right flower where are you based the wanchai hotel more of a boardinghouse really he gave me the address and i said listen youre offduty from now on till i contact you but youre on standby so dont leave your base at any time except between fifteen hundred and sixteen hundred hours on any day repeat fifteen and sixteen hundred and at no other time understood understood sir leave here now and dont look around where can i contact you if i have to you wont have to i hung up and put the phone on the banquette and watched him pay his bill at the bar and go through the curtains the thin chinese with the glasses was watching nora tewson and nobody else and i relaxed change this for me will you theres gin in it im sorry sir i thought you asked for gin and tonic no indian tonic ill fix it right away eurasian with a united states accent out of taiwan they all ought to be like that instead of the ones weve got in accounts in three minutes she was back and in fifteen minutes i saw the tewson woman ordering her third drink and i began working out what to do the george henry tewson dossier gave me quite a lot from his schooldays on through cambridge but missing out his job filling in relations contacts interests addresses vacation movements the marriage of course everything id need if i wanted to go across there and say well well well long time no see youre looking marvelous and tell me hows old george these days there was nothing she could do about it because i even knew his golf scores but it wasnt the way in for a lot of reasons london said theyd closed the enquiry into tewsons death so the thin man over there shouldnt be special branch and the policetrained thing didnt add up to a lot because most of the asian cells used people from official departments and he could be anyone anyone distinctly dangerous if i didnt wipe my feet her waitress had reached the bar of course he could be insurance because a couple of years ago tewson had been overdue with his fees at the golf club and his austin was three years old and theyd come out here on a package trip and by the way she was enjoying her widowhood hed either carried heavy life assurance in the uk or had known how to use a piggy bank or had taken out a shortterm bigfigure policy here in hong kong which might explain why the thin man was chinese i didnt think he was insurance her waitress was leaving the bar the long way in was to keep up the tag till i found out enough to signal london and ask for further briefing but that would take time and if nora tewson was the key figure in mandarin they wouldnt want me to sit back theyd pulled me in halfway through a tenday call and pushed me on to a plane and that could have been partly because they couldnt get anyone else to take this one on but it could have been totally because they wanted me to go very fast now theyd lit the fuse the thin chinese could be on the tag to see if she made any contact with anyone who knew george henry tewson or knew anything about his death or who wanted to know something about it so the only foolproof way in that would be fast effective and noncommittal was to make first contact as a complete stranger and in public going in deliberately under the opposition surveillance and making it quite clear that i knew nothing at all about tewson tewsons death or tewsons wife i got up timing it so that as her waitress reached the table i was there too pressing my way through the people towards the dancefloor and catching my foot on a chairleg the whole tray went down with a crash not just the glass better than id expected chapter four ming royal hong kong police fixed penalty ordinance notice of opportunity to pay fixed penalty motor vehicle registration mark code disc no was seen in at hours on in circumstances giving me reasonable cause to believe that a contravention of the ordinance particulars of which are given at overleaf was being or had been committed i took it off the windscreen and got into the capri starting up and moving off past the club looking for the jensen as soon as i was round the corner shed put it neatly in between some railings and a sandbin alongside the garden of someones consulate the flag over the building hung like a rag in the humid air there wasnt a parking slot anywhere so i took one end of the chain off the post in the side entrance to the consulate and ran the capri in there a dozen yards or so from the jensen and facing the right way in case i couldnt make final contact with her before she left the club then i walked back round the corner and through the ornate doors the gentleman forgot something what no i was double parked thats all i went to the bar and took a stool at the end near the heavy curtains in this area there was no backwash of light from the floorshow and i could watch the tewson woman and the chinese couldnt watch me because the ceilinghigh papiermache dragon was in the way indian tonic gin and tonic yes sir no listen indian tonic excuse me i youre perfectly welcome from here i could see the magnum of veuve clicquot and the dozen gardenias on her table but couldnt at this distance tell whether she was pleased with them or not the flying tray trick hadnt gone down too well christ shed said did you have to do that im terribly sorry thats not the pointlook at this indicating her model lame sheath patches of scotch all over it the waitress on all fours between us looking for the glass nora tewson with her hands on the edge of the table as if she were going to make a speech because the banquette was behind her knees and she couldnt stand up straight without support did i know how much this dress cost couldnt i see where i was going so forth really am very sorry such an exquisite dress be delighted to pay damages so on till she went off to clean up the waitress on her feet again excited because it had broken the monotony and this called for a suitable tip yes fifty hong kong dollars and this hundred is for a magnum of champagne look lets go to the bar i want it done before she comes back to her table the magnum hadnt been opened and she wasnt smelling the gardenias but i suppose she could have thrown the whole lot at the band i ssay dyou know thosethose gairls have got holes in those those net stockins of theirs wha i looked at him how can you tell he gazed back at me perched dead straight on his stool knees gripping the sides perfectly aware that in his present circumstances the c of g was critical expression of glazed outrage at my stupidity white cavalry moustache bridling wha what erzackly does that mean how can you tell he turned his back on me and raised his pearlfinish operaglasses again after wiping the steam off the lenses half an hour later a chinese chauffeur in white uniform came through the curtains and got him off the stool without a struggle and carried him out so cleverly that it looked as if he was walking an hour after that i saw her signing the bill and five minutes later as she came past the bar i was going across to the phone in the corner my back to her i must say you know how to apologize i swung round apolo oh the least i could do it was handsome tone much less sharp after four doubles id been counting them now the brittleness had gone she looked defenceless but would obviously bite off the first hand that moved too quickly i thought it best not to present it personally tone rueful rueful smile doormat please wipe her face went still and her eyes became fixed on me the pupils big in the neardark here by the curtains she couldnt have looked like this at me or any man sober pity you didnt she said fair enough may i see you home eyes thinking hard still fixed on me and i knew now why shed bite if anyone got too near for the same reason that any animal bites because its frightened yes thank you im clive wing her dark eyes stayed on me for another few seconds and then she turned her head away with a little jerk and i supposed that whatever the problem had been shed made up her mind about it it could have been the simple the obvious tewson had died over two months ago and thered had to come a time when she was ready to speak to men again and maybe it had come tonight outside in the warmth of the night air she tried to light a cigarette and i said let me have that and took the magnum im nora tewson she said and flicked the lighter shut as if making a point of it wed only moved a few paces from the doors and the chinese came out too fast and saw us and tried to go back and realized he couldnt and went on past us turning his head away to look up at the light across the acacia leaves walking briskly towards the corner the name rings a bell i said does it my cars down that way we began walking how did you come here in a cab because she wouldnt want to leave a brandnew jensen lying around and i didnt want her to see the capri the only thing was that if id been driving i could have got rid of the tag not overtly just playing the lights and the traffic but it might not be worth risking of the halfdozen theories in my mind the one i liked best was that tewson had been an agent in one of the london departments and had been knocked off by the opposition and his wife had been talked into a decoy operation in which case the thin man might not be a tag but a bodyguard that would explain her nerves beautiful job i said it was expensive she said and swung out past the sandbin clearing it by a couple of inches her anxiety state was prompting a steady release of adrenalin combating the alcohol the psyche was relaxed enough to let her forget her widowhood for the first time but her physical reactions were still good enough to drive this thing through the eye of a needle tewson i said thats teeeedoubleyew essohen how long have you been in hong kong i flew in this evening then you wont have heard the name i was here a couple of months ago she gave a slight resigned shrug then youve heard it the honda swung into the chrome frame of the nearside wing mirror and stayed there until she turned off gloucester road and headed south i counted five and the configuration moved into position again she drove as shed driven before her movements rhythmic and calculating her eyes always straight ahead as if she had to stare something down something in the future that would rush her into the present if she looked away and dropped her guard when thered been enough time for me to think back and call it to mind i said there was some kind of fishing accident wasnt there pause yes and you dont want to talk about it pause no the magnum was half empty why arent you drinking any clive too acid we were sitting on the thick hangchow carpet and she looked at me over her clasped knees are you trying to get me pissed youve been helping yourself she looked steadily at the magnum thats perfectly true god this stuff goes right through you doesnt it she said and went out for the third time fix yourself some scotch or whatever you want i looked around again the overall picture was inconsistent ming to the tune of ten or fifteen thousand pounds and then a lacquer table you could pick up in cat street for a song and in between them a brand new cocktail cabinet with chrome bamboo style legs imported from birmingham a nouveau riche with condescending friends whod told her where to buy the ming and hadnt been looking when shed done some shopping on her own but the total contents of this apartment would still pull in close on fifty thousand even at an auction and the tewson dossier said theyd come here for the last two years on a package tour no books no pictures no picture of george henry tewson even in the bedroom when shed shown me proudly round the whole apartment was just an expensive waitingroom to tell you the truth she said coming back and smoothing her lame skirt i do want to talk about it about what member you said i didnt want to talk about it oh yes well she tried to lift the magnum and i went to help her but she put it down again shaking her head id better not had i if you feel like it why shouldnt i ill put you to bed i bet you would she giggled and looked away and that was when the shivering began but i didnt think it was anything to do with sex at least not directly freedom or something ive just realized she said with a gutsy little laugh it wouldntve been funny if this bloody great bottle had been on that tray would it she lit another cigarette gold lighter dunhill that would have been a present this was where i could say well go on tell me what happened to him and just conceivably blow the whole thing how old are you nora little me thirtytwo why im a bad judge of peoples ages i wouldnt have thought she said with the frank stare starting again youd be a bad judge of anything no extramarital affaires the dossier said so far as is ascertainable this explained her little victorian innuendoes and frank stares and so forth it could explain the shivering too its time you threw me out i said and got up reluctantly and quickly she said i was going to talk about it wasnt i oh yes he was in the ministry of defence oh was he there must have been a good reason why london had kept this one out of the briefing and out of the dossier and maybe it was on the principle of never telling the ferrets what they dont have to know or maybe it had been part of the softlee softlee catchee monkee approach by that devious bastard egerton because he knows if he tried to sell me a conventional intelligence operation id only tell him to tuck it up his truss pretty important job i told her and knew instantly i was right on the nail it had been the only thing shed ever been able to say about george henry tewson the ministry of defence you know pretty important she said liking the phrase well i mean it was important that he worked there she uncurled off the carpet and stood with her hands clasping her bare arms not quite sure where to go actually his work wasnt important to tell you the truth as long as it was to him oh christ she said with a sour laugh it was all he ever thought about then she knew where she wanted to go and it took ten minutes for the whole trip back to england and then to hong kong for the first time all he could think about worked half the night sometimes i dont believe he knew i was there except when he wanted his meals still with her small ivorypale hands clasping her arms and she trod circles in the silk pile not looking at me once he wouldnt have gone across his own doorstep if i hadnt dragged him it was like getting a baby away from its bottle him and his sliderule dropping the cigaretteend into the neck of the magnum she was going to regret that it was spain at first the costa brava then i saw this ad about the exotic east and it she stopped moving and stood dead still and looked at me it really turned me on you know perfumes and jade and jewellery and all that sort of thing i suppose you think im childish said no he liked it in a way it was the fishing from this point she lost touch and most of the time forgot i was here it quite brought him out the first time we came a curl of her light hair falling loose as she talked her small stockinged feet silent as she moved across the carpet the nervous giggles more frequent and the memories more random though to tell you the truth it might have been the isle of wight as far as he was concerned everywhere was the same once hed got over the shock of leaving england for a couple of weeks gesturing now and saying suddenly and bitterly he never thought much about sex stopping just this once to listen to what shed said and then going on giving me the impression that she didnt really want to tell me about george henry tewson but about something much more urgent that she darent even mention so this would have to do giving her some kind of release i could have looked around at the ming and the cat street contemporary while i was listening because that was all id come here for to listen but she was using her body a lot couldnt keep still and i looked at that and the movements it made the way she shivered sometimes as she went on shed only meant to go in as far as her knees and it was up to her stomach now the tense trembling fear of going too tar the thrill of not going back talking to me all the time and none of the time about tewson then of course i found hed been putting it away in savings certificates and buying insurance and that kind of thing poor lamb her cigarette tracing smoke in the air as her feet did a pirouette thats how can live like this and quite honestly it makes a change my god i can go on once i get started you must be bored stiff said of course not then i thought no ill stay here and never go back at all i dont want to leave him you see the psychiatrist said i was right the one i went to he said id get over it quicker if i stayed here where george was then she just stood perfectly still in the middle of the room looking at nothing a girl with ivory skin and stockinged feet and a lock of hair and a sheath dress with stains where the scotch had soaked it her head turning slowly as she remembered me her dark eyes deepening you dont have to go do you no the shivering began again im so bloody frightened she said i walked north away from the cathay hotel going along kingston street and up as far as gloucester road without seeing any traffic not really expecting to at this hour three in the morning a patrol car slowed a little to check me going west and turned down cannon street the smell of the harbour came on the wind and a ship was hooting some way off three slows farewell it had been as if she hadnt slept with anyone for years or as if she knew it was for the last time an act of desperation and afterwards depression of course tugging the cigarette out with small sharp nails tearing the packet i dont even know who you are clive who are you so forth essential to ask her why she was frightened two reasons i wanted to know and shed expect me to ask no go did i say that i mustve been stoned furious with herself for having said it and with me for reminding her there was a taxi outside the excelsior and i got in mauritius hotel the streets swung past and i shut my eyes lingering flightdisorientation and nothing to have to watch everything under control one certainty she wasnt an agent either ours or theirs one probability tewson had been but there were inconsistencies because everything fitted so well and then came apart hed presented a classic cover in his dossier lowly work for a government department threeyearold austin and a few small debts and never travelling until spain and then suddenly hong kong three trips in a row and then careless leaving a widow no children all right started off in di ferreting around portsmouth and places then seconded or transferred to mi for missions abroad a feint in spain and then the far east theatre something strictly specific and confined to hong kong as a base for the south china seaboard area then the classic sequence approach from pekin temptation defection exposure elimination but not before hed been paid enough for his widow to blow it on ming chief inconsistency mi are a grotty lot but they wouldnt have given him the terminal handshake theyd have sent him back to london for the full fourteenyear stretch justice seen to be done so forth im so bloody frightened because shed known about it and couldnt stop it running but tewson had stopped running and she was still frightened so what was running now south and then west again into hennessy road a dark bundle of clothes on the pavement and some police around it the end of the opium trail we began slowing mauritius hotel the driver said i got out and paid and undertipped to provoke an argument because the lights werent too bright here and i wanted to make it easy oh all right then here you are but you people are bloody robbers and he went away happy as anything with a hong kong dollar i went into the hotel and nodded to the nightclerk when he woke up taking the stairs the firstfloor passage was conveniently long and i walked nearly to the end thinking it could of course have been nora tewson herself whod pushed the poor bastard into it like mrs tuckman she was hooked on money and there might have been quite a lot of it from mao if tewson had something they particularly wanted i got my keys and pushed one of them against the door of the cleaners closet and then opened it going in and shutting it nothing but bloody brooms everywhere pitch dark dont tread on anything there may be a bucket standing against the wall i thought the only thing shed said that was really interesting was about his work and even that had been clumsy pretty important well i mean it was important that he worked there actually his work wasnt important to tell you the truth most of what shed told me was in his dossier and the rest i could check on his cover had been something in technical or engineering design or research or development him and his sliderule she wasnt bright enough to make that up or deliver it without overacting some kind of cleaningfluid stinking to high heaven ammonia in it eyes accommodating now faint light from a ventilator above me i couldnt hear him but i didnt expect to there was carpet in the passage and hed walk quietly coming just far enough to note the number of the room next to the closet then going away the watch was probably changed at midnight this one was shorter and quite a bit older no glasses quite good turning away when id come down from her apartment and through the lobby nearly missed him and a morris not the honda keeping such a big gap that i thought id better stand there arguing with my cabdriver to give him a bit of time i dont even know who you are clive who are you got quite excited when id mentioned bullion id better pick up a tag tomorrow and take him to one of the dealers theyd given me in credentials and then lose him afterwards somewhere near the singapore check id given him enough time to reach the top of the stairs before i was halfway along the passage and there hadnt been any cover because the doors werent recessed so hed have had to wait there in case i turned round and from that distance and from that fine angle of view almost zero degrees he couldnt see if i were going into the closet or the room next door satisfactory given him five minutes to clear proposition she was still frightened so something was still running and she knew it and she knew what it was and london had given me the key to mandarin at the outset nora tewson but i didnt know if mandarin was their name for an opposition project they wanted me to penetrate or survey or destroy or the name of my own mission on the files and it was beginning to look a bit like a counterintelligence thing i didnt mind that it could be a legitimate penetration job either way and that was in my field somewhere to go into and go into alone a prescribed target and access availability and a safehouse for signals and refuge so far there hadnt been any problem since touchdown at kai tak id checked the safehouse made the contact with nora tewson noted the opposition surveillance gone in under it to develop the contact and established a false base room mauritius hotel the sole hazard potential was flower and as soon as possible id have him recalled to london turned the handle of the door and it took ten seconds to push it open one millimetre the diameter of the human pupil in artificial light field clear stairs lobby street check recheck clear i had to walk as far as the luk kwok before i found a taxi orient club you want nice chinese girl no just the orient club got out and paid him and watched him away recheck clear the street very quiet in the predawn hour no lights anywhere on this side of the consulate a haze of gnats floating below the lamp near the sandbin notice of opportunity to pay fixed penalty so forth put it with the other one some people collect absolutely anything these days check ignition wires and start up final check clear there were no messages for me at the hong kong cathay and i went straight up to my room and opened the door and froze its not only dogs the room was at the rear of the hotel and on the top floor it faced northeast and at this moment the first light was coming into the sky above the theatre and the trees in the park the shutters were half open the way id left them making a silhouette against the ashy light my cases were on the stand the way id left them its not only dogs that have a sense of smell the ability to sense alien presence in the environment or its recent presence all animals have it but in varying degrees of refinement in humans it has been atrophying over the decades since they began living with machines and relying on lights locks and mechanical systems but in creatures of the wild it remains highly developed in creatures of the wild and in those few of us who express and incur mortal enmity in pursuit of our complex purposes there was no actual smell that worried me in the short time id spent in this room i had become familiar with the subtle blend of sandalwood jute linen polish jeyes fluid and the ingrained odours of the human body nothing was different about the smell there was no particular sound from somewhere in the hotel i could hear the clack of mahjong pieces and the far faint jangle of an alarmclock but they werent loud enough to prevent my detecting human breathing in the room here if there were any human near me there was nothing to be seen but faint light shadows areas of neardarkness and various objects occupying positions familiar to me the shutters the cases shoes hotel literature doors lamps bathrobe everything i could see in the dim light was as i had seen it last the only cover in the room itself was under the bed and if a man were there he would be facing this way towards the door so i moved very fast using the bed itself as a springboard and spinning as i hit the floor on the other side and checked the space underneath against the light from the open doorway no i opened the bathroom door and threw the bathrobe in and waited two seconds and dropped and went in and looked behind the door no check wardrobe check window no point in checking the main doorlock for signs of tampering because in a small hotel you dont have to force a lock you get the concierge to turn his back on the keyboard for the required five seconds so everything was perfectly all right and i put the light on and shut the door and began checking small details id left the bottom corner of the hotel literature precisely lined up with the pattern on the table and the three drawers had been left pulled open a quarterinch at the righthand lefthand righthand ends from top downwards and the cases had been set with their top corners exactly touching the left rivet an inch lower than the right so forth it wasnt anything special we always do it and we do it with the speed of habit and we can check just as fast its absolutely foolproof providing the opposition isnt too professional but if its professional enough then you dont have a chance unless you go into the more refined mechanisms a hair across the wardrobe doors tautened between notches a dead match on the floor with the ash still intact ј pin balanced across the gap in the bathroom doorway i hadnt used these traps because no one had tagged me since id landed except for the two men surveying nora tewson and id made sure neither of them had tagged me to this hotel when id picked up the capri just now id been absolutely clear and id come into the hotel with security intact except for one factor if theyd wanted to they could have got my address the hong kong cathay i didnt think theyd want to because id gone in overtly to make the contact in the orient club and id let them tag me to jade imperial and later from there to the mauritius hotel there was no reason why they should suspect my cover no reason at all disregard discount the animal instinct ignore the slight raising of the hairs along the arms under their sleeves the prickling of the scalp the microwatt surge of galvanic force along the nerves of the spine dismiss and rationalize fatigue flightdisorientation unfamiliarity with the environment imaginative fears so forth very well because it was so very unlikely they would have taken any real interest in me so early so fast the young thin tubercular chinese had been policetrained and predictable he hadnt even noted flower in the surveillance area the older man had been much better and id nearly missed him in the lobby of jade imperial but hed been so cautious on the run to the mauritius hotel that id had to give him a full minute outside the place so he could keep me in sight the access to the mandarin target was prescribed and orderly it wasnt a nightdrop or a crashdrive or anything panicky like the tunis thing egerton and macklin and the administration in london had roped me in but they hadnt thrown me in theyd given me time to contact the key figure nora tewson and develop a relationship and the thing i had to do now was give her total attention until she showed me the way in and i sent for a director and set the action up and got moving so there was no reason for me to stand here in room of the hong kong cathay hotel with the instinctive feeling that someone had been here in my absence no reason because mandarin wasnt as big as that yet this was still the preliminary phase and id have to make a mistake or provoke them or get in their way before theyd extend their own routine surveillance of the tewson woman and move into my field on covert combat level if theyd been here this early and this fast it would mean that the initiative had already passed from the local cell or unit to the major directive not hong kong but pekin and i just didnt believe that had happened i wasnt prepared to credit the idea that within twelve hours of landing at kai tak airport i was faced with a mission that had started blowing right open in the primary phase sleep normal precautions pull the shutters and swing the catch throw the security bolt put a coin on the door handle and the two glass ashtrays on the carpet below a gesture to the needs of survival now that id rejected instinct last thoughts as i took off my things call her later today and listen to see if theyve got her phone bugged go and ask fleetway rentacar if anyones been trying to find out who hired the capri tell them about the carburation difficult to start and that could be critical on a tagging run there was a mosquito whining in the bathroom and i wondered what the humidity was in this place in september felt somewhere near eighty then i forgot about it because when i squeezed some toothpaste on the brush an airbubble popped and the stuff was too runny and i felt suddenly cold and thought i dont mind london offering me capsules but i dont like people putting the bloody stuff in my toothpaste chapter five flower where the hell have you been the light in the room was dim because i hadnt opened the shutters earlier bars of gold had appeared on the carpet as the angle of the planet relative to its local star had changed progressively now the beams of sunlight through the shutterslats were thinning again as i watched motes of dust drifted through them suddenly bright and then vanishing and i saw them with great clarity as i saw everything in the room ive noticed before that to miss death narrowly leaves you with your senses heightened these bright hallucinatory images were always there before but you were too busy to see them nowhere he said yes you bloody well have i phoned you fifteen minutes ago and you werent there oh i had to go and move the car he sounded surprised and aggrieved they wanted to unload a you couldve given them the keys couldnt you for christ sake bit of a pause then rather quietly yes sir i let it go id told the little fool to stay at his base at all times except between and hours and just now id phoned him at and thered been no answer from his room and theyd failed to locate him by page said hed gone out moving his car all right three minutes but three minutes could make a critical gap at a time when there had to be instant liaison the opposition believed i was dead and fifteen minutes ago they could have come in here to search the body and i might not have had time to do anything about it except to phone flower with a last signal so that control would know what had happened but he would have been moving his car i needed him today but tomorrow id have him on a plane for london before he could do any damage flower i said yes sir have you been on an active mission before no there was a click and i stopped to listen but it was one of the cleaners in the passage outside nothing on the line id checked it for bugs when id made the connection and we were clear listen i told him this operation has become extremely dangerous in the last few hours youll now have to follow my instructions with absolute precision for your own sake as well as mine someone knocked and i heard a key jangling and i called out for them to go away in ten minutes go and take up station at jade imperial and continue surveillance stay with the subject regardless of her movements but break off the moment you think youve been exposed break off at once and get right out of the field and leave a message here for me to the effect that mr jones has telephoned and will call again i made him repeat it and he got it wordperfect and i hung up and listened again to the sounds in the passage a trolley was squeaking one wheel offcentre and a girl was laughing with a high silvery sound they wouldnt have laughed like that if theyd come in here and found me on the bathroom floor with a blue cyanosed face i picked up the phone again and dialled good morning fleetway rentacar ill need something this evening what time dyou close eight oclock sir may we reserve a particular vehicle for you no ill be along i hung up and put the whole thing into the computer again and the answers came out the same unless thered been some kind of a breakin there must be a police link the field had been absolutely clear last night when id picked up the capri theyd tagged me from jade imperial to the mauritius hotel because id let them but they hadnt tagged me from the orient club to the cathay because id made sure they didnt id got here clean but theyd been here already got here before me and rigged the toothpaste thing just as they could have rigged a bomb sole possible link fleetway rentacar i checked the time at and went into the bathroom and put the tube into my pocket and spent five minutes throwing a whole web of traps around the room then i went out and put the notice on the door dont disturb id know if any of the staff went in there because theyd make the bed and everything then i was standing for a moment on the hotel steps looking around in the sunshine and catching the faint brackish tang of the harbour on the humid air loverlee morniang the boy said yes i didnt go down the steps it was a lovely morning and the sunshine was casting soft shadows in the street where cars were parked i looked particularly at the shadows and the cars the sensation of mortal vulnerability was intense for these few seconds even though i knew that the odds were in my favour if this hotel had been in the states or the uk or france i wouldnt have gone down the front steps at all id have used the service exit or a fire escape and got to the car very fast in the hope of disturbing their aim or at least dodging the shot countries vary and there are characteristic national and even regional tendencies towards the use of the rifle the knife the bomb the rope or the bare hands there are other aspects involved the need for speed silence accuracy anonymity so forth for instance in antwerp they blew hodgson apart with the slotmeter massage boy the instant he got into bed and exactly an hour after hed landed on a nightflight from paris because he was an experienced operator in a highly sensitive field and they wanted him out early and would have prepared backup techniques in case he didnt use the massage thing but in tunisia theyd hounded fyson for three days with a telescopic rifle and let him know it till his nerve went and he was taken out of the mission and found floating in tunis harbour it depends who you are what youre doing and how soon they want you out of the way theyd let fyson run because theyd wanted to know what he was doing before they went in and broke him up as a warning to the next man in a lot of factors are involved but the first consideration is the locality in the middle east they like the knife and the garrotte but the farther you come into the orient the more personal things tend to be because they can use their bare hands with more effect than a bomb and they can do it in almost dead silence they are subtle in other ways and sometimes exotic and in a place where they burn incense and eat birds nests and adulterate the wine with snake venom as an aphrodisiac you can expect to find kcn in your toothpaste the moment your name comes up want taxi no i walked down the steps and the skin reacted gooseflesh the nerves already feeling the impact and the penetration the ripping away of the bone then i was in the street and the sunshine was still bright and the soft air innocent they might be relying on the stuff theyd put in the bathroom it nearly always works because when youre cleaning your teeth youre usually thinking about something else it had worked with harris in mexico city and the police had blamed the tart he was with said she must have put it in his sangria i was checking the whole time as i walked along to where the capri was parked every car every window every angle of the rooftops because theyd got on to me so diabolically fast that i couldnt rely too much on the oriental preference for the bare hands they could be in so much of a hurry that their orders were to throw the lot at me whichever way i turned i knew when theyd got on to me right at the start of the tag last night when id taken up station behind flower and the tewson woman it had been the taiwanregistered toyota the one i hadnt liked the one id actually checked on and ignored like a bloody amateur theyd seen me hanging around jade imperial and theyd seen me take up the tag when flower moved off and from that minute they were on to me two months out of active operations and you lose the finetuned alertness that comes back to you as soon as youre in business again unless youve left it too late note there were three of them watching nora at least three the thin tubercular the shorter one and the man in the taiwan toyota the shorter one hadnt been in the toyota because he was working shifts with the thin man and theyd changed somewhere about midnight at least three logically four a lead tag and a backup for each of the working shifts it seemed a lot of attention for a poor little widow consoling herself on ming after her hubby had been drowned in that dreadful fishing accident there was a monsoon drain near the dark blue capri and i got the tube and squeezed the stuff out holding it below the level of the roadway it hung and dangled like a thin venomous snake then fell away as i flattened the tube and dropped that in too i hadnt left any traps on the capri so i had to go in cold not liking it starting with the front end and rocking it on the springs in case theyd put something in there with a pendulum detonator not liking it at all taking a look downwards through the drivers window with my hand screening out the reflections using the key and getting in and checking under the dash nervy and furious because i should have left routine traps around bloody carelessness id known mandarin was already running when id taken off from london wires okay but it wasnt nice turning the key and hearing the starter kick id seen what was left of the viceconsuls chevrolet in saigon bits everywhere and his scalp plastered against a tree got moving and turned west into leighton road flower would be leaving the wanchai district about now and ideally it would have been safer if id driven straight to jade imperial and got there before him cover the field and warn him if too many had moved in there this morning one tag and a backup were all right but things had changed since last evening they knew id joined the operation but i had to find out how theyd got on to me so fast it was important because it would tell me a lot of other things as well their capabilities techniques and something about their local contacts percival street going north so theyd picked me up in the toyota and when theyd seen me comfortably settled in the orient club theyd used a stock key off the bunch or put a cleaners coathanger through the moulding and got into the capri and poked around finding the papers in the glove pocket fleetway rentacar they could have rigged a bang for me on the spot but maybe there hadnt been time to fetch the necessary equipment or they hadnt felt a hundred per cent certain i was in opposition or they thought i was hong kong special branch and werent too worried didnt want to do anything terminal obviously theyd been on to flower just as fast and theyd been letting him run possibly to see what he was going to do possibly because they thought he was also special branch now they knew i wasnt theyd checked on me during the night and found out i was london intelligence and gone for me straight away working for quick elimination they were professionals out of pekin and theyd know the international networks we all did we all knew each other you cant go through ten or twenty firstline missions in ten or twenty geographical areas without the opposition sometimes getting a look at your face sometimes even getting a picture telescopic and fuzzy with grain but still your picture recognizable enough to go into the files last night theyd seen me operating a tag and theyd seen my face and theyd made signals and looked me up they might not know my name and they might not have a dossier on me but they knew i was london west into hennessy road and in four minutes i came up on the fleetway rentacar office with its windows one of them smashed thats right and patched up with cardboard and sticky tape till they could get it replaced i didnt even slow down no need just kept on going south along tin lok lane and then east again heading north after a while towards the excelsior no police link then theyd raided the capri outside the orient club and found the fleetway documents but they didnt have anyone in the police who could ask fleetway the name of the man whod rented the car they could have gone there first thing this morning and said a ford capri with this number had clouted their wing and not stopped who was the renter and what was his address so forth but they were moving too fast and they didnt want to wait for the morning and the office had closed at eight so theyd just broken in and looked at the books clive wing nationality british hong kong cathay hotel final phase theyd returned to their base the impressive building with the big brass doors at the corner of statue square overtly the bank of china covertly the party and diplomatic headquarters of the communist chinese republic in hong kong pekins listeningpost and window on the west they wouldnt have bothered to look up clive wing because cover names are only used once and they wouldnt find quiller on their books because its a code name and never used for cover or signals never used at all outside the doors of the bureau in whitehall theyd looked up the mug shots in the western intelligence section and found this particular scarred and bitteneared alleycat face with the cynical mouth and the watchful eyes the picture that some bright spark had managed to take when i was crossing the road or going through customs or feeding the ducks in bangkok or tokyo or seoul because theyre everywhere the chinese everywhere in asia a cell in every city and a plant in every consulate and theyll follow anything that moves theyll survey and observe and monitor every intelligence operation they can smell out whether it involves pekin or not theyd looked at the pictures and the man whod observed me outside the orient club and outside jade imperial mansions had identified me very well theyd said this man is london eliminate him i left the capri outside the excelsior and went in and used a phone and the ringing tone began flower had said she never left her pad before ten or eleven in the morning and it was now and i could have missed her and that would mean driving through her travel pattern in the hope of seeing either the hillman or the jensen and taking it from there but it had been near dawn when id left her this morning and she might want to catch up on her sleep so i let it ring eight times nine it didnt matter toomuch if her schedule was different today because part of my object was to meet flower get a complete report on every aspect of his surveillance take his notebook and then tell him to get on the first plane to london and dont come back i could make contact with him anywhere and at any time but the other part of my object was to ease myself into the tag watch her travel pattern and note the busy areas and short cuts and cover availability taking loops and coming back while flower manned the tag eleven rings twelve if i found more than two of the opposition in the field at jade imperial id warn flower off and order him to london straight away because there wouldnt be room for two of us if they were going to move into an actual guard action around nora tewson the mission had already gone into active phase and it could keep on changing as fast as an automatic gearbox all the way up through the range fourteen fifteen id left it too late id have to take the risk and hello this is clive i said slight pause and then a soft easy laugh oh and how do you feel this morning im only just coming down there was another soft little laugh and she said sleepily lets do it again thats why i rang i was having to think what to say because the bug was already there when shed opened the line they had a permanent threeway station operating thered been the slight kerlunk as the circuit had tripped in and now the line was hollow hoping you would she said would you like to go somewhere tonight the el caliph not tonight she said quickly and didnt say why tried to catch the tone to imagine what she would have added in explanation ive got to do my homework or my mothers coming round it was on that wavelength tomorrow yes what time shall i come dont come here ill meet you there at eight the el caliph room yes i tried every time to listen between the words and get the message her voice wasnt sleepy any more it was a little breathless secretive excited guilty not quite any of those things but all of them in her inexperienced way she was conducting an intrigue all right i said clive yes it came in an arch little rush ive never known anything like it you know nor have i my god i bet you have i said id never met anyone like her been searching all my life so forth repeated the time and place and let her ring off first an instant of regret as i put the phone down because if i ever met her again itd have to be without the ticks in tow and that was unlikely painfully inexperienced arch gauche coy but hungry and demanding like a halfstarved waif wanting to learn and then going for it hard the moment she got the message god ive seen them do this in a film wanting to do everything and do it now as if it was going to be for the last time clive i didnt know it could be like this some of the dialogue presumably from the same film though she meant it and finally you bastard for some reason oh you bastard meaning this too and leaving blood on me with her nails it seemed fairly clear that shed made the mistake of marrying a sliderule and couldnt think of anything to do about it except play about with a flickering projector in a girlfriends cellar slight progress made id confirmed they had a bug on her phone and there would obviously be others here and there among the ming she didnt know about it or with her victorian attitudes she wouldnt have said what she did on the phone just now and she certainly wouldnt have done what she did last night another point of interest was that she couldnt meet me tonight because she had to do something she didnt particularly want to do and conceivably she had to do it in room at the golden sands hotel because flower had told me that the only time shed made a definite movement was when shed gone expressly to that hotel and stayed the night if they picked me up today and i shook them off theyd know where to find me again if i checked out of the cathay or at least theyd think they knew i supposed id have to send another magnum and a dozen gardenias or something to the el caliph room tomorrow night that snivelling old crone in accounts was going to fracture a whalebone at this rate the sunshine bright as i went down the steps the smell of the sea much stronger here the ragged banners of the sails in the typhoon shelter and the throbbing of power boats want taxi sir yes because they knew the dark blue capri i left it when it was and got into the cab this is for you i gave him ten dollars you drive the way i tell you and therell be another ten when youve finished whats your name kwan not much more than a kid a bit scared of me eyes very wide didnt know who i was knew i wasnt the police or id have just flashed my id all right kwan get down into yee wo street and head for causeway road quick as you can but dont break the speed limit unless i tell you if i break speed limit i lose licence and they shut up and start driving i began checking for tags the moment he turned left into cannon street the odds against a tag at this point were a thousand to one and thats one of the ways you can get pushed right off your perch by thinking what the hell its a thousand to one were all right i told him to take sugar street and turn left and make one slow pass through the operational field and i saw the toyota parked under the trees by the park entrance and the hillman a hundred yards farther north kingston street i told him quickly and he did rather well most people would have overshot and wed have had to traipse all the way round the block and come back and risk losing the action and showing our hand by blinding along to catch up very good kwan now go to the end and turn round and stop it was an hours wait i wondered if she was changing her schedule like this because shed spent a sleepless night and was tired or because it had some bearing on the fact that she was going to break her routine again tonight this man is london yes eliminate him theyd done it before of course if this man had been hong kong police or hong kong special branch theyd have let him run for as long as he wanted to thered been an official enquiry into tewsons death and either of those departments could have decided to reopen it unofficially by watching his widow for a bit see what they could pick up i was damn sure this pekin cell was confident theyd never pick anything up even if they went on looking forever so why make a fuss and get in their way if this man had been washington or moscow or paris or bonn they would have shot out a foot and asked him what the hell did he think he was doing but this man was london and he had to die with his teeth clean just as the other man who was london george henry tewson had died with his feet wet jensen kwan hillman please toyota follow that toyota he nodded and stood on it and i nearly got whiplash going down through the park i said notice that its dark grey and rather dirty and that its registered in taiwan remember it has that aerial on the roof try and keep two or three cars between you and the toyota because i dont want him to see that were following him all the time if theres anything you dont understand ask me is okay all okay good down leighton road and heading southwest jensen hillman toyota taxi christ all you wanted were the flowers i didnt tell him to keep an eye on his wing mirrors as well because hed have quite enough to do in the lunchhour traffic his offside mirror was too high from where i sat but the righthand end of the interior mirror gave me a couple of inches if i sat well in the corner and the chrome on the pillar beading was nice and clean and picked up primary colours i wasnt really expecting an easy ride they knew i was london they knew my face and they knew i was interested in nora tewson wherever she went theyd look for me and you can calculate fairly precisely all other things being equaljust how long you can keep up a tag in a taxi before they get the vibrations and close in it isnt very long the knife flashed and the skin of the pineapple came away like a flower unfolding his hands were so quick that i was reminded of a stoppedaction film the fruit seeming to peel itself in a series of jerks without anyone there one of the americans was crouched on his knee squinting and turning the focus ring of his camera and three small chinese children stood porcelainstill and hand in hand watching the fruit seller with their luminous black eyes unblinking the jensen was parked a hundred yards away near queens road central and i could see most of its windscreen from here it was pointing this way and couldnt go anywhere without passing me a uturn was impossible on this stretch and there werent any side streets available her bright head moved in the sunshine and she stopped again they were mostly jewellery shops in this area i couldnt see the hillman because flower hadnt been able to find a slot when shed pulled in so hed come past and left it somewhere out of sight passing me on his way back to look for her he didnt see me or know i was there it was much brighter than it had been in the orient club last night and i saw him clearly for the first time a rather intenselooking boy with a tudor haircut and very pale skin a lot of pens clipped inside his breast pocket one of them probably full of tear gas they go in for gadgets at that age i couldnt see the toyota either but i knew where it was wed all been here a good thirty minutes and id taken a loop on foot to see if there were any short cuts available in the travel pattern flower had given me along hillier street and down jervois nothing but bloody snake shops they give me the creeps and back into queens road finding the toyota and passing it and coming up far enough to see the jensen it was the thin one with glasses and he was standing over there at the entrance to the silk emporium i still wasnt quite sure but it had looked very like a sudden pincer movement wed been tooling along des voeux road in line astern when a bus had pulled out and three or four cars had bunched two of them quite unnecessarily because they could have got past without any trouble i just left ten dollars on the seat and was inside the dry cleaners and out through the back before anyone had time to ask any questions picking up a taxi in wing kut street and telling the driver to wait because id been quicker than the traffic the jam was just clearing and i saw the jensen coming past and told him to slot in there no harm done and i had in fact seen the doors of those two cars coming open when theyd bunched behind the bus though of course they might have just decided to get out and walk such a lovely lot of windows here to look at so forth the smell of pineapple was in the air and the man was telling me i ought to buy one it was pure and delicious and quenching so i moved on he was quite right static surveillance from obtrusive corner was asking for it if that really had been a pincer attempt in des voeux street a rickshaw man went padding past the wickerwork creaking a pair of girls on the seat laughing delightedly cest mieux que le metro mais un peu plus cher the sunshine of the early afternoon was slanting across the rooftops lighting the windows on the other side of the street where it was reflected across the two lines of traffic i saw her bright head moving again as she turned away from me and began going towards the jensen the lights had changed and a no doubledecker was leading the pack from the wellington street intersection and for a couple of seconds i couldnt see the thin chinese then the traffic strung out a little and i had him in sight again he hadnt moved she hadnt stopped anywhere for lunch yet wed been kept on the move the whole time since wed left jade imperial and i needed a chance to break off and get closer to flower and make a rendezvous for whenever she holed up somewhere then i could get his report and take his notes and tell him to book a flight she was nearing the jensen now and the next phase was ready to open the chinese would wait till she was in the car and then hed turn suddenly and come down this way on the other side with that gangling headforward walk of his and be in the toyota with the engine running by the time she came past id have time to make a brush contact with flower and give him the rendezvous and let him get to the hillman but it didnt work out that way because when she reached the jensen i looked at flower to make sure hed seen he obviously had he was turning and making his way down on the other side hurrying a little and trying not to show it the pavement was a bit crowded and as far as i could see he stepped off the kerb at the wrong time and someone shouted and there was the fling of an arm and then a long red smear where the wheel of the bus went dragging chapter six breakthrough wai what is the goose it is gold this is for london immediate wait i listened carefully thinking he was warning me yes hed just been getting a pencil mandarin they picked the flower wing could hear his breathing as he wrote it down hed been in the shop below when the telephone had rung yes please repeat wait mandarin they pick the flower wing yes picked i spelt it yes picked thank you then i got fleetway and said id left the capri outside the excelsior and they could pick it up there and id see them as soon as i could to sign the papers and they said theyd prefer me to bring the car in personally and complete the formalities and i said they wouldnt be in business long if they didnt learn to cooperate feeling savage wanting to curse everybody just as one does when its been ones own fault i cant stand a messy death i dont mean the smear bit i mean a death that doesnt do anything doesnt mean anything thornton did it the right way thornton above all people hit the caucasus mountains headon with a twinengined petrov x trying to dodge the missiles they were sending up from the base at krasnodar one big bang and no heel taps the whole of the bureau laughing all the way to codes and cyphers with the stuff hed given the queens messenger in odessa complete blueprints of the submarine complex and defence installations with blownup photographs if youve got to go do it like that bobbie oh hes fine i think hes off abroad again you know some sort of government work to do with the consular staff welfare scheme i believe thats what he told us yes we do miss him of course we were hoping hed go into arthurs bank but there you are so long as hes happy thats the main thing isnt it a long red smear down the street and my fault because i should have kicked him out of hong kong last night when id seen he was low calibre and dangerous and too young to be out alone theyd let him run because theyd thought he must be special branch and then theyd picked me up and seen it was intelligence and finished him off the thing they were running was so big and they were so determined to push it through that they werent even interested in asking questions when the opposition turned up they just moved straight in for the kill i left the phonebox and went out to the street again there was a case for asking london for a director because the pressure was coming on hard but there wasnt anything to report yet there was no breakthrough the key to the breakthrough was nora tewson and shed gone id had to cross the road and go up there to make sure theyd been thorough and she was already coming past in the jensen before the traffic began jamming up around the accident there wasnt a taxi in sight and id been tempted to wave to her well well well fancy seeing you here take her to lunch get everything i could out of her but that would have been expedience not design the jensen was a death trap and i left it alone edging back from the knot of people and finding an alley and getting clear checking with every step because they were still here somewhere in the area the alley led on to kwong yuen street and i turned right and hurried but couldnt see her car there was a taxi near the intersection and i got in and we did the whole travel pattern starting with the house of shen constellation kaisers and the places shed stopped at earlier in the day in case she was looking for something specific and trying to make up her mind doubling back no go at four oclock i picked up a taunus from fleetway and went to the standard office back numbers department giving them the date i needed the report took some finding because the tourist trade is a major industry in hong kong and they like to feel that everything looks just as it does in the brochure tragic death of british visitor page ten one small photograph of george henry tewson the same as the one i had in my briefing file and obviously from the same source undistinguished glasses indefinite age there wasnt anything i hadnt been told already i asked if i could use their phone before i left but she wasnt in the selfdisgust about letting that poor little devil get caught in the machinery like that had so far kept my mind off the present situation the present situation was that the key figure in the field was changing her routine tonight for the second time and it could be critically significant and i wasnt going to be there unless i tried everything in the book and had some luck as well on my way back to the cathay i stopped to buy a pair of bushnell x s with a field and ultraviolet niters because jade imperial mansion was a quarter of a mile from the hotel and i might risk holing up there for another few hours if the binoculars could give me a reasonable view of the entrance gates the jensen normally used there was a chemists next door to the optical place and i went in and bought some more toothpaste neodens safeguards your health more than you could say for the last lot i parked the taunus in st pauls hospital and walked down cotton path into tung lo wan road crossing it and keeping on going round past the theatre into causeway road checking the windows of room shutters still closed a gentleman had telephoned three times they told me at the desk a mr chou he hadnt left his number it hadnt been flower and it hadnt been chiang and no one else knew me in the whole of hong kong i said i was going out again this evening but id let them know when i left so they wouldnt have to page me if mr chou called again then i went upstairs they must have been very quiet or the management would have heard about it by now every drawer was upside down and the carpet was off the floor and draped across the bed theyd prised several boards up and stripped some of the wallpaper and turned off the pipetap in the bathroom and dragged the cistern away from the wall taking down the air conditioner grilles unscrewing the wall plugs and turning the wardrobe on its side to get at the bottom the lamp brackets were on the floor with the wires pulled out of the swannecks and the bathroom door handles were off and lying on the windowsill the base was off the phone but it worked and i dialled and waited for ten rings but she didnt answer it took an hour to check for booby traps even though i didnt need to move more than a few things clothes shaver toilet bag so forth the shoes werent any good because theyd taken the heels off i was sweating a lot by the time id finished but id decided to do it instead of just walking out and rekitting at lane crawfords because i wanted to know if they thought i was green enough to blow myself up in here and to know if theyd rigged something for me anyway if they hadnt it could conceivably mean they were going to let me run till they could bring me down and interrogate as a general rule you dont ferret your way into their operation by picking their locks you do it by picking their minds i tried again twice during the hour ten rings each time the cover line being i missed her and was she sure she couldnt make it tonight oh well have fun if she answered i was going to take the taunus along caroline hill road and work north and find somewhere convenient for starting the tag when the jensen showed at the gates she didnt answer i was still drawing blank at hours now that theyd been here again and mr chou had started breathing down my neck i didnt feel like opening the shutters wide enough to take the x s because they might have put a man on the peep down there or in a building nearby and just the glint on the glasses could be fatal the maids could come in any time now to turn down the bed and things wouldnt be easy for them so i took one of the suitcases and went down and checked out at the desk very pleasant yes and what a wonderful view but my office had called me back another strike yes wouldnt it be excellent if they could only run things in england as they ran them in hong kong crossing the road to the hospital car park i felt the nape of my neck tingling it was normal but uncomfortable and there was nothing i could do about it they hadnt rigged anything for me but it didnt mean they might not use some other method when they were ready the thing is as soon as you start working in a sensitive field youre going to attract attention and as often as not youre going to be put on the opposition list right at the top if they think you look like getting in their way the deeper you go into the tunnel the more difficult its going to be to come out again alive its no good digging a hole and waiting till theyve gone because theyre not going to go and you cant run your mission by remaining immobile so all you can do is settle for the situation and check every shadow every sudden movement and try to make sure therell be time to duck and of course ignore the snivelling little organism thats so busy anticipating what its going to feel like with the top of the spine shot away why dont you run for cover trying to make you wonder why the hell you do it why you have to live like this youll never see moira again if you let them get you trying to make you give it up when you know bloody well its all there is in life to run it so close to the edge that you can see what its all about a chill at the nape of the neck ignore cerebrate start worrying over something real the way theyd switched tactics as soon as id arrived on the island theyd got on to me and moved straight in for the kill failing with me and succeeding with flower and taking not the slightest interest in asking questions suddenly theyd decided to ask a whole lot of questions up there in room without even leaving anything terminal for me to walk into i knew it wasnt from consideration for innocent persons this was a pekin operation and if a hong kong chambermaid went in there first and caught the blast itd serve her right for having deserted the daughters of the peoples liberation army to work for the wicked capitalists across the water one aspect was fascinating did they really think anyone from london would leave his cypher key stuffed in a lamp bracket for them to find they must be thinking of the russians the taunus was all right id left traps there wasnt any need to look under the facia but i looked just the same from habit the face was at the window as i straightened up are you visiting the hospital a chinese nobody i knew no he wagged his head would you please not park here unless you are visiting hospital all right we have sometimes many people park here and no room for i wont do it again thank you hospital is for emergency and if people park here we cannot get ambulance up to doors so oh use a bloody shoe horn start up and back out and turn not at all polite but it was beginning to look as if id missed the boat and i wasnt very happy there were two chances left ring every restaurant and supper club on the island and set up a temporary base at the golden sands hotel it was in telegraph bay and there were some hill roads to it but i took the major route through victoria and down past the university peeling off along the meandering drive that led to the beach the golden sands was long low exotic and recently built with vines and creeper still trying to cover the pagodas and terrace walls a small group of people were down on the private beach playing with a dog the only others i could see outside the place were a man and a woman stowing the sail of their boat at the jetty two or three motorlaunches were throbbing in the channel one of them leaving a wake that had curved away from nearer the shore possibly from the jetty here dyou have a room facing the beach at the golden sands the focus of social life would be on the beach at the poolside and along the two lower terraces i will see he said looking a little worried that he might have to disappoint me but with only half a dozen cars down there and the terraces deserted i had an idea things might turn out all right we can offer you this one sir if its just for one night room second floor view taking in the jetty the hong kong lifestyle was maritime and there could be as much traffic to and from the hotel by sea as by road i stayed in the room for less than half a minute to check security points and then went across to the terrace bar at the front because you could watch the road from here and anyone arriving by boat would take the lanternlit magnolia walk past the end of the building coming around to the entrance small girls in glowing cheongsams their feet making no sound no i said indian tonic there was a phone and i started work ten rings for jade imperial mansion and then the rounds beginning with the ones in her known pattern the bayside club the danshaku gaddis the eagles nest even from the front of the building you could hear the noise of the power boats and i kept one ear open in case any of them came across to the jetty two cars arrived two couples their voices floating up through the dusk way to come know but felicity said it was a simply fabulous place for fish headlights moving along the main road through pok fu lam yes i think table reserved in name tewson the harbour room a hit and a miss because i was here not there for tonight yes sir what time i think excuse me lady cancel table she what lady cancel table not come tonight hugos the man wha the tai pan grill trying kowloon now as well as the island no go every time a negative trying the miramar as the low grey jensen came round the curve of the drive and parked under the row of lanterns she was alone small neat steps that would have left footprints in a dead straight line not turning her head as she came towards the doors not looking upwards i had a cover line if she saw me here but it might be dangerous better she didnt see me turquoise tonight a discreet shower of sequins her midriff bare where the mole was though i couldnt see it from here the honda arrived within ninety seconds and although the driver didnt get out i could see it was the short chinese the one id taken to the mauritius hotel a whiff of exhaust gas came on the air i went to the top of the double staircase and looked down not every word was distinct but there wasnt any delay at the desk the room had been reserved the boy was taking her to the lift her short hair bright as she passed below the lamps it stopped at this floor and i was in my room when they came past a breath of something by faberge shed told me she always seemed to go for the expensive ones she didnt know why she wandered for the next half an hour among the few people who had moved on to the lower terrace not speaking to any of them not looking anywhere in particular but sometimes at the sea drinking three vodkas in a rowtwice going along the lantern path under the magnolias so that i had to use the binoculars to keep her in sight among the shadows there then she got fed up and came back her steps quicker and her bag swinging and sat at one of the tables not far below my windows clasping her bare arms and swinging one foot all the time now and then swatting at insects taking calculated intervals i got out the map from the briefing material and spread it on the bed looking at it for half a minute in every five directorate of overseas surveys series l sheet hong kong cape daguilar area grid zone designation q very close to grid ref roughly in the centre of tai tam bay macklin or egerton or someone had put a red cross tewson drowned from boat here peripheral features tai tam village prison at tung tau wan lo chau island turtle cove beach a second reference blue cross slipway where tewson hired boat also witness and this was yards from the centre of the bay where the red cross had been marked witnesses and were two of the chinese fishermen who had seen tewson in trouble a green cross marked the point on turtle cove beach where tewsons papers had been washed up later submarine contours gave only fathoms within a yards of the shore near the slipway fathoms for the general bay area she hadnt moved the report was attached to the map approximately twelve noon tewson hires boat from mr tsai game weight tackle alone on board as before there were some bits about tewsons being noticed by several people coastguards narcotics officers the crews of fishing junks approximately hours several others including the four key witnesses see tewson in some kind of difficulty mr fu jenchang sees boat rocking flurries in water silvery flashes on surface mr yung lungkwei fisherman on junk within yards of tewsons boat sees him struggling with what appeared to be a fish just prior to his overbalancing and falling in another witness a woman laughed suddenly below and i went to the window thinking it might have been nora but she hadnt moved and no one was talking to her from here she looked small and somehow significantly alone untouchable sitting there with her secrets trying to drink some of them away i wondered where shed been that day whether shed been on the slipway watching the distant blob of the boat when her husband had struggled with his fish and lost i wondered whether she had known it was going to happen this event that had brought so much change in her fortunes there were still beats out on the channel their lights making patterns across the still water and one of them was swinging in a curve towards the jetty the throb of its motors fading to a murmur it was the fifth id counted since nora had gone out to the terrace and three of them had left their mooring again shed watched each of them as theyd arrived and she was watching this one not leaving the table but keeping her small head angled attentively i picked up the x s again and focused them on the jetty the glow of the lanterns left shadows and i could have seen better by the more diffuse light of the moon that was just rising a small group of men one of them remaining with the launch as the others began moving towards the building the womans laugh came again from below but i didnt look away there were four of them three wearing white shirts or jackets i as i went on adjusting the focus i saw that two of them hung back a little as they came under the terrace lights the details were immediately clearer three chinese and a european two of the chinese hanging back quite a few yards the other chinese walking side by side with the european who wore some kind of bush jacket and a pair of sunglasses i got this man into sharp focus and studied his face for a moment and then put the binoculars down as he saw someone and gave an awkward little wave of his hand nora had left her table smoothing down her dress and going to greet the two men the chinese holding back a pace the two others remaining by the pagoda some dozen yards away the european embraced nora kissing her on the cheek a shade embarrassed nora a shade cool and breaking away rather soon perhaps because theyd all kept her waiting for nearly an hour i shut the window quietly and went to the phone a girl answered and sweat broke out on me at once because we were going to have to work very fast mandarin had shifted gear again kicking hard into phase three and we had to go with it he come the girl said briefing said the arrangement was that chiang would remain on close call continuous throughout this operation but that didnt mean he could go and yes goose gold so forth for london urgent immediate coded numerals he didnt answer getting his pad ready yes i gave it to him in cantonese there didnt have to be any mistakes there were two signals but the first was the most urgent saam yat boat saam extended phase digits leong say leong sup saam reverse transfers for the sake of speed yat look boat throw in a suffix group of three fives repeated to cancel any inadvertent alert in case he left an omission in the blanks read back he was quicker in his own tongue only just giving me time to phrase it mentally in english but hed got it all right first go need director fully urgent tewson alive chapter seven overkill the sea was dead calm a flat blue shimmer of light reaching to the hills of lamma island half seen through the haze the water near my feet lapped softly across the big smooth stones swirling around the piles of the breakwater it was nearly dawn the man under the lookingglass tree hadnt moved i put the binoculars up again the jetty of the golden sands hotel was half a mile away and the launch was still there a figure was moving about on it opening the engine hatch and half disappearing and i thought if he was going to start it up it would mean theyd be leaving soon and there was nothing i could do about it nothing relax youve asked for the impossible so dont start bellyaching because its not going to happen five minutes later the island across the channel became suffused with a rose light and the man under the lookingglass tree lifted his arms beginning the movements of tai chi chuan he was about sixty or seventy yards from where i stood and hadnt yet seen me part of my frustration was due to the fact that nothing apparent had happened since id sent the two signals last night chiang had got them off before hours and id sweated it out till midnight to give egerton time then i rang chiang again will make attempt london had said chiang told me the signal had come in at hours that was pretty fast considering the action theyd had to take my first request wouldnt have been any problem macklin had told me during field briefing that theyd probably fly someone in from pekin to direct me in the field and he was probably here already holed up with all those bloody snakes and asking chiang where the hell id gone it was my second request that would have shaken them up a bit id asked for a high speed power boat to make rendezvous with me at this precise point the twelvepile breakwater half a mile north of the golden sands hotel in telegraph bay soonest possible essential before dawn london was six thousand miles away and i didnt know how they were going to do it i just knew they had to if egerton hadnt played it so close to the chest they could have put a director into hong kong with me and there wouldnt have been any trouble he would have tickled up the navy or a private smallboat fleet operator and i would have been on board by now thats what a director in the field is for sometimes egerton is too clever by half the man under the lookingglass tree was bending and swaying bringing his spirit into harmony with the rhythm of the universe as the rose light turned gradually to gold on the hills of lamma binocs nobody moving anywhere outside the building itself two chinese boys trying to get a sail up near the end of the jetty could only be to air it there wasnt any wind the man on the launch was shutting the engine hatch and in a few seconds i heard the slight thump of the timber a minute later the throb of the engine began fatalism now necessary either london would do something in time and wed still have a mission or london would be too late and we wouldnt nothing i could do of course i wasnt certain it had been tewson the european in the bush jacket and sunglasses but hed looked like the photographs the one in my briefing file and the one in the hong kong standard and his greeting of nora and her response had been precisely in character with what i knew of their relationship theyd been meeting probably for the first time since flower had tagged her to the golden sands and theyd met in the presence of strangers or at least alien acquaintances theyd kissed but not like lovers it had been a gesture of almost anything but lovehabit convention the need to demonstrate a token affection leaving nothing for the neighbours to say i wasnt sure it was tewson but id bet on it because the whole thing fitted in with her attitudes towards me and her behaviour at jade imperial as a young widow released from a sexless marriage her eagerness archness and inexperience had been predictable but it hadnt explained her sense of guilt and intrigue she wasnt just having an affaire it was an extramarital affaire hindsight makes you look a fool i should have known two nights ago that tewson was alive the engine of the launch was still running and i lifted the xs again not wanting to making myself because if tewson put to sea and i couldnt follow and find out where he went the only lead would be nora again and shed have to be worked on and that would mean asking london for one of the psychos and hed have to come all the way out unless they could rake one up from the embassies or consulates in pekin or taipei or tokyo and start from scratch and it could take weeks to break her down and get what he wanted without her knowing and all id get out of it was a free ride home and a stomachful of adrenalin what the hell was london doing i didnt want the bloody guards called out i just wanted a boat for christs sake and i wanted it now it wouldnt have made much difference if id used speech code instead of cypher it would have saved maybe a few minutes but no more than that because c and c were open twentyfour hours and thered only been two signals to unzip and besides it would have been highly dangerous they picked the flower was perfectly safe because even if it was intercepted and its meaning understood it didnt say anything they didnt already know it was a whole lot different asking for a director to come out to the field it not only meant the operator had got hold of something big enough to need direction but that he was going to try for immediate penetration a tacit declaration of war that would bring in their troops and their supply line was a few miles long from here to the south china coast with ours having to stretch half across the globe the second signal ordering a boat and specifying the rdv couldnt have gone in any other way but cypher it was fully urgent and strictly hush and if the opposition had intercepted and decyphered it theyd have just sent someone down here to the twelvepile breakwater half a mile north of the golden sands hotel in telegraph bay with orders to tread all over my face the man had finished his calisthenics under the lookingglass tree and was walking slowly up the beach to his fishing boat i wasnt worried about him he could have tagged me here from the hotel and semaphored the entire book of mao if hed wanted to but he hadnt his movements had been genuine tai chi chuan and id made certain that no one was tagging me when id come down here the immediate field was totally secure there was movement now and i refocused two figures detaching themselves from the edge of the building one white one darker indistinct because the line of magnolias was in the way more movement this time on the far side of the pagoda two figures again both white the same stature their motion coordinated a slight burst of noise from the launch as the seaman cleared the cylinders the darker figure stopped looking up at one of the firstfloor windows and even at this distance and with no depth of field i could see his awkwardness as he waved his hand then they were filing down to the jetty forming the same kind of procession id seen last night i estimated that mandarin had another two minutes to run london was six thousand miles away but theyd got a radio hadnt they got a telephone for christ sake this wasnt an alien state it was a crown colony and they could pull some rank couldnt they and what the hell was the minister doing about this the one they were so bloody proud of because he could cut through the red tape in ten seconds flat hadnt anyone picked up the blower and got him off the pot sweating like a pig the seaman was in the stern handing his party aboard and the launch heeled slightly to their weight two of the figures were going into the cabin one of them the man in the bush jacket george henry tewson the man from london dead on paper killed off by bought witnesses at the dictates of clandestine necessity the man at the centre of mandarin alive and well and vanishing from sight as the stern went down and the exhaust note bubbled to a roar within thirty seconds the launch was a small indistinct blob half lost in the morning haze and i lowered the binoculars mission aborted am returning to london because there wasnt anything else i could do tewson was i being released periodically on some kind of parole and he might come here again but it wouldnt be for another week unless they changed the pattern id already got as close to nora as i could without getting killed and if i stayed in hong kong for another week i wouldnt have time to do anything but keep out of their way and hope to stay alive but that wasnt what i was here for all london could do was send one of their tame mindbenders to work on nora tewson and by the time hed produced results id be somewhere else and stuck into a different jumble sale helsinki if i could twist their arm there was a ministry scandal blowing up and we all knew it was nikolai again and wed have to stop him aware at the edge of my thoughts that the sound of the launch remained steady even though it was on the horizon now they were going to go straight through the roof in london because they hated a mission to abort it meant someone had blundered i supposed it was something to do with the acoustic properties of the east lamma channel there was an echo coming back from the hills over there making it seem that the launch was stationary at full speed so what did we do we lost yet another of those poor little wretches they always put in the field too early and we had all the paper off the wall at the hong kong cathay and we ran out of toothpaste london was going to fire egerton from a cannon every tuesday at the horse guards parade for as long as they could find anything to put back in the barrel but the direction of the sound had altered too and i turned my head the damn thing was nosing inshore losing way some kind of police boat i hadnt seen it because the binoculars had been stuck in my eyes the engines dying to a slow boil three smartlooking officers in the stern and watching me but not making any sign in case i was the wrong man i went along the breakwater like a monkey jumping from pile to pile and trying to keep my balance along the horizontal timbers the launch was standing off quite a big vessel twin screws couldnt come in any closer take time to lower the boat it was up to me really one of them grabbed me as i fell aboard can you move off are you mr wing we received can you move off immediately look you see that boat on the horizon his head swung like a perched hawks when it sights prey he was a neat young chinese thin as a string all cappeak and cheekbones his eyes locked on the distant sea you wish me to follow if its not too late he moved a hand in a signal to the bosun and nearly had me in the water as the stern dipped and the deck lurched sending me against the rails he was calling something to me above the roar of the engines what i shouted are you mr wing yes captain liu tsetung narcotics division the wind was whipping at our faces now and he led me into the cabin i caught the scent right away and he saw my expression giving a quick laugh fifty kilos he said a couple of the bags had burst and the stuff had spilled across the top of the locker we were taking it in when we had the signal about you when was that at we were north of green island you didnt waste any time peripheral anxiety nora tewson might conceivably note that two minutes after the launch had left the hotel mooring a police boat had put to sea at full speed half a mile north along the shore we didnt carry any markings visible at that distance but we had radar and we didnt look like a cabin cruiser nothing to be done about it ignore there were some charts framed under glass on the bulkhead and i looked at them hydrographic department hong kong approaches the relevant sheet was no islands south of lantau whats your bearing captain liu he looked at the compass twofouroh we were heading roughly southwest passing the north coast of lamma island by pak kok point and moving into the west lamma channel id assumed that a pekinbased operation would take the launch northwest towards the south china seaboard but i was wrong unless it was going to round lantau from the south and head north after leaving hong kong territorial waters we could see its dark blob through the windscreen larger now and growing clearer the sun was almost directly behind us and still only two diameters high right in their eyes if they looked astern are we flat out i am sorry are we going at full speed yes all i want is to see where they go do what you can to stay up sun of them to stay stay between them and the sun ah yes understand it occurred to me that london had taken so bloody long because theyd had to screen the whole of the hong kong police through local agents in place before they could give me a boat crew i could trust macklin had told me to use utmost care in approaching the police or the special branch egerton must have worked his chilblains to the bone getting me this toy it was a shame in ten minutes we began passing junks on their way out to the fishing banks and i looked at the chart again lamma was to port and falling astern with cheung chau island coming up on the other side the deck had been tilting a bit and i took a look at the compass wed begun heading a few points more southerly at degrees five minutes later captain liu spoke again you wish me still follow yes why we are leaving territorial waters now what difference does that make only if you wish me to put a shot across bows or go aboard we have no more authority now he was looking slightly disappointed and i thought what a dangerous world it was they must not see us captain liu they must remain totally unaware of our presence now is that understood oh yes understood he turned away slightly probably embarrassed peering with great concentration through the windscreen i suppose if youre a young ambitious skipper of a police boat you spend a lot of your time looking for an excuse to blow someone out of the water there wasnt a lot of shipping about but enough to give us a bit of cover liu went to stand by the bosun and we altered course twice in the next ten minutes as he brought us almost parallel with the launch keeping between it and the sun then he ordered half speed whats that thing i asked him an oil rig who does it belong to communist china i watched the distant shape of the launch slowing towards the oil rig then looked at the chart again the date on sheet was but someone had marked the rig in ink later slightly west of longitude by east latitude by north some two miles south of the sanmen island group stop both liu ordered the bubbling of the exhaust died to silence and we began drifting suddenly isolated on the expanse of the sea water slapped sometimes under the stern and a cable strained at its cleat somewhere forward of the radio mast the sun was already hot and threw an oily shadow on the starboard side captain liu stood without moving his cappeak set like a pointer at the horizon the superstructure of the oil rig stood like a splinter against the sky and within five minutes the shape of the launch had merged with it i took another look through the x s but we were still too distant to see much detail all right i told liu you wish to return yes i got him over to the charts head well to the north here above sha wan and come down the coast keeping as close to it as you can he spoke to the bosun and as we turned and got under way i stood looking at chart no mandarin was still running and we now had a target zone centre x south china sea in the first two seconds i forced a yoshida on him but he knew this one and broke it and his foot razored the air edgeon fast and powerful and deadly but missing me and bringing down some of the jars they crashed to the floor and my scalp rose but there was nothing i could do the man was my first concern not the reptiles because he was trying to kill me and they would only attack in fright we rolled and glass crunched under me and he gained a lock and i think it would have finished me but i was lying half across one of the snakes and it began striking at my arm again and again and i had to do something because i couldnt stand them they nauseated me again and again coiling and releasing its scales livid and the tiny black eyes glistening and the jaws gaping at right angles in a regular rhythm as it coiled released and struck coiling again as the pain burned in my arm it made me feel sick and i had to do something because there were some others free too slithering around among the broken glass theyd send me mad if i couldnt get away so i used my other knee and brought it against him in a jackknife drive that would have been quite useless without my horror of these things to give it force and the hold eased and came on again and then broke and i tried the only trick i had the third movement of the toka going straight in without the first and second preliminaries to open up the target but he took it and waited knowing i didnt have the leverage to make the kill for nearly a second we lay locked and immobile one body one twoheaded eightlimbed freak with its fierce internal energies at variance and on the point of blowing it apart as the electrochemical forces sought to regain stability i didnt know anything about him there had only been chiang here when id walked into the snake shop and at first hed acknowledged me with a slight nod then his eyes had shifted quickly to look past me over my shoulder and i had moved there wasnt time to do anything consciously in extreme danger the organism cedes control to the primitive brain and the cortex is required only to compute data and supply intelligence of the several hundred thousand facts impressions and implications these were salient i was presently listed for elimination by an alien network heavily infiltrating the field there was alarm in chiangs eyes in the orient the bare hand is the traditional weapon chiangs eyes had shifted only once so that there was probably only one man behind me my hope of survival in these circumstances lay more in a blind lightning move than in a considered and organized attack in the fifth of a second it would take me to turn and consider the ideal defence he could fell me with a handblade to the neck so id gone in low spinning and reaching for his legs and finding them bringing him off balance and chopping at the kneecap to paralyse since it was the first target presented if thered been a mistake if thered been no intention on his part to attack i would have known it at once and could have withdrawn leaving him only bruised but there hadnt been any mistake id known from the stance of his feet that id caught him halfway through a blow designed to kill during this second of suspended time there was nearsilence around us as we lay locked together in mortal intimacy on the fragments of glass i had managed to shift my weight and roll sideways a little so as to bring one elbow down across the small scaly head crushing it by degrees until its movement stopped a heavy slithering came from somewhere close and i wished they werent so quiet i wished theyd scream in their fright or bang into something to take my mind away from their oily leglessness something else moved now chiang i didnt know anything about chiang either he ran a safehouse for the bureau with global transmission facilities and had no love for the mainland chinese but that was all i knew i didnt know what he was prepared to do for me at this moment and it would be fatal to believe hed do anything at all i think he was going to shut the door of the shop and in part of my vision field i could see the faces of two boys peering in from the street perhaps wondering at the crash of glass just now but this street at this hour was filled with its own din and probably no one else had heard the man on the floor with me moved i couldnt do anything immediately because this new advantage was his and we both knew it and wed felt it coming one of the hazards of close combat is sweat and for the past few seconds it had been springing on our skin most critically on the fingers of my left hand that were gripping his wrist he had felt them begin to slip and so had i and we were both ready but he was faster and the air brushed my face as he chopped hard for the temple and missed and chopped again and tried for a third time too greedy or too impatient spending his strength and letting me work for a throw and letting me get it a blinding light in my head as i called for more force than i had pain under my palm as broken glass went in the throw succeeding to the point of taking him off balance and leaving him vulnerable not defenceless but open to anything i could do with my right hand there wasnt a lot of opportunity because he was spinning away from me through the terminal phase of the throw his shoulders smashing against the shelf of jars and sending them down his face passing for the first time across my field of vision a youth with thick black brows and flattened eyes a chinese from the north or northeast mongolian or manchurian glass flew as the jars hit the floor and a black and yellow trickle ran forming a coil and rearing but i blocked my mind and tried to concentrate totally on the need to survive forebrain processing was taking over the gross elements of the task while the primitive creature conditioned itself the nerve signals triggering the medulla and pouring adrenalin into the bloodstream the pulse rate and blood pressure rising as sugar flowed in to feed the muscles the senses increasing in their refinement so that the input of data should receive almost instantaneous assessment by the cortex but time moved slowly and at present the overall data was derived from a scene that was near stationary the youth was still reacting from the momentum of the throw his head jerking as his shoulder bounced from the shelf somewhere at the edge of the scene was chiang slamming the door forebrain the youth was coming back in a rebound from the shelf and i could take him with a single bracket throw if i waited long enough it would need a tenth of a second his face had blenched and i thought it was only partly because his blood had receded to supply the internal organs his shoulder had smashed fairly hard into the edge of the shelf and the muscle would be in trauma i went on waiting letting him come working out what i wanted to do and planning the best way to do it the bracket was still viable right hand in a swinging chop at the nape of his neck to add force to his own momentum left hand bunched and driven upwards into his abdomen supplementary moves my left knee to his groin if the bracket spun him towards me a chop at his shoulder to increase the degree of paralysis made by his impact with the edge of the shelf it was getting near time and he was already working for some kind of initiative but we were too close for footblows and he wasnt moving his left hand or arm they were hanging from the shoulder and i knew why his face was white the heel of his right hand was coming up but he wouldnt be able to make the blow because his right foot was too close for support then it was time and i put the bracket on him connecting but not strongly enough for a finish because my foot was slipping on something and robbing me of the support i needed he buckled over the abdomen blow and my hand hit iron muscle and there wasnt anything i could do about it because the bracket was on and he was still alive and very active hooking at my leg and swinging a close fast throw that turned me and sent me down he could have done it then because my spine was exposed and he still had the strength in one hand but what he didnt realize was that he was throwing me back into that bloody snakepit and i wasnt going to have it the forebrain shut off almost completely and the organism took over and i was vaguely aware of the action being triggered by the emotional syndrome horror desperation fury each emotion contributing to the next and powering the physical body with speed and strength otherwise unavailable no science no cerebration no technique blind rage in this way murder is often done and the wellknown statement is heard later in court i dont know what happened something just came over me i think he reacted twice but nothing remained in my memory except an impression of heat redness and a form of unearthly joy it probably took two seconds three at the most i wasnt on the floor any more because that was the place where the organism had been determined not to go it had been quite adamant about this because it had known that if it fell down there among those things again it would go mad i was standing in a crouch with my back against the wooden counter he was on the floor facing upwards with his eyes still open blood was dripping from my hand where the glass had gone in it was dripping into one of his eyes and i moved my hand away thinking vaguely that if it went on dripping there he wouldnt be able to see though of course it didnt matter what went into his eyes now it was very quiet except for the sawing of my breath i didnt hear anything but sensed a movement to my right and looked up at the man sitting on the stairs holding the gun chapter eight put that bloody thing away i told him i meant it i wasnt joking hed had me worried for a second till id recognized him id thought it was more trouble and wasnt ready for it he was ferris tried to tread on you he said did they he gave a wintry little smile putting the gun away ferris had directed me in hanover last time he was sitting on the steep flight of stairs thin and sandy and owlish an eccentric don his hair all over the place what was left of it why didnt you do it i asked him still annoyed at the start hed given me you wouldnt keep still i suppose he didnt want to make a noise either not that sort of noise and he might have got chiang in the leg or somewhere he would only have done it if hed seen i couldnt do it myself that was ferris he always made you bloody well work for your living my breath went on sawing id used an awful lot of muscle in the last few seconds and i needed the oxygen back and my lungs were going like bellows when i could i said chiang what kind of venom is it he didnt answer he was standing quietly looking down at the boy on the floor his expression benign it could have been chiang whod done something at the last minute thinking i couldnt manage he was a belt the briefing said maybe id ask ferris or maybe i didnt want to know chiang my nerves were still sensitive his head snapped up what kind of venom have these things got venom poison come on i want to know if its no poison he shook his head snake not venomous no law not allow in shops he took a step towards me and dragged my sleeve back his fingers very strong there were fang marks all over the place and i tried not to think about it no trouble he said it happen sometimes with me too is like little nails he called suddenly in the direction of the stairs chihchi as he moved impatiently towards the stairs i caught the smell of the incense that clung to his gown i straightened my back slowly letting the nerves explore the bones and ligaments there didnt seem to be anything wrong just the hand burning and the punctures in the arm chiang moved past me again taking the boys wrists and dragging him through the broken glass leaving him behind the counter one of them slid across the floor in a series of smooth curves black and yellow and i said ferris where are we going to talk up here i walked to the stairs watching for another one and ready to kick out a girl was coming down in a cheongsam not looking at me looking at chiang he spoke to her in cantonese with no particular urgency in his tone they had to see to the saiyan his hand was bleeding then they had to clear up all this mess and find the reptiles they would keep the door locked so forth and she kept saying yes yes quickly and repetitively like the chatter of a bird expressing her fright at the mess looking down at my hand then fleetingly up at my face she went back up the stairs chiang ferris said what about him ah he threw his head back quickly i will make all in order he came shuffling quickly to the stairs scattering bits of glass and flicking the dead snake aside with his pointed shoe folding his strong stubby hands and speaking softly and emphatically to ferris will cost money to take him long way and bury with fung shui there will be many others to pay teamoney and for not speaking of this will cost two thousand dollars watching our faces to catch our reaction you will be paid ferris said thinly what london decides you are to be paid i remembered he hated mercenaries even though we had to depend on them for so many things it was nothing to do with morality he knew they were dangerous and there will be no fung shut because he was our enemy not yours and there will not be many others to help you will use one other and you make damned sure hes deaf blind and dumb you should be ashamed of yourself in london mr chiang is not said to be a greedy person i would not like to report otherwise chiang gave a breathy little laugh to cover his loss of face and said nothing more ferris didnt look at me but turned and went up the stairs the girl chihchi was at the top beckoning me to follow her she sat me on a wicker linenbasket in a bathroom on the first floor with my wrist across the edge of the cracked handbasin and used running water and a pair of eyebrow tweezers while i looked at the two rust stains running down beneath the taps and the toothbrush and lifebuoy soap and the bottle of black hair dye one of mr chiangs little secrets she didnt speak english or was too shy so we spoke in cantonese she was the third daughter and working in a doll factory before going to the university next spring if she could pass the examinations but she found english difficult like chinese puzzle with a sudden warbling laugh at her own joke her eyes darting to mine again wondering who i was and who had smashed the jars and released the snakes down there and what had happened to my hand the things she told me were only the record id asked her to put on she used the tweezers delicately her hand pecking at mine like a bird flicking the pieces of glass into the basin while i sat there feeling the reaction and feeling it more strongly because i didnt want there to be any i had to start thinking again but all i could think was how bloody chancey this trade was getting it could have been me down there lying in all that hideous mess with ferris getting on the radio wing broken or whatever phrase hed use for immediate and urgent speechcode transmission to norfolk and by direct private phone to egertons bedside at one in the morning deceased during mission on the righthand page in the book before it was closed and nothing to show for it nothing like thornton had shown just a vulgar brawl with a hitman almost an accident hadnt you better think well im bloody well trying to she had to grip my wrist to keep my hand still i was shaking all over muscular reaction nervous reaction could do without it had to get back on form because theyd dropped in a director for the field and he was waiting to localbrief me she got some bandage and a dressing and i tried to blank off my mind clear it of all references and associations and start all over again it worked up to a point and the question came in pretty sharply hadnt you better think about what he was doing here well he didnt tag me from the car because i checked all the way and he didnt tag me from the golden sands so he did that hurt no must take great care so forth she tied the knot how did he get here ferris asked me when i went up to the radio room he assumed i knew and it made me touchy because i should know and didnt he was fiddling with the set his long body angled and propped on one of the sacks that chiang kept here how the hell should i know he turned his narrow sandy head to look at me for two seconds with his yellowish eyes they were rather bright with shifting lights in them but just about as expressive as a catseye on the road he wore plain glass in his spectacles we all knew that it was some kind of image he was trying to identify with and it was very successful because you only had to imagine ferris without his glasses to realize youd never recognize him he looked away with the faintest smile and went on fiddling with the set he knew i didnt mean how the hell should i know i meant shut up im trying to think thered been no tag from the golden sands and no tag from the taunus either he was one of the people theyd drafted into the field to keep watch for me or chiang had blown me ferris he looked up i said has chiang had recent screenings oh please be serious he said and gave a token giggle concentrating on the set again trying to clear the signal identification bleep from the background noise i realized i must be in mild delayed shock because if that boy had been one of the people whod been drafted into the field to watch for me hed be doing it at the hong kong cathay and the mauritius and the orient club and places like that where id been sighted and identified not here at the safehouse no one had ever seen me come here no one except him there was something i was missing and it wasnt anything to do with chiang when london sets up a safehouse it doesnt leave anything to chance because if one major operator gets blown at any given time and in any given place it can shake the whole of the network and do irreversible damage and wed all know that and id forgotten and ferris had reminded me i was forgetting too much ferris he looked up again ive got something for them i said london yes im holding open for them now can it wait if you like but i know where tewson went to oh jesus christ he said and switched over to send i told him where the thing was x and he began sending in cypher forgetting too much but some of it was corning back and i went down the stairs and found chiang putting those bloody things into a canvas bag while chihchi swept the glass into a cardboard box marked nestles chiang are there any more of those things loose is all now he said all home he was looking despondent and i didnt know whether it was because id finished off one of his most expensive delicacies or whether he was still annoyed with ferris for not letting him screw the bureau for a couple of thousand hong kong dollars i went behind the counter and bent over the boy and he stared at me with one eye as i found his wallet checking it yes a picture of me a copy of the one theyd found in their western networks file not so good as the one i had of tewson but quite recognizable some kind of minaret in the hazy background it could have been a stray theyd shot while i was doing the bangkok thing i took the wallet upstairs for ferris to go through and put a match to the photograph and waited until hed finished sending blank the same as the one theyd given me because that was the cypher for mandarin he was telling them about the boy downstairs while he was at it no smoke necessary contact will deal immediate and dossier to follow there might be something in the wallet he could send but the boy was only a hit and wouldnt know anything about the pekin cell any more than flower had known about the bureau an oil rig said ferris and swung round on the sack of herbs now theres a funny place he sniffed the air and looked at the curl of black ash your picture was it yes they must have it on file he looked up at me critically would you like a tetanus shot or anything not really are you ready to fill me in theres not much i slid my back down the wall and sat on the floor and told him everything i could think of he broke in only when he wanted me to know something or when he wanted me to see that he already had the background yes his parents are flying out to take his body back home yes they sent me a microfilm on the lady nora all right ill deal with that when youve told me what sort of damage they did it took only ten minutes but by that time id formed a conclusion about egerton he was a worse bastard than id thought because ferris had too clear a picture for london to have jumped him in from pekin as a reflex action in the last twentyfour hours when did they bring you in on mandarin ferris six weeks ago did they tell you who you were going to direct they said they hoped to get you i bet it wasnt egerton who said that no it was then he broke off and looked at me and the faint crinkles began at the corners of his eyes did the egg say he didnt have a director for you macklin said so macklin hes in field briefing oh he is is he well were not taking any instructions from him old boy he gets all his maps back to front oh i see he said suddenly giving a soft whinny the egg thought you wouldnt take it on if he couldnt drop you straight into the action is that it took you in did he serves you right youre always trying to pick and choose he was looking me all over with critical eyes you feeling uncomfy are you it was those bloody reptiles i cant stand the things oh really i thought they looked rather jolly old fellows he got off the sack like a stork taking off and went to the top of the stairs waving a finger in the direction of the set keep an ear open old boy then he was shouting for chiang telling him hed got some shopping for chihchi to do poking his head back in the doorway what are your measurements which ones i wished hed shut up and settle down and let me think because i wanted to know how it happened i suppose he was being very decent about it giving me time to work things out a director like sargent or loman would have slung the whole book at me for turning up at a safehouse for initial local briefing with a tag right on my back it must have shaken him need a new suit he said get arrested if you went out of here in that one blood all over it i gave him my measurements and told him to change the image and felt an immediate fool because it was the first thing hed think of he pretended he hadnt heard i sat watching the carrier level and tried again but all i came up with was another negative finding they hadnt raided fleetway or if they had it didnt give them a lead because id put my address as the hong kong cathay and id never been back there thing is ferris told me as he came back and sat on his sack there were only two characters who were ready to look at this job but the egg said he didnt want them because they probably wouldnt live no names and all that but theyre a couple of clowns knives in their teeth that sort of thing feldman i thought and ptack neither of them long enough out of middle europe to develop style they wouldnt have looked twice at the toothpaste for instance and you know what the egg always says there are old agents and bold agents but there are no old bold agents there was a fly buzzing at the window and he got up and began stabbing at it with his long pale finger until i heard a light brittle crunch he came back and sat down wiping his finger on the sack and i remembered him in hanover and before that in tangier going out of his way to step on a beetle and coming back without any interruption in what he was saying we dont know much about our directors but one thing i knew about ferris was that hed been sent into brussels three years ago with express orders to hit a man whod been turned and he was back inside twentyfour hours and nobody asked anything or said anything but the next day the tin came round to all departments and we dubbed up for the widow at the time we didnt know it was ferris but we knew it was someone in the top echelon active branch and it didnt take some of us long to work it out even his choice of phrase was significant tried to tread on you did they they probably saw you in the street he said consolingly there was some static and the s meter reacted and he looked at it and away again despite what the chamber of commerce says the two chief industries in hong kong are narcotics and espionage i dare say you know that theyre all here including mi the cia and of course half the population of moscow more to the point almost the entire population of pekin is here and you may have noticed how the walls of the bank of china appear to be bulging the set came alive and he adjusted the band spread listening with his head on one side and perfectly still like a praying mantis it was a brief request to stand by and he acknowledged so you may have been seen in the street unpalatable but not unthinkable i didnt say anything because he was interested in the set now and anyway there wasnt a lot to say by unpalatable he didnt mean it was unnerving to think one could be sighted by pure chance he meant that even if it was a fact it left you with the feeling you were dodging the issue and saying oh well it was probably a bit of bad luck that could be fatal still a point was missing so i shut it right out of my mind and let the subconscious work on it without any pressure from the forebrain it was the quickest way i could hear chiang in the shop below clearing up the last of the glass and ferris said hes all right you dont have to worry one of those who got across just after the purge they shot his wife before they were a hundred yards out but he kept on swimming its ten miles you know where he did it theyd been married three days of course he doesnt remember her now or not much but the barb went in and it wont ever come out you know how it goes notice how contented he looked when that character down there stopped moving hates their guts he gave a titter doesnt stop him trying to ride the bureau all the way to the bank he was simply telling me that if i thought i was tagged here because chiang had blown me i was wrong and id better think again i gave it a try and for the first time came up with a positive the honda had still been outside the golden sands when id left there and the taunus was in view of the windows so id got a boy to bring it across to the steps told him id strained my ankle it had been the best i could do and it had given me full cover from the upper floors but it was just conceivable that the honda tag had sighted me from somewhere below dear oh dear said ferris they really are terribly constipated today arent they he fidgeted with the band spread again but he could tell he was spot on then he stopped fidgeting and sat absolutely still perhaps as an exercise to prove he could do it it worried me a bit because he shouldnt have to certainly id brought a tag right into the safehouse at the initial rendezvous and had to kill him in front of a witness but as far as we knew the situation was secure again and chiang seemed confident he could lose the body as far as we knew it could be that the tag could never go back to his cell or send them a signal or in any way blow the safehouse but somewhere hed picked me up and if he could do it so could someone else the minute i left here until i could find out how hed got on to me i couldnt come back here once id left so the safehouse was blown anyway in that it was no longer usable except for transmission i wanted to ask ferris his thoughts on this but i didnt think id like the answer so i left it and went on sitting on the floor with my hand beginning to throb watching his insect like stillness what happened to north he asked me you were there werent you he eyed me obliquely through his glasses i thought youd been stuck in pekin there wouldnt have been any signals on a thing like that on the contrary half the staff at the bureau would have been put on special duties brushing it under the rug we get the telegraph he said innocently by diplomatic bag just for the crossword he shot himself i know it said so in the press his name had been given as dorkins and hed been a charter pilot for some unheardof outfit well thats what happened i said that all he didnt blow anything if thats what you mean thats what i mean he was still peddling his cover even to connie just before he went and did it i thought that was pretty good considering the state he was in oh very he said quickly and looked at the wall poor old north i didnt say anything just to make it difficult for him he was doing something for liaison group in moscow went and fell hook line and sinker for an actress he always was a bit corny remember actually she was working venus traps for delegates from finland the roofs coming off helsinki any time now did you know anyway she fell for him too snap crackle pop not just drawers off and the door shut the whole red rosy rigmarole hearts entwined forever going to get married and everything then dear old auntie kg found out and shot her dead in front of him when they were getting on the plane for antwerp both had perfectly good papers hed fixed them for her he was all right travelling separately clean as a whistle but i suppose it broke him up only known her for three weeks some people are funny arent they do you like girls he gave a soft little whinny and got down in front of the set spinning the band spread and moving the main tuner to make sure it was working i heard i told him carefully that hed got out of lubyanka he didnt turn round oh really the things people say i knew he wouldnt have brought up the subject of north without a damned good reason bureau policy demands immediate smoke out to cover any event of a scandalous nature or an event considered to jeopardize security and this policy has spread a mortuary silence throughout the corridors of that dreary hole in whitehall id talked for a minute to dewhurst the night id left london because we were alone and both shocked by what had happened policy apart we still dont chew the fat because a lot of its too depressing and wed end up neurotic most missions are dangerous and all of them impose a strain and every so often youll see an operator come back too shot up physically or too shaken spiritually to be sent out again ever at this time macklin was one of them and north god knows was another when something like that happens we do not ask for whom the bell tolls we dont want to know watching ferris at the set i thought there was only one reason why hed brought up the subject thats why id made it difficult for him to bring him down a peg its nearly always a part of the executivedirector relationship especially when a mission hots up youre both having to think like hell just to survive and you keep your wits sharp with a bit of oneupmanship the north thing had shivered the whole of the network and london was putting smoke out worldwide as my director in the field ferris was giving me the official version of the affair and that was the one i would adopt if there were any questions asked by anyone anywhere even or especially under duress ferris what did north have anything to do with mandarin no then i suppose he thought the answer had come too pat because he spun round on his heels to face me and said slowly nothing whatsoever and that is gospel fair enough he spun slowly back again london doesnt tell you more than you have to know when youre briefed because you can work better with your head clear of extraneous data but youre never misinformed and ferris was just reminding me thing is he said over his shoulder if they dont the callsign for mandarin very clear he acknowledged and stood by four blocks he said arent they getting fussy youd think old parkis was running this one i sat a bit straighter waiting as ferris was knowing the signals were going to come on stream i smelled the herbandsacking smell of this room under the roof and listened to the rising din of the narrow street below where the letterwriter would be setting up her stool and the boy lighting his charcoal under the first trussed duck but i was thinking of london at two in the morning the wide wet streets and egertons battered rover slipping through them with a bow wave on the gutter side and his pale academic face peering through the windscreen wipers because this was obviously what was happening over there hed taken the earlier signal at his bedside the one about tewsons being on the rig and he had got dressed and gone down to the garage for his car now he was inside the building and loping at his own pace along the corridors heading for the radio room they knew hed come in and had flashed us the call sign four blocks to indicate direct communication from control to the director in the field not really necessary because egerton would announce himself they must have someone new at the console a full minute went by and ferris began showing his nerves leaving the set and sitting on his sack again crossing his legs and huffing did you hear the one about the sailor who got his finger stuck in the keyhole they tried to mandarin control at console ill ferris squatted on the floor again with his head near the integral mike and acknowledged within five seconds the signals came on stream and i sat upright with my eyes shut reading london extending the digits and reversing the transfers and trying to place the tone and failing they had in fact got a new boy in there rather prissy but firstrate on his pauses and repeats after a minute ferris swivelled round and looked at me you reading yes he turned his back again and went full out for almost thirty minutes getting the details from me as control asked for them estimated number of opposition observers in the field identity of principals if any known location of opposition base and disposition of other fieldquarters safehousesdegree of insistence so forth most of it routine with key contractions the kind of things they always wanted to know at the outset of a mission then the questions got specific egerton wanted to know mrs tewsons attitude towards her deceased husband whether she appeared venal disloyal opportunistic was she promiscuous i did what i could catching the questions in the air before ferris had to ask me and in fifteen minutes i was sweating hard and wishing to christ i didnt feel so ragged the little bastard had forced a throat block for ten seconds or so before i could break it and i was still getting flashes in front of the eyes then control went on to the mundanities and the only question i had to answer was about the damage to the hong kong cathay i said theyd want some new wallpaper and a plumber and an electrician but no windows smashed telephone okay so forth while some poor bloody clerk put it all in the book you could tell this was egertons mission the hong kong cathay hotel would in due course receive a cheque in compensation for any damage sustained during the sojourn of one of their guests if the manager took it into his head to try tracing the cheque to its source hed grow old before his time egerton was particular about what he called the public domain dewhurst would have just said they must be insured against drunks bookies and acts of god and left it at that his point being that as a british taxpayer he wasnt going to fork out for things the insurance companies ought to pay for flower no further action required on our part what would actually happen was that his parents would be met at the airport by a senior secretary of welfare section and all their expenses would be paid i began reading alertly again because i could tell they were getting round to instructions egerton had probably gone into another room to work things out either alone or in consultation while his secondstringer keycontracted the routine advisories further movements and establishing of access liaison and security left to discretion of director in field transmission schedules to be as per current pattern far east theatre emergency signals to follow established rulings as to times form and code allocation of standby periods to conform with current schedules bihourly hourly heavy traffic bypass key state of mission reports were specified right down to the last microdot then they went off the air for fifteen minutes two standby signals and then four blocks of then they began on the instructions the first of which wed already been expecting i was to go out to the oil rig and try to get aboard chapter nine shield then i stopped dead i suppose there wasnt anything to get excited about but it had worried me having to kill him like that and hed left a lot of muscular strain in me and thered been those bloody things slithering about oh fair enough all in the days work but look we hadnt even got any target access figured out yet and already there were two dead and i wasnt beginning to fancy my chances all that much i stood in the street close to a doorway very close looking between the buildings towards the open square in the distance wanting to shout at them cant you leave me alone i just didnt feel ready for any more that was all at least for a while give me a day or even a few hours if thats how its got to be bloody well leave me alone i stood in the street with the morning sun dazzling in the shop windows the temperature in the eighties and warming up to another lovely day in exotic hong kong pearl of the orient this morning we shall be taking you on yet another fascinating tour this time beginning with a tram ride to famed victoria peak then down again to explore the fabulous tiger balm gardens pride of the island i stood in the street feeling how cold it was how perilous from this distance i could see the taunus easily enough and the traffic passing it thered been a slot and id backed it in and it was still there where id left it the square was a lawful parking zone but id taken the last slot and there hadnt been any vacancies since then or theyd only just arrived the humber was doubleparked with the bonnet up some kind of engine trouble so the police couldnt move it on in a hurry the red van had typhoo tea on it in gold letters but there wasnt a grocers or a cafe or a tea shop anywhere near they were all souvenir shops and cheap jewellers on that side of the square but the van was parked with two wheels on the pavement and the rollerdoor was down as if there was a delivery being made the chinese on the bike was just sitting there with his arms folded watching the traffic not even bothering to fetch a paper or something to read the others i couldnt see or hope to recognize thered be others i knew that this was about the roughest static surveillance job id ever seen but that wasnt the point the point was that the taunus was a death trap the left eyelid was flickering it always did when the nerves got close to the edge and i was cold standing by the doorway in the sunshine because i knew ferris was up there in the room below the roof thinking i still didnt know how that tag had been on my back when id gone into the snake shop well he was bloody well wrong because i knew i knew now and the unnerving thing was that id known for quite a while and could have told him put him out of his misery it was just that id had other things on my mind and hadnt taken too much notice i wasnt prepared to dodge the issue by saying that boy had sighted me by chance even though ferris had offered me the option i might have been sighted by chance but it was damned unlikely and the only other way that boy could have got on to my back was by a communications pitch and the only way they could have found any use for communications was by having a signals source and he could be only one man the one in the honda at the golden sands hotel hed been somewhere on the ground floor and seen me and recognized me and got on to the phone and told headquarters and headquarters had put out an allpoints bulletin and from that moment the taunus was a marked target id checked and doublechecked on the way up to the safehouse but there were limits to what i could do in a narrow winding street already crowded with chinese and the boy had been the first one to sight the taunus and he had my photograph they all did and he came to make the hit the people down there in the square didnt know that hed been an isolated case on his way from base to station or nosing along the capri travel pattern of two evenings ago and hed been lucky if that was the word then someone else had sighted the taunus but i wasnt there so there was no one to follow so he signalled headquarters and brought the pack in there could be twenty or thirty down there in the doorways and behind windows besides the people on station near the van and the humber and on the bicycle they would be deployed along the streets leading to the square the surveillance spreading tentacles in every direction to make sure i couldnt get within a hundred yards of the taunus without being seen or two hundred the distance from there to where i was standing now close very close to the doorway my hand was throbbing must take care of it shed said the feeling of deathly cold wouldnt go and i got fed up because i ought to get more bloody control over myself the mission was still in its access phase and i ought to be feeling right on my toes and i wasnt and there was no excuse tui mm chiu i stood back keeping clear of the actual doorway but remaining close enough to use it two other people went in a woman and her small boy and it wouldnt do if the wrong people saw me and recognized me and went in say three or four men and turned round and blocked the doorway while the rest of them came up i wouldnt know any of them i wouldnt have time to know anything at all if they came i began working back up the shallow steps it was a ladder street like most of them in this area having to push my way through tourists and vendors and groups of shopkeepers gathered in the bright morning sun want roast duck the scent of cheap perfumes and the drains long time no rain people said working back towards the snake shop but turning off as soon as i could to avoid the cardinal sin of visiting a safehouse with surveillance known to be active want haircut the sudden clatter of a mahjong game in a doorway a stall with wardrobes for the dead is this the place where you can get to see those fruit sellers do you know a childs laughter as a fortunetelling bird picked a card from the basket turning into the alley and walking faster checking twice and going on using every pane of glass there was bumping into people because i had to watch the reflections tui mm chiu sometimes attracting attention and that could be dangerous slowing down taking the next street a wider one looking for a taxi finding one lane crawfords when we reached there i went through the front and out by the back way climbing over a new delivery of merchandise finding a bar and calling ferris we listened for bugs my car was covered in ticks oh i see he said he meant that was how the boy had got on to me it could be rigged as well of course anything in it a suitcase everything all right apart from that it is now i rang off and sat down in the corner of the bar with my left shoulder against the wall the mirror on the other side of the room and the door facing me i was clear of the taunus trap but they were getting very insistent and i could be picked up anywhere anywhere at all because of the photograph coffee to help chase some of the adrenalin out of the system there was no chance of physical exercise the eyelid had stopped flickering i should bloody well hope so i must be getting old or something relax switch off leave things to ferris hed be on to the police by now telling them where to find the taunus and what to do with it check it for an explosive device check the suitcase take the car back to fleetway and put the case into the harbour or wherever they liked because i wouldnt get it back theyd hold it for me but they wouldnt part with it or with me either without asking me an awful lot of questions hong kong is just like other places the police dont like being rung up and told to look for bombs in abandoned cars without wanting to know why ferris could pull enough rank to tell them to shut up but itd mean revealing the fact that we were on the island and we didnt want to advertise it id asked him to do a couple of other things for me while he was about it pay my bill with fleetway and get a dozen gardenias sent to el caliph before eight oclock tonight with a message please forgive been called to rome due to the devaluation crisis tried four times to ring you but not home will never forget you clive i put on the mask the nerves were back to normal and it hadnt taken so long as i thought for three hours id been moving around central as free as a tourist and nobody had tried to raid me or even get on my tail besides which ferris hadnt been mean it was a white summerweight linen suit and quite a good fit and i felt a bit less like a lavatory brush with the mange id kitted up again at lane crawfords new suitcase shaver toilet things shoes so forth and the case was genuine leather because i cant stand plastic so that scaly old hellhag in accounts was going to cough up her brimstone when she got the bill i breathed in through the nose and the faceplate tightened satisfactorily and i took it off we spent a lot of time getting a good fit for the fins he was a helpful little man five feet high with a crew cut and a jolly smile and the right hand off at the wrist said it was a shark and i believed him you from england yes what part london so i have sister in london beshnill green well i never i asked him for a double hose regulator and three standard single cylinders of compressed air with reserve mechanisms and nickelplated interiors capacity cubic feet each can you recharge these for me if i need more air no he shook his head beaming used to have chargingroom but had also assistant who broke valve one day tank went through wall here and flew three streets away finish through side of bus peals of laughter nobody hurt but take permission from me you get them filled at another place i give you address thank you tank harness with instant release buckle lead belt depth gauge compass underwater watch dry suit no wet foam neoprene have you got one oh yes diving knife sawtooth edge one side straight edge the other you want shark repellent yes speargun no abalone iron no i had to try three wet suits on before i found the right one it had a yellow insignia on the back as a safety marker and id have to cover it with black adhesive tape later do you stock chains what sort of chains to secure the tanks to the boat no tell you where to buy he gave me another address i need a lamp he kicked the stool over to the shelves again and jumped up and hooked down the box catching it in the crook of his elbow we tested the batteries and i signed a travellers cheque sweating a lot after trying on all those suits but feeling much better almost back on form even the muscles feeling smoother tonight id be getting some sleep because ferris wouldnt be able to rustle up everything we needed before the morning god only knew how he was planning to send me in to the objective but if it was going to be an air drop wed obviously have to make it by night that would be tomorrow at the earliest id hired a dark grey station wagon from fleetway so that i could lay the air tanks flat i stowed the gear and found the place where they sold chains and noted the place where they could give me a recharge if i needed one and bought some black adhesive tape and reached the harbour hotel on the north shore of the island by noon that was where ferris had booked me in there was already a message for mr wing please call twa about my reservation i used the phone in my room and we listened for bugs and then he went straight into speech code switching to cypher where he had to and rattling off the numerals the code was standard operational for this date far east theatre listed arbitrary with no mnemonics october for briefing monday for rendezvous ginrummy north east yellow left hand so forth i went into the same pitch and thought christ hes got something moving i want you for briefing he said when hours where he gave the directions there was a junk tied up in the causeway bay typhoon anchorage the august moon the seventh along from the base of the northeast breakwater lefthand side of the utilities stanchion whats the flap i asked him theres no flap im sending you out to the rig thats all when midnight tonight i slept six hours in room at the harbour hotel with traps at the door and the window and then got up and showered and took the stuff out of the canvas case and tried on the wet suit again and tested the mask putting talc on the fins and taping the safety marker to black it out they might just as well have painted a bullseye on the back of the suit bang on the tenth vertebra it was only a tenminute run to the typhoon anchorage allow another five to park the station wagon with decent security and find the august moon that gave me fortyfive minutes to spare and i didnt like it ferris must have got a panic signal from london with orders to arrange immediate access and put his executive into the target zone bureau signals phrasing right out of the book it meant they wanted the ferret thrown into the sea that was all right the thing i didnt like was having to hang around for threequarters of an hour before i could even get to the briefing and find out what kind of access ferris had fixed up and what kind of communications we were going to use and what kind of chance there was of my coming out of that particular target zone alive the oil rig stood in international waters but it was chinese territory and at a rough guess id put its defence armament at about the same strength as a pocket battleship i knew from earlier missions that ferris was terribly fast and it was possible theyd picked him to fielddirect this operation because they knew we might have to hurry at any given phase or at some precise phase theyd been able to anticipate in the initial planning they might have shot him out to pekin as a cultural attache or some kind of embassy stooge the minute theyd seen mandarin coming up on the agenda i began wishing i knew a bit more about this job and that was a perfectly normal reaction at fortyfour minutes to final briefing the blood starts moving a few degrees quicker and the nerves start exchanging energy a few microseconds closer to optimum speed and you start wondering why the hell those zipperlipped bastards in london couldnt have told you a bit more or preferably a bloody sight more about the operation theyd decided to pitch you into in this case by egertons thriceaccursed subterfuge relax i picked up the phone and gave it ten rings and put it down again and that was a perfectly normal reaction too at fortythree minutes to final briefing the closer you move to potential death the more you think about women poor little bitch wed got her hormones moving again after all that time and all she was going to get at the el caliph at eight oclock tonight was a bunch of gardenias and all i was going to get was the shakes phone ferris london wants to send a shield oh for christ sake ferris be your age we were using cypher and all i could give him was the circumscribed phrase instructions refused but i got what i meant into the tone trust those bloody people in london to get you to the brink and then pull you back while they sent someone out to hold your hand theyre postponing the operation twentyfour hours ferris told me while they fly someone in from taiwan hes due to ferris he waited you let those poxridden bastards try sticking a shield on to me and as far as im concerned they can screw this mission and find another ferret you know me and you know i mean that im going in solo repeat solo or not at all difficult finding the right cypher phrases request no support am withdrawing from mission like trying to blow someones head off in a foreign language without knowing all the pronouns but some of it i put across in straight english poxridden so forth because it wouldnt give anything away i think theyre right ferris said reasonably i gave it five seconds because you dont get as far as the final briefing phase and chuck the whole thing in your directors face without another thought this wasnt egerton or not totally his chief talent was in knowing precisely what a given operator could do and how he was best able to do it we all have our little ways and heppinstall wont work properly without a shield because hes really a sliderule and requires peace of mind to do what he has to do and while hes trying to feel his way in to the complex centre of some sophisticated shadowsummit configuration or whatever hes doing he likes to be free to concentrate while his shield keeps the competition away till he runs out of ammunition styles wont operate without a shield because hes shitscared and london keeps a whole regiment standing by to support him through a mission because they know hes sensitive and brilliant and highly successful so long as he can keep his sphincter muscles under control i have to work solo because for me there has to be a risk this isnt because i like a a cheap thrill but because i need the stimulation of constant hazard to whip up the nerves and galvanize the organism to the pitch where i can do things i couldnt do otherwise if i had to rely on other people to keep me alive id get sloppy and make mistakes and that can be just as fatal as if you havent got a shield at all look at that poor bastard crowther i thought he was there his face puckered like a childs and his eyes watching me as we swayed along in the ambulance i thought he was there the last thing he ever said and ive never told anyone because he meant he thought jones was there shielding his back while he went in and found he couldnt get out again till they dropped him over the railway bridge for someone to find blown and cleaned out and dying while jones was waiting for him in lyons corner house and stuffing himself on buns a question of a missed rendezvous that was all a little misunderstanding at a critical time the tears running down crowthers face as he closed his eyes and gave it up frustration not selfpity or anything he didnt leave anyone who loved him frustration because hed completed the access and was ready to strike and get out again another beautiful job beautifully timed how does he do it we all used to say dont you give me jones or anyone ferris i said if youre not prepared to direct me without a shield youd better say so now after a bit he said plaintively its london old boy london knows bloody well i always work solo its because its underwater he said tell them they can pull me out then send someone else in there was a short silence then he said dont go away i put the phone back and left an imprint of sweat on it and walked up and down feeling soured and deceived and afraid because they could have settled this question earlier ferris had his access worked out or he wouldnt have called me in for final briefing and he couldnt have worked out his access before hed signalled his plans that was when they should have said all right but if its underwater were going to insist on a shield but theyd had second thoughts and i didnt like that it meant they were worried ferris couldnt have left the safehouse yet because he was still in signals with control there hadnt been time for him to rig up a set of his own on the junk or somewhere because hed need to make directional tests and check out the interference patterns and he wasnt a radio man and he wasnt signalling through chiang the present traffic was too sensitive so even if we could get london to agree it was going to take a lot of time and we were going to miss the hours rdv and arrive late for the midnight jump and it was giving me the sweats because if ever theres a time during a mission when you want everything to run like clockwork its when youre down for final briefing and taking up the slack on your nerves so youll be ready to do what you have to do wherever it is and wherever its going to take you ferrets have feelings the phone didnt ring for twentyfive minutes and i spent the interval in a limbo not wanting to do anything intelligent like checking over the briefing material because the whole thing could have gone dead and cold by now very much wanting to phone ferris and tell him to send a final signal executive withdraws from mission but there wouldnt be any point because theyd know id started to go gently round the bend id never withdrawn from a mission even when loman was running me even when the bastards booted me into tunis to pick up an operation already half wrecked and with two topechelon ferrets out of the running one dead and one blown before wed even found access thats why they shanghaied me into these stinking rotten jobs because they knew no one else would take them and they knew i wouldnt back out once id phone no bugs london he said is going to compromise you dont get a shield but theyre sending in a reserve i thought about this for so long that he had to ask if i was still on the line i said all right but keep him out of my way i told them thats what youd want you didnt tell them anything they didnt know he said there was time to keep our rendezvous and i said that was a bit of luck and rang off before i could say anything else because you dont feel relieved when the pressure comes off you feel like murder its something to do with the organism using the quickest way to get rid of the shock and i was quite happy about that spending the next three minutes murdering half the directors in the bureau very slowly and with an awful lot of screaming as the volts came on while this was happening i put the gear back into the canvas bag and shoved it into the wardrobe with the track suit and the other stuff and rigged entry traps and went down to the station wagon sixty seconds ahead of schedule i didnt object to a reserve they were taking a risk i knew that since my signal reporting that tewson was alive theyd been logically assuming he was either in hong kong or on the chinese mainland where i could have got to him through the normal penetration channels ferris had then shaken them by reporting that he was in fact under guard in what amounted to a maximum security block entirely surrounded by water and hed shaken them a second time when hed told them he planned to send me in solo he knew it was the only thing he could do in the specific circumstances of this mission at this phase he knew it was the only possible access to the target zone not by a fleet of ships or an airborne regiment but by one man alone and he knew we couldnt use a shield because this one man would himself become a target and we didnt want to double its size ferris had told me he thought london was right because he wanted to see if i had any doubts hed seen i hadnt and hed got into signals again and persuaded control to lay off a reserve was all right a shield would have followed me about and tried to keep me alive and got in my bloody way but a reserve would be told to stand off and do nothing unless i was blown or killed then hed move in that was all right i drove steadily the lights had come on in the dusk an hour ago and now they were bright the whole of the kowloon shoreline glittering across the nightblack harbour where the shipping floated like patches of fire that had broken away from the land the traffic was easing off towards causeway bay but i was taking the narrower streets doubling sometimes to check finding it clear waiting at a set of lights it occurred to me that london must be terribly nervous wanting to send in a reserve people like egerton realize the whole thing isnt a chess game they know the shadow executive comes under strain the minute the mission starts running and hes not expected to feel reassured if they send a man out to sit like a vulture on a tree while hes doing his best to stay alive and bring home a winner if he can normally london never tells you they might tell the director in the field but he doesnt necessarily pass it on well they could screw themselves there were people milling around the car trying to swarm across the road before the lights changed and a boeing went sloping weightlessly down the night sky towards kai tak on the other side of the harbour maybe theyd told me about the reserve because london was narked about my refusing a shield and ferris wanted me to know what controls thinking was he was very good about that and tried not to keep you in the dark even if it meant telling you something you didnt want to know there was no time to think about it anyway because they were holding the gun hard against my left temple and i couldnt even turn my head to see who it was chapter ten mime the boeing drifted lower its port light flicking on and off as it vanished behind the buildings and reappeared again its attitude slightly noseup as it settled along its flight path most of the people milling across the road were chinese coming up from one of the ferry piers but there were also a couple of american sailors and a group of japanese tourists and an airline steward royal dutch the lights were still red not many things in this scene were registering on a conscious level because they werent significant except for the lights when the lights changed to green id have to drive off the forebrain was very active triggered by the sensation of pressure against the temple before we do anything physically we go through the performance mentally as an automatic projection of intention to find out if its really a good idea if we think it is the motor nerves are fired and the muscles ordered theres still time to cancel the whole thing halfway or at any other stage the freedom of choice is infinitely variable but its normally better to go right through with the intention once were committed because weve seen it happen mentally and were fairly confident its going to work otherwise we wouldnt have put it into action there didnt seem a lot i could do a mass of data was streaming in from the sensory systems and it had to be computed before anything useful could be done movement was restricted with the people thronging in front of the station wagon i couldnt drive off this was one of the countless combinations presenting themselves for review a strike upwards with the right arm and a stab downwards with the right foot leaving it for the sudden vacuum in the induction manifold to kick the automatic shift into low and send thrust into the final drive most of the combinations involved both movable components man and machine this one got an instant negative because i couldnt drive through the people and because the computing element of the cortex didnt estimate sufficient time for the rightarm action to hit the gun away before it was fired i assumed it was a gun but that was all it was an assumption electrical impulse was pouring data into the brain and there was so much to handle that normal thought was ceding the field to imagination and instinct and it wasnt logical to imagine they were pressing a fountain pen to my head or a lipstick case the image of a face flickered for one microsecond among all the others the memory plundering its archives as a contribution to the welfare of the organism it was a smooth round face always rather sulky until you knew the man heppinstalls face in my mind for this instant because wed laid bets one day the three of us on whether it was possible to tell the calibre of a gun pressed to the back of the neck we used several guns alarming the fellow in firearms because we werent on duty at the time and stoner lost his money because he said one of them was a and it was really the end of a scent bottle the lights went green a rickshaw got on the move the other side of the station wagon the man between the shafts butting his way through the stragglers two girls ran giggling to the crowded pavement hobbled by their cheongsams and on the far side of the intersection a bus driver began tapping his horn as he moved slowly forward no one was taking any notice of what was happening around them at this hour they were hurrying into the town from the ferries or along to the restaurants andbrothels and bars of the wanchai district or eastwards to the hotels and supper clubs and theatres of causeway bay a few were strolling going where their fancy took them this was their first sight of hong kong by night and they circled like moths he was a professional quite a lot of the data concerned this man memory suggested he was chinese because the competition on this operation was chinese and sensory perception tended to confirm this he smelt of incense and the faint distorted image in the chrome strip of the window was oriental the pressure against my head was steady and constant and i knew he was a professional because he was speaking to me and laughing a little presenting the image of someone talking to a friend through the window of his car even though he realized it was hardly necessary when the passersby were so preoccupied the station wagon swayed an inch as the rear door was pulled open on the far side as far as i could tell there was only one man getting in then the front passenger door came open and someone else got in and slammed the door and pushed the muzzle hard against my left side below the ribcage the taxi in the mirror began honking because the lights had changed a few seconds ago but we wouldnt be long now because the man who had been talking and laughing to me took his gun away and got into the back leaning forward on the edge of the seat to talk again bringing the gun to the nape of my neck and covering it with his left hand i could feel the warmth of his little finger just above the muzzle the man beside me spoke now prodding me and i drove off across the intersection going east it was obvious what hed told me to do though i didnt understand he spoke in mandarin the common language of the new china as the first man had done what do you want i asked them in english just a slight tremor of alarm in the voice a couple of snatched glances at the man next to me my cover was that of a man who dealt in rare coins and bullion and i must have had a few brushes with violence or attempted violence in my profession a safebreak or a mugging or a bagsnatch things like that so i shouldnt be too frightened by this turn of events but merely alarmed there was a flat halfmuted singing of mandarin again and i shook my head hopelessly i was waiting for a bit of cantonese but i wasnt going to understand that either because theres a distinct advantage in the language barrier it invites the competition to speak freely among themselves in their own tongue and it slows the action down quite a bit when they bark out an order because if you dont understand what theyre barking out they cant expect immediate obedience i was now being searched as far as was possible in the confines of the station wagon and they were surprised not to find a gun the ones they carried were now pressed a little harder against me possibly because they were suspicious intelligent agents normally use guns some more mandarin then some rather inept attempts at cantonese when i kept shaking my head these were hit men recently arrived in hong kong uneducated and no more than actiontrained probably theyd been flown in from pekin when the people down here had found my photo in the files there were a lot of them here anything up to a hundred and it didnt even have to stop at that because the population of china is embarrassingly large they were here in force presumably because one operator can often mean a whole cell has moved into the field and a cell would depend on a network down along he kept saying in cantonese while i looked suitably puzzled he jerked a hand across the windscreen showing me where i had to go down towards the harbour i looked at my watch being careful not to take my hand off the wheel just angling the wrist because they seemed rather excited and i didnt want any accidents both guns were suddenly pressed harder against me and i had a verbal warning the time was and i noted it because its often important to remember what time an event happened or this could be just rationalizing the subconscious need for orientation to know the time was to control the situation if only in terms of being informed of being able to measure one of its elements and i suppose this was a sop to the whimpering little organism as it tried to get my attention theyre going to kill you its three to one and youve had it and theres nothing you can do but i dont want to die dont let them bloody well shut up sweat on my hands down he said at the next intersection pointing with his thin hand its striking edge swollen and inflamed hed be somewhere near the yellow standard and still having trouble with the bricks in a couple of minutes we came to a quay on the west side of the typhoon shelter and the man made me put the station wagon through a narrow gap between ropes and warning flags where the parapet was being repaired nobody was here because at night there was nothing to come here for stop there was a lot of sign language i had to get out and stand with my hands raised against the wall of the rope store while they patted me all over for the gun beginning to chatter when they couldnt find one i could hear two of them back inside the car pulling up the seats and snapping open the glove compartment where gun they asked me frustrated what the hell would i want a gun for getting irritable now a good mind to call a policeman so forth it was possible they were brighter than they looked so i launched a daring tirade of indignation in colonial english mentioning the severe punishment they would receive at the hands of the judge and the long years in prison they were risking by their infamous conduct they let me go on for ten seconds or so not because they were listening but because they were completely thrown by not being able to find my gun then they told me to shut up and began on my wallet they had a photograph of me i could see it was another copy of the one id found on the boy in the snake shop and they began comparing it with my face and the photograph in my passport making me stand facing the tall lamp at the edge of the quay they werent too satisfied but then i didnt see how they could be because passport photos are only ever good for a giggle and the one their network was circulating in hong kong was grainy i stood as theyd placed me hands by my sides so as not to attract attention if anyone came by a gun was pressed against my spine while the other two went through my papers driving licence membership card of the british numismatic association representatives card for mendoza sa of buenos aires the letters of introduction youve made a mistake i said they looked at me and then at the papers again i dont think theyd understood but i sensed they were pretty impressed by the cover material and for the first time it occurred to me that i had a chance of getting out of this alive the feeling was quite heady and an indication of how depressed id been getting before id seen the straws in the wind the thing was that all theyd had to go on was the photograph the copy of the one on file at the bank of china the station wagon was clear and so was the harbour hotel and theyd picked me up on sight alone part luck and part efficiency there werent many english in hong kong but the faces of caucasians looked much alike to the asians and theyd been very good and that was probably why they were so excited when theyd got into the car now they were beginning to wonder if theyd got the right man youre looking for someone else i told them shaking my head the two of them looked up again what this he held out one of the letters of introduction trying to sound accusing he could have questioned any of the other papers just as well he wanted me to react that was all coins i said the mendoza letter heading carried three gold pieces sumptuously embossed and gilded with great care i moved my hand pointing to my pocket what coin i took a risk and tapped my pocket with a stiff finger making my small change clink then bringing my hand very slowly to point at the letter i am a coin dealer how this he meant my left hand accident i didnt want to go into that one so i produced a short embarrassed laugh look i thought you were going to rob me but now i can see youre looking for someone in particular i spread my hands till the gun prodded my spine i am not the man you are looking for it was the only possible hope they were young and inexperienced and would fear their superiors and they werent keen on knocking off an innocent party before theyd made sure who he was on the other hand they felt frustrated about this they were three of the toughest young thugs id ever seen and they were longing to make a killing for the hell of it because thats what their pekin instructors had been training them to do for so long you come londan he had the inhuman stare of the disciple newly ordained with all the power of mao behind him he was addressing one of the imperialist vermin he had learned about at the desk and on the blackboard theyd stuffed his head with ta tzupao and his stomach with government rice and sent him out crusading a true son of the socialist revolution a brave soldier of the peoples liberation army neither lance in his hand nor falcon at his wrist but just an itch in the pit of his guts to do in reality what he had done so many times in makebelieve spilling the sawdust out of the sacks in the sweaty gymnasium sending them swinging on their ropes at a chop of his hand or a kick of his foot without even hating them and dreaming of the day when his masters would give him something alive something to hate something to kill something like me no i said i dont come from london i didnt think he could read roman characters he couldnt he didnt react the passport and the other papers didnt mean anything to him and that was why he found them impressive their very unintelligibility was mystic and had power over him he went on staring for a moment and then turned suddenly away to talk to the other man not the one with the gun at my spine the one with the blepharitis they spoke in mandarin still the kuoyu and i couldnt follow but it seemed as if they thought theyd made a mistake and didnt know what to do next so i began rehearsing a speech in simple engish they wouldnt understand but the words would implement my gestures and provide the vehicle for tone and the tone was very important rueful conciliatory halfadmitting myself as party to their unfortunate mistake listen i said and they looked at me if you will let me go i will tell no one it is a silly mistake i will go away quietly and forget i rang the changes on this theme bowing myself out of their ken taking a step towards the station wagon shaking my head sorrowfully about our foolish misunderstanding the bloody thing poking sharply into my back as i took that one step nearer the car i stopped and waited for them to react there were chimes sounding somewhere probably from one of the english churches eight oclock the hour when a young married widow with a taste for ming and emeralds and soixanteneuf would be going through the doors of el caliph to receive in surprise a dozen gardenias in lieu of dalliance when a thin owlish man with a thing against insects and a scar on his soul would be waiting in the shadows on a hong kong junk and listening to these same chimes checking his watch and when clive wing coin dealer was standing on a deserted quayside wondering how many minutes longer he was going to live theyd listened to what id said and their rather bright stares had followed my gestures attentively the language of mime is universally understood even by children they seemed to be waiting for me to go on but i decided to leave it at that as if i felt confident and didnt need to protest it was quiet here and we all stood perfectly still as we considered in our divers ways what should be done i thought i could neutralize one of them the one with the gun at my back it would take him a long time relatively to pull the trigger because i would induce nervous trauma in him first thats why i always disappoint those people in firearms when they try to sell me their goods i just dont trust the bloody things theyre heavy and awkward and unreliable and of course an absolute giveaway and i dont like the bang they make when these ticks had hijacked me just now in the car i couldnt have used a gun even if id carried one and they wouldnt have accepted my cover theyd have known right away theyd pulled in the spook they were after no go it takes time to pull a trigger because the chain of events is long and intricate this boy would have fast reactions but that would only narrow the time gap it wouldnt close it whatever move i made would surprise him because he was holding a gun and i wasnt and this gave him enormous confidence and left him wide open to surprise and all its hazards hed lose something in the region of a tenth of a second right at the outset because the flood of incoming data would be blocked off by the condition of shock he wouldnt be able to think what i was doing because his ability to reason would be suspended until the shock phase was over added to this critical delay would be the normal physiological requirements in terms of time the time needed to assess the data decide on the appropriate action envisage it analyse the image reach the decision to act and order the action the transmission of nervous signals would take very little time the electrical impulse travelling at a hundred miles per second and in this case probably a little faster since the organism was trained in unarmed combat but once his trigger finger had become active under its muscle contraction he was going to run into a phase of gross delay in the overall operation the flesh of his finger alone would absorb several minor fractions of a second and the spring mechanism of the gun would then begin using up the greatest proportion of the total time demanded from initiation to completion they stared at me at my rueful smile somewhere inland the clock in the church ended its chimes none of us moved none of us so maybe i could neutralize one of them the one with the gun but there was too much against it id have to move sideways instead of forward and down and even then his gun hand would follow until i could mount the blow and if i brought it off thered be one dead man and that was all there wouldnt be time to cripple him or put him out of action itd have to be a shikana the force of both arms swinging the elbow in a murderous curve for the diaphragm a rising blow that wouldnt call for sight since i knew precisely where his diaphragm was at this instant but if i did it thered be another death a second later because the nearer of the other two the one with the blepharitis would recognize the blow i was using and come for me with any one of the forwardkilling kicks while my neck was exposed to him at the end of my own movement hed be too frightened to do anything else because this is the way with the graduated belts their powers are so deadly that they recognize the dangers of an equal so there wasnt a chance but you have to think of everything or youll miss a trick and theyll go in there and switch the lights on and lock the door and pull your dossier out of the safe and drop it into the document destruction thing just because you didnt think of everything youre making a mistake i told them again they didnt understand and it worried them in case i was saying something they could use for their profit they told me to shut up i didnt know the word but i knew the tone then the thin one folded my papers and put them into the passport and i waited for him to hand them back to me and give a shrug and let me go because the imperilled psyche becomes undisciplined and clutters the mind with false hopes however you try to reason he said a word and the gun was pushed harder against my spine and we moved at last the four of us towards the station wagon i was forced back into the driving seat and they took my wrists and put my hands on the wheelrim then they all climbed in and slammed the doors and one of them tugged out the street map from the glove compartment and got it open and stared at it for a moment and finally stabbed his finger near one of the folds here he looked at me with his blank animal eyes to see that i understood go here the facia wasnt lit but there was a chemical glow from the quayside lamps and his finger was stabbing again at the point on the map the corner of statue square where the bank of china stood with its great brass doors and its garrison of armed guards and interrogators the place where they were going to take me and after a while make me wish to christ id drawn a capsule chapter eleven target have you seen this chart yes i told him where on the launch what launch the narcotics boat oh yes he had it spread across the table chart china southeast coastapproaches to hong kongislands south of lantau have you studied it he asked me not in detail his head turned slightly and he became very still for a second or two then he went across to the bulkhead and put his foot down and there was a light crunch and he came back i wish to christ you wouldnt do that i said he gave a titter but watched me with unamused eyes cockroach old boy the mariners bane how are you feeling bloody awful physically i was all right but it had put an edge on my nerves those three little ticks trying to get at me like that within minutes of final briefing youve got three and a half hours yet said ferris take it easy he leaned over the chart again moving the lantern so that its light featured the bottom righthand corner this was the target zone centred on longitude by east latitude by north the oil rig was two miles south of the sanmen islands and i saw hed marked it in i suppose hed asked the navy or someone where the thing was have you seen any other charts one or two on the narcotics launch yes i hadnt studied them he got another one and unrolled it and spread it out and began topographical briefing while i sat in my track suit and tried to get my left eyelid to keep still they could have wrecked the whole mission for me those little bastards hong kong is pretty well surrounded said ferris with these little islands a couple of hundred of them belonging to the colony and the rest of them garrisoned by the communist chinese i didnt ask any questions yet but i was already wondering how the hell he was going to drop me into the target zone with any kind of security even by night youll be going in by sub he said without looking up from the chart it wasnt telepathy he was just a very bright director and keeping one step ahead of me i let him go on talking trying to get the other thing out of my mind they were probably dead this group is perfectly barren with the nearest garrison on this island here five nautical miles to the northeast i was beginning to steam now so i unzipped the track suit to the waist and let it hang open ferris had gone to fetch it for me from the harbour hotel mustnt catch a cold hed said with a whinnying laugh and left me here on the junk with a towel round me i hadnt dried off enough before i put the track suit on and that was why i had begun steaming it hadnt taken a minute but it had seemed longer there wasnt time to plan anything elegant because once they got me inside that bloody place i wouldnt come out again alive and theyd have a go art getting the whole lot before i was too far gone to say anything there wasnt anything useful i could tell them about mandarin we wanted to reach tewson and we werent even in the access phase and they knew a hell of a lot more about him than we did but theyd try for general background what was my cell what network what bases so forth and if they worked on me for long enough i mean for months not hours they might get a picture of the bureau and even some of the organizational features names wouldnt mean anything they were all code the thing about having the suffix after your name in the dossier is that although it means youve proved yourself reliable under torture it doesnt mean they wont start doing things to you one day thatll finally break you down i dont like pain any more than anyone else does my hands were on the wheel where theyd put them and the thin one turned the ignition key to start the engine and then told me to drive off go now he said and i thought how chinese it sounded even though he spoke in english so the first thing to do was blow my cover i can be quite useful to you i said the thing that surprised them was that i said it in cantonese theyd been halfsure i was the man they wanted it was only when they couldnt find a gun that they began having serious doubts and even then theyd thought it was worth while taking me along to the interrogators now they had all they needed i could speak cantonese and id been concealing the fact on top of which id told them i could be useful to them they all three started to talk at once and the thin one told the other two to shut up he leaned forward with his arm across the top of the facia turned sideways to watch me you are from londan yes your name is clive wing yes his cantonese wasnt much better than mine but we got along the man behind me was pressing the gun into my neck so hard that i couldnt sit up straight they were excited again now ready for the execution but the thin one had a certain basic intelligence and thought i could conceivably be more use alive than dead the thing i needed was speed drive to the bank of china he said if thats what you want but ive told you i can be useful to you the engine was ticking over you will tell them at our headquarters he nodded his tone cocky and his whole attitude like that of a masterspy running an entire operation i shall arrange full interrogation i kept quiet for a couple of seconds and then got the right degree of reluctance into the tone all right but i can put one of my agents into your hands if youll be lenient with me later i looked at my watch what agent were working together but well have to hurry because we had a rendezvous at hours and hell leave if i dont show up it was terribly basic stuff and i felt a bit embarrassed the hit men of any network are never much more than muscle but these were from a state where most of the population had been trained to regard the life of the ant as utopia if i tried any kind of subtlety with them wed get bogged down in misunderstanding and all i needed was speed speed in terms of actual miles per hour also i needed a valid reason for hurrying i looked at my watch again and the gun poked harder into the neck muscle sending my head forward and one of the men behind me laughed but the thin one told him to shut up where is your rendezvous on a junk just this side of the naval dockyard he wanted me to show him on the map so i pointed to a spot near the dockyard there were a thousand junks along the north shore of the island and anywhere would suit me so long as it was west of this quay because i needed three left turns and a straight to bring me out where i wanted how many men are there i one man he thought about this and someone behind us said they could take on an army and he told him to shut up again then he reached his decision slapping the top of the facia a little dramatically very well we will go youve left it a bit late i said well have to hurry he nodded quickly and i used my right foot and the acceleration caught them by surprise and that bastard in the back lost his balance and the gun came away from my neck and it was quite a relief that was about all there was to it i didnt go too fast round the three lefthanders because i didnt want to worry them and there wasnt any need but i gunned up along the straight bit past the warehouse and they all sat waiting for me to slow and turn at the t section but i didnt because this was where the repair work was being done to the edge of the quay and by the time they began calling out we were going through the ropes and the warning flags fast enough to pull the uprights down and clear the edge without hitting the underside of the chassis they didnt shoot or anything because there obviously wouldnt be any point and in any case they were sitting there now with a cold wind blowing through their guts as the water of the harbour came swinging up at us in a great black wall i had the window down because if we hit the surface at any angle within ninety degrees each side of the vertical the door was going to slam shut again and i wanted the water to flood in before they could do anything about it not because it was necessary to kill them but because i didnt want them getting out and swimming around and trying to get at me again if i could reach the junk in the typhoon shelter we could keep mandarin running and go into the access phase i wanted that a lot one of the roadrepair boards flipped up and smashed the windscreen as we cleared the edge and a rope tautened and broke and whiplashed past the open window and then there was the long curving drop and i tried to work out the angles and the timing but the surface wasnt far below the edge of the quay and i had to hit the door open and kick clear of the bodywork and strike the water feet first with the impact wave from the station wagon knocking me sideways most of the breath gone and not much idea of the way things had worked out except that i was still in a fair condition for swimming the door slammed shut as it hit the water but it was a muted sound metal on bone one of them probably trying to get out while there was time not making it then there was one colossal bubble as the whole thing went under then a few smaller ones then nothing just the waves across the surface as i began a slow crawl this island here said ferris is your only possible refuge if you get into any kind of trouble hengkang chou with a steep south shore inclining to an average of sixteen fathoms within twenty yards or so of the waterline no garrison no garrison he wandered off to the stern deck and took a quiet look around and came back whistling softly and i waited for him to tread on something again then i was going to rip right into him because it had been only yesterday when the bus had left the long red smear on the roadway he couldnt see anything to tread on you think any of them got back to the surface possibly i didnt want to think about that either because there are some ways of going that you dont wish on your worst enemy the thing was that theyd spent a lot of time in the gymnasium but theyd had no security training or theyd have known the last thing you do when you have a captive is let him drive the car got any questions only general whats the sea temperature the average for the past week was this oil rig i got up and peeled off the top half of the track suit and turned it inside out and spread it across one of the bunks how close can anyone go in international waters you feeling the heat he was watching me with that quiet glitter in his eyes oh for christ sake its a hot night isnt it it brought more sweat out and i was duly warned with only three and a half hours to go id better start shutting down the spleen this access was about the most sensitive thing id ever had to handle that was why london was sending in a reserve just wanted to know old boy that youre feeling on top form he looked at the teakwood dragon that held the bulkhead lamp in its jaws in international waters maritime law prohibits uninvited vessels approaching nearer than five hundred metres thats about what fifteen or sixteen hundred feet last year a soviet ship sailed to within a hundred feet of an offshore rig in the north sea and began taking photographs and the navy sent a destroyer out there to warn it off how close is the sub going within a mile thats well clear of the illegal limit he gave a giggle mustnt upset anybody i asked him about standoff liaison rendezvous patterns so forth some of it hadnt been worked out yet because there hadnt been time you know what their lordships are you ask them to lend you a piddling little submarine and they think youre trying to scuttle the fleet but we got it in the endshes in the harbour now been rusting there for weeks hms swordfish you must have seen her when you came in from yes no more questions not really hed briefed me on night signals rations panicbutton limits the whole of the access routine whatve you got he asked me lifting his wrist that thing waterproof yes okay he pulled the winder and reset and pushed it back ill be filling you in on the rendezvous patterns and that sort of thing after weve left harbour the skippers had to call up the admiralty to get various permissions arent you glad youre not a bellbottomed matelot i said i was going to take ninety minutes sleep and he seemed rather relieved and said hed go for a little walk by which he meant hed take up station out there and vet anything that moved hed already fetched the scuba gear when hed gone to the hotel for the track suit and there wasnt anything else to do but wait ferris old boy is london going to put any fresh tags on nora tewson it was nothing to do with briefing and i was a bit surprised at my own question a touch of jealousy i suppose i didnt want anyone else to know what i knew of her that strange double image of the innocent and the tigress at least for a while i didnt count tewson of course hed never known her like that i very much doubt ferris said if theyd put any more tags on that girlie considering the state of things out here the egg doesnt care at all for sending people on suicide stunts we went aboard swordfish at midnight her lights resembled a fishing boats and i didnt recognize her until the tender began slowing then the configuration came up in silhouette against the lights of the kowloon shoreline radar mast conningtower diving planes the sea was glass calm the lifeline was still rigged on deck but a couple of hands started bringing it in as we went on board there were two or three figures standing on the bridge and ferris peered at them in the inadequate light wing he said this is bill ackroyd captain we said hello and a seaman reached down and took my stuff from the man in the tender one of the air bottles banged against a stanchion and someone said easy now i looked down careful with that bag there its fragile ay ay sir it was the shortwave hammerlund transceiver ferris had dug up for me and wed put it in a waterproof bag along with the lamp and the rations people were speaking in low voices and i noticed the main bridge lights were shrouded except for her riding lights swordfish was in wartime rig the tender backed off and swung in a wide curve away from us leaving a scimitar of iridescent light across the sea i could feel the vibration of the diesels under my feet whats that over there i asked ferris it looked like some kind of launch standing off at a hundred yards escort the skipper said for the whole trip just out of harbour would you like a drink he took us below there was gin set up in the wardroom and i asked for a straight tonic and ferris wanted to know if they had any milk and ackroyd began looking at us as if we were a couple of freak seaanemones theyd dragged up with the anchor chain frank topper he said close to the chest diving officer we all said hello again and i wished to christ we could cut out the garden party and get moving ferris had a nervous smile switched on against any doubts in his mind and i began feeling bloody annoyed because my left hand should have had some kind of treatment and i was still in mild aftershock from the station wagon thing and london was pitching us right into a crashaccess operation and that meant something had come up on the board and theyd started to panic cheers one of the officers said there seemed to be a lot of noise from the fans and blowers but nobody took any notice then there was the slam of a steel hatch and two seamen came down and disappeared through a doorway and ackroyd took us back into the control room the helmsman was in his seat and there were needles crawling all over the dials and ferris stood there watching everything with his bright glass eyes and a ruff of hair sticking out where hed brushed his head on the companionway coming down everything had suddenly gone quiet all right ackroyd said slow ahead both there wasnt any appreciable movement but the bug started glowing across the chart on the drt and in ten minutes we were out of the harbour five minutes later there was another sudden period of inactivity and ackroyd said pull out the plug and ease her down to periscope depth the deck began sloping by degrees and i looked at the instruments time course ferris was watching me and i felt like kicking his teeth in because his stare was critical and i knew that if i showed any signs of nerves or fatigue or anxiety hed have this ship turned about and taken back into harbour i didnt like being assessed at this phase of a mission if i felt incapable of going in or doing a decent job id say so he knew that better than loman perhaps or porterfield theyd send you into the target zone with your nerves in rags and your eyes out of focus from fatigue if they thought you could finish the course without dropping dead well slope off ferris said with a bright smile and do some more chatting he led me into the wardroom and we sat down and went over the whole thing again i got it right at the third go and then he filled me in about the liaison and rendezvous patterns the routine rdvs will be prearranged by radio ackroyd says we cant risk coming in closer than a mile from the rig so if you can swim that distance youll navigate by the north star and listen for the call of the sea swallow ill play you the tape in a minute swordfish will pick you up on the sonar and moved slowly to rendezvous this was typical ferris in less than twentyfour hours hed had the call of the sea swallow put on tape and dug up a radio from the american stores and pushed london to give us a ship through the navy if youre not in a condition to swim as far as that or any distance at all we can do you a straight emergency pickup through the distress channels and send in a coastguard chopper with a net if you cant do oh yes we can itd expose our hand but if i can get you back alive without blowing the mission thats what im going to do i knew he meant it but as i looked at him in the flat white light of the wardroom i wondered whether hed always been so considerate towards his executives in the field or whether he was trying to atone for what theyd sent him to do that time in brussels can i come in the captain was standing in the doorway of course ferris told him we were just chewing the fat for a submarine skipper ackroyd looked too young but that might have been partly due to the applered glow on his cheeks which i put down to the gin his eyes were small and quick and he gave explosive little laughs trying to cover them by tugging at the creases of his tropical slacks or scratching an ear he looked about the last man to want to creep about under the sea in the confines of a tin coffin would you like to know anything about this tub shes s class commissioned only last year and built for patrol got two diesels and all mod cons shes fast silent and difficult to detect just the job for you what he tugged energetically at his creases through the doorway i could hear the pinging of the sonar transducer above the rush of the blowers there was almost no vibration from the screws lucky to find ourselves on board said ferris dont know about luck his small quick eyes glancing from ferris to me and back i understand you put such a squib under their lordships they havent come down yet he scratched his ear his cheeks glowing what are you chaps leaning forward suddenly and lowering his voice intelligence wallahs or something mi thats right said ferris i suppose he thought if ackroyd had the impression that mi worked overseas he might as well leave it at that a classic piece of disinformation by the way do you think theyll use depthcharges ackroyds face snapped shut and he looked down at his hands you know thats why you chaps had so much trouble getting us to help you if i were to take swordfish into chinese waters only a few miles north of here wed have depth charges dropped on us no question at all his bright eyes came up and scanned us in a series of flicking glances i mean unless we surfaced and explained our presence or signalled we were in some kind of trouble now they cant do that in international waters but they might try his glance took in the doorway and he began speaking close to his chest again it hasnt escaped their lordships that if we are to drop off a frogman within a mile of an offshore oil rig whose structure is chinese republican territory we might encounter objections and of the most tangible kind it wouldnt be legal but it would be understandable his laugh exploded and he tugged busily at the lobe of his ear ferris gave a companionable whinny so its like that he said its like that gentlemen cross our fingers said ferris and ackroyd glanced at him we could both feel the chill coming out of him though hed been trying to deal with it ferris was claustrophobic and the idea of being inside this thing when they dropped depth charges on it wasnt making him feel any better let me explain said the captain if they were worried enough about our presence so close to the rig they might try to blow us out of the water and later claim they did it when we were inside their territorial waters and that we drifted south before we bottomed theyd have to knock us out at the first shy or wed start sending radio messages to the effect that we were being attacked in international waters he shrugged with his small pink hands provided they could drown us to a man before we could use the radio how could anyone dispute their claim we didnt say anything that is the position then of course im going to make every effort to avoid an incident i have seventy crew on board his face went shut again and he looked down at the table for the duration of this voyage gentlemen swordfish has been placed on a war footing this was our only way in said ferris im awfully sorry give us something to do you called on the right people the silent service a short burst of laughter while he plucked at his ear what time i asked him do we expect to arrive off the rig come into the control room the glow of the bug was moving across the chart between lamma and cheng chau islands were heading north of this one hei chou and turning approximately southeast instead of rounding this group here the long way round but safer as you see all these islands are chinese territory and most of them maintain garrisons and of course coastguard units he glanced up at the chronometer i estimate well reach our position in half an hour let us say we went back into the wardroom to keep out of their way everything going nicely ferris said but he didnt look at me he was behaving rather well every time one of the bulk head doors was slammed somewhere in the ship he gave a quick blink but that was all piece of cake i said and began sorting out my gear i didnt know what the conditions were out there in an air drop you can study the target zone on your way down and pick out any features that could be dangerous or difficult but all i knew on this trip was that the sea was calm the temperature was in the region of and moonrise had taken place twelve minutes ago it wasnt much to know in ten minutes the ship began heeling slightly as we turned southeast and headed straight for the rig fourteen or fifteen miles distant at i went back to the control room leaving ferris looking at a copy of penthouse not really his cup of tea his face had lost all its colour now and had a sheen of sweat on it i noticed hed pushed back the tuft of hair that had been sticking out theyd changed the chart on the deadreckoning tracer and we were now on with the glow of the bug moving midway between yai chou island and the sanmen group our heading was and the oil rig was four sea miles distant dead on our course it was quieter now in the control room and i looked up at the blower grilles weve shut some of them down said ackroyd the engineroom telegraph was at half ahead both we must have been slowing nobody was slamming doors any more i looked at ackroyd same eta thats right his small bright eyes were very steady now as he watched the console i went back to the wardroom ferris had pushed the copy of penthouse to the end of the table and was sitting motionless looking slightly upwards i suppose that was where he was expecting to hear the crump but the bloody things could go off anywhere dead on our beam or below us anywhere he turned his head are we still on our eta yes time to suit up isnt it yes talc floated up under the lights as i got into the wetsuit and zipped it to the throat and started on the final checks tank pressure valves harness backpack buckles a quick exhalation through the mouthpiece to clear the check valves all normal have you seen the rig yet ferris asked me not yet but its there i hit the valves a fraction to blow out any dust making him flinch sorry dont mind me i aligned the regulators turning the butterfly bolts fingertight are we slowing he asked i stopped work and listened yes there wasnt anything more i could do before it was time to put on the scuba so i went into the control room ackroyd turned his head fractionally were rigged for silent running he said understood we spoke very quietly all sound background had gone the engines were running at slow and theyd shut down all fans blowers pumps and auxiliary motors next to me i could hear the diving officer breathing want to take a look i went to the periscope the oil rig was dead in sights a black skeleton structure rearing from the moon lit surface of the sea longitude latitude the target for mandarin chapter twelve solo it was a quick piping note the call of the sea swallow ferris left the tape running while he helped me with the scuba this side okay another notch on the buckle the weight of the tanks shifted a seaman came to the doorway the captain wants you to know theyve got radar on the rig yes sir the bloody harness still wasnt right back another notch on both will you will do theres no hurry but i could hear his breathing wed passed through chinese territorial waters between the islands and the last report from the control room was that we were now standing off the rig at one mile feel better i shrugged the scuba a couple of times yes i tipped my head back as far as i could without feeling the regulators the nearest naval base was probably at kitchioh or somewhere to the west along the south china coast and even if they could send anything seaborne from namtow they wouldnt get here before swordfish was under way again it was airborne attention ackroyd was worried about the chart gave the depth in this area of the continental shelf as eighteen fathoms and if the garrison sent a chopper out from the rig or one of the islands wed have to crash dive but with periscope depth at sixty feet thered be critically limited room to manoeuvre with the sea calm and the moon clear wed be a sitting duck for any kind of aerial reconnaissance for christ sake switch it off will you ferris that bloody bird was getting on my nerves he went over to the taperecorder and pressed the stop button anyway youll know what to listen for i thought he said it rather deliberately if i dont know now i never will what we call good briefing if i may say so there was an edge on his voice the first time id heard it are they going to put it through the loudhailer with discretion a wintry smile its not meant to be a peacock ackroyd was standing in the doorway how are things getting along gentlemen he said it in a half whisper fine wheres the head through there as i turned away he said quickly dont flush it well do it for you later fair enough they were still standing there when i came back the silence was almost total now and i could hear the rustle of a sleeve as someone in the control room moved his arm nobody looked at me but i was the only man among the whole of the complement they were thinking about as soon as they could spit this bloody frog out of the escape hatch they could start engines and get the hell out of here before some yellow bastard spotted them skipper i said id like to take a final look by all means he led me into the control room i knew they wanted me out of swordfish as fast as possible but i couldnt help that i had to establish the image of the rig and i had to do it now and from this precise position because later it wouldnt be stable and i could lose my bearings we were to the northeast of the thing and midway between it and the sanmen islands and i wanted to memorize the rigs configuration from this exact angle because if a sea haze covered the pole star and the rigs structure sent my compass wild id have nothing left but this image as my guide up scope ackroyd stood aside and i took the grips turning the sights until the crosshairs swung to centre on the rig at this distance it reached twenty or so degrees from the horizontal and i could see its riding lights there was some kind of flood illumination hitting the cranes and derrick from lamps on the top deck and a flare pilot was burning with a steady flame from the tip of a stackpipe at one side i could make out the black aerodynamic shape of a helicopter the object we most feared thank you our pleasure the scope was brought down and i went through to the wardroom a young seaman was coming the other way and stood aside for me his leg catching one of my reserve air tanks it hit the metal bulkhead and someone said shit under his breath and the seamans face went white we all stood perfectly still for a minute trying to replay the sound in our memory to judge how bad it was it wasnt very good so i did a final synchronization check with ferris and tugged the flippers on and carried the reserve tanks and other stuff along to the escape hatch ackroyd led the way personally which i thought was civil of him ferris helped me stow the gear against the bulkhead and i checked the faceplate for misting better you than me ackroyd murmured he had a very heldin smile i wouldnt want your job either i said and put the mask on they swung the door shut without making a noise and the last thing i saw was the pale and watchful face of ferris not much of his mind on me most of it going through a lightning series of checks to see if wed forgotten anything overlooked anything anything that could catch up on us a minute from now or an hour from now or at noon today when was alone in the target zone and out of reach flooding began the sickly rubber smell of the mask i shifted the lead belt around an inch unnecessarily the water was waist high the thing i had to do was simple difficult but simple during final briefing id asked ferris why the hell didnt we take up station at the golden sands hotel and do a snatch on tewson the next time he was brought ashore to see his wife there were three reasons hed said one tewson might never go there again two london wanted the evidence three london wanted to know what the evidence was the water touched my chin the mask had started to mist up so i pulled it off and spat into the faceplate and wiped it clear and put it back if tewson never went to the hotel again we could lose him forever he could disappear into mainland china and that would be that presumably the evidence london wanted was to be used against tewson or through diplomatic channels against pekin or maybe both and the evidence london wanted was the evidence of what tewson was doing on board the rig water above my head vision distorted sound magnified as the water gushed in from the pipes left hand stinging salt in the wound ferris would tell london straight away hed have to because egerton always insisted on phase situation reports going in on time and it was no good telling him later that you were up a steeple or down a drain the moment this watertight hatch opened ferris would have to say so either through admiralty signals and crowborough or shiptoshore cable to chiang in cypher the standing contraction access phase open executive in target zone the hollow ringing sound of the water died away and there was just the steady inspiration and expiration of my lungs with the soft cathedral echoes then hinges turned and a circle of pale light appeared above me and i pushed gently upwards floating away the sea was dead calm and the light milky with the waning moon trailing a pale gold disc above me on the surface minutes later i thought i heard the pulsing of the subs engines but i wasnt sure the senses were having to adjust to the laws of this other world where the ears must listen under pressure and the eyes see things as larger than they were and closer halfway to the rig i turned and floated on my back sighting along the surface through the faceplate the island was there on the near horizon hengkang chou id been moving offcourse and when i turned again i saw the rigs configuration had altered noticeably this worried me because thered been no figures we could hope to work out for the targetzone duration i could hold out for three days in terms of rations and drinkingwater but that didnt have any reference to the amount of time id spend submerged standard practice was to economize with the air supply and leave a ten per cent margin of error in making calculations and you dont economize with the air supply by going offcourse watch what youre bloody well doing id been using the compass because they had radar and thered be lookouts on the rig the phosphorescent dial was clear enough to read accurately but the steel substructure was beginning to send the needle wild and from now on id have to risk it and take direct visual checks at intervals with the faceplate clear of the surface till i could pick up the base of the rig below water i was moving almost due south and the moon was climbing in the east and id have to avoid tilting my head to the left when i surfaced the faceplate to minimize reflection from the glass they didnt have sonar wed known that long before wed reached our position if theyd had sonar they would have sent the chopper aloft to investigate our sound and wed have seen it and ackroyd would have turned about or surfaced signalling difficulties the main danger would have come from divers below the rig if the substructure was under repair or there were modifications being made theyd have divers down and they would have picked up the sound of our screws i submerged again moving a few feet below the surface low enough to prevent the kick of the fins from making a disturbance high enough to preserve buoyancy i began looking for the outlines of the substructure ahead of me now but the water was cloudy in patches it could be just plankton or weed debris or the machinery on board the rig was perpetually disturbing the sea bed i began worrying about exhalation bubbles but there wasnt anything i could do theyd still break the surface from whatever depth i went down to ignore the world was silent around me my own sound alone disturbing it the hollow and echoing rhythm of my breathing as the living bellows of my lungs fed on the inert reservoirs of air and blew it out each breath exhausting it by degrees and irrecoverably sometimes the reserve tanks and the other gear caught an eddy from my fins and pulled me sideways a little dragging on the nylon cord and every time this happened i rose and broke the surface with the faceplate to correct my course but i didnt like having to do it because this whole operation was so bloody sensitive this was a ministry of defence thing and theyd got something so big on the board that theyd panicked and thrown us a crashaccess and the bureau hadnt been able to stop them control had been kicked into motion with almost nothing to go on we had to reach tewson as fast as we could and we didnt have to ask any questions there was obviously a chance that hed show up again at the golden sands but they couldnt give us time to mount an orderly snatch and that was all right but they couldnt have it both ways theyd hairtriggered mandarin to the point where the target was so sensitive that id almost certainly blow it before i could get there tewson was the target tewson and the rig and the instant they realized we were getting too close theyd whip him into china tell you what london had sent me here to do i had to stalk a bird barehanded and catch it before it flew up bloody london for you the cord tautened again and i was pulled sideways getting fed up with it when i broke surface with the faceplate i saw the configuration had altered but not too much i was learning how to do it better every time the flare at the tip of the stack made a diffused glow and i took off the mask and demisted it pulling the mouthpiece away for a moment to drag in the dry taste of ozone the rig looked about half a mile away and as far as i could see there was no movement on board the lights were stable and their pattern didnt change id have liked to audiosurvey for a few seconds but it wouldnt be easy it wouldnt be any good just pushing one ear through the surface because itd be full of water id have to drain it and that meant putting the whole of my head through and if they had any shortrange scanners theyd pick up the blob i went down again and listened below water holding my breath for five seconds nothing from the information ferris had picked up from local sources the oil rig had been operational for three months the crude was said to be already on stream and theyd set up a tanker shuttle between the rig and the refineries along the south china coast if they were burning residual lean gas at the flare pilot they must be running at production capacity and they ought to be working round the clock because on an operational oil rig theres no difference between night and day there was on this one no sound of machinery no sound of life i checked the time at airstream normal buoyancy easy to manage the spare tanks no real problem during the next long haul i made two brief visual checks from the surface and then stayed below the faint yellow stain of the flare pilot was now on the surface and i used it as my lode star until the dark trellis pattern of the substructure began showing against the sea bed a hundred feet below the glow of the derrick bases flared softly for two or three minutes on the surface and then dimmed out as i arched my back slightly and brought my head down diving to twenty feet on the gauge i was assuming there were lookouts and the air tanks on my back could pick up scattered light it was almost totally dark at this depth and i stopped kicking and drifted using my free hand to bring me more or less upright my eyes had been used to the moonglow for some time now and the flare pilot and then the white reflected light from the derricks had closed the irises to something like half their original diameter and i needed time to accommodate the trellis pattern of the rig was very faint now although i was closer and the sea was a dark wall around me silence then the longdrawn sound of my inhalation hollow and strange as if i could hear only the echo and not the sound itself silence again and then the bubbling as my breath rose from behind me and floated above my head at each interval between inhalation and exhalation the silence was total slight stress beginning because of this and because of the dim light the onset of disorientation normal but uncomfortable the organism was starting to ask where it was what it was doing here where it couldnt see things very well couldnt hear things to be ignored or better still contained keep still and keep quiet listen to what you can the sound of your own lifegiving breath look at what you can the faint pattern of the girders and above them the square configuration of the superstructure delineated by the night glow of the sky and the diaphanous cloud of debris drifting past as the current flowed from the south breathe see hear all is normal relax the nylon cord tugged slightly as the current moved the reserve tanks turning me gently round with one hand i spun myself slowly back to keep the girders in sight they were becoming clearer darker against the sands beyond except where the cloud floated moving nearer against my faceplate and lower its edge was blotting out part of the girders as if it were opaque and becoming larger one of the background girders ran straight upwards from it thin and perpendicular and i looked down to follow it then up again to watch the cloud itself its configuration had altered suddenly and protrusions appeared perfectly equidistant and as it bumped against me i put my free hand out to push it away but it wasnt easy because it was a cable above it not a girder in the background and these protrusions bumping against me in the current were detonation horns the shock was explosive because the nerves were being hit by imagination as well as fact and in an effort to keep me alive the imagination was picturing for me what would happen if i touched that thing again and for an instant i saw the blinding light and felt the tearing apart of life in the roaring waters and then the inrush of eternal dark christ sake stick to the facts and think try to think get back to where you were a second ago the bloody thing hasnt gone off and youre still alive so do something to stay that way it could have blown us right shuddup you snivelling little tick youll never see moira again if it get out of my head it didnt go off and were just the same as we were before but we have to think there wouldnt just be this one it drifted away a little on the current and then came back tethered by the thin steel cable i moved away slowly fanning the water with both hands retreating from it but not too far they wouldnt have put just this one here there wouldnt be any point i was in a minefield fanning with my hands keeping upright maintaining the organism in the vertical attitude it was used to so that it could operate without too much stress but more data was being rammed into the brain a whole mass of it to do with my hands information about my hands information and questions why were they both free my hands where had the i dont know turn spin slowly and mind the air tanks because if they hit that take care take normal care if it was a beach ball the tanks would never hit it its only because its full of tnt that you think they might relax turn slowly and look look everywhere it cant have drifted far instinct is devoted almost totally to keeping us alive and it functions at nerve speed and it doesnt even refer to higher authority it doesnt waste time asking the brain what to do it acts it shortcircuits the normal system that processes the data and presents it for decisionmaking and signals the motor nerves and contracts the muscles it doesnt demand cerebration because that would slow the action and it cant think for itself it thinks as much as a gun thinks after the triggers been pulled if it sees a spark coming it shuts your eyes and if it sees a snake it stops you dead in your tracks and if it sees a highexplosive mine it frees your hands and drives them flat against the water to push you away and that was why id lost my hold on the nylon cord and that was why the reserve tanks and the radio and the rations were drifting somewhere in the gloom where i couldnt see them where i had to see them but it was getting darker water pressure felt the same but i could be mistaken because in these conditions of dim light and silence and weightlessness the threshold of disorientation was low and if i couldnt maintain psychic stability the senses would have to start struggling to bring in the data and if i missed any data it could be fatal i wanted to check the depth gauge but the idea of moving my arm of moving anything at all was unnerving but it was the only way to find out if i was sinking imperceptibly to the sea bed and increasing darkness i kept my arm to my side bringing it up by the shortest path until my wrist was in front of the faceplate and i was peering at the gauge like a man going blind no information the luminous dial had lost its brightness and the light around me wasnt enough to pick out the shape of the needle i tilted my head by degrees moving slowly the sensory nerves of my skin beneath the rubber suit alerted for tactile signals above me it was less dark a greyness was diffusing the faint light from around the platform of the rig so i wasnt sinking and they hadnt doused their lights and there was nothing in the water to cloud my vision id been sweating that was all the shock had raised the blood heat and brought the sweat out and the faceplate had misted over and in normal conditions id have known what was happening but in these conditions it had taken a lot of finding out and the idea wasnt pleasant because if a diver doesnt know when his faceplates misted over hes pretty far gone christ sake relax take the bloody thing off and wipe it and put it back and do something about that stuff drifting around or do nothing mental blocks were getting in the way of rational thought because the organism was still frightened not about what would have happened if id hit that thing with one of the heavy metal air tanks instead of my chest but about what might happen if i went after the reserve tanks and came on them just as they reached a mine i took off the faceplate and put it back and blew out through the nose it wouldnt stay clear for long but i didnt want to surface yet and use saliva a decision had to be made and the whole of the mission would depend on it i was going to look for that equipment and try to find it before it struck a mine or i was going to get out all decisions are subject to chance and chance is incalculable you can only predict likelihood and i thought it was likely that the reserve tanks would hit a mine if they went on drifting with the current if they hit a mine there would be debris on the surface and the crew of the rig would see it and examine it and fit the clues together a buckled radio component caught in the remains of a waterproof bag an air pocket bringing it to the surface a carton of protein concentrate some biscuits still in their waxed paper theyd know how close we were getting and theyd double the guard on tewson or fly him out either way mandarin was blown but id be alive the island of hengkang chou was two miles away and i could get there underwater with the air i had left in the tanks the breakoff rendezvous for this access phase was twentyfour hours from the commencement of solo operations by the executive in the target zone hours today when id left swordfish location was hengkang chou island rotating quarter zones as per standard practice for this topographical situation the north shore if i could find caves or some other refuge east shore if there was nothing available in the north south shore if both were blank so forth life support was no problem in terms of food and water thirst would develop but that would be containable for the short period involved id be in good condition when ferris picked me up mission aborted executive withdrawn because itd be no good sending in the reserve thered be nothing for him to do george henry tewson would be somewhere in the threeandahalf million square miles of the chinese mainland reserve recalled and close the file on mandarin egerton wouldnt like it he works for the good of the cause they all have their different motivations the london controls lomans working for a knighthood and he doesnt give a damn for his ferrets look at what the bastard wanted me to do in tunisiablow myself up parkis is working for some grand and distant checkmate when the board is cleared of the pawns and in the meantime he moves us around and he doesnt care whether we live or die so long as we block the knights and the rooks while he plans his strategies but egerton works for queen and country and his morality is first world war with tattered banners and muted bugles and the greatest game of them all to win except for one thing he wont send you over the top without a chance as ferris had put it to me on board the august moon the egg doesnt care at all for sending people on suicide stunts the alternative to getting out was going in egerton wouldnt like that either but hed never know because theres always a phase in the mission when youre suddenly and critically in need of control direction on a major issue and cant get it or dont want to theres nothing london can do about it they can plan the whole operation from initial briefing and access down to the final support liaison thats designed to get the executive into the target zone and out again with a clear exit path and a whole skin and the merchandise theyre buying with what they pay him to do it but you cant always stick to the blueprint and unless youre lucky youre going to find yourself cut off in a red sector one fine day with the access blocked or the radio jammed or someone treading all over your face because you opened the wrong door and then youre going to want field direction or something from control and youre not going to get it they can bust a gut designing a setup thatll get you past all the pins without flashing a light but theres nearly always a time when youve got to go it alone we know that its why were in this thing most of us the ferrets have got their motivations too we dont go looking for trouble but if we get it we think we can deal with it and thats when we try very hard because if we fail were going to have to live with ourselves forever afterwards and thats tough because were vain so when we get close to the edge we dont go back we look over its just another way of getting rid of infantile aggression and if you dont like it you can do the other thing there wasnt any real problem if i let that stuff go on drifting itd either blow a mine or move free and wallow around in daylight tomorrow and attract attention and if either of those things happened itd finish the mission and that wasnt the object of what i was doing here i was here to complete mandarin according to plan it didnt look as if i had a chance in hell of coming out alive but that wasnt a reason for not going in at all it was gutthink immediately around me was an area of dim light and beyond it was a soft gathering wall of dark and somewhere on the other side that stuff was drifting in the current two steel cylinders each of them charged at a pressure of two thousand pounds a square inch and capable of smashing through the wall of a building and flying three streets away and going through the side of a bus and that was just if the valve broke they could do better than that if they went the wrong way through a minefield the one factor that had any value for me was that of time the longer that stuff went on drifting the less chance id have of finding it before it hit one of those bloody things and blew the sea apart so i thought id better start now chapter thirteen directive the water was greygreen growing lighter and darker as i rose and fell gliding through the greygreen world going my way in silence three minutes they drifted past me in the shifting light and shadow their steel spheres glowing as they caught a gleam of light from above their copper horns thrust outwards from them naked and quiet two minutes i threaded my way between the cables sinuous and slow and taking care nothing lived here and nothing moved except this black rubber creature as it passed through the cloudy avenues of spheres but a presence was here of a kind so different from my own that i felt its hostility the blind trapped presence of a thing unborn a thing that once free would hurl the sea apart i made my slow way through it one minute sometimes a bubble rose from the sea bed turning dull silver and then shimmering past my face vanishing above me one of them passed close to a mine not far from where i moved it touched and broke against the tip of a copper horn and for an instant sent me mad as the firestorm roared raging through my head then it was over the sound died away and the seas subsided and hollowed echoes of my breathing slowed again the potential packed inside these deadly fingers had grown too much on my mind and i wanted nothing to touch them not even a bubble zero breakoff point id been searching for half an hour and hadnt seen anything and this was the time when i must break off and let the stuff go on drifting beyond this limit id start using the air that was reserved for taking me as far as hengkang chou if i had to get out of the target zone and go to ground id covered most of the minefield and drawn blank in daylight i would have seen the loose gear long before this but id been working in near darkness and without a hope of using the lamp because the mines were cabled on outriggers below the surface well clear of the rigs substructure and if there were lookouts posted on deck theyd pick up the glow of the light twice id doubled back on my tracks without knowing it until id seen the faint image of a pontoon leg on the wrong side a hundred feet below and realized i must have turned too far where the mines made a right angle once id wasted time going down to fifty feet seeing a patch of shadow that had turned out to be a mass of drifting weed i turned obliquely and dived in a long curve coming up inside the minefield and heading for the great trellis of girders hearing the sound when i was almost halfway across the open space it was the sound of a ships bell cracked and muted its rhythm irregular in five minutes i had the direction worked out turning full circle to orientate aurally and then moving across the slow southerly current and through the network of girders to the far side reaching the minefield again i didnt have to search far once id got there the stuff was looming in front of my faceplate stationary except for the slight tug of the current the nylon cord had fouled one of the cables and was wrapped around it and the sound of the ships bell was being set up by the valve of one of the reserve tanks as it kept hitting against the mine i stood off watching it my hands fanning gently to keep me upright the waterproof bag containing the radio and the rations was creating resistance against the current part of it had caught around the cable leaving one of the tanks to swing against the mine it wasnt any good trying to make an estimate and work on its findings because there were too many unknown factors but it didnt look as though i had long because the shoulder of the cylinder was nudging one of the detonation horns and it was a strictly shutended situation so i kicked with the fins and moved in freeing the cord first and then working higher up keeping my head back and the faceplate clear of the horns as i pulled the reserve tank clear it wasnt easy because the mine was fixed to its cable with a turnbuckle and cotter pin and the pin kept catching against the valveguard normal thought process had ceded to a form of specialized attention the conscious field had narrowed to contain only the essentials i needed to work with the shape and size of the valveguard and the cotter pin and the horn of the mine the angles and direction in which the manipulation had to proceed the forces against it and the means of combating them but somewhere in my head there was panic trying to get loose like an area of pain the anaesthetic hasnt quite reached ignore this thing wasnt long out of the armament factory the steel had a satin sheen and the copper of the horn was catching the glow of the flare pilot burning above the rig the cotter pin was bright and a blob of grease still clung to the thread of the turnbuckle there were roman characters indented around the rim of the mine itself they werent clear in this light but it looked like hitachi japan the valveguard came free and i backed off bringing the gear with me the time was and i was alive and the mission was still running just after i went aboard the rig the stormwave height of the lower deck was fifty feet leaving a gap between the deck and the surface of the sea but in this area it was almost dark and the girders gave a network of cover i left all four tanks and the rest of the scuba gear lashed to a girder below surface and climbed one of the iron ladders i didnt expect to find lookouts on this first deck theyd be surveying the open sea beyond the limits of the minefield there was a radial series of catwalks and i took one of them as far as the central ladder that served the drilling complex going up again and reaching the top deck a single main lamp burned alongside the derrick flooding most of the deck a blizzard of bright moths blew around it and a lone bat circled gorging itself sometimes rising to the height of the flare pilot flame and circling again most of the deck was taken up with the drilling rig skid mounted and abutting on the control cabin the turbines took up the rest of the space and the helicopter pad was raised on a separate platform clear of the derrick and the two auxiliary pedestal cranes there were more radio facilities than id expected two masts cantilevered off the top deck and carrying microwave dishes and a third mast with a boostertype unit that looked very like a tropospheric scatter system conceivably for data transmission rigtoshore the one on my left hadnt moved for three or four minutes he was using binoculars on the sea through a ninetydegrees vector the other man was pacing his back to me because i was in the central area and he wasnt looking for anyone there they were both in some kind of paramilitary uniform but carried only sidearms the deck was three or four hundred feet across and i assumed there were other lookouts on the far side of the derrick and to the south of the engineroom installations it took me nearly an hour to locate the control console not because it was far from the central area but because i had to move by inches getting back into cover and staying there for minutes at a time while a lookout patrolled the area i was working i couldnt have moved around at all if the cover hadnt been exceptional the whole of this deck was broken up by cranes and winch gear and power houses and most of the enclaves were in deep shadow the dangerous areas were the catwalks and corridors and i kept out of them except when i had to evade one of the patrols the cover story ferris had worked out for me was better than nothing but it wouldnt stand up to professional interrogation it was an extreme resource to keep the opposition stalled while i tried for an emergency getout from the target zone if one of those patrols sighted me it could blow mandarin as effectively as a mine the control console was housed in a building like a concrete bunker and the only window was made of smoked plate glass with an integral mesh of extruded steel lamps burned inside and the control panels were visible through the glass but the place didnt seem to be manned at this hour the signs above the main door were in chinese characters followed by a number it was now an hour before dawn and i began getting out hanging back in deep cover and moving only when the risk was calculated the most interesting thing on the middle deck was the work site where they were building some kind of platform into the main structure of the drilling derrick the area was cluttered with welding gear and pneumatic rivet hammers and there werent any signs that the job had been abandoned i had to signal ferris and i couldnt do it from anywhere near the rig unless i had adequate noise background to cover my voice and if those riveters started up i could get some sort of message out through the interference if the set was any good by hours i was beginning to feel the shakes i had a lot of information for london and i wanted to give it to them as soon as i could because the future wasnt too certain but i couldnt do anything about it until i had some kind of noise background and all i could hear was the lowpitched sound of the diesel generators and that wasnt enough the human voice range would cut right across it there were two things wrong geometry chronometry they wouldnt leave a minefield to look after itself thered be a strict surveillance routine to make sure none of those things got loose or trapped flotsam and that meant theyd be sending someone down in daylight and hed use one of the four iron ladders that ran from the lower deck to the sea bed down the substructure legs they provided access to the pontoons and anchorage for repair and maintenance and the trouble was that i couldnt hope to find any effective concealment here between the lower deck and the surface of the sea the geometry was wrong i was wedged in the angle formed by three girders and it was the best cover i could find anywhere in the stormwave gap between the rig and the water there were twenty other places like this but they were exactly like this and therefore no better if the work crew on the middle deck had started riveting at first light i could have sent my signal to field direction and got out id been thinking of hengkang chou island in terms of a refuge in emergency but now id surveyed the rig i knew id have to go out there and hole up till tonight if london wanted me to extend operations but i couldnt leave here before i sent my signal because the waterproof bag was showing some wear and tear and i didnt think i could get the hammerlund as far as the island in working condition one drop of sea water in the wrong part of the circuit could block off the information i had for london and there might not be another chance so i had to stay here and hope the riveters would start work before anyone came down here to look at the minefield but they hadnt started work yet and that was why i was getting the shakes the chronometry was wrong at i was sweating hard in the rubber suit with the sun eight or nine diameters above the horizon and sending out heat there had to be a change of plan because i was a sitting duck and the best thing to do was leave the radio here and go down and put on the scuba and wait with my head above water ready to submerge as soon as anyone came down from the deck they wouldnt see me and wouldnt see the radio unless they were looking for it and i could stand off below water and get back here when i could one of the things i didnt like about it was that id use up a lot of air but none of the arguments against this plan made any sense because if didnt put it into action i risked being seen and taken on board for interrogation and the longer i waited the higher the risk would become i tilted the hammerlund along the inside line of rivet heads against the girder and swung down and went sideways along a horizontal section till i reached a pontoon leg three feet above the surface and then climbed all the way back because the noise had started frequency mhz executive in the field to base wing to swordfish a hell of a bloody din from the deck above me louder than id expected the rivethammer trapping the sound and sending vibrations throughout the whole of the rig i could feel it against my thighs and shoulder as i slid one leg along a girder and lay almost prone with my head against the set hed told me he was going to stay on board swordfish until i could send him a situation report ackroyd had a much bigger radio than anything ferris could carry around and i might flash the sub to come and pull me out in a hurry and hed want to be there i kept on talking giving them blocks of three with my head against the set and my nerves getting tight because it was going to be a fifteenminute exchange of signals and i hadnt even raised an acknowledgement yet and as soon as anyone came down one of those ladder the whole mission was blown treble two thrice all right i was in the middle of seven thousand tons of steel girders waving a sixfoot aerial around and trying to hit the ether with it while half a dozen diesel generators were pushing out enough electrostatic squelch to jam any transceiver within ten miles of here the riveter stopped and i hit the volume control in case swordfish came through too strongly the squirt of the welders kept up a low background so i thought id try it and spoke right against the mike treble two three blocks why the hell didnt those bastards swordfish very faint i acknowledged and turned up the volume a few degrees and waited they were going to get ferris he wouldnt be far away hed give me fives that was mandarin sweat stinging my eyes nobody on the ladders oh for christ sake come on were mandarin i went straight into the spiel wed been controlbriefed to exchange signals totally in cypher when we were using the swordfish radio without any speechcode thrown in to expedite the transmission the admiralty was a bit edgy about having spooks on board one of her majestys ships and theyd obviously told london that if we wanted to use the sparks wed have to do it in strict hush that was fair enough they werent used to having a couple of tornarsed mudlarks playing about with their sub and the kind of stuff wed be sending was pretty strong compared with the daytoday signals normally going outhave polished anchor please send buns for captains birthday so forth ferris was asking how i was and i told him to shut up and listen because i wanted to give him the whole picture before anyone came down here and stopped me extending and reversing leaving some of the transfers the right way round whenever they could stand in as a contraction this isnt an oil rig its a missile base thinking up nonstandard contractions when i thought ferris would get it first go without risking delay while he queried it no wellhead and false flare stack and crude reservoirs image from air would be perfect basic armament for defence six eightinch naval guns camouflaged as lean gas coolers main structure under modification electronic and telemetric installations not yet completed assume tewson involved as technician or supervisor him and his sliderule nora had said ferris shot me a couple of queries about crew strength and the type of missile and i told him i thought there was only a skeleton unit on board while the boffins sorted out the stuff for the console i couldnt tell him anything about the actual missile except that i hadnt seen any exhaust ducts or heat shields there might be then the riveter started banging again and i nearly fell off the bloody girder and ferris began complaining about the interference the generators had been bad enough but this din was affecting the air acoustics as well as the signal and i was getting fed up it threw me and then i got it id read us print polaris for us sprint polaris both missiles had a compressed gas launcher giving them a superfast initial ascent with virtually no heat involved and getting them out of sight almost immediately and this could be the same type which would explain why i couldnt see any exhaust ducts or shields he was asking me more about the camouflage but when i started off he cut in at the first interval and said he couldnt hear me through the jam so i told him to stand by and we sweated it out for twelve minutes till the riveter stopped and by that time i was right on the edge of my nerves because the logical time for a daily inspection of the minefield below me was first thing in the morning i turned down the volume for receive while ferris put specific questions and then raised it for transmission and spoke close to the mike with the welders for background cover configuration on both planes perfectly consistent with oil rig telemetry requirements identical in many respects giving similar installation images while i was filling in the picture it occurred to me that it made a certain amount of sense to build a missile base right on the doorstep of a uk possession and call it an oil rig the chinese republic had silos all over the mainland for reactiontakeoff missiles but they were being photographed regularly by the american sr from eighty thousand feet and by the soviet turo from somewhere just under that altitude it wasnt possible to hide things any more aerial surveillance by highaltitude plane and satellite units had been jacked up to the point where you couldnt plant a row of beans without getting a call the next morning from the cia or the kgb to say that according to their photographs youd put them in upside down there were immense problems involved in building a conventionaltakeoff missile base on the continental shelf in terms of getting the exhaust gas away but if you first thought of an oil rig as a disguise and then considered the similarities between an oil rig and a submarine and used compressed gas to pop the missile up the tube as they did with the sprint and the polaris then youd build one of these things question how far was george henry tewson from the design concept of polaris he was with the ministry of defence shed said grandly high on bubbly then shed remembered they told her not to say things like that actually his work wasnt important to tell you the truth poor little bitch out of her depth he was on mission factors now how long did i think i could stay on board the rig with any security what was my lifesupport status in terms of rations air essential rigtoisland gear how long would the radio stand up in these conditions necessary to leave rig immediately exchange concluded fair chance of returning at nightfall but bloody riveter began banging away and i called a into the mike for standby and cut it dead to save the batteries and started to sweat it out again watching the iron ladders and trying to think what i could do if ferris asked me to keep station while he got into signals with london thatd take up to an hour in cypher and i couldnt wait that long i couldnt wait another two seconds with any security and he knew that because id told him banging away the whole of the superstructure vibrating the rivets going into my head if they just found me clinging to the girder looking dead beat the cover story might hold up long enough for me to try some kind of a getout but if they found me with a radio it wouldnt hold up at all there wasnt anything i could do about that the instant i saw them on the ladder i could knock the hammerlund into the sea behind the pontoon leg but theyd hear the splash and investigate and find the rest of the stuff no go there had to be a limit and in five minutes id open up the set and keep sending fifteens situation contained but leaving station london was in a panic or they wouldnt have pushed me into this kind of position but if i could get out to hengkang chou and delay the action for eight or nine hours till nightfall and take it up again from there theyd still have a live executive in the field and total security in the target zone if i gave it more than another five minutes on board this rig theyd have a dead duck the riveter stopped and i hit the set with twos he came in straight away with another question but i didnt answer it i told him the situation was too insecure and i had to leave station he asked for a repeat and that brought the sweat out again we were throwing each other contractions for this exchange the phrasing was right out of the book because the executive was in a red sector and had to get out and the director was having to decide whether to let him go or punch in a priority signal when he had him on the air contractions take very little time indeed but i didnt have any to spare because my instinct was yelling at me to get the hell out of this deathtrap send him fifteens and shut down the set and drop into the sea and pull out priority message blast his eyes i waited he wasnt going to ask me for time while he talked to london he didnt have to hed already done that basic contractions executive will withdraw objective from target zone the objective was normally a file or a document or a chunk of strictly hush electronics but this time it was a man and what they were asking me to do was bring tewson off the rig chapter fourteen flotsam something moved away from me in the sand as my fins touched the sea bed and a flash of silver showed against the pontoon as a group of pomfret took refuge the depth on the gauge was feet and i was aware of the pressure here at atmospheres movement felt heavy and the silence brooded the light was diffused scattering down from the surface and leaving no shadows where the pontoon legs stood braced on the sand visibility was twenty or thirty feet the girders were sharply defined in the immediate vicinity but grew hazy on the other side of the pontoon finally vanishing into the insubstantial wall where sight was halted id changed air tanks on the surface buckling the full ones into the backpack as a routine safety measure and bringing the old ones down with me to leave here with the radio and some of the rations there might not be fresh water on hengkang chou and i was taking one quart along with me the hammerlund would have to be left here and id been worrying about that but there wasnt any choice if i took it to the island id be able to stay in signals with ferris during the next nine hours and with minimum background interference but the waterproof bag was showing signs of giving out and the twomile trip wouldnt improve it the radio was a component in the lifesupport chain of this operation and id have to leave it lashed to the rig with the other gear for picking up tonight i wasnt thinking about the london directive ferris had thrown me because there wasnt any point i would have said no straight away and shut the set down on that but egerton always likes you to give it a bit of thought before you tell him hes run the mission into the ground it wasnt that he didnt realize what he was asking me to do when the executives in the target zone the director in the field is normally in rapid and constant signals with control the moment id left swordfish theyd lit up the red bulb over the mission board for mandarin in london and it wouldnt go out till id left the target zone or blown the operation or got snatched or neutralized by the opposition ferris had had all the time he needed to tell egerton precisely what the situation was and egerton therefore knew bloody well that i didnt stand a hope in hell of bringing tewson off this rig id set up a getout action when id gone aboard but london didnt know that and in any case it was in the extreme resource category and i put my chances at ten to one against getting away with it this was nothing but routine procedure when you go into the target zone you leave every possible door wide open behind you and if theres anything you can use for a lastminute hitandrun getout you give it a go because in a lot of cases the alternatives a tenyear stretch in a brainwash facility or a sixfoot hole where no one can see them digging id made no provision for pulling a man out with me and there wouldnt have been anything i could have done about it even if london had briefed me on it before wed gone into the access phase the rig was manned and guarded and tewson was under the protection of the opposition and it was no go all along the line ferris knew that hed been instructed to fieldbrief me with the signal and hed done that id received the directive and acknowledged it and all i could do now was hole up on hengkang till tonight and come back and go over the rig again to see if i could fill in a few of the gaps try finding out what type of missile they were going to plug into this thing take a closer peek at the unit that looked like a tropospheric scatter system do a softshoe snatch on one of the guards and get him into cover and see if he could understand cantonese but that would be all i could do before i had to pull out and when i pulled out i couldnt bring tewson with me they bloody well ought to know that even at this depth i could feel the vibration of the riveter in the pontoon leg and when i lashed the used air tanks to the girder they began ringing to the percussion at four atmospheres the residue of air was being compressed by seventyfive per cent and the vibration was hitting them like a drum so i took them off and looped some of the cord round the girder to damp out the metaltometal contact before i lashed everything tight and damn nearly knocked into him when i turned round because he was right behind me and reaching for his knife high cheekbones and light yellow eyes behind the mask nothing on him except the divers knife no speargun or anything his move for the knife surprised me because you cant use any kind of blade under water with enough speed to do any damage youve got to wait till you can get in close and then start ramming with it he was shorter than i was and that meant he couldnt get in close unless i let him and i wasnt going to do that and he ought to know conceivably it was just a defensive reaction when id turned round he was offering the knife correctly hilt down and blade up at fortyfive degrees he knew how to use the thing and unless i backed off it wouldnt be any good reaching for my own knife because hed be ripping into me before i could get anywhere near it we looked at each other through our faceplates for two or three seconds before we made a move everything was in the eyes not communication but reaction his eyes were alert and hostile the lids narrowed and the pupils enlarged he watched me with total attention in my own eyes hed seen shock and now saw decision man is one of the territorial animals and contact between two members of their species gives rise to an immediate issue when one or the other is on his own ground for both of them but particularly for the intruder there is the primitive decision to be made to fight or run but he hadnt been waiting to see what i would do the situation was more sophisticated than it would have been for two of the lower animals this diver had seen me lashing something to the base of the rig and it could be explosive and whatever it was he wanted to find out as soon as he could and take it aloft for close examination he also wanted to know what i was doing here and who i was and where id come from and he was going to subdue me if he could and similarly take me to the surface and hand me over for interrogation thered been a chance that i might have capitulated in the instant of encounter but the time was past now and he saw that the very fact of my standing here face to face with him was an expression of hostility and he was going to make the first move by infinite degrees he was bringing his body lower and turning the trunk with the right shoulder coming towards me and the elbow at right angles the blade of the knife cocked and steady dull silver in the strange underwater light combat at eighteen fathoms has its own rules and some of them run counter to the norm you dont draw back to bring momentum into a blow because the pressure of the element is going to kill off momentum anyway you have to streamline the strike and he did that and the blade hit the glass of my faceplate and the point stayed there scraping on the surface as i held his wrist and we looked at each other locked and motionless hed struck directly forward and into the aim and id known hed have to do that because it was the only way and id worked fast and my forearm had driven straight upwards to connect my hand to his wrist but the water had built up resistance against the bicep area because it was travelling at right angles and it had slowed the blow but not critically hed struck for the throat or my breathing tube and hit the faceplate and his wrist was locked in my fingers and i began squeezing the bone was thin and i began levering working for a fracture watching the pain start in his eyes a foot blow was out of the question because of the drag of the fins so i knew hed have to use his left hand and i was ready but he was wickedly fast clawing for my breathing tube again and again as i jerked my head back and kicked upwards from the sea bed and dragged him with me keeping the pressure on his wrist but we were clear of the sand now and fighting in the manner of fish and he used the element for his own defense letting my grip on his wrist move his whole body the kinetic energy travelling through the arm to the shoulder and beyond breathing became difficult as the muscles demanded oxygen the lungs began creating a vacuum setting up pressure lag at the regulator he had stopped his lefthand action because i was holding the air tube out of his reach my back arched and my head angled but this was defensive because my right hand was immobilized and time was already running out in scuba diving exertion of any kind is at a heavy premium and we were making demands on oxygen that werent going to be met i estimated we had two more minutes before exhaustion set in the current was taking us slowly away from the substructure of the rig and we were drifting higher with the sandbars below us losing definition the only purchase either of us had was against the others body and we were using our legs now not for striking but for leverage my right foot working for pressure against his neck as one of his legs was hooked suddenly around mine as he went for a knee lock and got it and began putting stress into the movement with our ankles braced together bone on bone our black rubber bodies drifted entangled intimately in a deathly embrace a slow and freakish seacreature afloat on the current the pressures and tensions of its own destruction working within it the quadruple lung system starving for air the twin heads close together in mortal enmity each willing death on the other this wasnt how it was meant to be this slow surrender to the sea itself the drifting away to death of a fourarmed creature the light turning as the greygreen world revolved the mind spinning in silence in eternal peace think a whirlpool of colours streaming swirling a singing of yellow in my eyes as the deep came darkening think nitrogen narcosis do something the consciousness ebbing as the rapture of the deep drew over me the pain sharp in my knee and the brain waking christ sake do something finish him off and get up there his hand hooking again and the rush of salt water against my face as the mask was wrenched away fighting him halfblinded now and with pressure against the nose and the shape of his other hand indistinct as his wrist came free and he hooked again and dragged my air tube away taking my last hope of life not good enough and had to try but salt water now in my eyes and in my mouth and no more air and he kicked with his fins to get clear while i drowned but dont let him hell leave you here to die and my hand moved frenzied part of the mind driving it part of the mind striving to clear a space for conscious thought like a bubble in black water a bubble of light my fingers closing and snatching at his head and dragging the mask off and going for his air tube and finding it and tearing it away as he squirmed clear of the knee lock and began fighting for his life against the sea then at some time our faces passed close to each other and his looked as dead as mine must look the eyes dulled by the water and the mouth flattened as he held on to the last breath of his life as i was doing then we drifted apart in the reddening light as the blood from the wound in my hand began clouding against my eyes felt behind me for the air tube but it was out of my reach hed pulled the mouthpiece over my head and the tube was hanging somewhere behind my shoulderblades the longing began in my chest the longing to drag air into the lungs and breathe again the sea darkened as he loomed suddenly against my face his shoulder hitting and turning me as his arm hooked again and again behind him his hand trying to find the air tube as it drifted past my eyes i cut it away with my knife and kicked clear of him the effort had taken the last of my strength and my chest was hammering with the need for air and i knew that soon my throat must open and suck the water in and in the deep red singing i saw moira as i knew one day i would her long eyes and the flow of her copper hair turning her head in the way she did to watch me with her smile as my mind became lulled in the softcoming waves of nothing nihil annihilation while somewhere as if in a different place the organism continued with its desperate travail my hand reaching overhead and the fingers searching the breath held in the hollows of the sea and the mind lingering alive the nerves subservient to the primitive nub of matter at the top of the spine the hand suddenly frenzied as the fingers touched the concertina rubber of the tube and grasped it pulling it over my head and trying to force the mouthpiece against my teeth think as they closed on it on the life it could give but think as the forebrain was roused from its narcosis face the surface and my legs kicked and i turned on my back remembering my hand lifting taking the mouthpiece higher than the regulator with the opening downwards bring it down my face reaching upwards and my mouth hungry for the bubbling air and biting on it exhale the water turning me swallow my body drifting now breathe the sigh of the cylinders echoing in the deep vaults of the sea now breathe the lungs greedy and pulling at the valve and sweetly filling breathe i saw him once more he was slowly windmilling in the bloodred cloud his arms open and his legs apart and his movement graceful as the current turned him his eyes quiet as he danced alone his mask was still hanging at his neck its strap holding it and i pulled it over his head and put it on squeezing the water out by degrees as i breathed into it then i kicked with my fins and my hands reached upwards following the bubbles and slowly climbing their chain dont hurry let the bubbles go theres no hurry remember what you know never climb faster than they do let them go the light grew stronger above me its molten silver spreading in a pool as i neared the surface following the bubbles following globules of darkness began appearing and i watched them amused think their effect mesmeric their dark spheres floating psychedelically against my eyes remember their thin strings stretching above them remember the mines the faint trellis of girders was on my left and i turned and moved in that direction my heart thudding because the organism had been perturbed basic forebrain cerebration was starting up again as the effect of the nitrogen narcosis began wearing off at the crude decisionmaking level i was able to plan what i was going to do for the next few minutes consideration of later problems was beyond me for the moment it was enough to be alive when i reached the surface below the deck of the rig i removed the mouthpiece and turned off the air and hooked both arms across a horizontal girder and hung there filling my lungs slowly and deeply again and again sending oxygen through the system and driving the residue of carbon dioxide out of the body tissues hanging as limp as i could and thinking of nothing closing my eyes the water lapped at the girders a slow swell moving the surface without disturbing it i heard a sea bird call as it flew between the islands another answered far away then the riveter started up again and the shock went through me and i opened my eyes thinking id slept maybe i had it was time to go i didnt find it easy to put the mask on and the mouthpiece between my teeth because thered been death down there and i didnt want to go there again but i couldnt stay here by daylight there was no certain cover for me above the waterline orientate the island was to the north and i could see it clearly a series of humped green hills and a fall of granite rock where i knew there were caves the sea between here and hengkang chou was glass smooth under the climbing sun except where the flotsam made a patch of black its edges shining they could see it too because i heard cries and in a moment the riveter stopped and their voices were clearer they were calling in mandarin but i understood well enough it was one cry repeated man overboard and interspersed with short sharp words of enquiry and response where there the hiss of the welding plant died away now and the only background was the murmur of the diesel generators the mens voices were raised sharply against it and i heard the first order being shouted feet began ringing on the iron decks i dived sound burst suddenly against my eardrums the power launch was tied up on the far side of the rig below badweather derricks and its engines started up as i began a long curving path that took me through the girders on the north side of the substructure with the minefield ten or fifteen feet above my head i turned slowly on my back and saw their dark blobs against the flare of the surface the body of the diver floated above them and the oblong shape of the launch went curving across its draught too shallow for the keel to foul the outrigger framework that held the mines suspended its engines were loud now filling the sea with their sound with fifty feet on the depth gauge i was invisible from the surface and this was as deep as i wanted to go because the pressure was already tangible and it was urgent that i stayed free of narcosis there was also a lingering sense of fear as moved again in the deeps watching the enemy above me through a dead mans mask ignore i kicked with the fins setting a steady rhythm still swimming with my face to the surface in the hope of navigating the compass was useless at this distance from the rig and i couldnt go up and check my bearings all i could do was to keep the pool of sunlight in my wake and on my left but it was amorphous and diffuse its glare dazzling me i shut my eyes against it the boats engines were idling now as they took the body aboard and examined it desultory thought process mandarin was blown the cover story ferris had given me had been thin at best but now it wouldnt stand a chance because they knew by now that the diver hadnt just got into difficulties down there his mask was missing and his air tube had been severed with a knife the three secret service men whod escorted tewson to and from the golden sands hotel were almost certainly on board the rig and thered be a naval defence cadre with frogmen responsible for underwater maintenance and security and if they were good at their job theyd inspect the substructure down to the sea bed and find my gear and the radio i didnt see any point in going back to the rig when night came just to get picked off by rapid fire or caught alive and grilled and taken to pekin and grilled again and thrown on the heap i could hear the launch again taking him back to the rig the thing that narked me was that i couldnt tell ferris wed blown the operation and he couldnt tell london to switch that red light off and shut down the station on mandarin ferris would go on brooding over the chart and haunting the radio room in swordfish and egerton would go on ordering trays of tea for his mission staff in operations and punching out requests for a situation report and all theyd get was silence well they shouldnt bloody well ask me to do the impossible all right id done it before but there were limits and this time theyd blown the fuse some stupid pratt in the ministry of defence had seen the news about tewsons shark thing and got the wind up and hit the button and told the bureau to go and verify and set up an operation to get him out of hong kong if he was still alive that was all right till we told them he was under an armed guard on chinese territory in the middle of the sea that was when control should have told them to go home and shut up about it and maybe that was what egerton had in fact done but they wouldnt listen well theyd listen now all right your bright little boffins gone and run away from home and hes not coming back so youd better change the combinations on the files and take that launcher off the secret list and stop his pension because theres nothing more we can do for you the sun was in my eyes it was all i had to steer by but it wasnt very precise it was just a big dazzling area that changed shape sometimes when the swell ran heavy and created surface undulation and if i went off course id waste time and air and energy and i didnt want to waste any of those things because they were the means of life but the only hope of taking a straight line to the island was by surfacing and correcting my bearings and i was still only half a mile from the rig and the lookouts were alerted sun in my eyes i closed them no go i had to watch the surface all the time to keep the flare of light in my tracks and on my left and i had to check the gauge every thirty seconds to keep at a constant depth dazzle the sound of the engines was faint now but i could hear they were idling they hadnt been shut off the body was being put aboard the rig another sound was coming in fainter still but regular and i couldnt place it i didnt think it was the riveter that would make a sharper vibration through the water and they wouldnt have started work again so soon the sun was going down its brightness flowing away to my left and leaving me in twilight a kind of peace was coming into me a stillness and my eyes were closing of their own accord drawing darkness across the last of the day while watch it the twilight deepening to night where nothing christ sake watch it will you been rolling over id been rolling slowly over hypnosis induced by the dazzle orientate but it was difficult because there wasnt anything for the eye to fix on except that shifting pool of light and if i didnt stay locked on to it i could swim in a circle in these weightless conditions with my only navigational reference tending to induce hypnosis there was no way of making the island unless i surfaced and took bearings and i couldnt do that because i knew what the sound was the new one they were putting the chopper aloft i stopped kicking and hung there with the surface fifty feet above me and the sea bed fiftysix feet below the rotor was producing a light fluttering sound most of it screened by the surface and the other noise was louder transmitted directly to my ears from the screws of the launch it was rising in pitch and increasing in volume the thing was heading in this direction the body had been found some distance to the north of the rig and i suppose it was the logical direction for anyone to take if they wanted to start a hunt for his assailant they knew there hadnt been any kind of a boat near the rig and they knew his air tube had been cut clean through by a blade and it had happened underwater so they didnt have to make any guesses they were looking for a frogman id shut my eyes while i was motionless and now it was dark again and i kicked with the fins to correct my attitude id been drifting headdown without knowing it i had approximately sixty seconds before the helicopter picked out the faint blob against the sandbars and signalled the launch where to find me and i didnt like either of the two things i could do but i was going to have to do one of them i could start swimming nearer the surface and wait till the chopper sighted me and then i could put out a cloud with the shark repellent and dive and leave it for them as a decoy while i tried to get clear or i could go straight down to a hundred feet where they couldnt see me and swim faceup with the sun as a bearing and try to hit the island before narcosis reduced me to a drifting piece of flotsam and the air in the tanks ran out the launch was throttling down as near as i could judge it was at a horizontal distance of a hundred yards i could see its faint smudge moving slowly across the surface against the dazzling light cutting a vee from the fluid gold and spreading it towards me assume starting square search a shadow passed suddenly over me as the helicopter swung in from the southeast lowering across the sea both the launch and the chopper would be armed and if i tried the decoy thing they might decide to open fire instead of bringing in divers to pick me up and hand me over for grilling so i jackknifed and put my arms to my sides and felt the pressure mounting as i plunged to the dark sands below chapter fifteen trap i couldnt breathe his hands were at my throat and he pressed with his thumbs and i couldnt stop him his eyes were slits and below the mask his teeth were bared with the effort as he went on pressing with his thumbs behind his yellow face the mountain reared i tried to move but his weight was on me and the water lapped at my head its waves coming and going without any sound the mountain was silent gigantic directly above me and i began running but i couldnt breathe he was blocking my throat haze began covering the mountain and i pulled off the mask and the mountain was instantly clear something was in my mouth and i pulled it away and my lungs bellowed heaving inside my ribs there was something under my feet and i pushed upwards and got my head higher out of the water and the mountain sloped away until it was a low hill covered in green i pushed again with my feet and climbed higher getting a grip on the rocks with my hands the left one painful and oozing blood then i stopped moving and stood waistdeep in the water wanting to do nothing but breathe the sweet air in id always believed that thirst was the worst but it isnt the tanks had run out of air but i didnt need it because my head was out of the water id been dying for the want of air when there was the whole sky full of it hed gone id been hallucinating this was hengkang chou island i couldnt have recovered full consciousness or i would have reacted faster situation data was coming in heavily and was so significant that i dealt with it first and the imaginative process was partially inhibited id lost consciousness somewhere near the sea bed and drifted on the southerly current and exhausted the air supply in tidal breathing but i was still alive and had a refuge where i could hole up in safety and this situation was so satisfactory that i didnt look for problems time check id been drifting in the unconscious state for something like two hours and the current had kept me close to the sea bed or the helicopter would have sighted me the rubber suit was ripped in a lot of places and my knees and shoulders felt bruised ferris had told me the south shore of the island was steep granite dropping away to sixteen fathoms within twenty yards of the waterline so the onshore current had dragged me up the slope of rock to the surface rotor there had to be more data before i saw the danger i was in and it came aurally from across the sea and i went down slowly and was careful not to make a splash because if this was the south shore of the island it was in sight of the rig and at a distance of two miles a pair of mediumpower field glasses could pick up an object the size of a man bloody well wake up and try to survive i took off the faceplate to avoid reflection and sank into the water with only my head clear tugging at the quickrelease buckles of the backpack and letting the air tanks go pushing them down the rockface with my hands and then my feet to start them sliding to the bottom then i made a fivesecond survey across the seas surface three helicopters airborne one of them this side of the rig and the other two well beyond it five boats visible three of them cabin class two of them smaller craft i couldnt see from this distance whether they were navy police or coastguard but they were flying the yellowstarred flag of the chinese republic in the stern they would almost certainly have divers down the nearest cave mouthwas this side of the southernmost point and i submerged with the mask on surfacing every so often to breathe and keeping my head turned inshore reaching the cave and crawling on to the fissured floor and flopping down on my stomach drawing deep breaths the mask still on until i remembered it and pulled it away state of semiexhaustion and it worried me because it hadnt been a long swim and the fins had cut down the work possible blood loss i remembered the wound had come open while id been engaged with the diver possible residual effects of nitrogen narcosis id been unconscious for two hours and there would still be a lingering retention of co in the tissues probably combination of both factors and therefore normal but i didnt like it because i had to think and all i could see was a flutter of light in front of my eyes and all i could hear was the chopchopchop of that bloody rotor amplified in the cave an irregular draught above my head and something pattering on my back the sense of creatures somewhere near me take some interest then because everything is interesting if you want to live all right bats napping all over the place above my head id frightened them i let my eyes shut again be too dangerous to go inland and try to reach the far side of the island because the chopper was too close and there wouldnt be much cover in these soft green hills there werent any trees only bushes and short scrub clinging to the rock where it could id reached land but the only cover was in the sea and id no air left in the tanks and they were gone now anyway so much junk all id had to keep me alive not long ago think of nothing relax got to think want to live the breakoff rdv for this phase was twelve hours from now and i was in place in the third rotating sector hengkang chou the rations id been preparing to bring with me were still on the sand below the rig where id let them fall when the diver had found me there i could last without food but i had a thirst beginning because id lost fluids in sweat and i wouldnt be able to graze on the scrub till nightfall ignore thirst the lights kept flashing and i shut my eyes again and lay prone letting the whole thing go for a minute leaving the organism to look after itself by automatic data analysis squeaking sounds and air movement in close proximity recognizable and acceptable volume of distant sounds constant psychedelic display behind closed eyes attributable to nerve trauma this data to be ignored the water lapped relax now i crawled higher and sat with my back propped on the rock and watched the bats dipping and swerving across the cave mouth their wings turning pink as the sunlight shone through their thin membranes turning black as they wheeled inside the opening again think one of them coming very close unaware of me until its radar picked me up small ears and flat piglike face vanishing as it weaved aside think of what must be done others hanging from the roof of the cave for some reason undisturbed asleep and enfolded in their leathery wings face what you know theyre making a lot of effort out there three choppers and five boats and probably more on their way they want to find the man who killed their diver and they want to find him badly because he got near their missile base and they want to know who he is theyve got a lot of questions for him check logic satisfactory it would be nice to use this halfdoped forebrain for cerebration above the neanderthal level but for the moment it was the best i could do there wasnt anything difficult to work out there was a manhunt mounted for me and i must elude it but the thing i had to face was that they wouldnt deploy their forces on that scale without extending the search area and when they couldnt find my body dead or alive in the sea theyd start searching the sanmen island group and the nearest one was this one so they werent going to have to look far theyd start with the caves along the south shore and that was where i was now so id better get out but if i got out theyd see me nervelight receding now left hand becoming numb because i was holding ft above me against the rock face to stop the bleeding so it didnt look as if i could do anything and what worried me was that red lamp over the board for mandarin where they were sitting on their hands looking at the clock and the situation crossplot and not very carefully looking at each other when they got up and walked around and swallowed some more cold tea with the scum on and said no sir every time egerton came in no sir theres nothing new at that end of the mission there was a building full of people with talent enough to man an international chess tournament and signals facilities in excess of the requirements of an operational air force base and a codes staff capable of hitting our agentsinplace in moscow or pekin with a telephone directory got up as hymns ancient and modern and a permanent hotline direct to the minister of defence and at this end of the mission there was a halfdoped ferret sitting in a cave and getting slowly covered in batshit at a rough guess id say mandarin was blown all i was interested in now was getting out alive and i didnt think i could do it swordfish would arrive in these waters at tomorrow and the call of the sea swallow would be heard and go unanswered and the sub would pull out and all ferris could do then was consider sending in the reserve but i didnt think thered be one available because the bureau didnt have anyone stupid enough to take on a shutended penetration job with a seaborne access problem except possibly for omalley and for one thing he was in athens and for another thing hed get pissed the night before and go in with a sawnoff motor torpedoboat and theyd see him coming before hed started the engine and control knew that hed told ferris to hang a reserve in front of my nose just to make me go into this thing out of sheer stinking pride well this time it hadnt worked if they wanted george henry tewson off that rig theyd have to use a skyhook aural data becoming significant and demanding analysis increase in the volume of sound and the only sound of any consequence was that of the helicopter i dropped into the water and floated towards the cave mouth and saw the thing was perceptibly closer two of the boats were also moving in one of them heading directly this way with its bow wave appropriate to half speed they werent hurrying because they hadnt seen anything and if there was anyone on this group of islands they could head him off and pin him down without any trouble it would finally depend on manpower and they had unlimited resources i thought the best thing to do was to start getting some information on the cave system on hengkang chou and with that bloody boat heading this way i thought i had less than a couple of minutes to get clear of here this cave didnt offer anything it was a culdesac preliminary hyperventilation is dangerous if its pushed too far and i spent only thirty seconds on it emphasizing the exhalation and taking nine or ten pints into the lungs before i slid below the surface and followed the undersea cliff i couldnt see them this cave was no better than the other one it had a shut end i couldnt see them but i could hear them they were checking the other cave two men in a dinghy when theyd checked that one theyd come and check this one i waited there wasnt anything else i could do the launch was standing off a short distance the men on board couldnt see into the cave they were base and support for the men in the dinghy there were now two helicopters over the island i could see one of them banking sharply across the southernmost headland and sloping down from the sky chopchopchopchop coming closer i sank under the surface and lay prone in the shallows of the cave because even when you know youve finally lost a wheel you go on trying till the very last second its in the nature of the beast its always someone else always never you someone like klj berlin a longrange rifle shot or thornton hit a mountain headon with a petrov x or north with his brains all over the bathroom you never think its going one fine day to be you the bloody thing slammed past the cave mouth chopchopchop the echo slamming back i waited five seconds and pushed my face into the air and started breathing again the bats were going frantic swarming into the sunshine and back perfectly understandable imagine what they must have thought picking up that bloody great superbat on their little radars it would have been a piece of cake to hyperventilate and go down to fifty feet and come up on the far side of the dinghy and go into the cave after theyd searched it but they had divers down in the area and i could see their marker buoys on each side of the launch they were being very thorough i suppose ferris was hanging around one of the islands in hong kong waters lamma or the soko group and from that distance swordfish would probably notice the aerial activity conceivably hed put a signal out a lot of choppers up looks like a search could be were blown you never think its going to be you theyre looking particularly shutfaced when you go through clearance and you know it must be mario because its the only one running or you find you cant reach parkis and you know his operation must have come unstuck because he told you to be here and he doesnt miss an appointment unless the skys caved in and this time its poor old talbot or you see two of the escapecrew couriers going into debriefing as white as a sheet and thats either fitzroy or crocker and you dont ask anyone which this time theyll know it was you the sun was striking into the cave mouth sending light dappling the rocks now that the helicopter had reached the end of its loop a mile away it was quiet in this stretch of water and i could hear voices from the power launch when i sighted along the surface i saw three of the crew standing in the stern and watching the cave where the dinghy was the men in the dinghy were armed and carried something heavy and chromed id just seen the shape of it and the flash of the sun when theyd gone in there and it had looked like a portable searchlight taken from the launch there werent any ledges in this cave in this one where i was trapped there wasnt a hollow where i could have crouched or a loose rock i could have used as cover there was nothing and nothing i could do when they came the divers werent just making a random search of the rockface below water they were keeping precise station on watch for anyone swimming out of a cave when the search party went in all i could do was wait whats wrong with egerton today who egerton oh his mission got blown christ who was he running dunno quiller i think you never think it could be you and then one day you find out youre bloody well wrong and when i heard the splash of their oars i pushed with my feet and floated out of the cave face down so that they could see it wasnt anything worth shooting at chapter sixteen fuse ive got it i said redhill golf club it could have been you were a member there for a year or two you used to play at lot with i clicked my fingers trying to remember the name harry foster not foster no i clicked my fingers again chester thats it chester thats right he said well im damnedit really is a small world isnt it i looked around lowering my voice you know i left there under a bit of a cloud i suppose did you well chucked out practically pros little wife remember her wow i gave a rueful grin cant help it yknow ive just got an eye for the girls he laughed quietly his teeth very white in contrast to his brickred face he was one of those englishmen who never tan they just get redder and redder he looked suddenly serious the laugh dying abruptly as he peered at me through his thicklensed glasses you know why i left the club he asked no i thought quickly and began laughing oh god not for the same no i got behind with the fees is that all of course i always paid up right on the dot the only trouble was the cheques always bounced we laughed again how are you feeling now oh i said not bad youve had a rough time of it the girl put the needle in and we watched it it was a shock thats all upset me i can tell you i expect it did he said what happened exactly she went on pressing the plunger i hardly felt it well i told him trying to think back i must have drifted here pretty well unconscious then i saw this chap coming for me with his knife and well i had to do something woke me right up i can tell you he was a real bastard came at me i broke off and looked around at the young nurse and the man standing by the door and the other one sitting on a stool near the sterilizing unit do these people understand english old boy it doesnt matter he said well i mean i wouldnt like to upset anybody but quite frankly after what that that chap did to me down there im pretty annoyed wouldnt you be i certainly would someone else came in looking at my hand without touching it saying something to the nurse in chinese and then slipping a white gown on and taking some surgical gloves from a sterile packet hes the doctor tewson told me good afternoon i said cheerfully but the man didnt seem to hear me i hoped he was good at his job that was all my hand was looking like a notterriblywelldone steak go on said tewson what oh well i mean there it was that chink came at me with his knife out and it woke me right up as you can imagine im pretty strong and i know a thing or two about looking after myself and well i suppose i must have been in a flaming temper or of course i wouldnt have been so rough with him i looked down for a moment a bit ashamed of myself poor little sod but i mean he shouldnt have i broke off and shrugged with my right shoulder well its done now i suppose the nurse inclined the articulated couch an inch or two lower so that i was in a halfreclining position the man in the white gown was working on my hand but i couldnt see it because theyd put a little screen round it cant feel a thing you know theyre pretty good arent they yes i looked at him very straight listen old boy are they very annoyed about that poor little bastard i mean sod he was only doing what he thought was right so was i i gave an ironic laugh at least it was right for me he was watching what they were doing to my hand how did you come to be drifting so near the rig god knows it was just the current he nodded slowly still watching the operation did you fall off a boat or something not exactly i was in a rubber dinghy with an outboard and id put the anchor down while i was diving you see then when i tried to pull it up it wouldnt budge so i went down again to free it thing was stuck in a whole lot of weed i was about waist deep in the stuff well i cut the anchor clear and then had to cut myself clear after that because the stuff was all round my legs then i must have lost consciousness or as good as i just remember feeling sort of drunk you know how it feels do you dyou do any diving not a lot kind of narcosis id been down too longalways overdo things thats me i shut my eyes and didnt say any more it doesnt hurt i opened my eyes mm no cant feel a thing old boy no the fatigues just catching up on me i suppose bit whacked i shut my eyes again i expect you are sorry thats all right he didnt talk again for a while situation totally zero in terms of a getout and i didnt like the way theyd brought tewson in to put the questions because the other two men in here were obviously bugs and understood english perfectly and it meant the intelligence cell knew how to think and i dont like people thinking they hadnt had any more than a few minutes to brief tewson and i didnt like the way theyd done that either he clearly wasnt intelligence but he probably wasnt a fool either and theyd just told him to talk about himself as much as he wanted to if it would help him put me at my ease and that meant they were perfectly confident that whatever he told me i wouldnt ever be able to pass on the thing that interested me most was his present state of mind it was so like his wifes he was lonely and he was scared but i didnt think they were scared of the chinese theyd got into something deeper than it had looked and they hadnt given themselves a chance to pull out while there was time in spite of his briefing thered been no need for him to admit hed lived in redhill or that hed been asked to resign from the golf club because he hadnt paid his fees id been aware of his strong compulsion to reminisce with a fellowcountryman just for a couple of minutes until hed remembered the others were listening and that he was meant to interrogate me that was why theyd taken him on a lead to the golden sands at regular intervals for sexual recreation and wifely reassurance they didnt want their missiles to get stuck in the tube because their design consultant was spiritually disorientated all over he said what is i opened my eyes your little operation reaction hit the nerves but stopped short at involuntary muscular stimulation he wasnt looking at me as he said it he was unaware of any double meaning it feels fine theyre very skilled the surgeon was peeling off the thin disposable gloves and dropping them into a sanibin and leaving the nurse to do the final dressing she looked at me once not smiling looking away again just wanting to know that the capitalistimperialist dupe was exhibiting the correct clinical reaction following anaesthetized surgical trauma they wanted to keep me in good health and this tied in with the chinese attitude towards captive political or intelligence officers of foreign extraction they relied more heavily on indoctrination mindbending and intensive exploration of the psyche rather than induced physical pain it also tied in with the way theyd pulled me out of the sea an hour ago thered been a sudden alarm raised and for a few minutes id been a floating target for half a dozen guns but after theyd made sure couldnt do anything theyd got me into the launch and given me the appropriate rescue attention while i rolled my eyes and moaned and so forth the only sign of enmity had come from one of the divers when hed surfaced and seen me lying in the stern his stream of invective had gone on until one of the officers had cut him short possibly he was a close friend of the man id killed perhaps even his brother the nurse activated the very expensivelooking surgical couch and tipped me upright thank you i said to her thankyou nodding and smiling drew a complete blank so i turned to tewson this come under the national health he laughed pleasantly rocking back an inch on his heels i thought he probably hadnt seen an englishman to talk to for a long time national health was a very english institution and the phrase had struck another chord with him i could believe that if i just said piccadilly or god save the queen he would have broken down and sobbed on my shoulder served him bloody well right he shouldve thought of what he was doing before he sold out to the reds in such a hurry at least people like philby had the decency to go on hating our guts after theyd made the break but of course he hadnt sold out to the reds at all hed sold out to nora when were you in england last i was certain he hadnt meant to ask me oh couple of months ago why i just wondered how things were over there i gave a short laugh price of bangers is up again and you can still get into the news of the world if you leave your flies undone on the tube we laughed together real old pals hed sold out to nora the girl with a taste for soixanteneuf and ming he couldnt give her the one so he gave her the other a man short on libido doesnt have to be insensitive about it and she wouldnt have spared him it had gone on for years and he hadnt been able to do anything about it because he wasnt earning enough then the chance came and hed sold two things in the same deal the design of the missile launcher he was working on and his conscience and hed bought back his pride so i suppose you never saw your dinghy again my what ohno drifted off into the wide blue yonder cost me a packet on my income anyway where were you diving he asked casually and i felt sorry for him he was a genuine boffin and all hed got on his mind was a sliderule and theyd told him to interrogate me and make it sound natural and he just wasnt capable he was a simpleminded genius and this wasnt his field at all south china sea i told him with a shut face just doing a bit of scuba fishing were you thats right then i put my right hand on his arm and lowered my voice fact is old boy i cant tell you what i was doing because ive been sworn to secrecy be breaking my word to a friend get it awfully sorry thats all right he was obviously relieved hed put the question theyd told him to put and if i didnt want to answer it he couldnt make me the nurse was putting my left arm in a sling and i looked into her blank young face as roguishly as my cover demanded trying to make her look up at me no go she pinned the sling to the white tunic i had on when theyd brought me on board the rig theyd cut away the remains of the rubber suit and put me into this mao outfit and together with the sling it made a first class change of image if id had any use for one the chinese near the door pulled it open and beckoned us outside he looked like the one whod escorted tewson to the golden sands hotel he went out first and we followed and nobody said anything till we were going along the deck towards the living quarters and suddenly i knew i had to make a move and i didnt know precisely what kind of move and i had to think and i thought fast strolling beside tewson near the rails it didnt have to be a physical move the lastditch getout thing id set up wasnt for now it was for the dark and for the time when was driven to do something suicidal the move i had to make now was psychological and i was beginning to see its shape situation i was free to walk on deck in the warm afternoon sunshine and chat with my fellow countryman but appearances were deceptive because this was an opposition stronghold and theyd got me and they were going to keep me unless i could stop them and i didnt think i could stop them in metaphysical terms i was at the wide end of a narrowing tunnel that would take me through the imminent interrogation phase with their professional from the hong kong cell and through increasingly restrictive incarceration and withholding of privileges to the final elaborate mindbending sessions with the intelligence psychiatrists in pekin that would leave me physically emaciated and with irreversible personality changes that would kill off any hope of making an eventual break because i would no longer be the kind of human being who could plan such a thing or even want it probably it was my last chance of using tewson for my own purposes or even of seeing him again theyd briefed him to question me before they put any kind of pressure on because you couldnt feel suspicious of a chap born under the same flag and all that and i was expected to be relaxed and make a slip or decide to give him my confidence id pushed this one as far as i could and the only thing that worried me was that hed seemed to accept the fact that id met him sometimes at the golf club the dossier on george henry tewson that macklin had given me was exhaustive even to the names of his acquaintances in redhill but id expected him to challenge me on this one what year were you there then i dont seem to remember you so forth but in the first few minutes of talking to him id recognized a whopping case of homesickness and thrown him the golf club thing and i think he took it without question because hed wanted to run into someone from his intimate past all the way out here on this remote prison of his where he lived among strangers i think hed accepted the whole of my cover story and the two chinese had been listening attentively so that they could trip me on the second time round they wouldnt be able to do that because id been speaking to their ears and not tewsons and there wasnt anything they could trip me on so theyd have to console themselves with the obvious ones what were you doing so far from land in a small rubber dinghy why were you sworn to secrecy who is your friend so forth that was all right most of the cover was pickproof the thing about cutting the anchor free and then losing consciousness was to give me a base theyd never find but couldnt prove was nonexistent because they were going to check up on every word id heard the helicopter take off soon after theyd brought me aboard and i was pretty certain theyd gone to pick up the interrogator in hong kong so i didnt have long to make a move i made it the chinese was leading the way and the guard had followed us out of the clinic and i dont think i could have said anything to tewson quietly enough without their catching some of it and even if they only caught a couple of words theyd get the drift but the riveter had started up a few minutes before wed left the clinic and it was still hammering away on one of the lower decks and the sound cover was adequate it was a hundred to one against my getting off this missile base with a whole skin but i was going to try and if i got clear then i was taking tewson tewson was the target for mandarin he was the objective london wanted me to bring out executive will withdraw objective from target zone and if i was going to pull off a hundredtoone shot and get out alive then i was going to take the objective with me because wasnt interested in aborting the mission i didnt have much to lose because you dont need a capsule you know when it comes to the crunch thats just the most convenient way you dont even need drain cleaner or exhaust gas or a knife or a gun or a high window without bars or a rope you just need your nails and an artery and their belief that you want to stay alive that bits important because if they think youre going to try switching off theyll start watching you and thats a bore id do it because i dont like tunnels im claustrophobic i wouldnt want to go through with the intensive interrogation phase and the increasingly restrictive incarceration and the final mindbending sessions in pekin because theyd break down the psyche to the point when i didnt think the bureau was important any more and then id give them the lot and i wouldnt mind but i minded now so i hadnt got much to lose if i tried to get the objective out of the target zone and failed even if it killed me a lot would depend on tewson he was saying something but i couldnt hear what bloody noise he said with his quick white laugh theyre doing repairs just like the strand i said always got the road up we laughed about this nodding together the chinese in front of us hadnt turned round so the chance was wide open and i went over the whole thing in the next two seconds to make sure i got it right i had to blow my cover but only to tewson not to the opposition theyd told him or they would later tell him that i was an intelligence agent sent to hong kong to find him and take him back to london and id have to say something to him that would cut right across their story it must be something he couldnt repeat to the opposition without endangering himself and it must carry the name of a sponsor to give it high credibility but a sponsor he couldnt contact openly for confirmation and finally it must be short because at any next second the din of the riveter could stop and leave me without aural cover all i had to do was light a fuse a shortburn fuse in his mind tewson i waited till hed turned his head then pitched my voice against the background noise nora says shes found out youre expendable theyre going to kill you the minute youve done this job for their own security she wants me to tell you to get out of this as soon as you can chapter seventeen cover when last night what time ive told you i cant remember what the time was you told me nothing oh for christ sake who are your employers im not going to tell you because you are lying if you say that again ill where are they now who your employers theyre oh jesus are you off your fucking rocker how many times have you asked me that one hed been at me for two hours without a break but he wasnt very good thin chap with a wide jaw and a short haircut mao tunic some kind of insignia workers merit medal or something hed started sweating because of the heat of the lamp theyd given me the smallest cabin on the whole rig one narrow bunk set in the wall like a niche at the crematorium where you put the urn cheap cardtable and picnic chair army mirror on a chain tinwashbasin no loo there was only one lamp and it was high on the wall and theyd put a two hundred watt bulb in it and he was getting as much of the glare as i was but i suppose he thought he should do this thing like they did it on the flicks what is the name of the yacht the isabella look wouldnt it be better if you played that thing back a few times where is the yacht now thats the third time whats the point of leaving that thing running when all you can do is ask the same bloody questions like a record player id begun looking at him sideways a bit in the last halfhour the cover demanded that i should react with increasing exasperation and finally begin to doubt his sanity he hadnt tripped me on anything yet because he wasnt capable this was the best interrogator they had in hong kong and hed been immediately available as a member of the local cell so theyd flown him in right away in the helicopter and now he was doing his stuff but his stuff consisted of the repetitiontoattrition technique and not much else the idea is that if you shout the same question at the subject fifty times hell finally tell the truth its meant to work on the principle that every time they shout the question you feel a bit more guilty about lying and in the end you hear your own subconscious throwing up the right answer its not funny when it happens because you start thinking its your sanity thats begun to slip then youre strictly on the skids and if they didnt find the capsule in the lining youd better get it out and dont let them see you till you keel over but i didnt think this man could do any good because he wasnt fully trained he wasnt alternating with the correct mood changes that made you think he believed you and trusted you so that the guilt mechanism produced more power the next time you lied where were you diving in the bloody sea i wiped the sweat off my face and tried to slide back the small metal window again to make him think id forgotten theyd jammed it solid the first thing an interrogator looks for is the onset of memory lapse and itd make him feel good and when you start feeling good youve got one foot on the soap you shouldnt feel anything in first category interrogation no kicks no shocks you dont really talk you question or you answer anything like conversation is discouraged because it decreases the tension where were you diving he asked me again his eyes were a bit pinkrimmed under the light and i wondered how long he could keep it up two hours is a long time listen im going to tell you the whole thing again and you make sure you get it all down on that tape then if you ask me just one more question again i swear ill throw you straight through that fucking door okay i didnt expect an answer because that ones in the book the interrogator has to keep up the theme of repetition and anything else he says will ease the monotony and he doesnt want to do that right my what is your name he wanted it his way if i told him the whole thing again the ball was going to stop in my court it had to be question answer question answer wearing you down harry cox why did you come to hong kong to do some diving why some people gave me a job what job look for a wreck what wreck now dont start asking me that one again ive told you a boat went down with a private collection of gold coins on board and my present employers who are your employers question i gave them my word i wouldnt reveal their names listen you let a thing like this get around and youll have the whole of the hong kong fishing fleet out here looking for that boat it stands to reason what is the boats position what depth did it wow up was there a collision so forth i gave him the answers again there wasnt any problem but now and then i told him he was a stupid clot and asked him if hed gone off his rocker routine cover approach but helpful to relieve the tension in me he could throw me this stuff till he had to bring in a relief and it wouldnt worry me but it was what they were doing outside this cabin that was starting to give me the shakes because i was a bit farther inside the tunnel at this stage and going deeper and i didnt want to go on the man they were going to give me in pekin would be different from this one for the first few days id respect his skin and admire his techniques and then hed start getting close and id have to fight back till he blew me and when hed blown me hed begin on the real stuff the bureau he would be a top professional a brain surgeon where is the yacht which one just a gag this was the thirtieth time the one that dropped you over the wreck somewhere in the south china sea they didnt say where they were going now listen ive given you the whole thing again as i said i would now if you ask me one more question im going to smash you up and youll wish to christ youd never set eyes on me now do you understand that i put a lot of spleen into it but he went on staring into my face with his pinkrimmed eyes while he thought out the next question his feet were still in the stance hed taken up when id talked about throwing him through the door hed quietly slid them there and i hadnt looked down but i didnt have to because he was a belt and it would be the first defensive position you cant interrogate anyone alone in a small room unless you can stop him when he comes at you intensive questioning can drive a man into a psychic trap and an explosion on the subconscious level can be murderous you are lying he said and slapped down my photograph phase two hed taken my cover story and gone over it exhaustively and couldnt break it so now he was going to watch my eyes while he threw facts at me facts like the photograph christ i said if i thought i looked like that id go and shoot myself this is your photograph we know it is bloody insulting it was the same one one of our agents managed to swim clear he said from the car in the harbour frown threesecond pause then what the hell are you he says this is your photograph prolong mystification car in the harbour what on earth so forth till he cut in again your photograph your photograph your photograph till i blew up and began shouting i tell you youre making a stupid mistake i demand to phone the governor of hong kong you cant do this to a subject of the united kingdom storming up and down couldve been an actor if i didnt have a face like a hyenas arse your photograph i let him go on very hot in here now damned if im going to ask him to open the door photograph told him to screw himself then he pulled the towel off the thing on the bed and watched my eyes closely hells that your radio we found it feeble laugh listen if i had a radio like that id get a bomb for it in kowloon what is it hammerlund i looked at it very keen radio man this is your radio well i must say thats very generous of you i timed it at fifteen minutes he gave it all he knew how your radio your radio your radio told him he was out of his cottonpickin mind told him to belt up bloody light was in my eyes starting to worry me i still wasnt completely out of the narcosis thing and i hadnt slept since eightoclock last night and it was now sixthirty and he was still pitching it at me where was your base the hong kong cathay i dont know what youre the mauritius you stayed at both those places will you bloody well listen to me a minute i tell you youre mistaken where was your base he threw me the other places on my travel pattern watching my eyes trying to pick his way in the orient club the golden sands hotel telling me he knew id been there telling i me he knew so much about me that there wasnt any point in my denying his accusations you were there when flower died what flower the man flower you were there when he died what the hells a man flower i looked at him obliquely again worried about his mental state flower was an agent he was your agent oh jesus wept are you back on that agent thing flower flower hot and the light blinding flower one stage i thought all right well have a go hes in the first defensive position but that doesnt matter ill start with a full yoharka give him no time have to watch it no emotions start emoting and youll end up right in his hands because the gutthinkll get in the way of the brainthink steady tired thats all went down too deep too long you were there when he go and shit you were shuddup you went to jade imperial mansion someone else bloke in the snap shall we tell mr tewson about your woman friend moira whats she got to do with not moira nora i havent got a woman called nora she any good you went to jade imperial mansion six times in six minutes poor old tewson wonder what hes thinking now bit of a shaker for him but it was pickproof that was all i cared just her name alone had given it credibility and he couldnt phone her to ask her about it because her line was bugged and theyd monitor his call this end and hed know that and he couldnt tell his chinese fellowworkers because theyd shove him in shackles in case he believed me and tried to dive overboard there wasnt anything he could do except worry while the fuse went on burning in his head so you have been lying i have not been lying with every word you have lied ive told you the truth yelling at each other heat of the lamp his face coming and going lies lies lies ive told you the truth sod you look out perk up tired i am sorry mr cox what i am sorry smile on his face of course i believe your story but you must understand that we have to pay close attention if persons approach this oil drill we have very expensive machinery here i hope you will accept my apologies movement of air as he passed me listen i said can i go out and take some air on deck but of course mr cox it is a delightful evening i leaned on the rail below me the sea was amethyst its haze reaching to the ochre line of the horizon where the sun had gone down all was still except where a sea bird wheeled in silence overhead whats this stuff its a kind of millet gruel i thought it looked rather wet there was a dish of mantou what about this in public i was keeping the cover millet he said corn squash potatoes not bad the line shuffled along and we shuffled with it think theyve got anything except millet he gave his quick white laugh but it was just habit his nerves were pretty bad theres some pekin duck along there face and the lamp swinging thank christ for that the canteen was very clean and everything shone under the bright lights music tinkled soothingly from the speakers someone dropped his tin plate and there was immediate silence and then the clatter started up again i didnt notice any smell of actual food i suppose they kept it down with airwick or something hygienic like that i shovelled some duck on my plate for the sake of protein and tewson had some too then we went along the deck to his cabin carrying our trays sorry theres no wine as we put our trays on each side of the table i noticed his hands were shaking his brickred colouring had yellowed since i saw him last this is very welcome is it he seemed pathetically pleased it doesnt taste too bad i expect ive got used to it i mean the whole things welcome the idea of being invited to dine on board with a fellow guest if thats quite the word he looked down they suggested it civil of them i would have asked you myself of course if of course im glad of a chance to talk to you he took a sip of water cheers cheers we began eating i didnt look at him except when he made the odd remark and he found it difficult to meet my eyes september was a beautiful month in hong kong he said the evenings were always like this very calm i said i hadnt been in this part of the globe for some years he asked me how the food was very good he seemed pleased again and i couldnt think why some exaggerated sense of hostmanship his eyes went down to his plate and the light flashed across his thicklensed glasses they treat me well very well im sure they do nothing to complain of thats good he ate rather hungrily but i imagined they wouldnt be rationed on board a firstline missile site possibly he was hoping to get to the flavour he put his knife and fork down did you come here to take me back i had to think for a couple of seconds that was the idea what will they do with you now he asked me and looked up the same as theyll do with you he pushed his plate away and folded his arms on the table and leaned towards me i dont believe it you know what you said dont you i left it at that wanting to know how much hed need convincing he stood it for five seconds or so you cant prove anything he wouldnt need much convincing anyway i said its up to you he let that go because he had to he knew we couldnt talk how how well do you know nora check and recheck i wouldnt normally have to but that bloody light had bored holes in my eyes and i was longing for sleep and couldnt think as fast as i should situation id blown my cover to him they hadnt broken me down but that didnt mean anything they knew they were going to if they kept on long enough so i could talk to him about anything i chose but not about my warning to him now he might not realize this and i was ready in case he let a word slip so that i could try covering it it was academic anyway theyd got us both i dont know her very well i said done a bit of shopping with her you knowhouse of shen constellation and places like that few evenings together at the orient and gaddis shes fun isnt she loves expensive things of course didnt know she was married or well thats all right he said with his head going down i dont often see people suffering i dont mean selfpity i mean suffering maybe i dont recognize it too easily because in my opinion its always their own bloody fault and thats why i dont seem to have too many friends but i recognized it now i suppose shed gone and shoehorned him into this thing be a pushover in a place like hong kong my husband works for the ministry of defence how interesting its interesting for him all right but the moneys not much im sure the prestige is a compensation you cant have a fling on prestige hong kong is certainly a little expensive sos everywhere i find excuse me but are you sort of i mean fully chinese i was born here that makes me a british subject oh isnt that nice i pushover he was staying at this hotel too and knew london quite well she ought to look up his brother when she got back he must give her the address the chinese embassyjust a temporary post shed found his brother charming and discreet and extraordinarily generous because of his love for the british then hong kong again for their next vacation and this time a prearranged contact and a blazing row in their hotel what did she think she was doing she wasnt doing anything except wasting the best years of her life tied to a man who couldnt even do it more than once a month and couldnt give her any money so she could at least buy a few new dresses and try to look like a woman somebody loved but this would be treason oh dont be so bloody dramatic the chinks havent got anything against us its india theyre scared of now its got the bomb he told me theyre a poor country and this thing youre working on would cut their costs of defence down to a tenth oh all right weve talked quite a lot together so what and listen will you do you know how much theyd pay us for a few months work just as a technical adviser better get ready for it george a hundred thousand pounds he sat with his head down toying with some kind of fruit mush in a waxed hygienic cup i havent had time to think he said quietly he meant he hadnt had time to think about what id told him out there on deck with the riveter hammering away i havent had time to think youd have to give me longer than that how much longer i dont know id have to think egerton sitting there on the edge of the table by the voice spectograph telling them to do the whole series again and double check tewsons voice i wondered where theyd bugged him somewhere in hong kong theyd been getting serious about george henry tewson maybe a long time before theyd sent for me and put me down the hole they wouldnt be too worried about the chinese republic setting up a cheap missile system the uk was a small island at the wrong end of the telescope and the first targets in any kind of preemptive nuclear showdown would be the soviet union and india but tewson didnt have to stop at china hed got goods for sale and there were other potential buyers and some of them were in europe and he could go from door to door a hundred thousand a knock and shed think he was the most wonderful man in the world and that was what he wanted all he wanted he didnt want money none of us do we want what it can buy he wanted his wife they didnt know about that in london or maybe they did and maybe that was why they wanted him back there to put away and lose the key he was a bacillus at large a oneman doityourself bubonic plague he hadnt spoken for five minutes that was very nice i said and pushed my plate away and got up and took my knife and prised the second wallplug cover off and dragged out the wires and pulled down the portrait of mao and neutralized that one too and got the fireextinguisher off the wall and shot foam into the ceiling ventilator grille that didnt have any dust accumulated around the vanes and threw the extinguisher on the bunk and said listen they dont want anyone to know theyve got this thing because people are going to feel pressed into developing their own systems in retaliation particularly india and if youre let loose across the frontiers everybody will know theyll even know if youre caught and sent back to london and shoved in clink because of the trial proceedings he was watching me from his chair and the light wasnt across his thicklensed glasses and i could see his eyes and i could see they were looking at something hed known would happen to him one day so he didnt look surprised and he didnt look afraid he looked destroyed theres only one way they can make sure you keep your mouth shut about the work youve done for them theyre going to do it for real this time tewson theyre going to take you to tai tam bay and leave you long enough for the fish to pick you clean so they can show youve been there since your fishing accident and theyre going to take a leg off to show it was a shark but theyll leave your head on so the dentist can prove its you and dont tell me ive given you a load of cobblers work it out for yourself no one had come to the cabin yet maybe no one would it depended on their thinking they knew the three mikes were dead and they knew id done it and they knew why but they also knew they could break this poor bastard open and play the whole thing back they wanted to know what we were talking about and they couldnt do that if they came along here because wed shut up the only thing they could do by coming in here would be to show themselves up as a bunch of lemons and theres this face thing theyre all so fussy about how much longer is this job going to take tewson he stared at me through the lenses what did you say id dragged his thoughts back god knew from what particular hell this job youre doing for them how longs it going to take he tried to concentrate about two weeks all right youve got two weeks to live thought i should tell you chapter eighteen objective his silhouette came into the window again this was a different one theyd changed the guard at midnight his ears stuck out from a rather thin neck i couldnt see his eyes the window was narrow and id taken a lot of time measuring it to see if my body could pass through it in the end i gave it up that was before hed started again not this one the one with the redrimmed eyes why did you destroy the listening devices ive told you why did you destroy the listening devices gave me three hours three hours can be a long time i could still see the lamp what did you say to him leave me alone you bastard what did you say to him screw yourself one hundred and eighty minutes and five repetitions every minute and the light making pools at the back of my empty skull blazing its way right through the sockets one hundred and eighty temptations to tell him the light was still in my eyes they were shut but it was still there i would like to sleep i would like to sleep i would like to see the light go out and hear the dark and feel the silhouette turning slowly the tape running through the bright metal dishes anything else but millet of course if id known you were married she laughed and opened her legs and the blood was there in a long smear down the road a man flower what is a man watch it mouth dry and the breath pumping happened what happened bloody well wake up window was blank he wasnt at the window check dont do again it again tired thats all havent had any sleep since eight oclock last night last no night before yes a long time i raised my head off the pillow and waited he came again very regular every five minutes assumption was that he paced the width of the deck and took station at the rail and surveyed and paced back the door was locked from the outside and hed remain within earshot and i couldnt do anything with the door and if i tried the window itd make a noise what did you say to him oh christ dont you start very well in the morning you will be escorted to pekin down the long narrowing tunnel the silhouette left the window and i got off the bunk again and picked up the twist of newspaper and lit the end and held it to the air extractor the grille was getting sooty this was the fourth time and there didnt seem to be much reaction i shut my eyes standing there with my arm raised my eyes wouldnt stand the light of the flame the night was quiet i listened but the night was quiet dont you face it hope in hell the heat of the flame on my fingers i blew it out but didnt take it away till the last of the smoke was drawn through the grille there was another twist of paper ready because id found i could light two within the fiveminute period when the guard was absent i lit the second one and the light of the flame pushed into my skull through the eyesockets i could smell the paintwork burning around the grille o jesus christ youre in a locked room and the guards armed and there are four others out there at least four others you saw them last night and youd get fifty yards in the sea if the drop didnt kill you fifty yards before they started firing and you wouldnt even float because of all the lead so what are you doing here lighting bits of bloody paper off your rocker or something heat on my fingers sleep bells quite loud bells dont you go to sleep on your feet im warning you bit of action to wake you up whole place full of bells more noise out there than a fleet of fire engines they must have smelt smoke somewhere i hadnt really expected it to work and it took a second or two to get the brainthink going again the ball of newspaper was in the corner with the cheap cardtable over it threeply go up a treat i lit the newspaper there were voices outside a lot of shouting time i went it wasnt really a refinement the thing had to be credible and if id just started a fire in here and banged on the door theyd see what i was doing trying to get out but if the alarm system went off theyd take it seriously so i broke the window and shouted and went to the door and started hammering and the place filled up with smoke and the heat was on my back and i began wondering if hed get here and open up before the fumes knocked me out i didnt want to try the window till there was nothing else for it because it was so bloody narrow that i might get stuck halfway and the whole thing would turn into a barbecue eyes running and the fumes burning in my throat table was crackling some sparks flying off i kept on hammering but i couldnt shout any more couldnt breathe everything red behind me now and roaring then the door fell down and i went on top of it and the flames came blowing in the air rush as he got me by the wrists and dragged me across the deck hands beating at my back slapping my shoulders got me there i suppose the flames had got me there bells bells and feet running and the clang of a fire bucket shouting they dropped me against the bulkhead below the derrick and i let my head sag one of them had got the hose from the nearest point and they were in business now and i watched them but you havent got time to watch them couldnt see too well because eyes streaming and everything blurred but come on for christ sake come on they were forming a group watching the blaze some of them bringing another hose and i crawled as far as the iron ladder and got on my feet and knew i couldnt do it and then did it still there where id left it but sweet jesus be careful be careful thing weighed a ton one of them was coming now and when he saw i was on my feet he pulled his gun and i brought my arms up high lifting the thing above my head ready to throw it he stopped and the man behind him stopped the man behind him was naked to the waist just out of bed he was my interrogator tell the guard i said to drop his gun he stood still staring above my head the thing weighed a ton but only because i was so bloody tired normally it wouldnt take a lot of lifting a lot of holding up tell him but my throat was too sore so i brought it forward suddenly and he made a shrill sound to the guard and repeated it and the guard dropped his gun i raised my arms again to make it easier to hold there the big deck lamp was behind me and i could see the shadow enormous with the horns sticking out from its sphere theyd be gleaming quietly in the light above my head copper coloured copper red i couldnt see them the shouting had died away it sounded as if theyd got the fire under control there wasnt much in there thatd burn the walls and ceiling and floor were iron this whole thing was iron the deck here was iron and the gun had made a dull ringing when it fell even if i couldnt make it even if it got too heavy even if my legs just crumpled and i fell forward the thing would detonate on the iron deck he knew that and he didnt want to die bring colonel tang here i told him no as he moved want him brought here send someone and be quick because i dont know how long i can hold this he didnt do anything right away so i let one leg buckle at the knee and the big round shadow moved on the deck the horns swinging he spoke sharply to the guard and the guard began running id asked tewson who was in charge of the rig tang hed told me i wanted to know about him army colonel honorary rank actually a physicist their top missile man big in pekin hed do that was what had changed my mind id unscrewed this thing from the turnbuckle and brought it up here last night in case i could use it for a lastditch getout chuck it at the fuel tanks and drop overboard while everyone was busy swim to the island and make the rendezvous but tewson might not have been game didnt look like a swimmer with a man like tang on the hook we could do it with a bit more style provided i didnt drop this bloody mine and someone didnt shoot me back on fire i could swear those bastards hadnt got the flames out they were just standing there gawping stink of wet charred bedclothes coming out of the cabin water all over the place i could hear the rest of the crew coming on deck some of them asking what was going on three fast shots banging into the girders behind me and a shrill voice but not in time to stop the fourth one and it bit into my ribs and i staggered and the voice of the interrogator shrilled out again and they started dropping their guns where they stood then he was staring above me again i think he was praying been a shock and i brought the mine down holding it against my chest like a medicine ball ready to throw i suppose some stupid prick had panicked well this wasnt the most stable situation anything could happen listen i said get tang here could feel the blood under my tunic warm on the skin no particular pain and nothing coming into my mouth smashed a rib with any luck but oh jesus christ i was tired i was tired the colonel was a short man very straightbacked epaulettes on his white tunic pyjama pants comic opera if it hadnt been so bloody deadly i said what i wanted him to do he looked at me for a long time it was incredibly quiet thirty or forty men on deck in a semicircle and the big lamp throwing shadows the bells had stopped and the hydrants were shut off and all i could hear was someone whispering and someone telling him to shut up colonel tang stood in front of me he hadnt said anything yet my eyes were still watering and he looked blurred i couldnt see what he was thinking and i didnt really care because i was going to tell him what to think and if he didnt like it i was going to lob this bloody lollipop right in his face getting fed up with holding come on get a grip drifting away again colonel he was like a statue im ready to die for my beliefs you have five seconds if i could only stay on my feet another five seconds one he didnt move id spoken in english he was an educated man and more likely to know english than cantonese two i thought my hand was bleeding my left hand must take great care of it little chihchi had said fat lot of chance the interrogator was standing next to the colonel a step to the rear he was watching the mine fascinated conceivably he was thinking in terms of a flying leap catch it before it hit the deck id stop that lark three thing of course was that nobody could really do anything without this man getting killed and if they let that happen pekin would have their balls off four possibly he was wondering if he could talk me out of it but id preempted that one tell these people youre ready to die for your beliefs and they wont question it terribly keen on ideology theres a species of ant that fights fires they throw themselves bodily on to the flames till the sheer weight of numbers puts them out i suppose it takes all sorts five he was still watching me and i got the thing above my head and lurched forward with it and an enormous hiss went up from the crowd of men and tang threw his hands out but i managed to keep my balance in time when he just said no after that it was okay i told him to go first down the iron ladders and i followed him and the seaman fell in behind he was going to pilot the launch hello i said when we got there coming along he was standing by the launch his thicklensed glasses catching the light id told him to wait for us here at hours if he was interested id expected he would be he didnt like the bit about tai tam bay i began thinking she wasnt there the breakoff rendezvous was for hours hengkang chou island rotating sectors beginning with the north coast so she ought to be standing off by now and id been using the signalling lamp on our way in mandarin mandarin mandarin no acknowledgement but i changed it to instructions surface surface surface felt rotten all this trouble and they couldnt even get here in time to there she was the sea broke ahead of us in a long dark wave and the water streamed off her hull as she came up black and shining under the moon swordfish the launch slowed and i had to grip the rail as the weight of the mine started swinging me round id got it in the crook of my left arm and tewson made a move to steady it but i warned him off because i didnt know how sensitive these detonators were he was watching me obviously worried i suppose i looked a bit far gone because the blood had soaked into the tunic below my ribs and my back was in a mess and my eyes wouldnt quite focus kept blurring use some sleep that was all but he was waiting for me to keel over and blast the whole lot of us into kingdom come colonel tang stood erect in the stern hadnt looked at us once since wed left the rig shocking loss of face and all that well i couldnt help it got my job to do we pulled alongside and started wallowing in the waves the sub had put out when shed surfaced our fenders squawking against her plates as a seaman swung a boathook across lot of people in the conningtower ferris and ackroyd couple of officers all with drawn revolvers as if they were expecting some sort of trouble told tewson to go aboard first these two men are going back to the rig i told ackroyd all right can someone take this thing for me but go easy oh my oath one of the officers said and reached down christ sake dont drop it i could hardly lift it now but we managed most of them looked as if theyd stopped breathing for a bit then they helped me aboard and i nearly fell over and someone had to put out a hand bloody embarrassing braced myself against the rail ferris i said this is tewson the objective the end
