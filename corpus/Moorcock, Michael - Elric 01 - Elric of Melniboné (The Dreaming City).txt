city of ameeron the tunnel under the marsh two black swords the pale kings mercy epilogue book one on the island kingdom of melnibone all the old rituals are still observed though the nations power has waned for five hundred years and now her way of life is maintained only by her trade with the young kingdoms and the fact that the city of imrryr has become the meeting place of merchants are those rituals no longer useful can the rituals be denied and doom avoided one who would rule in emperor elrics stead prefers to think not he says that elric will bring destruction to melnibone by his refusal to honour all the rituals and now opens the tragedy which will close many years from now and precipitate the destruction of this world a melancholy king a court strives to honour him it is the colour of a bleached skull his flesh and the long hair which flows below his shoulders is milkwhite from the tapering beautiful head stare two slanting eyes crimson and moody and from the loose sleeves of his yellow gown emerge two slender hands also the colour of bone resting on each arm of a seat which has been carved from a single massive ruby the crimson eyes are troubled and sometimes one hand will rise to finger the light helm which sits upon the white locks a helm made from some dark greenish alloy and exquisitely moulded into the likeness of a dragon about to take wing and on the hand which absently caresses the crown there is a ring in which is set a single rare actorios stone whose core sometimes shifts sluggishly and reshapes itself as if it were sentient smoke and as restless in its jewelled prison as the young albino on his ruby throne he looks down the long flight of quartz steps to where his court disports itself dancing with such delicacy and whispering grace that it might be a court of ghosts mentally he debates moral issues and in itself this activity divides him from the great majority of his subjects for these people are not human these are the people of melnibone the dragon isle which ruled the world for ten thousand years and has ceased to rule it for less than five hundred years and they are cruel and clever and to them morality means little more than a proper respect for the traditions of a hundred centuries to the young man four hundred and twentyeighth in direct line of descent from the first sorcerer emperor of melnibone their assumptions seem not only arrogant but foolish it is plain that the dragon isle has lost most of her power and will soon be threatened in another century or two by a direct conflict with the emerging human nations whom they call somewhat patronisingly the young kingdoms already pirate fleets have made unsuccessful attacks on imrryr the beautiful the dreaming city capital of the dragon isle of melnibone yet even the emperors closest friends refuse to discuss the prospect of melnibones fall they are not pleased when he mentions the idea considering his remarks not only unthinkable but also a singular breach of good taste so alone the emperor broods he mourns that his father sadric the eightysixth did not sire more children for then a more suitable monarch might have been available to take his place on the ruby throne sadric has been dead a year whispering a glad welcome to that which came to claim his soul through most of his life sadric had never known another woman than his wife for the empress had died bringing her sole thinblooded issue into the world but with melnibonean emotions sadric had loved his wife and had been unable to find pleasure in any other company even that of the son who had killed her and who was all that was left of her by magic potions and the chanting of runes by rare herbs had her son been nurtured his strength sustained artificially by every art known to the sorcerer kings of melnibone and he had livedstill livesthanks to sorcery alone for he is naturally lassitudinous and without his drugs would barely be able to raise his hand from his side through most of a normal day if the young emperor has found any advantage in his lifelong weakness it must be in that perforce he has read much before he was fifteen he had read every book in his fathers library some more than once his sorcerous powers learned initially from sadric are now greater than any possessed by his ancestors for many a generation his knowledge of the world beyond the shores of melnibone is profound though he has as yet had little direct experience of it if he wishes he could resurrect the dragon isles former might and rule both his own land and the young kingdoms as an invulnerable tyrant but his reading has also taught him to question the uses to which power is put to question his motives to question whether his own power should be used at all in any cause his reading has led him to this morality which still he barely understands thus to his subjects he is an enigma and to some he is a threat for he neither thinks nor acts in accordance with their conception of how a true melnibonean should think and act his cousin yyrkoon for instance has been heard more than once to voice strong doubts concerning the emperors right to rule the people of melnibone this feeble scholar will bring doom to us all he said one night to dyvim tvar lord of the dragon caves dyvim tvar is one of the emperors few friends and he had duly reported the conversation but the youth had dismissed the remarks as only a trivial treason whereas any of his ancestors would have rewarded such sentiments with a very slow and exquisite public execution the emperors attitude is further complicated by the fact that yyrkoon who is even now making precious little secret of his feelings that he should be emperor is the brother of cymoril a girl whom the albino considers the closest of his friends and who will one day become his empress down on the mosaic floor of the court prince yyrkoon can be seen in all his finest silks and furs his jewels and his brocades dancing with a hundred women all of whom are rumoured to have been mistresses of his at one time or another his dark features at once handsome and saturnine are framed by long black hair waved and oiled and his expression as ever is sardonic while his bearing is arrogant the heavy brocade cloak swings this way and that striking other dancers with some force he wears it almost as if it is armour or perhaps a weapon amongst many of the courtiers there is more than a little respect for prince yyrkoon few resent his arrogance and those who do keep silent for yyrkoon is known to be a considerable sorcerer himself also his behaviour is what the court expects and welcomes in a melnibonean noble it is what they would welcome in their emperor the emperor knows this he wishes he could please his court as it strives to honour him with its dancing and its wit but he cannot bring himself to take part in what he privately considers a wearisome and irritating sequence of ritual posturings in this he is perhaps somewhat more arrogant than yyrkoon who is at least a conventional boor from the galleries the music grows louder and more complex as the slaves specially trained and surgically operated upon to sing but one perfect note each are stimulated to more passionate efforts even the young emperor is moved by the sinister harmony of their song which in few ways resembles anything previously uttered by the human voice why should their pain produce such marvellous beauty he wonders or is all beauty created through pain is that the secret of great art both human and melnibonean the emperor elric closes his eyes there is a stir in the hall below the gates have opened and the dancing courtiers cease their motion drawing back and bowing low as soldiers enter the soldiers are clad all in light blue their ornamental helms cast in fantastic shapes their long broadbladed lances decorated with jewelled ribbons they surround a young woman whose blue dress matches their uniforms and whose bare arms are encircled by five or six bracelets of diamonds sapphires and gold strings of diamonds and sapphires are wound into her hair unlike most of the women of the court her face has no designs painted upon the eyelids or cheekbones elric smiles this is cymoril the soldiers are her personal ceremonial guard who according to tradition must escort her into the court they ascend the steps leading to the ruby throne slowly elric rises and stretches out his hands cymoril i thought you had decided not to grace the court tonight she returns his smile my emperor i found that i was in the mood for conversation after all elric is grateful she knows that he is bored and she knows too that she is one of the few people of melnibone whose conversation interests him if protocol allowed he would offer her the throne but as it is she must sit on the topmost step at his feet please sit sweet cymoril he resumes his place upon the throne and leans forward as she seats herself and looks into his eyes with a mixed expression of humour and tenderness she speaks softly as her guard withdraws to mingle at the sides of the steps with elrics own guard her voice can be heard only by elric would you ride out to the wild region of the island with me tomorrow my lord there are matters to which i must give my attention he is attracted by the idea it is weeks since he left the city and rode with her their escort keeping a discreet distance away are they urgent he shrugs what matters are urgent in melnibone after ten thousand years most problems may be seen in a certain perspective his smile is almost a grin rather like that of a young scholar who plans to play truant from his tutor very wellearly in the morning well leave before the others are up the air beyond imrryr will be clear and sharp the sun will be warm for the season the sky will be blue and unclouded elric laughs such sorcery you must have worked cymoril lowers her eyes and traces a pattern on the marble of the dais well perhaps a little i am not without friends among the weakest of the elementals elric stretches down to touch her fine fair hair does yyrkoon know no prince yyrkoon has forbidden his sister to meddle in magical matters prince yyrkoons friends are only among the darker of the supernatural beings and he knows that they are dangerous to deal with thus he assumes that all sorcerous dealings bear a similar element of danger besides this he hates to think that others possess the power that he possesses perhaps this is what in elric he hates most of all let us hope that all melnibone needs fine weather for tomorrow says elric cymoril stares curiously at him she is still a melnibonean it has not occurred to her that her sorcery might prove unwelcome to some then she shrugs her lovely shoulders and touches her lord lightly upon the hand this guilt she says this searching of the conscience its purpose is beyond my simple brain and mine i must admit it seems to have no practical function yet more than one of our ancestors predicted a change in the nature of our earth a spiritual as well as a physical change perhaps i have glimmerings of this change when i think my stranger unmelnibonean thoughts the music swells the music fades the courtiers dance on though many eyes are upon elric and cymoril as they talk at the top of the dais there is speculation when will elric announce cymoril as his empresstobe will elric revive the custom that sadric dismissed of sacrificing twelve brides and their bridegrooms to the lords of chaos in order to ensure a good marriage for the rulers of melnibone it was obvious that sadrics refusal to allow the custom to continue brought misery upon him and death upon his wife brought him a sickly son and threatened the very continuity of the monarchy elric must revive the custom even elric must fear a repetition of the doom which visited his father but some say that elric will do nothing in accordance with tradition and that he threatens not only his own life but the existence of melnibone itself and all it stands for and those who speak thus are often seen to be on good terms with prince yyrkoon who dances on seemingly unaware of their conversation or indeed unaware that his sister talks quietly with the cousin who sits on the ruby throne who sits on the edge of the seat forgetful of his dignity who exhibits none of the ferocious and disdainful pride which has in the past marked virtually everyother emperor of melnibone who chats animatedly forgetful that the court is supposed to be dancing for his entertainment and then suddenly prince yyrkoon freezes in midpirouette and raises his dark eyes to look up at his emperor in one corner of the hall dyvim tvars attention is attracted by yyrkoons calculated and dramatic posture and the lord of the dragon caves frowns his hand falls to where his sword would normally be but no swords are worn at a court ball dyvim tvar looks warily and intently at prince yyrkoon as the tall nobleman begins to ascend the stairs to the ruby throne many eyes follow the emperors cousin and now hardly anyone dances though the music grows wilder as the masters of the music slaves goad their charges to even greater exertions elric looks up to see yyrkoon standing one step below that on which cymoril sits yyrkoon makes a bow which is subtly insulting i present myself to my emperor he says an upstart prince he confronts his cousin and how do you enjoy the ball cousin elric asked aware that yyrkoons melodramatic presentation had been designed to catch him offguard and if possible humiliate him is the music to your taste yyrkoon lowered his eyes and let his lips form a secret little smile everything is to my taste my liege but what of yourself does something displease you you do not join the dance elric raised one pale finger to his chin and stared at yyrkoons hidden eyes i enjoy the dance cousin nonetheless surely it is possible to take pleasure in the pleasure of others yyrkoon seemed genuinely astonished his eyes opened fully and met elrics elric felt a slight shock and then turned his own gaze away indicating the music galleries with a languid hand or perhaps it is the pain of others which brings me pleasure fear not for my sake cousin i am pleased i am pleased you may dance on assured that your emperor enjoys the ball but yyrkoon was not to be diverted from his object surely if his subjects are not to go away saddened and troubled that they have not pleased their ruler the emperor should demonstrate his enjoyment i would remind you cousin said elric quietly that the emperor has no duty to his subjects at all save to rule them their duty is to him that is the tradition of melnibone yyrkoon had not expected elric to use such arguments against him but he rallied with his next retort i agree my lord the emperors duty is to rule his subjects perhaps that is why so many of them do not themselves enjoy the ball as much as they might i do not follow you cousin cymoril had risen and stood with her hands clenched on the step above her brother she was tense and anxious worried by her brothers bantering tone his disdainful bearing yyrkoon she said he acknowledged her presence sister i see you share our emperors reluctance to dance yyrkoon she murmured you are going too far the emperor is tolerant but tolerant or is he careless is he careless of the traditions of our great race is he contemptuous of that races pride dyvim tvar was now mounting the steps it was plain that he too sensed that yyrkoon had chosen this moment to test elrics power cymoril was aghast she said urgently yyrkoon if you would live i would not care to live if the soul of melnibone perished and the guardianship of our nations soul is the responsibility of the emperor and what if we should have an emperor who failed in that responsibility an emperor who was weak an emperor who cared nothing for the greatness of the dragon isle and its folk a hypothetical question cousin elric had recovered his composure and his voice was an icy drawl for such an emperor has never sat upon the ruby throne and such an emperor never shall dyvim tvar came up touching yyrkoon on the shoulder prince if you value your dignity and your life elric raised his hand there is no need for that dyvim tvar prince yyrkoon merely entertains us with an intellectual debate fearing that i was bored by the music and the dancewhich i am nothe thought he would provide the subject for a stimulating discourse i am certain that we are most stimulated prince yyrkoon elric allowed a patronising warmth to colour his last sentence yyrkoon flushed with anger and bit his lip but go on dear cousin yyrkoon elric said i am interested enlarge further on your argument yyrkoon looked around him as if for support but all his supporters were on the floor of the hall only elrics friends dyvim tvar and cymoril were nearby yet yyrkoon knew that his supporters were hearing every word and that he would lose face if he did not retaliate elric could tell that yyrkoon would have preferred to have retired from this confrontation and choose another day and another ground on which to continue the battle but that was not possible elric himself had no wish to continue the foolish banter which was no matter how disguised a little better than the quarrelling of two little girls over who should play with the slaves first he decided to make an end to it yyrkoon began then let me suggest that an emperor who was physically weak might also be weak in his will to rule as befitted and elric raised his hand you have done enough dear cousin more than enough you have wearied yourself with this conversation when you would have preferred to dance i am touched by your concern but now i too feel weariness steal upon me elric signaled for his old servant tanglebones who stood on the far side of the throne dais amongst the soldiers tanglebones my cloak elric stood up i thank you again for your thoughtfulness cousin he addressed the court in general i was entertained now i retire tanglebones brought the cloak of white fox fur and placed it around his masters shoulders tanglebones was very old and much taller than elric though his back was stooped and all his limbs seemed knotted and twisted back on themselves like the limbs of a strong old tree elric walked across the dais and through the door which opened onto a corridor which led to his private apartments yyrkoon was left fuming he whirled round on the dais and opened his mouth as if to address the watching courtiers some who did not support him were smiling quite openly yyrkoon clenched his fists at his sides and glowered he glared at dyvim tvar and opened his thin lips to speak dyvim tvar coolly returned the glare daring yyrkoon to say more then yyrkoon flung back his head so that the locks of his hair all curled and oiled swayed against his back and yyrkoon laughed the harsh sound filled the hall the music stopped the laughter continued yyrkoon stepped up so that he stood on the dais he dragged his heavy cloak round him so that it engulfed his body cymoril came forward yyrkoon please do not he pushed her back with a motion of his shoulder yyrkoon walked stiffly towards the ruby throne it became plain that he was about to seat himself in it and thus perform one of the most traitorous actions possible in the code of melnibone cymoril ran the few steps to him and pulled at his arm yyrkoons laughter grew it is yyrkoon they would wish to see on the ruby throne he told his sister she gasped and looked in horror at dyvim tvar whose face was grim and angry dyvim tvar signed to the guards and suddenly there were two ranks of armoured men between yyrkoon and the throne yyrkoon glared back at the lord of the dragon caves you had best hope you perish with your master he hissed this guard of honour will escort you from the hall dyvim tvar said evenly we were all stimulated by your conversation this evening prince yyrkoon yyrkoon paused looked about him then relaxed he shrugged theres time enough if elric will not abdicate then he must be deposed cymorils slender body was rigid her eyes blazed she said to her brother if you harm elric in any way i will slay you myself yyrkoon he raised his tapering eyebrows and smiled at that moment he seemed to hate his sister even more than he hated his cousin your loyalty to that creature has ensured your own doom cymoril i would rather you died than that you should give birth to any progeny of his i will not have the blood of our house diluted taintedeven touchedby his blood look to your own life sister before you threaten mine and he stormed down the steps pushing through those who came up to congratulate him he knew that he had lost and the murmurs of his sycophants only irritated him further the great doors of the hall crashed together and closed yyrkoon was gone from the hall dyvim tvar raised both his arms dance on courtiers pleasure yourselves with all that the hall provides it is what will please the emperor most but it was plain there would be little more dancing done tonight courtiers were already deep in conversation as excitedly they debated the events dyvim tvar turned to cymoril elric refuses to understand the danger princess cymoril yyrkoons ambition could bring disaster to all of us including yyrkoon cymoril sighed aye including yyrkoon but how can we avoid this cymoril if elric will not give orders for your brothers arrest he believes that such as yyrkoon should be allowed to say what they please it is part of his philosophy i can barely understand it but it seems integral to his whole belief if he destroys yyrkoon he destroys the basis on which his logic works that at any rate dragon master is what he has tried to explain to me dyvim tvar sighed and he frowned though unable to understand elric he was afraid that he could sometimes sympathise with yyrkoons viewpoint at least yyrkoons motives and arguments were relatively straightforward he knew elrics character too well however to believe that elric acted from weakness or lassitude the paradox was that elric tolerated yyrkoons treachery because he was strong because he had the power to destroy yyrkoon whenever he cared and yyrkoons own character was such that he must constantly be testing that strength of elrics for he knew instinctively that if elric did weaken and order him slain then he would have won it was a complicated situation and dyvim tvar dearly wished that he was not embroiled in it but his loyalty to the royal line of melnibone was strong and his personal loyalty to elric was great he considered the idea of having yyrkoon secretly assassinated but he knew that such a plan would almost certainly come to nothing yyrkoon was a sorcerer of immense power and doubtless would be forewarned of any attempt on his life princess cymoril said dyvim tvar i can only pray that your brother swallows so much of his rage that it eventually poisons him i will join you in that prayer lord of the dragon caves together they left the hall riding through the morning a moment of tranquillity the light of the early morning touched the tall towers of imrryr and made them scintillate each tower was of a different hue there were a thousand soft colours there were rose pinks and pollen yellows there were purples and pale greens mauves and browns and oranges hazy blues whites and powdery golds all lovely in the sunlight two riders left the dreaming city behind them and rode away from the walls over the green turf towards a pine forest where among the shadowy trunks a little of the night seemed to remain squirrels were stirring and foxes crept homeward birds were singing and forest flowers opened their petals and filled the air with delicate scent a few insects wandered sluggishly aloft the contrast between life in the nearby city and this lazy rusticity was very great and seemed to mirror some of the contrasts existing in the mind of at least one of the riders who now dismounted and led his horse walking kneedeep through a mass of blue flowers the other rider a girl brought her own horse to a halt but did not dismount instead she leaned casually on her high melnibonean pommel and smiled at the man her lover elric would you stop so near to imrryr he smiled back at her over his shoulder for the moment our flight was hasty i would collect my thoughts before we ride on how did you sleep last night well enough cymoril though i must have dreamed without knowing it for there werethere were little intimations in my head when i awoke but then the meeting with yyrkoon was not pleasant do you think he plots to use sorcery against you elric shrugged i would know if he brought a large sorcery against me and he knows my power i doubt if he would dare employ wizardry he has reason to believe you might not use your power he has worried at your personality for so longis there not a danger he will begin to worry at your skills testing your sorcery as he has tested your patience elric frowned yes i suppose there is that danger but not yet i should have thought he will not be happy until you are destroyed elric or is destroyed himself cymoril elric stooped and picked one of the flowers he smiled your brother is inclined to absolutes is he not how the weak hate weakness cymoril took his meaning she dismounted and came towards him her thin gown matched almost perfectly the colour of the flowers through which she moved he handed her the flower and she accepted it touching its petals with her perfect lips and how the strong hate strength my love yyrkoon is my kin and yet i give you this adviceuse your strength against him i could not slay him i have not the right elrics face fell into familiar brooding lines you could exile him is not exile the same as death to a melnibonean you yourself have talked of travelling in the lands of the young kingdoms elric laughed somewhat bitterly but perhaps i am not a true melnibonean yyrkoon has said as muchand others echo his thoughts he hates you because you are contemplative your father was contemplative and no one denied that he was a fitting emperor my father chose not to put the results of his contemplation into his personal actions he ruled as an emperor should yyrkoon i must admit would also rule as an emperor should he too has the opportunity to make melnibone great again if he were emperor he would embark on a campaign of conquest to restore our trade to its former volume to extend our power across the earth and that is what the majority of our folk would wish is it my right to deny that wish it is your right to do what you think for you are the emperor all who are loyal to you think as i do perhaps their loyalty is misguided perhaps yyrkoon is right and i will betray that loyalty bring doom to the dragon isle his moody crimson eyes looked directly into hers perhaps i should have died as i left my mothers womb then yyrkoon would have become emperor has fate been thwarted fate is never thwarted what has happened has happened because fate willed it thusif indeed there is such a thing as fate and if mens actions are not merely a response to other mens actions elric drew a deep breath and offered her an expression tinged with irony your logic leads you close to heresy cymoril if we are to believe the traditions of melnibone perhaps it would be better if you forgot your friendship with me she laughed you begin to sound like my brother are you testing my love for you my lord he began to remount his horse no cymoril but i would advise you to test your love yourself for i sense there is tragedy implicit in our love as she swung herself back into her saddle she smiled and shook her head you see doom in all things can you not accept the good gifts granted you they are few enough my lord aye ill agree with that they turned in their saddles hearing hoofbeats behind them some distance away they saw a company of yellowclad horsemen riding about in confusion it was their guard which they had left behind wishing to ride alone come cried elric through the woods and over yonder hill and theyll never find us they spurred their steeds through the sunspeared wood and up the steep sides of the hill beyond racing down the other side and away across a plain where noidel bushes grew their lush poison fruit glimmering a purplish blue a nightcolour which even the light of day could not disperse there were many such peculiar berries and herbs on melnibone and it was to some of them that elric owed his life others were used for sorcerous potions and had been sown generations before by elrics ancestors now few melniboneans left imrryr even to collect these harvests only slaves visited the greater part of the island seeking the roots and the shrubs which made men dream monstrous and magnificent dreams for it was in their dreams that the nobles of melnibone found most of their pleasures they had ever been a moody inwardlooking race and it was for this quality that imrryr had come to be named the dreaming city there even the meanest slaves chewed berries to bring them oblivion and thus were easily controlled for they came to depend on their dreams only elric himself refused such drugs perhaps because he required so many others simply to ensure his remaining alive the yellowclad guards were lost behind them and once across the plain where the noidel bushes grew they slowed their flight and came at length to cliffs and then the sea the sea shone brightly and languidly washed the white beaches below the cliffs seabirds wheeled in the clear sky and their cries were distant serving only to emphasise the sense of peace which both elric and cymoril now had in silence the lovers guided their horses down steep paths to the shore and there they tethered the steeds and began to walk across the sand their hairhis white hers jet blackwaving in the wind which blew from the east they found a great dry cave which caught the sounds the sea made and replied in a whispering echo they removed their silken garments and made love tenderly in the shadows of the cave they lay in each others arms as the day warmed and the wind dropped then they went to bathe in the waters filling the empty sky with their laughter when they were dry and were dressing themselves they noticed a darkening of the horizon and elric said we shall be wet again before we return to imrryr no matter how fast we ride the storm will catch us perhaps we should remain in the cave until it is past she suggested coming close and holding her soft body against him no he said i must return soon for there are potions in imrryr i must take if my body is to retain its strength an hour or two longer and i shall begin to weaken you have seen me weak before cymoril she stroked his face and her eyes were sympathetic aye ive seen you weak before elric come lets find the horses by the time they reached the horses the sky was grey overhead and full of boiling blackness not far away in the east they heard the grumble of thunder and the crash of lightning the sea was threshing as if infected by the skys hysteria the horses snorted and pawed at the sand anxious to return even as elric and cymoril climbed into their saddles large spots of rain began to fall on their heads and spread over their cloaks then suddenly they were riding at full tilt back to imrryr while the lightning flashed around them and the thunder roared like a furious giant like some great old lord of chaos attempting to break through unbidden into the realm of earth cymoril glanced at elrics pale face illuminated for a moment by a flash of skyfire and she felt a chill come upon her then and the chill had nothing to do with the wind or the rain for it seemed to her in that second that the gentle scholar she loved had been transformed by the elements into a helldriven demon into a monster with barely a semblance of humanity his crimson eyes had flared from the whiteness of his skull like the very flames of the higher hell his hair had been whipped upward so that it had become the crest of a sinister warhelm and by a trick of the stormlight his mouth had seemed twisted in a mixture of rage and agony and suddenly cymoril knew she knew profoundly that their mornings ride was the last moment of peace the two of them would ever experience again the storm was a sign from the gods themselvesa warning of storms to come she looked again at her lover elric was laughing he had turned his face upward so that the warm rain fell upon it so that the water splashed into his open mouth the laughter was the easy unsophisticated laughter of a happy child cymoril tried to laugh back but then she had to turn her face away so that he should not see it for cymoril had begun to weep she was weeping still when imrryr came in sight a black and grotesque silhouette against a line of brightness which was the as yet untainted western horizon prisoners their secrets are taken from them the men in yellow armour saw elric and cymoril as the two approached the smallest of the eastern gates they have found us at last smiled elric through the rain but somewhat belatedly eh cymoril cymoril still embattled with her sense of doom merely nodded and tried to smile in reply elric took this as an expression of disappointment nothing more and called to his guards ho men soon we shall all be dry again but the captain of the guard rode up urgently crying my lord emperor is needed at monshanjik tower where spies are held spies aye my lord the mans face was pale water cascaded from his helm and darkened his thin cloak his horse was hard to control and kept sidestepping through pools of water which had gathered wherever the road was in disrepair caught in the maze this morning southern barbarians by their chequered dress we are holding them until the emperor himself can question them elric waved his hand then lead on captain lets see the brave fools who dare melnibones seamaze the tower of monshanjik had been named for the wizardarchitect who had designed the seamaze millennia before the maze was the only means of reaching the great harbour of imrryr and its secrets had been carefully guarded for it was their greatest protection against sudden attack the maze was complicated and pilots had to be specially trained to steer ships through it before the maze had been built the harbour had been a kind of inland lagoon fed by the sea which swept in through a system of natural caverns in the towering cliff which rose between lagoon and ocean there were five separate routes through the seamaze and any individual pilot knew but one in the outer wall of the cliff there were five entrances here young kingdom ships waited until a pilot came aboard then one of the gates to one of the entrances would be lifted all aboard the ship would be blindfolded and sent below save for the oarmaster and the steersman who would also be masked in heavy steel helms so that they could see nothing do nothing but obey the complicated instructions of the pilot and if a young kingdom ship should fail to obey any of those instructions and should crush itself against the rock walls well melnibone did not mourn for it and any survivors from the crew would be taken as slaves all who sought to trade with the dreaming city understood the risks but scores of merchants came every month to dare the dangers of the maze and trade their own poor goods for the splendid riches of melnibone the tower of monshanjik stood overlooking the harbour and the massive mole which jutted out into the middle of the lagoon it was a seagreen tower and was squat compared with most of those in imrryr though still a beautiful and tapering construction with wide windows so that the whole of the harbour could be seen from it from monshanjik tower most of the business of the harbour was done and in its lower cellars were kept any prisoners who had broken any of the myriad rules governing the functioning of the harbour leaving cymoril to return to the palace with a guard elric entered the tower riding through the great archway at the base scattering not a few merchants who were waiting for permission to begin their bartering for the whole of the ground floor was full of sailors merchants and melnibonean officials engaged in the business of trade though it was not here that the actual wares were displayed the great echoing babble of a thousand voices engaged in a thousand separate aspects of bargaining slowly stilled as elric and his guard rode arrogantly through to another dark arch at the far end of the hall this arch opened onto a ramp which sloped and curved down into the bowels of the tower down this ramp clattered the horsemen passing slaves servants and officials who stepped hastily aside bowing low as they recognised the emperor great brands illuminated the tunnel guttering and smoking and casting distorted shadows onto the smooth obsidian walls a chill was in the air now and a dampness for water washed about the outer walls below the quays of imrryr and still the emperor rode on and still the ramp struck lower through the glassy rock and then a wave of heat rose to meet them and shifting light could be seen ahead and they passed into a chamber that was full of smoke and the scent of fear from the low ceiling hung chains and from eight of the chains swinging by their feet hung four people their clothes had been torn from them but their bodies were clothed in blood from tiny wounds precise but severe made by the artist who stood scalpel in hand surveying his handiwork the artist was tail and very thin almost like a skeleton in his stained white garments his lips were thin his eyes were slits his fingers were thin his hair was thin and the scalpel he held was thin too almost invisible save when it flashed in the light from the fire which erupted from a pit on the far side of the cavern the artist was named doctor jest and the art he practised was a performing art rather than a creative one the art of drawing secrets from those who kept them doctor jest was the chief interrogator of melnibone he turned sinuously as elric entered the scalpel held between the thin thumb and the thin forefinger of his fight hand he stood poised and expectant almost like a dancer and then bowed from the waist my sweet emperor his voice was thin it rushed from his thin throat as if bent on escape and one was inclined to wonder if one had heard the words at all so quickly had they come and gone doctor are these the southlanders caught this morning indeed they are my lord another sinuous bow for your pleasure coldly elric inspected the prisoners he felt no sympathy for them they were spies their actions had led them to this pass they had known what would happen to them if caught but one of them was a boy and another a woman it appeared though they writhed so in their chains it was quite difficult to tell at first it seemed a shame then the woman snapped what remained of her teeth at him and hissed demon and elric stepped back saying have they informed you of what they were doing in our maze doctor they still tantalise me with hints they have a fine sense of drama i appreciate that they are here i would say to map a route through the maze which a force of raiders might then follow but they have so far withheld the details that is the game we ail understand how it must be played and when will they tell you doctor jest oh very soon my lord it would be best to know if we are to expect attackers the sooner we know the less time we shall lose dealing with the attack when it comes do you not agree doctor i do my lord very well elric was irritated by this break in his day it had spoiled the pleasure of the ride it had brought him face to face with his duties too quickly doctor jest returned to his charges and reaching out with his free hand expertly seized the genitals of one of the male prisoners the scalpel flashed there was a groan doctor jest tossed something onto the fire elric sat in the chair prepared for him he was bored rather than disgusted by the rituals attendant upon the gathering of information and the discordant screams the clash of the chains the thin whisperings of doctor jest all served to ruin the feeling of wellbeing he had retained even as he reached the chamber but it was one of his kingly duties to attend such rituals and attend this one he must until the information was presented to him and he could congratulate his chief interrogator and issue orders as to the means of dealing with any attack and even when that was over he must confer with admirals and with generals probably through the rest of the night choosing between arguments deciding on the deposition of men and ships with a poorly disguised yawn he leaned back and watched as doctor jest ran fingers and scalpel tongue tongs and pincers over the bodies he was soon thinking of other matters philosophical problems which he had still failed to resolve it was not that elric was inhumane it was that he was still a melnibonean he had been used to such sights since childhood he could not have saved the prisoners even if he had desired without going against every tradition of the dragon isle and in this case it was a simple matter of a threat being met by the best methods available he had become used to shutting off those feelings which conflicted with his duties as emperor if there had been any point in freeing the four who danced now at doctor jests pleasure he would have freed them but there was no point and the four would have been astonished if they had received any other treatment than this where moral decisions were concerned elric was by and large practical he would make his decision in the context of what action he could take in this case he could take no action such a reaction had become second nature to him his desire was not to reform melnibone but to reform himself not to initiate action but to know the best way of responding to the actions of others here the decision was easy to make a spy was an aggressor one defended oneself against aggressors in the best possible way the methods employed by doctor jest were the best methods my lord absently elric looked up we have the information now my lord doctor jests thin voice whispered across the chamber two sets of chains were now empty and slaves were gathering things up from the floor and flinging them on the fire the two remaining shapeless lumps reminded elric of meat carefully prepared by a chef one of the lumps still quivered a little but the other was still doctor jest slid his instruments into a thin case he carried in a pouch at his belt his white garments were almost completely covered in stains it seems there have been other spies before these doctor jest told his master these came merely to confirm the route if they do not return in time the barbarians will still sail but surely they will know that we expect them elric said probably not my lord rumours have been spread amongst the young kingdom merchants and sailors that four spies were seen in the maze and were spearedslain whilst trying to escape i see elric frowned then our best plan will be to lay a trap for the raiders aye my lord you know the route they have chosen aye my lord elric turned to one of his guards have messages sent to all our generals and admirals whats the hour the hour of sunset is just past my liege tell them to assemble before the ruby throne at two hours past sunset wearily elric rose you have done well as usual doctor jest the thin artist bowed low seeming to fold himself in two a thin and somewhat unctuous sigh was his reply a battle the king proves his warskill yyrkoon was the first to arrive all clad in martial finery accompanied by two massive guards each holding one of the princes ornate warbanners my emperor yyrkoons shout was proud and disdainful would you let me command the warriors it will relieve you of that care when doubtless you have many other concerns with which to occupy your time elric replied impatiently you are most thoughtful prince yyrkoon but fear not for me i shall command the armies and the navies of melnibone for that is the duty of the emperor yyrkoon glowered and stepped to one side as dyvim tvar lord of the dragon caves entered he had no guard whatsoever with him and it seemed he had dressed hastily he carried his helmet under his arm my emperori bring news of the dragons i thank you dyvim tvar but wait until all my commanders are assembled and impart that news to them too dyvim tvar bowed and went to stand on the opposite side of the hall to that on which prince yyrkoon stood gradually the warriors arrived until a score of great captains waited at the foot of the steps which led to the ruby throne where elric sat elric himself still wore the clothes in which he had gone riding that morning he had not had time to change and had until a little while before been consulting maps of the mazesmaps which only he could read and which at normal times were hidden by magical means from any who might attempt to find them southlanders would steal imrryrs wealth and slay us all elric began they believe they have found a way through our seamaze a fleet of a hundred warships sails on melnibone even now tomorrow it will wait below the horizon until dusk then it will sail to the maze and enter by midnight it expects to reach the harbour and to have taken the dreaming city before dawn is that possible i wonder no many spoke the single word no elric smiled but how shall we best enjoy this little war they offer us yyrkoon as ever was first to shout let us go to meet them now with dragons and with battlebarges let us pursue them to their own land and take their war to them let us attack their nations and burn their cities let us conquer them and thus ensure our own security dyvim tvar spoke up again no dragons he said what yyrkoon whirled what no dragons prince they will not be awakened the dragons sleep in their caverns exhausted by their last engagement on your behalf mine you would use them in our conflict with the vilmirian pirates i told you that i would prefer to save them for a larger engagement but you flew them against the pirates and you burned their little boats and now the dragons sleep yyrkoon glowered he looked up at elric i did not expect elric raised his hand we need not use our dragons until such a time as we really need them this attack from the southlander fleet is nothing but we will conserve our strength if we bide our time let them think we are unready let them enter the maze once the whole hundred are through we close in blocking off all routes in or out of the maze trapped they will be crushed by us yyrkoon looked pettishly at his feet evidently wishing he could think of some flaw in the plan tall old admiral magum colim in his seagreen armour stepped forward and bowed the golden battlebarges of imrryr are ready to defend their city my liege it will take time however to manoeuvre them into position it is doubtful if all will fit into the maze at once then sail some of them out now and hide them around the coast so that they can wait for any survivors that may escape our attack elric instructed him a useful plan my liege magum colim bowed and sank back into the crowd of his peers the debate continued for some time and then they were ready and about to leave but then prince yyrkoon bellowed once more i repeat my offer to the emperor his person is too valuable to risk in battle my personit is worthless let me command the warriors of both land and sea while the emperor may remain at the palace untroubled by the battle confident that it will be won and the southlanders trouncedperhaps there is a book he wishes to finish elric smiled again i thank you for your concern prince yyrkoon but an emperor must exercise his body as well as his mind i will command the warriors tomorrow when elric arrived back at his apartments it was to discover that tanglebones had already laid out his heavy black wargear here was the armour which had served a hundred melnibonean emperors an armour which was forged by sorcery to give it a strength unequalled on the realm of earth which could so rumour went even withstand the bite of the mythical runeblades stormbringer and mournblade which had been wielded by the wickedest of melnibones many wicked rulers before being seized by the lords of the higher worlds and hidden forever in a realm where even those lords might rarely venture the face of the tangled man was full of joy as he touched each piece of armour each finely balanced weapon with his long gnarled fingers his seamed face looked up to regard elrics careravaged features oh my lord oh my king soon you will know the joy of the fight aye tanglebonesand let us hope it will be a joy i taught you all the skillsthe art of the sword and the poignardthe art of the bowthe art of the spear both mounted and on foot and you learned well for all they say you are weak save one theres no better swordsman in melnibone prince yyrkoon could be better than me elric said reflectively could he not i said save one my lord and yyrkoon is that one well one day perhaps well be able to test the matter ill bathe before i don all that metal best make speed master from what i hear there is much to do and ill sleep after ive bathed elric smiled at his old friends consternation it will be better thus for i cannot personally direct the barges into position i am needed to command the frayand that i will do better when ive rested if you think it good lord king then it is good and you are astonished you are too eager tanglebones to get me into all that stuff and see me strut about in it as if i were arioch himself tangleboness hand flew to his mouth as if he had spoken the words not his master and he was trying to block them his eyes widened elric laughed you think i speak bold heresies eh well ive spoken worse without any ill befalling me on melnibone tanglebones the emperors control the demons not the reverse so you say my liege it is the truth elric swept from the room calling for his slaves the warfever filled him and he was jubilant now he was in all his black gear the massive breastplate the padded jerkin the long greaves the mail gauntlets at his side was a fivefoot broadsword which it was said had belonged to a human hero called aubec resting on the deck against the golden rail of the bridge was the great round warboard his shield bearing the sign of the swooping dragon and a helm was on his head a black helm with a dragons head craning over the peak and dragons wings flaring backward above it and a dragons tail curling down the back all the helm was black but within the helm there was a white shadow from which glared two crimson orbs and from the sides of the helm strayed wisps of milkwhite hair almost like smoke escaping from a burning building and as the helm turned in what little light came from the lantern hanging at the base of the mainmast the white shadow sharpened to reveal featuresfine handsome featuresa straight nose curved lips upslanting eyes the face of emperor elric of melnibone peered into the gloom of the maze as he listened for the first sounds of the searaiders approach he stood on the high bridge of the great golden battlebarge which like all its kind resembled a floating ziggurat equipped with masts and sails and oars and catapults the ship was called the son of the pyaray and it was the flagship of the fleet the grand admiral magum colim stood beside elric like dyvim tvar the admiral was one of elrics few close friends he had known elric all his life and had encouraged him to learn all he could concerning the running of fighting ships and fighting fleets privately magum colim might fear that elric was too scholarly and introspective to rule melnibone but he accepted elrics right to rule and was made angry and impatient by the talk of the likes of yyrkoon prince yyrkoon was also aboard the flagship though at this moment he was below inspecting the warengines the son of the pyaray lay at anchor in a huge grotto one of hundreds built into the walls of the maze when the maze itself was built and designed for just this purposeto hide a battlebarge there was just enough height for the masts and enough width for the oars to move freely each of the golden battlebarges was equipped with banks of oars each bank containing between twenty and thirty oars on either side the banks were four five or six decks high and as in the case of the son of the pyaray might have three independent steering systems fore and aft being armoured all in gold the ships were virtually indestructible and for all their massive size they could move swiftly and manoeuvre delicately when occasion demanded it was not the first time they had waited for their enemies in these grottoes it would not be the last the battlebarges of melnibone were rarely seen on the open seas these days but once they had sailed the oceans of the world like fearsome floating mountains of gold andthey had brought terror whenever they were sighted the fleet had been larger then comprising hundreds of craft now there were less than forty ships but forty would suffice now in damp darkness they awaited their enemies listening to the hollow slap of the water against the sides of the ship elric wished that he had been able to conceive a better plan than this he was sure that this one would work but he regretted the waste of lives both melnibonean and barbarian it would have been better if some way could have been devised of frightening the barbarians away rather than trapping them in the seamaze the southlander fleet was not the first to have been attracted by imrryrs fabulous wealth the southlander crews were not the first to entertain the belief that the melniboneans because they never now ventured far from the dreaming city had become decadent and unable to defend their treasures and so the southlanders must be destroyed in order to make the lesson clear melnibone was still strong she was strong enough in yyrkoons view to resume her former dominance of the worldstrong in sorcery if not in soldiery hist admiral magum colim craned forward was that the sound of an oar elric nodded i think so now they heard regular splashes as of rows of oars dipping in and out of the water and they heard the creak of timbers the southlanders were corning the son of the pyaray was the ship nearest to the entrance and it would be the first to move out but only when the last of the southlanders ships had passed them admiral magum colim bent and extinguished the lantern then quickly quietly he descended to inform his crew of the raiders coming not long before yyrkoon had used his sorcery to summon a peculiar mist which hid the golden barges from view but through which those on the melnibonean ships could peer now elric saw torches burning in the channel ahead as carefully the reavers negotiated the maze within the space of a few minutes ten of the galleys had passed the grotto admiral magum colim rejoined elric on the bridge and now prince yyrkoon was with him yyrkoon too wore a dragon helm though less magnificent than elrics for elric was chief of the few surviving dragon princes of melnibone yyrkoon was grinning through the gloom and his eyes gleamed in anticipation of the bloodletting to come elric wished that prince yyrkoon had chosen another ship than this but it was yyrkoons right to be aboard the flagship and he could not deny it now half the hundred vessels had gone past yyrkoons armour creaked as impatiently he waited pacing the bridge his gauntletted hand on the hilt of his broadsword soon he kept saying to himself soon and then their anchor was groaning upwards and their oars were plunging into the water as the last southland ship went by and they shot from the grotto into the channel ramming the enemy galley amidships and smashing it in two a great yell went up from the barbarian crew men were flung in all directions torches danced erratically on the remains of the deck as men tried to save themselves from slipping into the dark chill waters of the channel a few brave spears rattled against the sides of the melnibonean flaggalley as it began to turn amongst the debris it had created but imrryrian archers returned the shots and the few survivors went down the sound of this swift conflict was the signal to the other battlebarges in perfect order they came from both sides of the high rock walls and it must have seemed to the astonished barbarians that the great golden ships had actually emerged from solid stoneghost ships filled with demons who rained spears arrows and brands upon them now the whole of the twisting channel was confusion and a medley of warshouts echoed and boomed and the clash of steel upon steel was like the savage hissing of some monstrous snake and the raiding fleet itself resembled a snake which had been broken into a hundred pieces by the tall implacable golden ships of melnibone these ships seemed almost serene as they moved against their enemies their grappling irons flashing out to catch wooden decks and rails and draw the galleys nearer so that they might be destroyed but the southlanders were brave and they kept their heads after their initial astonishment three of their galleys headed directly for the son of the pyaray recognising it as the flagship fire arrows sailed high and dropped down into the decks which were wooden and not protected by the golden armour starting fires wherever they fell or else bringing blazing death to the men they struck elric raised his shield above his head and two arrows struck it bouncing still flaring to a lower deck he leapt over the rail following the arrows jumping down to the widest and most exposed deck where his warriors were grouping ready to deal with the attacking galleys catapults thudded and balls of blue fire swished through the blackness narrowly missing all three galleys another volley followed and one mass of flame struck the far galleys mast and then burst upon the deck scattering huge flames wherever it touched grapples snaked out and seized the first galley dragging it close and elric was amongst the first to leap down onto the deck rushing forward to where he saw the southland captain dressed all in crude chequered armour a chequered surcoat over that a big sword in both his huge hands bellowing at his men to resist the melnibonean dogs as elric approached the bridge three barbarians armed with curved swords and small oblong shields ran at him their faces were full of fear but there was determination there as well as if they knew they must die but planned to wreak as much destruction as they could before their souls were taken shifting his warboard onto his arm elric took his own broadsword in both hands and charged the sailors knocking one off his feet with the lip of theshield and smashing the collarbone of another the remaining barbarian skipped aside and thrust his curved sword at elrics face elric barely escaped the thrust and the sharp edge of the sword grazed his cheek bringing out a drop or two of blood elric swung the broadsword like a scythe and it bit deep into the barbarians waist almost cutting him in two he struggled for a moment unable to believe that he was dead but then as elric yanked the sword free he closed his eyes and dropped the man who had been struck by elrics shield was staggering to his feet as elric whirled saw him and smashed the broadsword into his skull now the way was clear to the bridge elric began to climb the ladder noting that the captain had seen him and was waiting for him at the top elric raised his shield to take the captains first blow through all the noise he thought he heard the man shouting at him die you whitefaced demon die you have no place in this earth any longer elric was almost diverted from defending himself by these words they rang true to him perhaps he really had no place on the earth perhaps that was why melnibone was slowly collapsing why fewer children were born every year why the dragons themselves were no longer breeding he let the captain strike another blow at the shield then he reached under it and swung at the mans legs but the captain had anticipated the move and jumped backwards this however gave elric time to run up the few remaining steps and stand on the deck facing the captain the mans face was almost as pale as elrics he was sweating and he was panting and his eyes had misery in them as well as a wild fear you should leave us alone elric heard himself saying we offer you no harm barbarian when did melnibone last sail against the young kingdoms you offer us harm by your very presence whiteface there is your sorcery there are your customs and there is your arrogance is that why you came here was your attack motivated by disgust for us or would you help yourselves to our wealth admit it captaingreed brought you to melnibone at least greed is an honest quality an understandable one but you creatures are not human worseyou are not gods though you behave as if you were your day is over and you must be wiped out your city destroyed your sorceries forgotten elric nodded perhaps you are right captain i am right our holy men say so our seers predict your downfall the chaos lords whom you serve will themselves bring about that downfall the chaos lords no longer have any interest in the affairs of melnibone they took away their power nearly a thousand years since elric watched the captain carefully judging the distance between them perhaps that is why our own power waned or perhaps we merely became tired of power be that as it may the captain said wiping his sweating brow your time is over you must be destroyed once and for all and then he groaned for elrics broadsword had come under his chequered breastplate and gone up through his stomach and into his lungs one knee bent one leg stretched behind him elric began to withdraw the long sword looking up into the barbarians face which had now assumed an expression of reconciliation that was unfair whiteface we had barely begun to talk and you cut the conversation short you are most skillful may you writhe forever in the higher hell farewell elric hardly knew why after the captain had fallen face down on the deck he hacked twice at the neck until the head rolled off the body rolled to the side of the bridge and was then kicked over the side so that it sank into the cold deep water and then yyrkoon came up behind elric and he was still grinning you fight fiercely and well my lord emperor that dead man was right right elric glared at his cousin right ayein his assessment of your prowess and chuckling yyrkoon went to supervise his men who were finishing off the few remaining raiders elric did not know why he had refused to hate yyrkoon before but now he did hate yyrkoon at that moment he would gladly have slain him it was as if yyrkoon had looked deeply into elrics soul and expressed contempt for what he had seen there suddenly elric was overwhelmed by an angry misery and he wished with all his heart that he was not a melnibonean that he was not an emperor and that yyrkoon had never been born pursuit a deliberate treachery like haughty leviathans the great golden battlebarges swam through the wreckage of the reaver fleet a few ships burned and a few were still sinking but most had sunk into the unplumbable depths of the channel the burning ships sent strange shadows dancing against the dank walls of the seacaverns as if the ghosts of the slain offered a last salute before departing to the seadepths where it was said a chaos king still ruled crewing his eerie fleets with the souls of all who died in conflict upon the oceans of the world or perhaps they went to a gentler doom serving straasha lord of the water elementals who ruled the upper reaches of the sea but a few had escaped somehow the southland sailors had got past the massive battlebarges sailed back through the channel and must even now have reached the open sea this was reported to the flagship where elric magum colim and prince yyrkoon now stood together again on the bridge surveying the destruction they had wreaked then we must pursue them and finish them said yyrkoon he was sweating and his dark face glistened his eyes were alight with fever we must follow them elric shrugged he was weak he had brought no extra drugs with him to replenish his strength he wished to go back to imrryr and rest he was tired of bloodletting tired of yyrkoon and tired most of all of himself the hatred he felt for his cousin was draining him still furtherand he hated the hatred that was the worst part no he said let them go let them go unpunished come now my lord king that is not our way prince yyrkoon turned to the aging admiral is that our way admiral magum colim magum colim shrugged he too was tired but privately he agreed with prince yyrkoon an enemy of melnibone should be punished for daring even to think of attacking the dreaming city yet he said the emperor must decide let them go said elric again he leant heavily against the rail let them carry the news back to their own barbarian land let them say how the dragon princes defeated them the news will spread i believe we shall not be troubled by raiders again for some time the young kingdoms are full of fools yyrkoon replied they will not believe the news there will always be raiders the best way to warn them will be to make sure that not one southlander remains alive or uncaptured elric drew a deep breath and tried to fight the faintness which threatened to overwhelm him prince yyrkoon you are trying my patience but my emperor i think only of the good of melnibone surely you do not want your people to say that you are weak that you fear a fight with but five southland galleys this time elrics anger brought him strength who will say that elric is weak will it be you yyrkoon he knew that his next statement was senseless but there was nothing he could do to stop it very well let us pursue these poor little boats and sink them and let us make haste i am weary of it all there was a mysterious light in yyrkoons eyes as he turned away to relay the orders the sky was turning from black to grey when the melnibonean fleet reached the open sea and turned its prows south towards the boiling sea and the southern continent beyond the barbarian ships would not sail through the boiling seano mortal ship could do that it was saidbut would sail around it not that the barbarian ships would even reach the edges of the boiling sea for the huge battlebarges were fastsailing vessels the slaves who pulled the oars were full of a drug which increased their speed and their strength for a score or so of hours before it slew them and now the sails billowed out catching the breeze golden mountains skimming rapidly over the sea these ships their method of construction was a secret lost even to the melniboneans it was easy to imagine how men of the young kingdoms hated melnibone and its inventions for it did seem that the battlebarges belonged to an older alien age as they bore down upon the fleeing galleys now sighted on the horizon the son of the pyaray was in the lead of the rest of the fleet and was priming its catapults well before any of its fellows had seen the enemy perspiring slaves gingerly manhandled the viscous stuff of the fireballs getting them into the bronze cups of the catapults by means of long spoonended tongs it flickered in the predawn gloom now slaves climbed the steps to the bridge and brought wine and food on platinum platters for the three dragon princes who had remained there since the pursuit had begun elric could not summon the strength to eat but he seized a tall cup of yellow wine and drained it the stuff was strong and revived him a trifle he had another cup poured and drank that as swiftly as the other he peered ahead it was almost dawn there was a line of purple light on the horizon at the first sign of the suns disc elric said let loose the fireballs i will give the order said magum colim wiping his lips and putting down the meat bone on which he had been chewing he left the bridge elric heard his feet striking the steps heavily all at once the albino felt surrounded by enemies there had been something strange in magum colims manner during the argument with prince yyrkoon elric tried to shake off such foolish thoughts but the weariness the selfdoubt the open mockery of his cousin all succeeded in increasing the feeling that he was alone and without friends in the world even cymoril and dyvim tvar were finally melniboneans and could not understand the peculiar concerns which moved him and dictated his actions perhaps it would be wise to renounce everything melnibonean and wander the world as an anonymous soldier of fortune serving whoever needed his aid the dull red semicircle of the sun showed above the black line of the distant water there came a series of booming sounds from the forward decks of the flagship as the catapults released their fiery shot there was a whistling scream fading away and it seemed that a dozen meteors leapt through the sky hurtling towards the five galleys which were now little more than thirty shiplengths away elric saw two galleys flare but the remaining three began to sail a zigzag course and avoided the fireballs which landed on the water and burned fitfully for a while before sinking into the depths more fireballs were prepared and elric heard yyrkoon shout from the other side of the bridge ordering the slaves to greater exertions then the fleeing vessels changed their tactics evidently realising that they could not save themselves for long and spreading out sailed towards the son of the pyaray just as the other ships had done in the seamaze it was not merely their courage that elric admired but their manoeuvring skill and the speed at which they had arrived at this logical if hopeless decision the sun was behind the southland ships as they turned three brave silhouettes drew nearer to the melnibonean flagship as scarlet stained the sea as if in anticipation of the bloodletting to come another volley of fireballs was flung from the flagship and the leading galley tried to tack round and avoid it but two of the fiery globes spattered directly on its deck and soon the whole ship was alive with flame burning men leapt into the water burning men shot arrows at the flagship burning men fell slowly from their positions in the rigging the burning men died but the burning ship came on someone had lashed the steering arm and directed the galley at the son of the pyaray it crashed into the golden side of the battlebarge and some of the fire splashed on the deck where the main catapults were in position a cauldron containing the firestuff caught and immediately men were running from all quarters of the ship to try to douse the flame elric grinned as he saw what the barbarians had done perhaps that ship had deliberately allowed itself to be fired now the majority of the flagships complement was engaged with putting out the blazewhile the southland ships drew alongside threw up their own grapples and began to board ware boarders elric shouted long after he might have warned his crew barbarians attack he saw yyrkoon whirl round see the situation and rush down the steps from the bridge you stay there my lord king he flung at elric as he disappeared you are plainly too weary to fight and elric summoned all that was left of his strength and stumbled after his cousin to help in the defense of the ship the barbarians were not fighting for their livesthey knew those to be taken already they were fighting for their pride they wanted to take one melnibonean ship down with them and that ship must be the flagship itself it was hard to be contemptuous of such men they knew that even if they took the flagship the other ships of the golden fleet would soon overwhelm them but the other ships were still some distance away many lives would be lost before they reached the flagship on the lowest deck elric found himself facing a pair of tall barbarians each armed with a curved blade and a small oblong shield he lunged forward but his armour seemed to drag at his limbs his own shield and sword were so heavy that he could barely lift them two swords struck his helm almost simultaneously he lunged back and caught a man in the arm rammed the other with his shield a curved blade clanged on his backplate and he all but lost his footing there was choking smoke everywhere and heat and the tumult of battle desperately he swung about him and felt his broadsword bite deep into flesh one of his opponents fell gurgling with blood spouting from his mouth and nose the other lunged elric stepped backwards fell over the corpse of the man he had slain and went down his broadsword held out before him in one hand and as the triumphant barbarian leapt forward to finish the albino elric caught him on the point of the broadsword running him through the dead man fell towards elric who did not feel the impact for he had already fainted not for the first time had his deficient blood no longer enriched by drugs betrayed him he tasted salt and thought at first it was blood but it was sea water a wave had risen over the deck and momentarily revived him he struggled to crawl from under the dead man and then he heard a voice he recognised he twisted his head and looked up prince yyrkoon stood there he was grinning he was full of glee at elrics plight black oily smoke still drifted everywhere but the sounds of the fight had died areare we victorious cousin elric spoke painfully aye the barbarians are all dead now we are about to sail for imrryr elric was relieved he would begin to die soon if he could not get to his store of potions his relief must have been evident for yyrkoon laughed it is as well the battle did not last longer my lord or we should have been without our leader help me up cousin elric hated to ask prince yyrkoon any favour but he had no choice he stretched out his empty hand i am fit enough to inspect the ship yyrkoon came forward as if to take the hand but then he hesitated still grinning but my lord i disagree you will be dead by the time this ship turns eastward again nonsense even without the drugs i can live for a considerable time though movement is difficult help me up yyrkoon i command you you cannot command me elric i am emperor now you see be wary cousin i can overlook such treachery but others will not i shall be forced to yyrkoon swung his legs over elrics body and went to the rail here were bolts which fixed one section of the rail in place when it was not used for the gangplank yyrkoon slowly released the bolts and kicked the section of rail into the water now elrics efforts to free himself became more desperate but he could hardly move at all yyrkoon on the other hand seemed possessed of unnatural strength he bent and easily flung the corpse away from elric yyrkoon said elric this is unwise of you i was never a cautious man cousin as well as you know yyrkoon placed a booted foot against elrics ribs and began to shove elric slid towards the gap in the rail he could see the black sea heaving below farewell elric now a true melnibonean shall sit upon the ruby throne and who knows might even make cymoril his queen it has not been unheard of and elric felt himself rolling felt himself fall felt himself strike the water felt his armour pulling him below the surface and yyrkoons last words drummed in elrics ears like the persistent booming of the waves against the sides of the golden battlebarge book two less certain of himself or his destiny than ever the albino king must perforce bring his powers of sorcery into play conscious that he has embarked upon a course of action by no means at one with his original conception of the way he wished to live his life and now matters must be settled he must begin to rule he must become cruel but even in this he will find himself thwarted the caverns of the sea king elric sank rapidly desperately trying to keep the last of his breath in his body he had no strength to swim and the weight of the armour denied any hope of his rising to the surface and being sighted by magum colim or one of the others still loyal to him the roaring in his ears gradually faded to a whisper so that it sounded as if little voices were speaking to him the voices of the water elementals with whom in his youth he had had a kind of friendship and the pain in his lungs faded the red mist cleared from his eyes and he thought he saw the face of his father sadric of cymoril and fleetingly of yyrkoon stupid yyrkoon for all that he prided himself that he was a melnibonean he lacked the melnibonean subtlety he was as brutal and direct as some of the young kingdom barbarians he so much despised and now elric began to feel almost grateful to his cousin his life was over the conflicts which tore his mind would no longer trouble him his fears his torments his loves and his hatreds all lay in the past and only oblivion lay before him as the last of his breath left his body he gave himself wholly to the sea to straasha lord of all the water elementals once the comrade of the melnibonean folk and as he did this he remembered the old spell which his ancestors had used to summon straasha the spell came unbidden into his dying brain waters of the sea thou gave us birth and were our milk and mother both in days when skies were overcast you who were first shall be the last searulers fathers of our blood thine aid is sought thine aid is sought your salt is blood our blood your salt your blood the blood of man straasha eternal king eternal sea thine aid is sought by me for enemies of thine and mine seek to defeat our destiny and drain away our sea either the words had an old symbolic meaning or they referred to some incident in melnibonean history which even elric had not read about the words meant very little to him and yet they continued to repeat themselves as his body sank deeper and deeper into the green waters even when blackness overwhelmed him and his lungs filled with water the words continued to whisper through the corridors of his brain it was strange that he should be dead and still hear the incantation it seemed a long while later that his eyes opened and revealed swirling water and through it huge indistinct figures gliding towards him death it appeared took a long time to come and while he died he dreamed the leading figure had a turquoise beard and hair pale green skin that seemed made of the sea itself and when he spoke a voice that was like a rushing tide he smiled at elric straasha answers thy summons mortal our destinies are bound together how may i aid thee and in aiding thee aid myself elrics mouth was filled with water and yet he still seemed capable of speech he said king straasha the paintings in the tower of darputnain the library when i was a boy i saw them king straasha the seaking stretched out his seagreen hands aye you sent the summons you need our aid we honour our ancient pact with your folk no i did not mean to summon you the summons came unbidden to my dying mind i am happy to drown king straasha that cannot be if your mind summoned us it means you wish to live we will aid you king straashas beard streamed in the tide and his deep green eyes were gentle almost tender as they regarded the albino elric closed his own eyes again i dream he said i deceive myself with fantasies of hope he felt the water in his lungs and he knew he no longer breathed it stood to reason therefore that he was dead but if you were real old friend and you wished to aid me you would return me to melnibone so that i might deal with the usurper yyrkoon and save cymoril before it is too late that is my only regretthe torment which cymoril will suffer if her brother becomes emperor of melnibone is that all you ask of the water elementals king straasha seemed almost disappointed i do not even ask that of you i only voice what i would have wished had this been reality and i was speaking which i know is impossible now i shall die that cannot be lord elric for our destinies are truly intertwined and i know that it is not yet your destiny to perish therefore i will aid you as you have suggested elric was surprised at the sharpness of detail of this fantasy he said to himself what a cruel torment i subject myself to now i must set about admitting my death you cannot die not yet now it was as if the seakings gentle hands had picked him up and bore him through twisting corridors of a delicate coral pink texture slightly shadowed no longer in water and elric felt the water vanish from his lungs and stomach and he breathed could it be that he had actually been brought to the legendary plane of the elemental folka plane which intersected that of the earth and in which they dwelled for the most part in a huge circular cavern which shone with pink and blue motherofpearl they came to rest at last the seaking laid elric down upon the floor of the cavern which seemed to be covered with fine white sand which was yet not sand for it yielded and then sprang back when he moved when king straasha moved it was with a sound like the tide drawing itself back over shingle the seaking crossed the white sand walking towards a large throne of milky jade he seated himself upon this throne and placed his green head on his green fist regarding elric with puzzled yet compassionate eyes elric was still physically weak but he could breathe it was as if the sea water had filled him and then cleansed him when it was driven out he felt clearheaded and now he was much less sure that he dreamed i still find it hard to know why you saved me king straasha he murmured from where he lay on the sand the rune we heard it on this plane and we came that is all aye but there is more to sorceryworking than that there are chants symbols rituals of all sorts previously that has always been true perhaps the rituals take the place of urgent need of the kind which sent out your summons to us though you say you wished to die it was evident you did not really want to die or the summoning would not have been so clear and have reached us so swiftly forget all this now when you have rested we shall do what you have requested of us painfully elric raised himself into a sitting position you spoke earlier of intertwined destinies do you then know something of my destiny a little i think our world grows old once the elementals were powerful on your plane and the people of melnibone all shared that power but now our power wanes as does yours something is changing there are intimations that the lords of the higher worlds are again taking an interest in your world perhaps they fear that the folk of the young kingdoms have forgotten them perhaps the folk of the young kingdoms threaten to bring in a new age where gods and beings such as myself no longer shall have a place i suspect there is a certain unease upon the planes of the higher worlds you know no more king straasha raised his head and looked directly into elrics eyes there is no more i can tell you son of my old friends save that you would be happier if you gave yourself up entirely to your destiny when you understand it elric sighed i think i know of what you speak king straasha i shall try to follow your advice and now that you have rested it is time to return the seaking rose from his throne of milky jade and flowed towards elric lifting him up in strong green arms we shall meet again before your life ends elric i hope that i shall be able to aid you once more and remember that our brothers of the air and of fire will try to aid you also and remember the beaststhey too can be of service to you there is no need to suspect their help but beware of gods elric beware of the lords of the higher worlds and remember that their aid and their gifts must always be paid for these were the last words elric heard the seaking speak before they rushed again through the sinuous tunnels of this other plane moving at such a speed that elric could distinguish no details and at times did not know whether they remained in king straashas kingdom or had returned to the depths of his own worlds sea a new emperor and an emperor renewed strange clouds filled the sky and the sun hung heavy and huge and red behind them and the ocean was black as the golden galleys swept homeward before their battered flagship the son of the pyaray which moved slowly with dead slaves at her oars and her tattered sails limp at their masts and smokebegrimed men on her decks and a new emperor upon her warwrecked bridge the new emperor was the only jubilant man in the fleet and he was jubilant indeed it was his banner now not elrics which took pride of place on the flagmast for he had lost no time in proclaiming elric slain and himself ruler of melnibone to yyrkoon the peculiar sky was an omen of change of a return to the old ways and the old power of the dragon isle when he issued orders his voice was a veritable croon of pleasure and admiral magum colim who had ever been wary of elric but who now had to obey yyrkoons orders wondered if perhaps it would not have been preferable to have dealt with yyrkoon in the manner in which yyrkoon had dealt with elric dyvim tvar leaned on the rail of his own ship terhalis particular satisfaction and he also paid attention to the sky though he saw omens of doom for he mourned for elric and considered how he might take vengeance on prince yyrkoon should it emerge that yyrkoon had murdered his cousin for possession of the ruby throne melnibone appeared on the horizon a brooding silhouette of crags a dark monster squatting in the sea calling her own back to the heated pleasures of her womb the dreaming city of imrryr the great cliffs loomed the central gate to the seamaze opened water slapped and gasped as the golden prows disturbed it and the golden ships were swallowed into the murky dankness of the tunnels where bits of wreckage still floated from the previous nights encounter where white bloated corpses could still be seen when the brandlight touch them the prows nosed arrogantly through the remains of their prey but there was no joy aboard the golden battlebarges for they brought news of their old emperors death in battle next night and for seven nights in all the wild dance of melnibone would fill the streets potions and petty spells would ensure that no one slept for sleep was forbidden to any melnibonean old or young while a dead emperor was mourned naked the dragon princes would prowl the city taking any young woman they found and filling her with their seed for it was traditional that if an emperor died then the nobles of melnibone must create as many children of aristocratic blood as was possible musicslaves would howl from the top of every tower other slaves would be slain and some eaten it was a dreadful dance the dance of misery and it took as many lives as it created a tower would be pulled down and a new one erected during those seven days and the tower would be called for elric viii the albino emperor slain upon the sea defending melnibone against the southland pirates slain upon the sea and his body taken by the waves that was not a good portent for it meant that elric had gone to serve pyaray the tentacled whisperer of impossible secrets the chaos lord who commanded the chaos fleetdead ships dead sailors forever in his thralland it was not fitting that such a fate should befall one of the royal line of melnibone ah but the mourning would be long thought dyvim tvar he had loved elric for all that he had sometimes disapproved of his methods of ruling the dragon isle secretly he would go to the dragon caves that night and spend the period of mourning with the sleeping dragons who now that elric was dead were all he had left to love and dyvim tvar then thought of cymoril awaiting elrics return the ships began to emerge into the halflight of the evening torches and braziers already burned on the quays of imrryr which were deserted save for a small group of figures who stood around a chariot which had been driven out to the end of the central mole a cold wind blew dyvim tvar knew that it was the princess cymoril who waited with her guards for the fleet though the flagship was the last to pass through the maze the rest of the ships had to wait until it could be towed into position and dock first if this had not been the required tradition dyvim tvar would have left his ship and gone to speak to cymoril escort her from the quay and tell her what he knew of the circumstances of elrics death but it was impossible even before terhalis particular satisfaction had dropped anchor the main gangplank of the son of the pyaray had been lowered and the emperor yyrkoon all swaggering pride had stepped down it his arms raised in triumphant salute to his sister who could be seen even now searching the decks of the ships for a sign of her beloved albino suddenly cymoril knew that elric was dead and she suspected that yyrkoon had in some way been responsible for elrics death either yyrkoon had allowed elric to be borne down by a group of southland reavers or else he had managed to slay elric himself she knew her brother and she recognised his expression he was pleased with himself as he always had been when successful in some form of treachery or another anger flashed in her tearfilled eyes and she threw back her head and shouted at the shifting ominous sky oh yyrkoon has destroyed him her guards were startled the captain spoke solicitously madam he is deadand that brother slew him take prince yyrkoon captain kill prince yyrkoon captain unhappily the captain put his right hand on the hilt of his sword a young warrior more impetuous drew his blade murmuring i will slay him princess if that is your desire the young warrior loved cymoril with considerable and unthinking intensity the captain offered the warrior a cautionary glance but the warrior was blind to it now two others slid swords from scabbards as yyrkoon a red cloak wound about him his dragon crest catching the light from the brands guttering in the wind stalked forward and cried yyrkoon is emperor now no shrieked yyrkoons sister elric elric where are you serving his new master pyaray of chaos his dead hands pull at the sweep of a chaos ship sister his dead eyes see nothing at all his dead ears hear only the crack of pyarays whips and his dead flesh cringes feeling nought but that unearthly scourge elric sank in his armour to the bottom of the sea murderer traitor cymoril began to sob the captain who was a practical man said to his warriors in a low voice sheath your weapons and salute your new emperor only the young guardsman who loved cymoril disobeyed but he slew the emperor my lady cymoril said so what of it he is emperor now kneel or youll be dead within the minute the young warrior gave a wild shout and leapt towards yyrkoon who stepped back trying to free his arms from the folds of his cloak he had not expected this but it was the captain who leapt forward his own sword drawn and hacked down the youngster so that he gasped halfturned then fell at yyrkoons feet this demonstration of the captains was confirmation of his real power and yyrkoon almost smirked with satisfaction as he looked down at the corpse the captain fell to one knee the bloody sword still in his hand my emperor he said you show a proper loyalty captain my loyalty is to the ruby throne quite so cymoril shook with grief and rage but her rage was impotent she knew now that she had no friends leering the emperor yyrkoon presented himself before her he reached out his hand and he caressed her neck her cheek her mouth he let his hand fall so that it grazed her breast sister he said thou art mine entirely now and cymoril was the second to fall at his feet for she had fainted pick her up yyrkoon said to the guard take her back to her own tower and there be sure she remains two guards will be with her at all times in even her most private moments they must observe her for she may plan treachery against the ruby throne the captain bowed and signed to his men to obey the emperor aye my lord it shall be done yyrkoon looked back at the corpse of the young warrior and feed that to her slaves tonight so that he can continue serving her he smiled the captain smiled too appreciating the joke he felt it was good to have a proper emperor in melnibone again an emperor who knew how to behave who knew how to treat his enemies and who accepted unswerving loyalty as his right the captain fancied that fine martial times lay ahead for melnibone the golden battlebarges and the warriors of imrryr could go aspoiling again and instil in the barbarians of the young kingdoms a sweet and satisfactory sense of fear already in his mind the captain helped himself to the treasures of lormyr argimiliar and pikarayd of ilmiora and jadmar he might even be made governor say of the isle of the purple towns what luxuries of torment would he bring to those upstart sealords particularly count smiorgan baldhead who was even now beginning to try to make the isle a rival to melnibone as a trading port as he escorted the limp body of the princess cymoril back to her tower the captain looked on that body and felt the swellings of lust within him yyrkoon would reward his loyalty there was no doubt of that despite the cold wind the captain began to sweat in his anticipation he himself would guard the princess cymoril he would relish it marching at the head of his army yyrkoon strutted for the tower of darputna the tower of emperors and the ruby throne within he preferred to ignore the litter which had been brought for him and to go on foot so that he might savour every small moment of his triumph he approached the tower tall among its fellows at the very centre of imrryr as he might approach a beloved woman he approached it with a sense of delicacy and without haste for he knew that it was his he looked about him his army marched behind him magum colim and dyvim tvar led the army people lined the twisting streets and bowed low to him slaves prostrated themselves even the beasts of burden were made to kneel as he strode by yyrkoon could almost taste the power as one might taste a luscious fruit he drew deep breaths of the air even the air was his all imrryr was his all melnibone soon would all the world be his and he would squander it all how he would squander it such a grand terror would he bring back to the earth such a munificence of fear in ecstasy almost blindly did the emperor yyrkoon enter the tower he hesitated at the great doors of the throne room he signed for the doors to be opened and as they opened he deliberately took in the scene tiny bit by tiny bit the walls the banners the trophies the galleries all were his the throne room was empty now but soon he would fill it with colour and celebration and true melnibonean entertainments it had been too long since blood had sweetened the air of this hall now he let his eyes linger upon the steps leading up to the ruby throne itself but before he looked at the throne he heard dyvim tvar gasp behind him and his gaze went suddenly to the ruby throne and his jaw slackened at what he saw his eyes widened in incredulity an illusion an apparition said dyvim tvar with some satisfaction heresy cried the emperor yyrkoon staggering forward finger pointing at the robed and cowled figure which sat so still upon the ruby throne mine mine the figure made no reply mine begone the throne belongs to yyrkoon yyrkoon is emperor now what are you why would you thwart me thus the cowl fell back and a bonewhite face was revealed surrounded by flowing milkwhite hair crimson eyes looked coolly down at the shrieking stumbling thing which came towards them you are dead elric i know that you are dead the apparition made no reply but a thin smile touched the white lips you could not have survived you drowned you cannot come back pyaray owns your soul there are others who rule in the sea said the figure on the ruby throne why did you slay me cousin yyrkoons guile had deserted him making way for terror and confusion because it is my right to rule because you were not strong enough nor cruel enough nor humorous enough is this not a good joke cousin begone begone begone i shall not be ousted by a spectre a dead emperor cannot rule melnibone we shall see said elric signing to dyvim tvar and his soldiers a traditional justice now indeed i shall rule as you would have had me rule cousin elric watched as dyvim tvars soldiers surrounded the wouldbe usurper and seized his arms relieving him of his weapons yyrkoon panted like a captured wolf he glared around him as if hoping to find support from the assembled warriors but they stared back at him either neutrally or with open contempt and you prince yyrkoon will be the first to benefit from this new rule of mine are you pleased yyrkoon lowered his head he was trembling now elric laughed speak up cousin may arioch and all the dukes of hell torment you for eternity growled yyrkoon he flung back his head his wild eyes rolling his lips curling arioch arioch curse this feeble albino arioch destroy him or see melnibone fall elric continued to laugh arioch does not hear you chaos is weak upon the earth now it needs a greater sorcery than yours to bring the chaos lords back to aid you as they aided our ancestors and now yyrkoon tell mewhere is the lady cymoril but yyrkoon had lapsed again into a sullen silence she is at her own tower my emperor said magum colim a creature of yyrkoons took her there said dyvim tvar the captain of cymorils own guard he slew a warrior who tried to defend his mistress against yyrkoon it could be that princess cymoril is in danger my lord then go quickly to the tower take a force of men bring both cymoril and the captain of her guard to me and yyrkoon my lord asked dyvim tvar let him remain here until his sister returns dyvim tvar bowed and selecting a body of warriors left the throne room all noticed that dyvim tvars step was lighter and his expression less grim than when he had first approached the throne room at prince yyrkoons back yyrkoon straightened his head and looked about the court for a moment he seemed like a pathetic and bewildered child all the lines of hate and anger had disappeared and elric felt sympathy for his cousin growing again within him but this time elric quelled the feeling be grateful cousin that for a few hours you were totally powerful that you enjoyed domination over all the folk of melnibone yyrkoon said in a small puzzled voice how did you escape you had no time for making a sorcery no strength for it you could barely move your limbs and your armour must have dragged you deep to the bottom of the sea so that you should have drowned it is unfair elric you should have drowned elric shrugged i have friends in the sea they recognise my royal blood and my right to rule if you do not yyrkoon tried to disguise the astonishment he felt evidently his respect for elric had increased as had his hatred for the albino emperor friends aye said elric with a thin grin ii thought too you had vowed not to use your powers of sorcery but you thought that a vow which was unbefitting for a melnibonean monarch to make did you not well i agree with you you see yyrkoon you have won a victory after all yyrkoon stared narrowly at elric as if trying to divine a secret meaning behind elrics words you will bring back the chaos lords no sorcerer however powerful can summon the chaos lords or for that matter the lords of law if they do not wish to be summoned that you know you must know it yyrkoon have you not yourself tried and arioch did not come did he did he bring you the gift you soughtthe gift of the two black swords you know that i did not i guessed now i know yyrkoon tried to speak but his voice would not form words so angry was he instead a strangled growl escaped his throat and for a few moments he struggled in the grip of his guards dyvim tvar returned with cymoril the girl was pale but she was smiling she ran into the throne room elric cymoril are you harmed cymoril glanced at the crestfallen captain of her guard who had been brought with her a look of disgust crossed her fine face then she shook her head no i am not harmed the captain of cymorils guard was shaking with terror he looked pleadingly at yyrkoon as if hoping that his fellow prisoner could help him but yyrkoon continued to stare at the floor have that one brought closer elric pointed at the captain of the guard the man was dragged to the foot of the steps leading to the ruby throne he moaned what a petty traitor you are said elric at least yyrkoon had the courage to attempt to slay me and his ambitions were high your ambition was merely to become one of his pet curs so you betrayed your mistress and slew one of your own men what is your name the man had difficulty speaking but at last he murmured it is valharik my name what could i do i serve the ruby throne whoever sits upon it so the traitor claims that loyalty motivated him i think not it was my lord it was the captain began to whine he fell to his knees slay me swiftly do not punish me more elrics impulse was to heed the mans request but he looked at yyrkoon and then remembered the expression on cymorils face when she had looked at the guard he knew that he must make a point now whilst making an example of captain valharik so he shook his head no i will punish you more tonight you will die here according to the traditions of melnibone while my nobles feast to celebrate this new era of my rule valharik began to sob then he stopped himself and got slowly to his feet a melnibonean again he bowed low and stepped backward giving himself into the grip of his guards i must consider a way in which your fate may be shared with the one you wished to serve elric went on how did you slay the young warrior who sought to obey cymoril with my sword i cut him down it was a clean stroke but one and what became of the corpse prince yyrkoon told me to feed it to princess cymorils slaves i understand very well prince yyrkoon you may join us at the feast tonight while captain valharik entertains us with his dying yyrkoons face was almost as pale as elrics what do you mean the little pieces of captain valhariks flesh which our doctor jest will carve from his limbs will be the meat on which you feast you may give instructions as to how you wish the captains flesh prepared we should not expect you to eat it raw cousin even dyvim tvar looked astonished at elrics decision certainly it was in the spirit of melnibone and a clever irony improving on prince yyrkoons own idea but it was unlike elric or at least it was unlike the elric he had known up until a day earlier as he heard his fate captain valharik gave a great scream of terror and glared at prince yyrkoon as if the wouldbe usurper were already tasting his flesh yyrkoon tried to turn away his shoulders shaking and that will be the beginning of it said elric the feast will start at midnight until that time confine yyrkoon to his own tower after prince yyrkoon and captain valharik had been led away dyvim tvar and princess cymoril came and stood beside elric who had sunk back in his great throne and was staring bitterly into the middledistance that was a clever cruelty dyvim tvar said cymoril said it is what they both deserve aye murmured elric it is what my father would have done it is what yyrkoon would have done had our positions been reversed i but follow the traditions i no longer pretend that i am my own man here i shall stay until i die trapped upon the ruby throneserving the ruby throne as valharik claimed to serve it could you not kill them both quickly cymoril asked you know that i do not plead for my brother because he is my brother i hate him most of all but it might destroy you elric to follow through with your plan what if it does let me be destroyed let me merely become an unthinking extension of my ancestors the puppet of ghosts and memories dancing to strings which extend back through time for ten thousand years perhaps if you slept dyvim tvar suggested i shall not sleep i feel for many nights after this but your brother is not going to die cymoril after his punishmentafter he has eaten the flesh of captain valhariki intend to send him into exile he will go alone into the young kingdoms and he will not be allowed to take his grimoires with him he must make his way as best he can in the lands of the barbarian that is not too severe a punishment i think it is too lenient said cymoril you would be best advised to slay him send soldiers now give him no time to consider counterplots i do not fear his counterplots elric rose wearily now i should like it if you would both leave me until an hour or so before the feasting begins i must think i will return to my tower and prepare myself for tonight said cymoril she kissed elric lightly upon his pale forehead he looked up filled with love and tenderness for her he reached out and touched her hair and her cheek remember that i love you elric she said i will see that you are safely escorted homeward dyvim tvar said to her and you must choose a new commander of your guard can i assist in that i should be grateful dyvim tvar they left elric still upon the ruby throne still staring into space the hand that he lifted from time to time to his pale head shook a little and now the torment showed in his strange crimson eyes later he rose up from the ruby throne and walked slowly head bowed to his own apartments followed by his guards he hesitated at the door which led onto the steps going up to the library instinctively he sought the consolation and forgetfulness of a certain kind of knowledge but at that moment he suddenly hated his scrolls and his books he blamed them for his ridiculous concerns regarding morality and justice he blamed them for the feelings of guilt and despair which now filled him as a result of his decision to behave as a melnibonean monarch was expected to behave so he passed the door to the library and went on to his apartments but even his apartments displeased him now they were austere they were not furnished according to the luxurious tastes of all melniboneans with their delight in lush mixtures of colour and bizarre design he would have them changed as soon as possible he would give himself up to those ghosts who ruled him for some time he stalked from room to room trying to push back that part of him which demanded he be merciful to valharik and to yyrkoonat very least to slay them and be done with it or better to send them both into exile but it was impossible to reverse his decision now at last he lowered himself to a couch which rested beside a window looking out over the whole of the city the sky was still full of turbulent cloud but now the moon shone through like the yellow eye of an unhealthy beast it seemed to stare with a certain triumphant irony at him as if relishing the defeat of his conscience elric sank his head into his arms later the servants came to tell him that the courtiers were assembling for the celebration feast he allowed them to dress him in his yellow robes of state and to place the dragon crown upon his head and then he returned to the throne room to be greeted by a mighty cheer more wholehearted than any he had ever received before he acknowledged the greeting and then seated himself in the ruby throne looking out over the banqueting tables which now filled the hall a table was brought and set before him and two extra seats were brought for dyvim tvar and cymoril would sit beside him but dyvim tvar and cymoril were not yet here and neither had the renegade valharik been brought and where was yyrkoon they should even now be at the centre of the hallvalharik in chains and yyrkoon seated beneath him doctor jest was there heating his brazier on which rested his cooking pans testing and sharpening his knives the hall was filled with excited talk as the court waited to be entertained already the food was being brought in though no one might eat until the emperor ate first elric signed to the commander of his own guard has the princess cymoril or lord dyvim tvar arrived at the tower yet no my lord cymoril was rarely late and dyvim tvar never elric frowned perhaps they did not relish the entertainment and what of the prisoners they have been sent for my lord doctor jest looked up expectantly his thin body tensed in anticipation and then elric heard a sound above the din of the conversation a groaning sound which seemed to come from all around the tower he bent his head and listened closely others were hearing it now they stopped talking and also listened intently soon the whole hall was in silence and the groaning increased then all at once the doors of the throne room burst open and there was dyvim tvar gasping and bloody his clothes slashed and his flesh gashed and following him in came a mista swirling mist of dark purples and unpleasant blues and it was this mist that groaned elric sprang from his throne and knocked the table aside he leapt down the steps towards his friend the groaning mist began to creep further into the throne room as if reaching out for dyvim tvar elric took his friend in his arms dyvim tvar what is this sorcery dyvim tvars face was full of horror and his lips seemed frozen until at last he said it is yyrkoons sorcery he conjured the groaning mist to aid him in his escape i tried to follow him from the city but the mist engulfed me and i lost my senses i went to his tower to bring him and his accessory here but the sorcery had already been accomplished cymoril where is she he took her elric she is with him valharik is with him and so are a hundred warriors who remained secretly loyal to him then we must pursue him we shall soon capture him you can do nothing against the groaning mist ah it comes and sure enough the mist was beginning to surround them elric tried to disperse it by waving his arms but then it had gathered thickly around him and its melancholy groaning filled his ears its hideous colours blinded his eyes he tried to rush through it but it remained with him and now he thought he heard words amongst the groans elric is weak elric is foolish elric must die stop this he cried he bumped into another body and fell to his knees he began to crawl desperately trying to peer through the mist now faces formed in the mistfrightful faces more terrifying than any he had ever seen even in his worst nightmares cymoril he cried cymoril and one of the faces became the face of cymorila cymoril who leered at him and mocked him and whose face slowly aged until he saw a filthy crone and ultimately a skull on which the flesh rotted he closed his eyes but the image remained cymoril whispered the voices cymoril and elric grew weaker as he became more desperate he cried out for dyvim tvar but heard only a mocking echo of the name as he had heard cymorils he shut his lips and he shut his eyes and still crawling tried to free himself from the groaning mist but hours seemed to pass before the groans became whines and the whines became faint strands of sound and he tried to rise opening his eyes to see the mist fading but then his legs buckled and he fell down against the first step which led to the ruby throne again he had ignored cymorils advice concerning her brotherand again she was in danger elrics last thought was a simple one i am not fit to live he thought to call the chaos lord as soon as he recovered from the blow which had knocked him unconscious and thus wasted even more time elric sent for dyvim tvar he was eager for news but dyvim tvar could report nothing yyrkoon had summoned sorcerous aid to free him sorcerous aid to effect his escape he must have had some magical means of leaving the island for he could not have gone by ship said dyvim tvar you must send out expeditions said elric send a thousand detachments if you must send every man in melnibone strive to wake the dragons that they might be used equip the golden battlebarges cover the world with our men if you must but find cymoril all those things i have already done said dyvim tvar save that i have not yet found cymoril a month passed and imrryrian warriors marched and rode through the young kingdoms seeking news of their renegade countrymen i worried more for myself than for cymoril and i called that morality thought the albino i tested my sensibilities not my conscience a second month passed and imrryrian dragons sailed the skies to south and east west and north but though they flew across mountains and seas and forests and plains and unwittingly brought terror to many a city they found no sign of yyrkoon and his band for finally one can only judge oneself by ones actions thought elric i have looked at what i have done not at what i meant to do or thought i would like to do and what i have done has in the main been foolish destructive and with little point yyrkoon was right to despise me and that was why i hated him so a fourth month came and imrryrian ships stopped in remote ports and imrryrian sailors questioned other travelers and explorers for news of yyrkoon but yyrkoons sorcery had been strong and none had seen him i must now consider the implications of all these thoughts said elric to himself wearily the swiftest of the soldiers began to return to melnibone bearing their useless news and as faith disappeared and hope faded elrics determination increased he made himself strong both physically and mentally he experimented with new drugs which would increase his energy rather than replenish the energy he did not share with other men he read much in the library though this time he read only certain grimoires and he read those over and over again these grimoires were written in the high speech of melnibonethe ancient language of sorcery with which elrics ancestors had been able to communicate with the supernatural beings they had summoned and at last elric was satisfied that he understood them fully though what he read sometimes threatened to stop him in his present course of action and when he was satisfiedfor the dangers of misunderstanding the implications of the things described in the grimoires were catastrophiche slept for three nights in a drugged slumber and then elric was ready he ordered all slaves and servants from his quarters he placed guards at the doors with instructions to admit no one no matter how urgent their business he cleared one great chamber of all furniture so that it was completely empty save for one grimoire which he had placed in the very centre of the room then he seated himself beside the book and began to think when he had meditated for more than five hours elric took a brush and a jar of ink and began to paint both walls and floor with complicated symbols some of which were so intricate that they seemed to disappear at an angle to the surface on which they had been laid at last this was done and elric spreadeagled himself in the very centre of his huge rune face down one hand upon his grimoire the other stretched palm down the moon was full a shaft of its light fell directly upon elrics head turning the hair to silver and then the summoning began elric sent his mind into twisting tunnels of logic across endless plains of ideas through mountains of symbolism and endless universes of alternate truths he sent his mind out further and further and as it went he sent with it the words which issued from his writhing lipswords that few of his contemporaries would understand though their very sound would chill the blood of any listener and his body heaved as he forced it to remain in its original position and from time to time a groan would escape him and through all this a few words came again and again one of these words was a name arioch arioch the patron demon of elrics ancestors one of the most powerful of all the dukes of hell who was called knight of the swords lord of the seven darks lord of the higher hell and many more names besides arioch it was on arioch whom yyrkoon had called asking the lord of chaos to curse elric it was arioch whom yyrkoon had sought to summon to aid him in his attempt upon the ruby throne it was arioch who was known as the keeper of the two black swordsthe swords of unearthly manufacture and infinite power which had once been wielded by emperors of melnibone arioch i summon thee runes both rhythmic and fragmented howled now from elrics throat his brain had reached the plane on which arioch dwelt now it sought arioch himself arioch it is elric of melnibone who summons thee elric glimpsed an eye staring down at him the eye floated joined another the two eyes regarded him arioch my lord of chaos aid me the eyes blinkedand vanished oh arioch come to me come to me aid me and i will serve you a silhouette that was not a human form turned slowly until a black faceless head looked down upon elric a halo of red light gleamed behind the head then that too vanished exhausted elric let the image fade his mind raced back through plane upon plane his lips no longer chanted the runes and the names he lay exhausted upon the floor of his chamber unable to move in silence he was certain that he had failed there was a small sound painfully he raised his weary head a fly had come into the chamber it buzzed about erratically seeming almost to follow the lines of the runes elric had so recently painted the fly settled first upon one rune and then on another it must have come in through the window thought elric he was annoyed by the distraction but still fascinated by it the fly settled on elrics forehead it was a large black fly and its buzz was loud obscene it rubbed its forelegs together and it seemed to be taking a particular interest in elrics face as it moved over it elric shuddered but he did not have the strength to swat it when it came into his field of vision he watched it when it was not visible he felt its legs covering every inch of his face then it flew up and still buzzing loudly hovered a short distance from elrics nose and then elric could see the flys eyes and recognise something in them they were the eyesand yet not the eyeshe had seen on that other plane it began to dawn on him that this fly was no ordinary creature it had features that were in some way faintly human the fly smiled at him from his hoarse throat and through his parched lips elric was able to utter but one word arioch and a beautiful youth stood where the fly had hovered the beautiful youth spoke in a beautiful voicesoft and sympathetic and yet manly he was clad in a robe that was like a liquid jewel and yet which did not dazzle elric for in some way no light seemed to come from it there was a slender sword at the youths belt and he wore no helm but a circlet of red fire his eyes were wise and his eyes were old and when they were looked at closely they could be seen to contain an ancient and confident evil elric that was all the youth said but it revived the albino so that he could raise himself to his knees elric and elric could stand he was filled with energy the youth was taller now than elric he looked down at the emperor of melnibone and he smiled the smile that the fly had smiled you alone are fit to serve arioch it is long since i was invited to this plane but now that i am here i shall aid you elric i shall become your patron i shall protect you and give you strength and the source of strength though master i be and slave you be how must i serve you duke arioch elric asked having made a monstrous effort of selfcontrol for he was filled with terror by the implications of ariochs words you will serve me by serving yourself for the moment later a time will come when i shall call upon you to serve me in specific ways but i ask little of you save that you swear to serve me elric hesitated you must swear that said arioch reasonably or i cannot help you in the matter of your cousin yyrkoon or his sister cymoril i swear to serve you said elric and his body was flooded with ecstatic fire and he trembled with joy and he fell to his knees then i can tell you that from time to time you can call on my aid and i will come if your need is truly desperate i will come in whichever form is appropriate or no form at all if that should prove appropriate and now you may ask me one question before i depart i need the answers to two questions your first question i cannot answer i will not answer you must accept that you have now sworn to serve me i will not tell you what the future holds but you need not fear if you serve me well then my second question is this where is prince yyrkoon prince yyrkoon is in the south in a land of barbarians by sorcery and by superior weapons and intelligence he has effected the conquest of two mean nations one of which is called oin and the other of which is called yu even now he trains the men of oin and the men of yu to march upon melnibone for he knows that your forces are spread thinly across the earth searching for him how has he hidden he has not but he has gained possession of the mirror of memorya magical device whose hiding place he discovered by his sorceries those who look into this mirror have their memories taken the mirror contains a million memories the memories of all who have looked into it thus anyone who ventures into oin or yu or travels by sea to the capital which serves both is confronted by the mirror and forgets that he has seen prince yyrkoon and his imrryrians in those lands it is the best way of remaining undiscovered it is elric drew his brows together therefore it might be wise to consider destroying the mirror but what would happen then i wonder arioch raised his beautiful hand although i have answered further questions which are one could argue part of the same question i will answer no more it could be in your interest to destroy the mirror but it might be better to consider other means of countering its effects for it does i remind you contain many memories some of which have been imprisoned for thousands of years now i must go and you must goto the lands of oin and yu which lie several months journey from here to the south and well beyond lormyr they are best reached by the ship which sails over both land and sea farewell elric and a fly buzzed for a moment upon the wall before vanishing elric rushed from the room shouting for his slaves the ship which sails over land and sea and how many dragons still sleep in the caverns elric paced the gallery overlooking the city it was morning but no sun came through the dull clouds which hung low upon the towers of the dreaming city imrryrs life continued unchanged in the streets below save for the absence of the majority of her soldiers who had not yet returned home from their fruitless quests and would not be home for many months to come dyvim tvar leaned on the parapet of the gallery and stared unseeingly into the streets his face was tired and his arms were folded on his chest as if he sought to contain what was left of his strength two perhaps it would take a great deal to wake them and even then i doubt if theyd be useful to us what is this ship which sails over land and sea which arioch spoke of ive read of it beforein the silver grimoire and in other tomes a magic ship used by a melnibonean hero even before there was melnibone and the empire but where it exists and if it exists i do not know who would know dyvim tvar straightened his back and turned it on the scene below arioch elric shrugged but he would not tell me what of your friends the water elementals have they not promised you aid and would they not be knowledgeable in the matter of ships elric frowned deepening the lines which now marked his face ayestraasha might know but im loath to call on his aid again the water elementals are not the powerful creatures that the lords of chaos are their strength is limited and moreover they are inclined to be capricious in the manner of the elements what is more dyvim tvar i hesitate to use sorcery save where absolutely imperative you are a sorcerer elric you have but lately proved your greatness in that respect involving the most powerful of all sorceries the summoning of a chaos lordand you still hold back i would suggest my lord king that you consider such logic and that you judge it unsound you decided to use sorcery in your pursuit of prince yyrkoon the die is already cast it would be wise to use sorcery now you cannot conceive of the mental and physical effort involved i can conceive of it my lord i am your friend i do not wish to see you painedand yet there is also the difficulty dyvim tvar of my physical weakness elric reminded his friend how long can i continue in the use of these overstrong potions that now sustain me they supply me with energy ayebut they do so by using up my few resources i might die before i find cymoril i stand rebuked but elric came forward and put his white hand on dyvim tvars buttercoloured cloak but what have i to lose eh no you are right i am a coward to hesitate when cymorils life is at stake i repeat my stupiditiesthe stupidities which first brought this pass upon us all ill do it will you come with me to the ocean aye dyvim tvar began to feel the burden of elrics conscience settling upon him also it was a peculiar feeling to come to a melnibonean and dyvim tvar knew very well that he liked it not at all elric had last ridden these paths when he and cymoril were happy it seemed a long age ago he had been a fool to trust that happiness he turned his white stallions head towards the cliffs and the sea beyond them a light rain fell winter was descending swiftly on melnibone they left their horses on the cliffs lest they be disturbed by elrics sorceryworking and clambered down to the shore the rain fell into the sea a mist hung over the water little more than five ship lengths from the beach it was deathly still and with the tall dark cliffs behind them and the wall of mist before them it seemed to dyvim tvar that they had entered a silent netherworld where might easily be encountered the melancholy souls of those who in legend had committed suicide by a process of slow selfmutilation the sound of the two mens boots on shingle was loud and yet was at once muffled by the mist which seemed to suck at noise and swallow it greedily as if it sustained its life on sound now elric murmured he seemed not to notice the brooding and depressive surroundings now i must recall the rune which came so easily unsummoned to my brain not many months since he left dyvim tvars side and went down to the place where the chill water lapped the land and there carefully he seated himself crosslegged his eyes stared unseeingly into the mist to dyvim tvar the tall albino appeared to shrink as he sat down he seemed to become like a vulnerable child and dyvim tvars heart went out to elric as it might go out to a brave nervous boy and dyvim tvar had it in mind to suggest that the sorcery be done with and they seek the lands of oin and yu by ordinary means but elric was already lifting his head as a dog lifts its head to the moon and strange thrilling words began to tumble from his lips and it became plain that even if dyvim tvar did speak now elric would not hear him dyvim tvar was no stranger to the high speechas a melnibonean noble he had been taught it as a matter of coursebut the words seemed nonetheless strange to him for elric used peculiar inflections and emphases giving the words a special and secret weight and chanting them in a voice which ranged from bass groan to falsetto shriek it was not pleasant to listen to such noises coming from a mortal throat and now dyvim tvar had some clear understanding of why elric was reluctant to use sorcery the lord of the dragon caves melnibonean though he was found himself inclined to step backward a pace or two even to retire to the clifftops and watch over elric from there and he had to force himself to hold his ground as the summoning continued for a good space of time the runechanting went on the rain beat harder upon the pebbles of the shore and made them glisten it dashed most ferociously into the still dark sea lashed about the fragile head of the chanting palehaired figure and caused dyvim tvar to shiver and draw his cloak more closely about his shoulders straashastraashastraasha the words mingled with the sound of the rain they were now barely words at all but sounds which the wind might make or a language which the sea might speak straasha again dyvim tvar had the impulse to move but this time he desired to go to elric and tell him to stop to consider some other means of reaching the lands of oin and yu straasha there was a cryptic agony in the shout straasha elrics name formed on dyvim tvars lips but he found that he could not speak it straasha the crosslegged figure swayed the word became the calling of the wind through the caverns of time straasha it was plain to dyvim tvar that the rune was for some reason not working and that elric was using up all his strength to no effect and yet there was nothing the lord of the dragon caves could do his tongue was frozen his feet seemed frozen his feet seemed frozen to the ground he looked at the mist had it crept closer to the shore had it taken on a strange almost luminous green tinge he peered closely there was a massive disturbance of the water the sea rushed up the beach the shingle crackled the mist retreated vague lights flickered in the air and dyvim tvar thought he saw the shining silhouette of a gigantic figure emerging from the sea and he realised that elrics chant had ceased king straasha elric was saying in something approaching his normal tone you have come i thank you the silhouette spoke and the voice reminded dyvim tvar of slow heavy waves rolling beneath a friendly sun we elementals are concerned elric for there are rumours that you have invited chaos lords back to your plane and the elementals have never loved the lords of chaos yet i know that if you have done this it is because you are fated to do it and therefore we hold no enmity against you the decision was forced upon me king straasha there was no other decision i could make if you are therefore reluctant to aid me i shall understand that and call on you no more i will help you though helping you is harder now not for what happens in the immediate future but what is hinted will happen in years to come now you must tell me quickly how we of the water can be of service to you do you know ought of the ship which sails over land and sea i need to find that ship if i am to fulfil my vow to find my love cymoril i know much of that ship for it is mine grome also lays claim to it but it is mine fairly it is mine grome of the earth grome of the land below the roots grome of the ground and all that lives under it my brother grome long since even as we elementals count time grome and i built that ship so that we could travel between the realms of earth and water whenever we chose but we quarrelled and we fought there were earthquakes tidal waves volcanic eruptions typhoons and battles in which all the elementals joined with the result that new continents were flung up and old ones drowned it was not the first time we had fought each other but it was the last and finally lest we destroy each other completely we made a peace i gave grome part of my domain and he gave me the ship which sails over land and sea but he gave it somewhat unwillingly and thus it sails the sea better than it sails the land for grome thwarts its progress whenever he can still if the ship is of use to you you shall have it i thank you king straasha where shall i find it it will come and now i grow weary for the further from my own realm i venture the harder it is to sustain my mortal form farewell elricand be cautious you have a greater power than you know and many would make use of it to their own ends shall i wait here for the ship which sails over land and sea no the sea kings voice was fading as his form faded grey mist drifted back where the silhouette and the green lights had been the sea again was still wait wait in your tower it will come a few wavelets lapped the shore and then it was as if the king of the water elementals had never been there at all dyvim tvar rubbed his eyes slowly at first he began to move to where elric still sat gently he bent down and offered the albino his hand elric looked up in some surprise ah dyvim tvar how much time has passed some hours elric it will soon be night what little light there is begins to wane we had best ride back for imrryr stiffly elric rose to his feet with dyvim tvars assistance aye he murmured absently the sea king said i heard the sea king elric i heard his advice and i heard his warning you must remember to heed both i like too little the sound of this magic boat like most things of sorcerous origin the ship appears to have vices as well as virtues like a doublebladed knife which you raise to stab your enemy and which instead stabs you that must be expected where sorcery is concerned it was you who urged me on my friend aye said dyvim tvar almost to himself as he led the way up the cliffpath towards the horses aye i have not forgotten that my lord king elric smiled wanly and touched dyvim tvars arm worry not the summoning is over and now we have the vessel we need to take us swiftly to prince yyrkoon and the lands of oin and yu let us hope so dyvim tvar was privately sceptical about the benefits they would gain from the ship which sails over land and sea they reached the horses and he began to wipe the water off the flanks of his own roan i regret he said that we have once again allowed the dragons to expend their energy on a useless endeavour with a squadron of my beasts we could do much against prince yyrkoon and it would be fine and wild my friend to ride the skies again side by side as we used to when all this is done and princess cymoril brought home we shall do that said elric hauling himself wearily into the saddle of his white stallion you shall blow the dragon horn and our dragon brothers will hear it and you and i shall sing the song of the dragon masters and our goads shall flash as we straddle flamefang and his mate sweetclaw ah that will be like the days of old melnibone when we no longer equate freedom with power but let the young kingdoms go their own way and be certain that they let us go ours dyvim tvar pulled on his horses reins his brow was clouded let us pray that day will come my lord but i cannot help this nagging thought which tells me that imrryrs days are numbered and that my own life nears its close nonsense dyvim tvar youll survive me theres little doubt of that though you be my elder dyvim tvar said as they galloped back through the closing day i have two sons did you know that elric you have never mentioned them they are by old mistresses i am happy for you they are fine melniboneans why do you mention this dyvim tvar elric tried to read his friends expression it is that i love them and would have them enjoy the pleasures of the dragon isle and why should they not i do not know dyvim tvar looked hard at elric i could suggest that it is your responsibility the fate of my sons elric mine it seems to me from what i gathered from the water elementals words that your decisions could decide the fate of the dragon isle i ask you to remember my sons elric i shall dyvim tvar i am certain they shall grow into superb dragon masters and that one of them shall succeed you as lord of the dragon caves i think you miss my meaning my lord emperor and elric looked solemnly at his friend and shook his head i do not miss your meaning old friend but i think you judge me harshly if you fear ill do ought to threaten melnibone and all she is forgive me then dyvim tvar lowered his head but the expression in his eyes did not change in imrryr they changed their clothes and drank hot wine and had spiced food brought elric for all his weariness was in better spirits than he had been for many a month and yet there was still a tinge of something behind his surface mood which suggested he encouraged himself to speak gaily and put vitality into his movements admittedly thought dyvim tvar the prospects had improved and soon they would be confronting prince yyrkoon but the dangers ahead of them were unknown the pitfalls probably considerable still he did not out of sympathy for his friend want to dispel elrics mood he was glad in fact that elric seemed in a more positive frame of mind there was talk of the equipment they would need in their expedition to the mysterious lands of yu and oin speculation concerning the capacity of the ship which sails over land and seahow many men it would take what provisions they should put aboard and so on when elric went to his bed he did not walk with the dragging tiredness which had previously accompanied his step and again bidding him goodnight dyvim tvar was struck by the same emotion which had filled him on the beach watching elric begin his rune perhaps it was not by chance that he had used the example of his sons when speaking to elric earlier that day for he had a feeling that was almost protective as if elric were a boy looking forward to some treat which might not bring him the joy he expected dyvim tvar dismissed the thoughts as best he could and went to his own bed elric might blame himself for all that had occurred in the question of yyrkoon and cymoril but dyvim tvar wondered if he too were not to blame in some part perhaps he should have offered his advice more cogentlymore vehemently evenearlier and made a stronger attempt to influence the young emperor and then in the melnibonean manner he dismissed such doubts and questions as pointless there was only one ruleseek pleasure however you would but had that always been the melnibonean way dyvim tvar wondered suddenly if elric might not have regressive rather than deficient blood could elric be a reincarnation of one of their most distant ancestors had it always been in the melnibonean character to think only of oneself and ones own gratification and again dyvim tvar dismissed the questions what use was there in questions after all the world was the world a man was a man before he sought his own bed he went to visit both his old mistresses waking them up and insisting that he see his sons dyvim slorm and dyvim mav and when his sons sleepyeyed bewildered had been brought to him he stared at them for a long while before sending them back he had said nothing to either but he had brought his brows together frequently and rubbed at his face and shaken his head and when they had gone had said to niopal and saramal his mistresses who were as bewildered as their offspring let them be taken to the dragon caves tomorrow and begin their learning so soon dyvim tvar said niopal aye theres little time left i fear he would not amplify on this remark because he could not it was merely a feeling he had but it was a feeling that was growing almost to the point where it was becoming an obsession with him in the morning dyvim tvar returned to elrics tower and found the emperor pacing the gallery above the city asking eagerly for any news of a ship sighted off the coast of the island but no such ship had been seen servants answered earnestly that if their emperor could describe the ship it would be easier for them to know for what to look but he could not describe the ship and could only hint that it might not be seen on water at all but might appear on land he was all dressed up in his black war gear and it was plain to dyvim tvar that elric was indulging in even larger quantities of the potions which replenished his blood the crimson eyes gleamed with a hot vitality the speech was rapid and the bonewhite hands moved with unnatural speed when elric made even the lightest gesture are you well this morning my lord asked the dragon master in excellent spirits thank you dyvim tvar elric grinned though id feel even better if the ship which sails over land and sea were here now he went to the balustrade and leaned upon it peering over the towers and beyond the city walls looking first to the sea and then to the land where can it be i wish that king straasha had been able to be more specific ill agree with that dyvim tvar who had not breakfasted helped himself from the variety of succulent foods laid upon the table it was evident that elric had eaten nothing dyvim tvar began to wonder if the volume of potions had not affected his old friends brain perhaps madness brought about by his involvement with complicated sorcery his anxiety for cymoril his hatred of yyrkoon had begun to overwhelm elric would it not be better to rest and to wait until the ship is sighted he suggested quietly as he wiped his lips ayetheres reason in that elric agreed but i cannot i have an urge to be off dyvim tvar to come face to face with yyrkoon to have my revenge on him to be united with cymoril again i understand that yet still elrics laugh was loud and ragged you fret like tanglebones over my wellbeing i do not need two nursemaids lord of the dragon caves with an effort dyvim tvar smiled you are right well i pray that this magical vesselwhat is that he pointed out across the island a movement in yonder forest as if the wind passes through it but there is no sign of wind elsewhere elric followed his gaze you are right i wonder and then they saw something emerge from the forest and the land itself seemed to ripple it was something which glinted white and blue and black it came closer a sail said dyvim tvar it is your ship i think my lord aye elric whispered craning forward my ship make yourself ready dyvim tvar by midday we shall be gone from imrryr what the earth god desired the ship was tall and slender and she was delicate her rails masts and bulwarks were exquisitely carved and obviously not the work of a mortal craftsman though built of wood the wood was not painted but naturally shone blue and black and green and a kind of deep smoky red and her rigging was the colour of seaweed and there were veins in the planks of her polished deck like the roots of trees and the sails on her three tapering masts were as fat and white and light as clouds on a fine summer day the ship was everything that was lovely in nature few could look upon her and not feel delighted as they might be delighted upon sighting a perfect view in a word the ship radiated harmony and elric could think of no finer vessel in which to sail against prince yyrkoon and the dangers of the lands of oin and yu the ship sailed gently in the ground as if upon the surface of a river and the earth beneath the keel rippled as if turned momentarily to water wherever the keel of the ship touched and a few feet around it this effect became evident though after the ship had passed the ground would return to its usual stable state this was why the trees of the forest had swayed as the ship passed through them parting before the keel as the ship sailed towards imrryr the ship which sails over land and sea was not particularly large certainly she was considerably smaller than a melnibonean battlebarge and only a little bigger than a southern galley but the grace of her the curve of her line the pride of her bearingin these she had no rival at all already her gangplanks had been lowered down to the ground and she was being made ready for her journey elric hands on his slim hips stood looking up at king straashas gift from the gates of the city wall slaves were bearing provisions and arms and carrying them up the gangways meanwhile dyvim tvar was assembling the imrryrian warriors and assigning them their ranks and duties while on the expedition there were not many warriors only half the available strength could come with the ship for the other half must remain behind under the command of admiral magum colim and protect the city it was unlikely that there would be any large attack on melnibone after the punishment meted out to the barbarian fleet but it was wise to take precautions particularly since prince yyrkoon had vowed to conquer imrryr also for some strange reason that none of the onlookers could divine dyvim tvar had called for volunteersveterans who shared a common disabilityand made up a special detachment of these men who so the onlookers thought could be of no use at all on the expedition still neither were they of use when it came to defending the city so they might as well go these veterans were led aboard first last to climb the gangway was elric himself he walked slowly heavily a proud figure in his black armour until he reached the deck then he turned saluted his city and ordered the gangplank raised dyvim tvar was waiting for him on the poopdeck the lord of the dragon caves had stripped off one of his gauntlets and was running his naked hand over the oddly coloured wood of the rail this is not a ship made for war elric he said i should not like to see it harmed how can it be harmed elric asked lightly as imrryians began to climb the rigging and adjust the sails would straasha let it be destroyed would grome fear not for the ship which sails over land and sea dyvim tvar fear only for our own safety and the success of our expedition now let us consult the charts remembering straashas warning concerning his brother grome i suggest we travel by sea for as far as possible calling in here he pointed to a seaport on the western coast of lormyrto get our bearings and learn what we can of the lands of oin and yu and how those lands are defended few travellers have ever ventured beyond lormyr it is said that the edge of the world lies not far from that countrys most southerly borders dyvim tvar frowned could not this whole mission be a trap i wonder ariochs trap what if he is in league with prince yyrkoon and we have been completely deceived into embarking upon an expedition which will destroy us i have considered that said elric but there is no other choice we must trust arioch i suppose we must dyvim tvar smiled ironically another matter now occurs to me how does the ship move i saw no anchors we could raise and there are no tides that i know of that sweep across the land the wind fills the sailssee it was true the sails were billowing and the masts creaked slightly as they took the strain elric shrugged and spread his hands i suppose we must tell the ship he suggested shipwe are ready to sail elric took some pleasure in dyvim tvars expression of astonishment as with a lurch the ship began to move it sailed smoothly as over a calm sea and dyvim tvar instinctively clutched the rail shouting but we are heading directly for the city wall elric crossed quickly to the centre of the poop where a large lever lay horizontally attached to a ratchet which in turn was attached to a spindle this was almost certainly the steering gear elric grasped the lever as one might grasp an oar and pushed it round a notch or two immediately the ship respondedand turned towards another part of the wall elric hauled back on the lever and the ship leaned protesting a little as she yawed around and began to head out across the island elric laughed in delight you see dyvim tvar it is easy a slight effort of logic was all it took nonetheless said dyvim tvar suspiciously id rather we rode dragons at least they are beasts and may be understood but this sorcery it troubles me those are not fitting words for a noble of melnibone elric shouted above the sound of the wind in the rigging the creaking of the ships timbers the slap of the great white sails perhaps not said dyvim tvar perhaps that explains why i stand beside you now my lord elric darted his friend a puzzled look before he went below to find a helmsman whom he could teach how to steer the ship the ship sped swiftly over rocky slopes and up gorsecovered hills she cut her way through forests and sailed grandly over grassy plains she moved like a lowflying hawk which keeps close to the ground but progresses with incredible speed and accuracy as it searches for its prey altering its course with an imperceptible flick of a wing the soldiers of imrryr crowded her decks gasping in amazement at the ships progress over the land and many of the men had to be clouted back to their positions at the sails or elsewhere about the ship the huge warrior who acted as bosun seemed the only member of the crew unaffected by the miracle of the ship he was behaving as he would normally behave aboard one of the golden battlebarges going solidly about his duties and seeing to it that all was done in a proper seamanly manner the helmsman elric had selected was on the other hand wideeyed and somewhat nervous of the ship he handled you could see that he felt he was at any moment going to be dashed against a slab of rock or smash the ship apart in a tangle of thicktrunked pines he was forever wetting his lips and wiping sweat from his brow even though the air was sharp and his breath steamed as it left his throat yet he was a good helmsman and gradually he became used to handling the ship though his movements were perforce more rapid for there was little time to deliberate upon a decision the ship travelled with such speed over the land the speed was breathtaking they sped more swiftly than any horsewere swifter even than dyvim tvars beloved dragons yet the motion was exhilarating too as the expressions on the faces of all the imrryrians told elrics delighted laughter rang through the ship and infected many another member of the crew well if grome of the roots is trying to block our progress i hesitate to guess how fast we shall travel when we reach water he called to dyvim tvar dyvim tvar had lost some of his earlier mood his long fine hair streamed around his face as he smiled at his friend ayewe shall all be whisked off the deck and into the sea and then as if in answer to their words the ship began suddenly to buck and at the same time sway from side to side like a ship caught in powerful crosscurrents the helmsman went white and clung to his lever trying to get the ship back under control there came a brief terrified yell and a sailor fell from the highest crosstree in the main mast and crashed onto the deck breaking every bone in his body and then the ship swayed once or twice and the turbulence was behind them and they continued on their course elric stared at the body of the fallen sailor suddenly the mood of gaiety left him completely and he gripped the rail in his black gauntleted hands and he gritted his strong teeth and his crimson eyes glowed and his lips curled in selfmockery what a fool i am what a fool i am to tempt the gods so still though the ship moved almost as swiftly as it had done there seemed to be something dragging at it as if gromes minions clung on to the bottom as barnacles might cling in the sea and elric sensed something around him in the air something in the rustling of the trees through which they passed something in the movement of the grass and the bushes and the flowers over which they crossed something in the weight of the rocks of the angle of the hills and he knew that what he sensed was the presence of grome of the groundgrome of the land below the rootsgrome who desired to own what he and his brother straasha had once owned jointly what they had had made as a sign of the unity between them and over which they had then fought grome wanted very much to take back the ship which sails over land and sea and elric staring down at the black earth became afraid king grome but at last with the land tugging at their keel they reached the sea sliding into the water and gathering speed with every moment until melnibone was gone behind them and they were sighting the thick clouds of steam which hung forever over the boiling sea elric thought it unwise to risk even this magical vessel in those peculiar waters so the vessel was turned and headed for the coast of lormyr sweetest and most tranquil of the young kingdom nations and the port of ramasaz on lormyrs western shore if the southern barbarians with whom they had so recently fought had been from lormyr elric would have considered making for some other port but the barbarians had almost certainly been from the southeast on the far side of the continent beyond pikarayd the lormyrians under their fat cautious king fadan were not likely to join a raid unless its success were completely assured sailing slowly into ramasaz elric gave instructions that their ship be moored in a conventional way and treated like any ordinary ship it attracted attention nonetheless for its beauty and the inhabitants of the port were astonished to find melniboneans crewing the vessel though melniboneans were disliked throughout the young kingdoms they were also feared thus outwardly at any rate elric and his men were treated with respect and were served reasonably good food and wine in the hostelries they entered in the largest of the waterfront inns a place called heading outward and coming safely home again elric found a garrulous host who had until he bought the inn been a prosperous fisherman and who knew the southernmost shores reasonably well he certainly knew the lands of oin and yu but he had no respect for them at all you think they could be massing for war my lord he raised his eyebrows at elric before hiding his face in his winemug wiping his lips he shook his red head then they must war against sparrows oin and yu are barely nations at all their only halfway decent city is dhozkamand that is shared between them half being on one side of the river ar and half being on the other as for the rest of oin and yuit is inhabited by peasants who are for the most part so illeducated and superstitionridden that they are povertystriken not a potential soldier among em youve heard nothing of a melnibonean renegade who has conquered oin and yu and set about training these peasants to make war dyvim tvar leaned on the bar next to elric he sipped fastidiously from a thick cup of wine prince yyrkoon is the renegades name is that whom you seek the innkeeper became more interested a dispute between the dragon princes eh thats our business said elric haughtily of course my lords you know nothing of a great mirror which steals mens memories dyvim tvar asked a magical mirror the innkeeper threw back his head and laughed heartily i doubt if theres one decent mirror in the whole of oin or yu no my lords i think you are misled if you fear danger from those lands doubtless you are right said elric staring down into his own untasted wine but it would be wise if we were to check for ourselvesand it would be in lormyrs interests too if we were to find what we seek and warn you accordingly fear not for lormyr we can deal easily with any silly attempt to make war from that quarter but if youd see for yourselves you must follow the coast for three days until you come to a great bay the river ar runs into that bay and on the shores of the river lies dhozkama seedy sort of city particularly for a capital serving two nations the inhabitants are corrupt dirty and diseaseridden but fortunately they are also lazy and thus afford little trouble especially if you keep a sword by you when you have spent an hour in dhozkam you will realise the impossibility of such folk becoming a menace to anyone else unless they should get close enough to you to infect you with one of their several plagues again the innkeeper laughed hugely at his own wit as he ceased shaking he added or unless you fear their navy it consists of a dozen or so filthy fishing boats most of which are so unseaworthy they dare only fish the shallows of the estuary elric pushed his winecup aside we thank you landlord he placed a melnibonean silver piece upon the counter this will be hard to change said the innkeeper craftily there is no need to change it on our account elric told him i thank you masters would you stay the night at my establishment i can offer you the finest beds in ramasaz i think not elric told him we shall sleep aboard out ship tonight that we might be ready to sail at dawn the landlord watched the melniboneans depart instinctively he bit at the silver piece and then suspecting he tasted something odd about it removed it from his mouth he stared at the coin turning it this way and that could melnibonean silver be poisonous to an ordinary mortal he wondered it was best not to take risks he tucked the coin into his purse and collected up the two winecups they had left behind though he hated waste he decided it would be wiser to throw the cups out lest they should have become tainted in some way the ship which sails over land and sea reached the bay at noon on the following day and now it lay close inshore hidden from the distant city by a short isthmus on which grew thick neartropical foliage elric and dyvim tvar waded through the clear shallow water to the beach and entered the forest they had decided to be cautious and not make their presence known until they had determined the truth of the innkeepers contemptuous description of dhozkam near the tip of the isthmus was a reasonably high hill and growing on the hill were several goodsized trees elric and dyvim tvar used their swords to clear a path through the undergrowth and made their way up the hill until they stood under the trees picking out the one most easily climbed elric selected a tree whose trunk bent and then straightened out again he sheathed his sword got his hands onto the trunk and hauled himself up clambering along until he reached a succession of thick branches which would bear his weight in the meantime dyvim tvar climbed another nearby tree until at last both men could get a good view across the bay where the city of dhozkam could be clearly seen certainly the city itself deserved the innkeepers description it was squat and grimy and evidently poor doubtless this was why yyrkoon had chosen it for the lands of oin and yu could not have been hard to conquer with the help of a handful of welltrained imrryrians and some of yyrkoons sorcerous allies indeed few would have bothered to conquer such a place since its wealth was plainly virtually nonexistent and its geographical position of no strategic importance yyrkoon had chosen well for purposes of secrecy if nothing else but the landlord had been wrong about dhozkams fleet even from here elric and dyvim tvar could make out a good thirty goodsized warships in the harbour and there seemed to be more anchored upriver but the ships did not interest them as much as the thing which flashed and glittered above the citysomething which had been mounted on huge pillars which supported an axle which in turn supported a vast circular mirror set in a frame whose workmanship was as plainly nonmortal as that of the ship which had brought the melniboneans here there was no doubt that they looked upon the mirror of memory and that any who had sailed into t he harbour after it had been erected must have had their memory of what they had seen stolen from them instantly it seems to me my lord said dyvim tvar from his perch a yard or two away from elric that it would be unwise of us to sail directly into the harbour of dhozkam indeed we could be in danger if we entered the bay i think that we look upon the mirror even now only because it is not pointed directly at us but you notice there is machinery to turn it in any direction its user choosessave one it cannot be turned inland behind the city there is no need for it for who would approach oin and yu from the wastelands beyond their borders and who but the inhabitants of oin or yu would need to come overland to their capital i think i take your meaning dyvim tvar you suggest that we would be wise to make use of the special properties of our ship and and go overland to dhozkam striking suddenly and making full use of those veterans we brought with us moving swiftly and ignoring prince yyrkoons new alliesseeking the prince himself and his renegades could we do that elric dash into the cityseize yyrkoon rescue cymorilthen speed out again and away since we have too few men to make a direct assault it is all we can do though its dangerous the advantage of surprise would be lost of course once we had made the attempt if we failed in our first attempt it would become much harder to attack a second time the alternative is to sneak into the city at night and hope to locate yyrkoon and cymoril alone but then we should not be making use of our one important weapon the ship which sails over land and sea i think your plan is the best one dyvim tvar let us turn the ship inland now and hope that grome takes his time in finding usfor i still worry lest he try seriously to wrest the ship from our possession elric began to climb down towards the ground standing once more upon the poopdeck of the lovely ship elric ordered the helmsman to turn the vessel once again towards the land under halfsail the ship moved gracefully through the water and up the curve of the bank and the flowering shrubs of the forest parted before its prow and then they were sailing through the green dark of the jungle while startled birds cawed and shrilled and little animals paused in astonishment and peered down from the trees at the ship which sails over land and sea and some almost lost their balance as the graceful boat progressed calmly over the floor of the forest turning aside for only the thickest of the trees and thus they made their way to the interior of the land called oin which lay to the north of the river ar which marked the border between oin and the land called yu with which oin shared a single capital oin was a country consisting largely of unforested jungle and infertile plains where the inhabitants farmed for they feared the forest and would not go into it even though that was where oins wealth might be found the ship sailed well enough through the forest and out over the plain and soon they could see a large lake glinting ahead of them and dyvim tvar glancing at the crude map with which he had furnished himself in ramasaz suggested that they begin to turn towards the south again and approach dhozkam by means of a wide semicircle elric agreed and the ship began to tack round it was then that the land began to heave again and huge waves of grassy earth this time rolled around the ship and blotted out the surrounding view the ship pitched wildly up and down and from side to side two more imrryrians fell from the rigging and were killed on the deck below the bosun was shouting loudlythough in fact all this upheaval was happening in silenceand the silence made the situation seem that much more menacing the bosun yelled to his men to tie themselves to their positions and all those not doing anythingget below at once he added elric had wound a scarf around the rail and tied the other end to his wrist dyvim tvar had used a long belt for the same purpose but still they were flung in all directions often losing their footing as the ship bucked this way and that and every bone in elrics body seemed about to crack and every inch of his flesh seemed bruised and the ship was creaking and protesting and threatening to break up under the awful strain of riding the heaving land is this gromes work elric dyvim tvar panted or is it some sorcery of yyrkoons elric shook his head not yyrkoon it is grome and i know no way to placate him not grome who thinks least of all the kings of the elements yet perhaps is the most powerful but surely he breaks his bargain with his brother by doing this to us no i think not king straasha warned us this might happen we can only hope that grome expends all his energy and that the ship survives as it might survive a natural storm at sea this is worse than a seastorm elric elric nodded his agreement but could say nothing for the deck was tilting at a crazy angle and he had to cling to the rails with both hands in order to retain any kind of footing and now the silence stopped instead they heard a rumbling and a roaring that seemed to have something of the character of laughter king grome elric shouted king grome let us be we have done you no harm but the laughter increased and it made the whole ship quiver as the land rose and fell around it as trees and hills and rocks rushed towards the ship and then fell away again never quite engulfing them for grome doubtless wanted his ship intact grome you have no quarrel with mortals elric cried again let us be ask a favour of us if you must but grant us this favour in return elric was shouting almost anything that came into his head really he had no hope of being heard by the earth god and he did not expect king grome to bother to listen even if the elemental did hear but there was nothing else to do grome grome grome listen to me elrics only response was in the louder laughter which made every nerve in him tremble and the earth heaved higher and dropped lower and the ship spun round and round until elric was sure he would lose his senses entirely king grome king grome is it just to slay those who have never done you harm and then slowly the heaving earth subsided and the ship was still and a huge brown figure stood looking down at the ship the figure was the colour of earth and looked like a vast old oak his hair and his beard were the colour of leaves and his eyes were the colour of gold ore and his teeth were the colour of granite and his feet were like roots and his skin seemed covered in tiny green shoots in place of hair and he smelled rich and musty and good and he was king grome of the earth elementals he sniffed and he frowned and he said in a soft mighty voice that was yet coarse and grumpy i want my ship it is not our ship to give king grome said elric gromes tone of petulance increased i want my ship he said slowly i want the thing it is mine of what use is it to you king grome use it is mine grome stamped and the land rippled elric said desperately it is your brothers ship king grome it is king straashas ship he gave you part of his domain and you allowed him to keep the ship that was the bargain i know nothing of a bargain the ship is mine you know that if you take the ship then king straasha will have to take back the land he gave you i want my ship the huge figure shifted its position and bits of earth fell from it landing with distinctly heard thuds on the ground below and on the deck of the ship then you must kill us to obtain it elric said kill grome does not kill mortals he kills nothing grome builds grome brings to life you have already killed three of our company elric pointed out three are dead king grome because you made the landstorm gromes great brows drew together and he scratched his great head causing an immense rustling noise to sound grome does not kill he said again king grome has killed said elric reasonably three lives lost grome grunted but i want my ship the ship is lent to us by your brother we cannot give it to you besides we sail in it for a purposea noble purpose i think we i know nothing of purposesand care nothing for you i want my ship my brother should not have lent it to you i had almost forgotten it but now that i remember it i want it will you not accept something else in place of the ship king grome said dyvim tvar suddenly some other gift grome shook his monstrous head how could a mortal give me something it is mortals who take from me all the time they steal my bones and my blood and my flesh could you give me back all that your kind has taken is there not one thing elric said grome closed his eyes precious metals jewels suggested dyvim tvar we have many such in melnibone i have plenty said king grome elric shrugged in despair how can we bargain with a god dyvim tvar he gave a bitter smile what can the lord of the soil desire more sun more rain these are not ours to give i am a rough sort of god said grome if indeed god i am but i did not mean to kill your comrades i have an idea give me the bodies of the slain bury them in my earth elrics heart leapt that is all you wish of us it would seem much to me and for that you will let us sail on on water aye growled grome but i do not see why i should allow you to sail over my land it is too much to expect of me you can go to yonder lake but from now this ship will only possess the properties bestowed upon it by my brother straasha no longer shall it cross my domain but king grome we need this ship we are upon urgent business we need to sail to the city yonder elric pointed in the direction of dhozkam you may go to the lake but after that the ship will sail only on water now give me what i ask elric called down to the bosun who for the first time seemed amazed by what he was witnessing bring up the bodies of the three dead men the bodies were brought up from below grome stretched out one of his great earthy hands and picked them up i thank you he growled farewell and slowly grome began to descend into the ground his whole huge frame becoming atom by atom absorbed with the earth until he was gone and then the ship was moving again slowly towards the lake on the last short voyage it would ever make upon the land and thus our plans are thwarted said elric dyvim tvar looked miserably towards the shining lake aye so much for that scheme i hesitate to suggest this to you elric but i fear we must resort to sorcery again if we are to stand any chance of achieving our goal elric sighed i fear we must he said the city and the mirror prince yyrkoon was pleased his plans went well he peered through the high fence which enclosed the flat roof of his house he looked out towards the harbour at his splendid captured fleet every ship which had come to dhozkam and which had not flown the standard of a powerful nation had been easily taken after its crew had looked upon the great mirror which squatted on its pillars above the city demons had built those pillars and prince yyrkoon had paid them for their work with the souls of all those in oin and yu who had resisted him now there was one last ambition to fulfil and then he and his new followers would be on their way to melnibone he turned and spoke to his sister cymoril lay on a wooden bench staring unseeingly at the sky clad in the filthy tatters of the dress she had been wearing when yyrkoon abducted her from her tower see our fleet cymoril while the golden barges are scattered we shall sail unhampered into imrryr and declare the city ours elric cannot defend himself against us now he fell so easily into my trap he is a fool and you were a fool to give him your affection cymoril made no response through all the months she had been away yyrkoon had drugged her food and drink and produced in her a lassitude which rivalled elrics undrugged condition yyrkoons own experiments with his sorcerous powers had turned him gaunt wildeyed and somewhat mangy he ceased to take any pains with his physical appearance but cymoril had a wasted haunted look to her for all that beauty remained it was as if dhozkams rundown seediness had infected them both in different ways fear not for your own future however my sister yyrkoon continued he chuckled you shall still be empress and sit beside the emperor on his ruby throne only i shall be emperor and elric shall die for many days and the manner of his death will be more inventive than anything he thought to do to me cymorils voice was hollow and distant she did not turn her head when she spoke you are insane yyrkoon insane come now sister is that a word that a true melnibonean should use we melniboneans judge nothing sane or insane what a man ishe is what he doeshe does perhaps you have stayed too long in the young kingdoms and its judgments are becoming yours but that shall soon be righted we shall return to the dragon isle in triumph and you will forget all this just as if you yourself had looked into the mirror of memory he darted a nervous glance upwards as if he halfexpected the mirror to be turned on him cymoril closed her eyes her breathing was heavy and very slow she was bearing this nightmare with fortitude certain that elric must eventually rescue her from it that hope was all that had stopped her from destroying herself if the hope went altogether then she would bring about her own death and be done with yyrkoon and all his horrors did i tell you that last night i was successful i raised demons cymoril such powerful dark demons i learned from them all that was left for me to learn and i opened the shade gate at last soon i shall pass through it and there i shall find what i seek i shall become the most powerful mortal on earth did i tell you all this cymoril he had in fact repeated himself several times that morning but cymoril had paid no more attention to him than she did now she felt so tired she tried to sleep she said slowly as if to remind herself of something i hate you yyrkoon ah but you shall love me soon cymoril soon elric will come elric ha he sits twiddling his thumbs in his tower waiting for news that will never comesave when i bring it to him elric will come she said yyrkoon snarled a brutefaced oinish girl brought him his morning wine yyrkoon seized the cup and sipped the stuff then he spat it at the girl who trembling ducked away yyrkoon took the jug and emptied it onto the white dust of the roof this is elrics thin blood this is how it will flow away but again cymoril was not listening she was trying to remember her albino lover and the few sweet days they had spent together since they were children yyrkoon hurled the empty jug at the girls head but she was adept at dodging him as she dodged she murmured her standard response to all his attacks and insults thank you demon lord she said thank you demon lord yyrkoon laughed aye demon lord your folk are right to call me that for i rule more demons than i rule men my power increases every day the oinish girl hurried away to fetch more wine for she knew he would be calling for it in a moment yyrkoon crossed the roof to stare through the slats in the fence at the proof of his power but as he looked upon his ships he heard sounds of confusion from the other side of the roof could the yurits and the oinish be fighting amongst themselves where were their imrryrian centurions where was captain valharik he almost ran across the roof passing cymoril who appeared to be sleeping and peered down into the streets fire he murmured fire it was true that the streets appeared to be on fire and yet it was not an ordinary fire balls of fire seemed to drift about igniting rushthatched roofs doors anything which would easily burnas an invading army might put a village to the torch yyrkoon scowled thinking at first that he had been careless and some spell of his had turned against him but then he looked over the burning houses at the river and he saw a strange ship sailing there a ship of great grace and beauty that somehow seemed more a creation of nature than of manand he knew they were under attack but who would attack dhozkam there was no loot worth the effort it could not be imrryrians it could not be elric it must not be elric he growled the mirror it must be turned upon the invaders and upon yourself brother cymoril had risen unsteadily and leaned against a table she was smiling you were too confident yyrkoon elric comes elric nonsense merely a few barbarian raiders from the interior once they are in the centre of the city we shall be able to use the mirror of memory upon them he ran to the trapdoor which led down into his house captain valharik valharik where are you valharik appeared in the room below he was sweating there was a blade in his gloved hand though he did not seem to have been in any fighting as yet make the mirror ready valharik turn it upon the attackers but my lord we might hurry do as i say well soon have these barbarians added to our own strengthalong with their ships barbarians my lord can barbarians command the fire elementals these things we fight are flame spirits they cannot be slain any more than fire itself can be slain fire can be slain by water prince yyrkoon reminded his lieutenant by water captain valharik have you forgotten but prince yyrkoon we have tried to quench the spirits with waterand the water will not move from our buckets some powerful sorcerer commands the invaders he has the aid of the spirits of fire and water you are mad captain valharik said yyrkoon firmly mad prepare the mirror and let us have no more of these stupidities valharik wetted his dry lips aye my lord he bowed his head and went to do his masters bidding again yyrkoon went to the fence and looked through there were men in the streets now fighting his own warriors but smoke obscured his view he could not make out the identities of any of the invaders enjoy your petty victory yyrkoon chuckled for soon the mirror will take away your minds and you will become my slaves it is elric said cymoril quietly she smiled elric comes to take vengeance on you brother yyrkoon sniggered think you think you well should that be the case hell find me gone for i still have a means of evading himand hell find you in a condition which will not please him but it is not elric it is some crude shaman from the steppes to the east of here he will soon be in my power cymoril too was peering through the fence elric she said i can see his helm what yyrkoon pushed her aside there in the streets imrryrian fought imrryrian there was no longer any doubt of that yyrkoons menimrryrian oinish and yuritwere being pushed back and at the head of the attacking imrryrians could be seen a black dragon helm such as only one melnibonean wore it was elrics helm and elrics sword that had once belonged to earl aubec of malador rose and fell and was bright with blood which glistened in the morning sunshine for a moment yyrkoon was overwhelmed with despair he groaned elric elric elric ah how we continue to underestimate each other what curse is on us cymoril had flung back her head and her face had come to life again i said he would come brother yyrkoon whirled on her ayehe has comeand the mirror will rob him of his brain and he will turn into my slave believing anything i care to put in his skull this is even sweeter than i planned sister ha he looked up and then flung his arms across his eyes as he realised what he had done quicklybelowinto the housethe mirror begins to turn there came a great creaking of gears and pulleys and chains as the terrible mirror of memory began to focus on the streets below it will be only a little while before elric has added himself and his men to my strength what a splendid irony yyrkoon hurried his sister down the steps leading from the roof and he closed the trapdoor behind him elric himself will help in the attack on imrryr he will destroy his own kind he will oust himself from the ruby throne do you not think that elric has anticipated the threat of the mirror of memory brother cymoril said with relish anticipate it ayebut resist it he cannot he must see to fight he must either be cut down or open his eyes no man with eyes can be safe from the power of the mirror he glanced around the crudely furnished room where is valharik where is the cur valharik came running in the mirror is being turned my lord but it will affect our own men too i fear then cease to fear what if our own men are drawn under its influence we can soon feed what they need to know back into their brainsat the same time as we feed our defeated foes you are too nervous captain valharik but elric leads them and elrics eyes are eyesthough they look like crimson stones he will fare no better than his men in the streets around prince yyrkoons house elric dyvim tvar and their imrryrians pushed on forcing back their demoralised opponents the attackers had lost barely a man whereas many oinish and yurits lay dead in the streets beside a few of their renegade imrryrian commanders the flame elementals whom elric had summoned with some effort were beginning to disperse for it cost them dear to spend so much time entirely within elrics plane but the necessary advantage had been gained and there was now little question of who would win as a hundred or more houses blazed throughout the city igniting others and requiring attention from the defenders lest the whole squalid place burn down about their ears in the harbour too ships were burning dyvim tvar was the first to notice the mirror beginning to swing into focus on the streets he pointed a warning finger then turned blowing on his warhorn and ordering forward the troops who up to now had played no part in the fighting now you must lead us he cried and he lowered his helm over his face the eyeholes of the helm had been blocked so that he could not see through slowly elric lowered his own helm until he was in darkness the sound of fighting continued however as the veterans who had sailed with them from melnibone set to work in their place and the other troops fell back the leading imrryrians had not blocked their eyeholes elric prayed that the scheme would work yyrkoon peeking cautiously through a chink in a heavy curtain said querulously valharik they fight on why is that is not the mirror focussed it should be my lord then see for yourself the imrryrians continue to forge through our defendersand our men are beginning to come under the influence of the mirror what is wrong valharik what is wrong valharik drew air between his teeth and there was a certain admiration in his expression as he looked upon the fighting imrryrians they are blind he said they fight by sound and touch and smell they are blind my lord emperorand they lead elric and his men whose helms are so designed they can see nothing blind yyrkoon spoke almost pathetically refusing to understand blind aye blind warriorsmen wounded in earlier wars but good fighters nonetheless that is how elric defeats our mirror my lord agh no no yyrkoon beat heavily on his captains back and the man shrank away elric is not cunning he is not cunning some powerful demon gives him these ideas perhaps my lord but are there demons more powerful than those who have aided you no said yyrkoon there are none oh that i could summon some of them now but i have expended my powers in opening the shade gate i should have anticipated i could not anticipate oh elric i shall yet destroy you when the runeblades are mine then yyrkoon frowned but how could he have been prepared what demon unless he summoned arioch himself but he has not the power to summon arioch i could not summon him and then as if in reply yyrkoon heard elrics battle song sounding from the nearby streets and that song answered the question arioch arioch blood and souls for my lord arioch then i must have the runeblades i must pass through the shade gate there i still have alliessupernatural allies who shall deal easily with elric if need be but i need time yyrkoon mumbled to himself as he paced about the room valharik continued to watch the fighting they come closer said the captain cymoril smiled closer yyrkoon who is the fool now elric or you be still i think i think yyrkoon fingered his lips then a light came into his eye and he looked cunningly at cymoril for a second before turning his attention to captain valharik valharik you must destroy the mirror of memory destroy it but it is our only weapon my lord exactlybut is it not useless now aye destroy it and it will serve us again yyrkoon flicked a long finger in the direction of the door go destroy the mirror but prince yyrkoonemperor i meanwill that not have the effect of robbing us of our only weapon do as i say valharik or perish but how shall i destroy it my lord your sword you must climb the column behind the face of the mirror then without looking into the mirror itself you must swing your sword against it and smash it it will break easily you know the precautions i have had to take to make sure that it was not harmed is that all i must do aye then you are free from my serviceyou may escape or do whatever else you wish to do do we not sail against melnibone of course not i have devised another method of taking the dragon isle valharik shrugged his expression showed that he had never really believed yyrkoons assurances but what else had he to do but follow yyrkoon when fearful torture awaited him at elrics hands with shoulders bowed the captain slunk away to do his princes work and now cymoril yyrkoon grinned like a ferret as he reached out to grab his sisters soft shoulders now to prepare you for your lover elric one of the blind warriors cried they no longer resist us my lord they are limp and allow themselves to be cut down where they stand why is this the mirror has robbed them of their memories elric called turning his own blind head towards the sound of the warriors voice you can lead us into a building nowwhere with luck we shall not glimpse the mirror at last they stood within what appeared to elric as he lifted his helm to be a warehouse of some kind luckily it was large enough to hold their entire force and when they were all inside elric had the doors shut while they debated their next action we should find yyrkoon dyvim tvar said let us interrogate one of those warriors therell be little point in that my friend elric reminded him their minds are gone theyll remember nothing at all they do not at present remember even what they are let alone who go to the shutters yonder where the mirrors influence cannot reach and see if you can see the building most likely to be occupied by my cousin dyvim tvar crossed swiftly to the shutters and looked cautiously out ayetheres a building larger than the rest and i see some movement within as if the surviving warriors were regrouping its likely thats yyrkoons stronghold it should be easily taken elric joined him aye i agree with you well find yyrkoon there but we must hurry lest he decides to slay cymoril we must work out the best means of reaching the place and instruct our blind warriors as to how many streets how many houses and so forth we must pass what is that strange sound one of the blind warriors raised his head like the distant ringing of a gong i hear it too said another blind man and now elric heard it a sinister noise it came from the air above them it shivered through the atmosphere the mirror dyvim tvar looked up has the mirror some property we did not anticipate possibly elric tried to remember what arioch had told him but arioch had been vague he had said nothing of this dreadful mighty sound this shattering clangour as if he is breaking the mirror he said but why there was something more now something brushing at his brain as if the sound were itself sentient perhaps yyrkoon is dead and his magic dies with him dyvim tvar began and then he broke off with a groan the noise was louder more intense bringing sharp pain to his ears and now elric knew he blocked his ears with his gauntleted hands the memories in the mirror they were flooding into his mind the mirror had been smashed and was releasing all the memories it had stolen over the centuriesthe aeons perhaps many of those memories were not mortal many were the memories of beasts and intelligent creatures which had existed even before melnibone and the memories warred for a place in elrics skullin the skulls of all the imrryriansin the poor tortured skulls of the men outside whose pitiful screams could be heard rising from the streetsand in the skull of captain valharik the turncoat as he lost his footing on the great column and fell with the shards from the mirror to the ground far below but elric did not hear captain valharik scream and he did not hear valhariks body crash first to a rooftop and then into the street where it lay all broken beneath the broken mirror elric lay upon the stone floor of the warehouse and he writhed as his comrades writhed trying to clear his head of a million memories that were not his ownof loves of hatreds of strange experiences and ordinary experiences of wars and journeys of the faces of relatives who were not his relatives of men and women and children of animals of ships and cities of fights of lovemaking of fears and desiresand the memories fought each other for possession of his crowded skull threatening to drive his own memories from his head and as elric writhed upon the ground clutching at his ears he spoke a word over and over again in an effort to cling to his own identity elric elric elric and gradually by an effort which he had experienced only once before when he had summoned arioch to the plane of the earth he managed to extinguish all those alien memories and assert his own until shaken and feeble he lowered his hands from his ears and no longer shouted his own name and then he stood up and looked about him more than two thirds of his men were dead blind or otherwise the big bosun was dead his eyes wide and staring his lips frozen in a scream his right eyesocket raw and bleeding from where he had tried to drag his eye from it all the corpses lay in unnatural positions all had their eyes open and many bore the marks of selfmutilation while others had vomited and others had dashed their brains against the wall dyvim tvar was alive but curled up in a corner mumbling to himself and elric thought he might be mad some of the other survivors were indeed mad but they were quiet they afforded no danger only five including elric seemed to have resisted the alien memories and retained their own sanity it seemed to elric as he stumbled from corpse to corpse that most of the men had had their hearts fail dyvim tvar elric put his hand on his friends shoulder dyvim tvar dyvim tvar took his head from his arm and looked into elrics eyes in dyvim tvars own eyes was the experience of a score of millennia and there was irony there too i live elric few of us live now a little later they left the warehouse no longer needing to fear the mirror and found that all the streets were full of the dead who had received the mirrors memories stiff bodies reached out hands to them dead lips formed silent pleas for help elric tried not to look at them as he pressed through them but his desire for vengeance upon his cousin was even stronger now they reached the house the door was open and the ground floor was crammed with corpses there was no sign of prince yyrkoon elric and dyvim tvar led the few imrryrians who were still sane up the steps past more imploring corpses until they reached the top floor of the house and here they found cymoril she was lying upon a couch and she was naked there were runes painted on her flesh and the runes were in themselves obscene her eyelids were heavy and she did not at first recognise them elric rushed to her side and cradled her body in his arms the body was oddly cold hehe makes mesleep said cymoril a sorcerous sleepfrom whichonly he can wake me she gave a great yawn i have stayed awake this longby an effort ofwillfor elric comes elric is here said her lover softly i am elric cymoril elric she relaxed in his arms youyou must find yyrkoonfor only he can wake me where has he gone elrics face had hardened his crimson eyes were fierce where to find the two black swordsthe runeswordsofour ancestorsmournblade and stormbringer said elric grimly those swords are cursed but where has he gone cymoril how has he escaped us throughthroughthrough theshade gatehe conjured ithe made the most fearful pacts with demons to go through theotherroom now cymoril slept but there seemed to be a certain peace on her face elric watched as dyvim tvar crossed the room sword in hand and flung the door open a dreadful stench came from the next room which was in darkness something flickered on the far side ayethats sorcery right enough said elric and yyrkoon has thwarted me he conjured the shade gate and passed through it into some netherworld which one ill never know for there is an infinity of them oh arioch i would give much to follow my cousin then follow him you shall said a sweet sardonic voice in elrics head at first the albino thought it was a vestige of a memory still fighting for possession of his head but then he knew that arioch spoke to him dismiss your followers that i may speak with thee said arioch elric hesitated he wished to be alonebut not with arioch he wished to be with cymoril for cymoril was making him weep tears already flowed from his crimson eyes what i have to say could result in cymoril being restored to her normal state said the voice and moreover it will help you defeat yyrkoon and be revenged upon him indeed it could make you the most powerful mortal there has ever been elric looked up at dyvim tvar would you and your men leave me alone for a few moments of course dyvim tvar led his men away and shut the door behind him arioch stood leaning against the same door again he had assumed the shape and poise of a handsome youth his smile was friendly and open and only the ancient eyes belied his appearance it is time to seek the black swords yourself elric said arioch lest yyrkoon reach them first i warn you of thiswith the runeblades yyrkoon will be so powerful he will be able to destroy half the world without thinking of it that is why your cousin risks the dangers of the world beyond the shade gate if yyrkoon possesses those swords before you find them it will mean the end of you of cymoril of the young kingdoms and quite possibly the destruction of melnibone too i will help you enter the netherworld to seek for the twin runeswords elric said musingly i have often been warned of the dangers of seeking the swordsand the worse dangers of owning them i think i must consider another plan my lord arioch there is no other plan yyrkoon desires the swords if you do not with mournblade in one hand and stormbringer in the other he will be invincible for the swords give their user power immense power arioch paused you must do as i say it is to your advantage and to yours lord arioch ayeto mine i am not entirely selfless elric shook his head i am confused there has been too much of the supernatural about this affair i suspect the gods of manipulating us the gods serve only those who are willing to serve them and the gods serve destiny also i like it not to stop yyrkoon is one thing to assume his ambitions and take the swords myselfthat is another thing it is your destiny cannot i change my destiny arioch shook his head no more than can i elric stroked sleeping cymorils hair i love her she is all i desire you shall not wake her if yyrkoon finds the blades before you do and how shall i find the blades enter the shade gatei have kept it open though yyrkoon thinks it closedthen you must seek the tunnel under the marsh which leads to the pulsing cavern in that chamber the runeswords are kept they have been kept there ever since your ancestors relinquished them why were they relinquished your ancestors lacked courage courage to face what themselves you are cryptic my lord arioch that is the way of the lords of the higher worlds hurry even i cannot keep the shade gate open long very well i will go and arioch vanished immediately elric called in a hoarse cracking voice for dyvim tvar dyvim tvar entered at once elric what has happened in here is it cymoril you look i am going to follow yyrkoonalone dyvim tvar you must make your way back to melnibone with those of our men who remain take cymoril with you if i do not return in reasonable time you must declare her empress if she still sleeps then you must rule as regent until she wakes dyvim tvar said softly do you know what you do elric elric shook his head no dyvim tvar i do not he got to his feet and staggered towards the other room where the shade gate waited for him book three and now there is no turning back at all elrics destiny has been forged and fixed as surely as the hellswords were forged and fixed aeons before was there ever a point where he might have turned off this road to despair damnation and destruction or has he been doomed since before his birth doomed through a thousand incarnations to know little else but sadness and struggle loneliness and remorseeternally the champion of some unknown cause through the shade gate and elric stepped into a shadow and found himself in a world of shadows he turned but the shadow through which he had entered now faded and was gone old aubecs sword was in elrics hand the black helm and the black armour were upon his body and only these were familiar for the land was dark and gloomy as if contained in a vast cave whose walls though invisible were oppressive and tangible and elric regretted the hysteria the weariness of brain which had given him the impulse to obey his patron demon arioch and plunge through the shade gate but regret was useless now so he forgot it yyrkoon was nowhere to be seen either elrics cousin had had a steed awaiting him or else more likely he had entered this world at a slightly different angle and was thus either nearer or farther from their mutual goal the air was rich with brineso rich that elrics nostrils felt as if they had been packed with saltit was almost like walking under water and just being able to breathe the water itself perhaps this explained why it was so difficult to see any great distance in any direction why there were so many shadows why the sky was like a veil which hid the roof of a cavern elric sheathed his sword there being no evident danger present at that moment and turned slowly trying to get some kind of bearing it was possible that there were jagged mountains in what he judged the east and perhaps a forest to the west without sun or stars or moon it was hard to gauge distance or direction he stood on a rocky plain over which whistled a cold and sluggish wind which tugged at his cloak as if it wished to possess it there were a few stunted leafless trees standing in a clump about a hundred paces away it was all that relieved the bleak plain save for a large shapeless slab of rock which stood a fair way beyond the trees it was a world which seemed to have been drained of all life where law and chaos had once battled and in their conflict destroyed all were there many planes such as this one elric wondered and for a moment he was filled with a dreadful presentiment concerning the fate of his own rich world he shook this mood off at once and began to walk towards the trees and the rock beyond he reached the trees and passed them and the touch of his cloak on a branch broke the brittle thing which turned almost at once to ash which was scattered on the wind elric drew the cloak closer about his body as he approached the rock he became conscious of a sound which seemed to emanate from it he slowed his pace and put his hand upon the pommel of his sword the noise continueda small rhythmic noise through the gloom elric peered carefully at the rock trying to locate the source of the sound and then the noise stopped and was replaced by anothera soft scuffle a padding footfall and then silence elric took a pace backward and drew aubecs sword the first sound had been that of a man sleeping the second sound was that of a man waking and preparing himself either for attack or to defend himself elric said i am elric of melnibone i am a stranger here and an arrow slid past his helm almost at the same moment as a bowstring sounded elric flung himself to one side and sought about for cover but there was no cover save the rock behind which the archer hid and now a voice came from behind the rock it was a firm rather bleak voice it said that was not meant to harm you but to display my skill in case you considered harming me i have had my fill of demons in this world and you look like the most dangerous demon of all whiteface i am mortal said elric straightening up and deciding that if he must die it would be best to die with some sort of dignity you spoke of melnibone i have heard of the place an isle of demons then you have not heard enough of melnibone i am mortal as are all my folk only the ignorant think us demons i am not ignorant my friend i am a warrior priest of phum born to that caste and the inheritor of all its knowledge and until recently the lords of chaos themselves were my patrons then i refused to serve them longer and was exiled to this plane by them perhaps the same fate befell you for the folk of melnibone serve chaos do they not aye and i know of phumit lies in the unmapped eastbeyond the weeping waste beyond the sighing desert beyond even elwher it is one of the oldest of the young kingdoms all that is sothough i dispute that the east is unmapped save by the savages of the west so you are indeed to share my exile it seems i am not exiled i am upon a quest when the quest is done i shall return to my own world return say you that interests me my pale friend i had thought return impossible perhaps it is and i have been tricked and if your own powers have not found you a way to another plane perhaps mine will not save me either powers i have none since i relinquished my servitude to chaos well friend do you intend to fight me there is only one upon this plane i would fight and it is not you warrior priest of phum elric sheathed his sword and at the same moment the speaker rose from behind the rock replacing a scarletfletched arrow in a scarlet quiver i am rackhir said the man called the red archer for as you see i affect scarlet dress it is a habit of the warrior priests of phum to choose but a single colour to wear it is the only loyalty to tradition i still possess he had on a scarlet jerkin scarlet breeks scarlet shoes and a scarlet cap with a scarlet feather in it his bow was scarlet and the pommel of his sword glowed rubyred his face which was aquiline and gaunt as if carved from fleshless bone was weatherbeaten and that was brown he was tall and he was thin but muscles rippled on his arms and torso there was irony in his eyes and something of a smile upon his thin lips though the face showed that it had been through much experience little of it pleasant an odd place to choose for a quest said the red archer standing with hands on hips and looking elric up and down but ill strike a bargain with you if youre interested if the bargain suits me archer ill agree to it for you seem to know more of this world than do i wellyou must find something here and then leave whereas i have nothing at all to do here and wish to leave if i help you in your quest will you take me with you when you return to our own plane that seems a fair bargain but i cannot promise what i have no power to give i will say only thisif it is possible for me to take you back with me to our own plane either before or after i have finished my quest i will do it that is reasonable said rackhir the red archer nowtell me what you seek i seek two swords forged millennia ago by immortals used by my ancestors but then relinquished by them and placed upon this plane the swords are large and heavy and black and they have cryptic runes carved into their blades i was told that i would find them in the pulsing cavern which is reached through the tunnel under the marsh have you heard of either of these places i have not nor have i heard of the two black swords rackhir rubbed his bony chin though i remember reading something in one of the books of phum and what i read disturbed me the swords are legendary many books make some small reference to themalmost always mysterious there is said to be one tome which records the history of the swords and all who have used themand all who will use them in the futurea timeless book which contains all time some call it the chronicle of the black sword and in it it is said men may read their whole destinies i know nothing of that either it is not one of the books of phum i fear comrade elric that we shall have to venture to the city of ameeron and ask your questions of the inhabitants there there is a city upon this plane ayea city i stayed but a short time in it preferring the wilderness but with a friend it might be possible to bear the place a little longer why is ameeron unsuited to your taste its citizens are not happy indeed they are a most depressed and depressing group for they are all you see exiles or refugees or travelers between the worlds who lost their way and never found it again no one lives in ameeron by choice a veritable city of the damned as the poet might remark aye rackhir offered elric a sardonic wink but i sometimes think all cities are that what is the nature of this plane where are as far as i can tell no planets no moon no sun it has something of the air of a great cavern there is indeed a theory that it is a sphere buried in an infinity of rock others say that it lies in the future of our own eartha future where the universe has died i heard a thousand theories during the short space of time i spend in the city of ameeron all it seemed to me were of equal value all it seemed to me could be correct why not there are some who believe that everything is a lie conversely everything could be the truth it was elrics turn to remark ironically you are a philosopher then as well as an archer friend rackhir of phum rackhir laughed if you like it is such thinking that weakened my loyalty to chaos and led me to this pass i have heard that there is a city called tanelorn which may sometimes be found on the shifting shores of the sighing desert if i ever return to our own world comrade elric i shall seek that city for i have heard that peace may be found therethat such debates as the nature of truth are considered meaningless that men are content merely to exist in tanelorn i envy those who dwell in tanelorn said elric rackhir sniffed aye but it would probably prove a disappointment if found legends are best left as legends and attempts to make them real are rarely successful comeyonder lies ameeron and that sad to say is more typical of most cities one comes acrosson any plane the two tall men both outcasts in their different ways began to trudge through the gloom of that desolate wasteland in the city of ameeron the city of ameeron came in sight and elric had never seen such a place before ameeron made dhozkam seem like the cleanest and most wellrun settlement there could be the city lay below the plain of rocks in a shallow valley over which hung perpetual smoke a filthy tattered cloak meant to hide the place from the sight of men and gods the buildings were mostly in a state of semiruin or else were wholly ruined and shacks and tents erected in their place the mixture of architectural stylessome familiar some most alienwas such that elric was hard put to see one building which resembled another there were shanties and castles cottages towers and forts plain square villas and wooden huts heavy with carved ornamentation others seemed merely piles of rock with a jagged opening at one end for a door but none looked wellcould not have looked well in that landscape under that perpetually gloomy sky here and there red fires sputtered adding to the smoke and the smell as elric and rackhir reached the outskirts was rich with a great variety of stinks arrogance rather than pride is the paramount quality of most of ameerons residents said rackhir wrinkling his hawklike nose where they have any qualities of character left at all elric trudged through filth shadows scuttled amongst the closepacked buildings is there an inn perhaps where we can enquire after the tunnel under the marsh and its whereabouts no inn by and large the inhabitants keep themselves to themselves a city square where folk meet this city has no centre each resident or group of residents built their own dwelling where they felt like it or where there was space and they come from all planes and all ages thus the confusion the decay and the oldness of many of the places thus the filth the hopelessness the decadence of the majority how do they live they live off each other by and large they trade with demons who occasionally visit ameeron from time to time demons aye and the bravest hunt the rats which dwell in the caverns below the city what demons are these just creatures mainly minor minions of chaos who want something that the ameeronese can supplya stolen soul or two a baby perhaps you can imagine what else if youve knowledge of what demons normally demand from sorcerers aye i can imagine so chaos can come and go on this plane as it pleases im not sure its quite as easy but it is certainly easier for the demons to travel back and forth here than it would be for them to travel back and forth in our plane have you seen any of these demons aye the usual bestial sort coarse stupid andpowerfulmany of them were once human before electing to bargain with chaos now they are mentally and physically warped into foul demon shapes elric found rackhirs words not to his taste is that ever the fate of those who bargain with chaos he said you should know if you come from melnibone i know that in phum it is rarely the case but it seems that the higher the stakes the subtler are the changes a man undergoes when chaos agrees to trade with him elric sighed where shall we enquire of our tunnel under the marsh there was an old man rackhir began and then a grunt behind him made him pause another grunt a face with tusks in it emerged from a patch of darkness formed by a fallen slab of masonry the face grunted again who are you said elric his swordhand ready pig said the face with tusks in it elric was not certain whether he was being insulted or whether the creature was describing himself pig two more faces with tusks in them came out of the patch of darkness pig said one pig said another snake said a voice behind elric and rackhir elric turned while rackhir continued to watch the pigs a tall youth stood there where his head would have been sprouted the bodies of about fifteen goodsized snakes the head of each snake glared at elric the tongues flickered and they all opened their mouths at exactly the same moment to say again snake thing said another voice elric glanced in that direction gasped drew his sword and felt nausea sweep through him then pigs snake and thing were upon them rackhir took one pig before it could move three paces his bow was off his back and strung and a redfletched arrow nocked and shot all in a second he had time to shoot one more pig and then drop his bow to draw his sword back to back he and elric prepared to defend themselves against the demons attack snake was bad enough with its fifteen darting heads hissing and snapping with teeth which dripped venom but thing kept changing its formfirst an arm would emerge then a face would appear from the shapeless heaving flesh which shuffled implacably closer thing it shouted two swords slashed at elric who was dealing with the last pig and missed his stroke so that instead of running the pig through the heart he took him in a lung pig staggered backward and slumped to the ground in a pool of muck he crawled for a moment but then collapsed thing had produced a spear and elric barely managed to deflect the cast with the flat of his sword now rackhir was engaged with snake and the two demons closed on the men eager to make a finish of them half the heads of snake lay writhing on the ground and elric had managed to slice one hand off thing but the demon still seemed to have three other hands ready it seemed to be created not from one creature but from several elric wondered if through his bargaining with arioch this would ultimately be his fate to be turned into a demona formless monster but wasnt he already something of a monster didnt folk already mistake him for a demon these thoughts gave him strength he yelled as he fought elric and thing replied his adversary also eager to assert what he regarded as the essence of his being another hand flew off as aubecs sword bit into it another javelin jabbed out and was knocked aside another sword appeared and came down on elrics helm with a force which dazed him and sent him reeling back against rackhir who missed his thrust at snake and was almost bitten by four of the heads elric chopped at the arm and the tentacle which held the sword and saw them part from the body but then become reabsorbed again the nausea returned elric thrust his sword into the mass and the mass screamed thing thing thing elric thrust again and four swords and two spears waved and clashed and tried to deflect aubecs blade thing this is yyrkoons work said elric without a doubt he has heard that i have followed him and seeks to stop us with his demon allies he gritted his teeth and spoke through them unless one of these is yyrkoon himself are you my cousin yyrkoon thing thing the voice was almost pathetic the weapons waved and clashed but they no longer darted so fiercely at elric or are you some other old familiar friend thing elric stabbed again and again into the mass thick reeking blood spurted and fell upon his armour elric could not understand why it had become so easy to take the attack to the demon now shouted a voice from above elrics head quickly elric glanced up and saw a red face a white beard a waving arm dont look at me you fool nowstrike and elric put his two hands above his sword hilt and drove the blade deep into the shapeless creature which moaned and wept and said in a small whisper frank before it died rackhir thrust at the same moment and his blade went under the remaining snake heads and plunged into the chest and thence into the heart of the youthbody and his demon died too the whitehaired man came clambering down from the ruined archway on which he had been perched he was laughing niuns sorcery still has some effect even here eh i heard the tall one call his demon friends and instruct them to set upon you it did not seem fair to me that five should attack twoso i sat upon that wall and i drew the manyarmed demons strength out of it i still can i still can and now i have his strength and feel considerably better than i have done for many a moon it said frank said elric frowning was that a name do you think its name before perhaps said old niun perhaps poor creature but still it is dead now you are not of ameeron you twothough ive seen you here before red one and ive seen you said rackhir with a smile he wiped snakes blood from his blade using one of snakes heads for the purpose you are niun who knew all aye who knew all but who now knows very little soon it will be over when i have forgotten everything then may return from this awful exile it is the pact i made with orland of the staff i was a fool who wished to know everything and my curiosity led me into an adventure concerning this orland orland showed me the error of my ways and sent me here to forget sadly as you noticed i still remember some of my powers and my knowledge from time to time i know you seek the black swords i know you are elric of melnibone i know what will become of you you know my destiny said elric eagerly tell me what it is niun who knew all niun opened his mouth as if to speak but then firmly shut it again no he said i have forgotten no elric made as if to seize the old man no you remember i can see that you remember i have forgotten niun lowered his head rackhir took hold of elrics arm he has forgotten elric elric nodded very well then he said but have you remembered where lies the tunnel under the marsh yes it is only a short distance from ameeron the marsh itself you go that way then you look for a monument in the shape of an eagle carved in black marble at the base of the monument is the entrance to the tunnel niun repeated this information parrotfashion and when he looked up his face was clearer what did i just tell you elric said you gave us instructions on how to reach the entrance to the tunnel under the marsh did i niun clapped his old hands splendid i have forgotten that now too who are you we are best forgotten said rackhir with a gentle smile farewell niun and thanks thanks for what both for remembering and for forgetting they walked on through the miserable city of ameeron away from the happy old sorcerer sighting the odd face staring at them from a doorway or a window doing their best to breathe as little of the foul air as possible i think perhaps that i envy niun alone of all the inhabitants of this desolate place said rackhir i pity him said elric why so it occurs to me that when he has forgotten everything he may well forget that he is allowed to leave ameeron rackhir laughed and slapped the albino upon his black armoured back you are a gloomy comrade friend elric are all your thoughts so hopeless they tend in that direction i fear said elric with a shadow of a smile the tunnel under the marsh and on they travelled through that sad and murky world until at last they came to the marsh the marsh was black black spiky vegetation grew in clumps here and there upon it it was cold and it was dank a dark mist swirled close to the surface and through the mist sometimes darted low shapes from the mist rose a solid black object which could only be the monument described by niun the monument said rackhir stopping and leaning on his bow its well out into the marsh and theres no evident pathway leading to it is this a problem do you think comrade elric elric waded cautiously into the edge of the marsh he felt the cold ooze drag at his feet he stepped back with some difficulty there must be a path said rackhir fingering his bony nose else how would your cousin cross elric looked over his shoulder at the red archer and he shrugged who knows he could be travelling with sorcerous companions who have no difficulty where marshes are concerned suddenly elric found himself sitting down upon the damp rock the stink of brine from the marsh seemed for a moment to have overwhelmed him he was feeling weak the effectiveness of his drugs last taken just as he stepped through the shade gate was beginning to fade rackhir came and stood by the albino he smiled with a certain amount of bantering sympathy well sir sorcerer cannot you summon similar aid elric shook his head i know little that is practical concerning the raising of small demons yyrkoon has all his grimoires his favourite spells his introductions to the demon worlds we shall have to find a path of the ordinary kind if we wish to reach yonder monument warrior priest of phum the warrior priest of phum drew a red kerchief from within his tunic and blew his nose for some time when he had finished he put down a hand helped elric to his feet and began to walk along the rim of the marsh keeping the black monument ever in sight it was some time later that they found a path at last and it was not a natural path but a slab of black marble extending out into the gloom of the mire slippery to the feet and itself covered with a film of ooze i would almost suspect this of being a false patha lure to take us to our death said rackhir as he and elric stood and looked at the long slab but what have we to lose now come said elric setting foot on the slab and beginning to make his cautious way along it in his hand he now held a torch of sorts a bundle of sputtering reeds which gave off an unpleasant yellow light and a considerable amount of greenish smoke but it was better than nothing rackhir testing each footstep with his unstrung bowstave followed behind whistling a small complicated tune as he went along another of his race would have recognised the tune as the song of the son of the hero of the high hell who is about to sacrifice his life a popular melody in phum particularly amongst the caste of the warrior priest elric found the tune irritating and distracting but he said nothing for he concentrated every fragment of his attention on keeping his balance upon the slippery surface of the slab which now appeared to rock slightly as if it floated on the surface of the marsh and now they were halfway to the monument whose shape could be clearly distinguished a great eagle with spread wings and a savage beak and claws extended for the kill an eagle in the same black marble as the slab on which they tried to keep their balance and elric was reminded of a tomb had some ancient hero been buried here or had the tomb been built to house the black swordsimprison them so that they might never enter the world of men again and steal mens souls the slab rocked more violently elric tried to remain upright but swayed first on one foot and then the other the brand waving crazily both feet slid from under him and he went flying into the marsh and was instantly buried up to his knees he began to sink somehow he had managed to keep his grip on the brand and by its light he could see the redclad archer peering forward elric im here rackhir youre sinking the marsh seems intent on swallowing me aye can you lie flat i can lie forward but my legs are trapped elric tried to move his body in the ooze which pressed against it something rushed past him in front of his face giving voice to a kind of muted gibbering elric did his best to control the fear which welled up in him i think you must give me up friend rackhir what and lose my means of getting out of this world you must think me more selfless than i am comrade elric here rackhir carefully lowered himself to the slab and reached out his arm towards elric both men were now covered in clinging slime both shivered with cold rackhir stretched and stretched and elric leaned forward as far as he could and tried to reach the hand but it was impossible and every second dragged him deeper into the stinking filth of the marsh then rackhir took up his bowstave and pushed that out grab the bow elric can you leaning forward and stretching every bone and muscle in his body elric just managed to get a grip on the bowstave now i mustah rackhir pulling at the bow found his own feet slipping and the slab beginning to rock quite wildly he flung out one arm to grab the far lip of the slab and with his other hand kept a grip on the bow hurry elric hurry elric began painfully to pull himself from the ooze the slab still rocked crazily and rackhirs hawklike face was almost as pale as elrics own as he desperately strove to keep his hold on both slab and bow and then elric all soaked in mire managed to reach the slab and crawl onto it the brand still sputtering in his hand and lie there gasping and gasping and gasping rackhir too was short of breath but he laughed what a fish ive caught he said the biggest yet id wager i am grateful to you rackhir the red archer i am grateful warrior priest of phum i owe you my life said elric after a while and i swear that whether im successful in my quest or not ill use all my powers to see you through the shade gate and back into the world from which we have both come rackhir said quietly you are a man elric of melnibone that is why i saved you there are few men in any world he shrugged and grinned now i suggest we continue towards yonder monument on our knees undignified it might be but safer it is also and it is but a short way to crawl elric agreed not much more time had passed in that timeless darkness before they had reached a little mossgrown island on which stood the monument of the eagle huge and heavy and towering above them into the greater gloom which was either the sky or the roof of the cavern and at the base of the plinth they saw a low doorway and the doorway was open a trap mused rackhir or does yyrkoon assume us perished in ameeron said elric wiping himself free of slime as best he could he sighed lets enter and be done with it and so they entered they found themselves in a small room elric cast the faint light of a brand about the place and saw another doorway the rest of the room was featurelesseach wall made of the same faintly glistening black marble the room was filled with silence neither man spoke both walked unfalteringly towards the next doorway and when they found steps began to descend the steps which wound down and down into total darkness for a long time they descended still without speaking until eventually they reached the bottom and saw before them the entrance to a narrow tunnel which was irregularly shaped so that it seemed more the work of nature than of some intelligence moisture dripped from the roof of the tunnel and fell with the regularity of heartbeats to the floor seeming to echo a deeper sound far far away emanating from somewhere in the tunnel itself elric heard rackhir clear his throat this is without doubt a tunnel said the red archer and it unquestionably leads under the marsh elric felt that rackhir shared his reluctance to enter the tunnel he stood with the guttering brand held high listening to the sound of the drops falling to the floor of the tunnel trying to recognise that other sound which came so faintly from the depths and then he forced himself forward almost running into the tunnel his ears filled with a sudden roaring which might have come from within his head or from some other source in the tunnel he heard rackhirs footfalls behind him he drew his sword the sword of the dead hero aubec and he heard the hissing of his own breath echo from the walls of the tunnel which was now alive with sounds of every sort elric shuddered but he did not pause the tunnel was warm the floor felt spongy beneath his feet the smell of brine persisted and now he could see that the walls of the tunnel were smoother that they seemed to shiver with quick regular movement he heard rackhir gasp behind him as the archer too noted the peculiar nature of the tunnel its like flesh murmured the warrior priest of phum like flesh elric could not bring himself to reply all his attention was required to force himself forward he was consumed by terror his whole body shook he sweated and his legs threatened to buckle under him his grip was so weak that he could barely keep his sword from falling to the floor and there were hints of something in his memory something which his brain refused to consider had he been here before his trembling increased his stomach turned but he still stumbled on the brand held before him and now the soft steady thrumming sound grew louder and he saw ahead a small almost circular aperture at the very end of the tunnel he stopped swaying the tunnel ends whispered rackhir there is no way through the small aperture was pulsing with a swift strong beat the pulsing cavern elric whispered that is what we should find at the end of the tunnel under the marsh that must be the entrance rackhir it is too small for a man to enter elric said rackhir reasonably no elric stumbled forward until he stood close to the opening he sheathed his sword he handed the brand to rackhir and then before the warrior priest of phum could stop him he had flung himself headfirst through the gap wriggling his body throughand the walls of the aperture parted for him and then closed behind him leaving rackhir on the other side elric got slowly to his feet a faint pinkish light now came from the walls and ahead of him was another entrance slightly larger than the other through which he had just come the air was warm and thick and salty it almost stifled him his head throbbed and his body ached and he could barely act or think save to force himself onward on faltering legs he flung himself towards the next entrance as the great muffled pulsing sounded louder and louder in his ears elric rackhir stood behind him pale and sweating he had abandoned the brand and followed elric through elric licked dry lips and tried to speak rackhir came closer elric said thickly rackhir you should not be here i said i would help aye but then help i shall elric had no strength for arguing so he nodded and with his hands forced back the soft walls of the second aperture and saw that it led into a cavern whose round wall quivered to a steady pulsing and in the centre of the cavern hanging in the air without any support at all were two swords two identical swords huge and fine and black and standing beneath the swords his expression gloating and greedy stood prince yyrkoon of melnibone reaching up for them his lips moving but no words escaping from him and elric himself was able to voice but one word as he climbed through and stood upon that shuddering floor no he said yyrkoon heard the word he turned with terror in his face he snarled when he saw elric and then he too voiced a word which was at once a scream of outrage no with an effort elric dragged aubecs blade from its scabbard but it seemed too heavy to hold upright it tugged his arm so that it rested on the floor his arm hanging straight at his side elric drew deep breaths of heavy air into his lungs his vision was dimming yyrkoon had become a shadow only the two black swords standing still and cool in the very centre of the circular chamber were in focus elric sensed rackhir enter the chamber and stand beside him yyrkoon said elric at last those swords are mine yyrkoon smiled and reached up towards the blades a peculiar moaning sound seemed to issue from them a faint black radiance seemed to emanate from them elric saw the runes carved into them and he was afraid rackhir fitted an arrow to his bow he drew the string back to his shoulder sighting along the arrow at prince yyrkoon if he must die elric tell me slay him said elric and rackhir released the string but the arrow moved very slowly through the air and then hung halfway between the archer and his intended target yyrkoon turned a ghastly grin on his face mortal weapons are useless here he said elric said to rackhir he must be right and your life is in danger rackhir go rackhir gave him a puzzled look no i must stay here and help you elric shook his head you cannot help you will only die if you stay go reluctantly the red archer unstrung his bow glanced suspiciously up at the two black swords then squeezed his way through the doorway and was gone now yyrkoon said elric letting aubecs sword fall to the floor we must settle this you and i two black swords and then the runeblades stormbringer and mournblade were gone from where they had hung so long and stormbringer had settled into elrics right hand and mournblade lay in prince yyrkoons right hand and the two men stood on opposite sides of the pulsing cavern and regarded first each other and then the swords they held the swords were singing their voices were faint but could be heard quite plainly elric lifted the huge blade easily and turned it this way and that admiring its alien beauty stormbringer he said and then he felt afraid it was suddenly as if he had been born again and that this runesword was born with him it was as if they had never been separate stormbringer and the sword moaned sweetly and settled even more smoothly into his grasp stormbringer yelled elric and he leapt at his cousin stormbringer and he was full of fearso full of fear and the fear brought a wild kind of delighta demonic need to fight and kill his cousin to sink the blade deep into yyrkoons heart to take vengeance to spill blood to send a soul to hell and now prince yyrkoons cry could be heard above the thrum of the swordvoices the drumming of the pulse of the cavern mournblade and mournblade came up to meet stormbringers blow and turn that blow and thrust back at elric who swayed aside and brought stormbringer round and down in a sidestroke which knocked yyrkoon and mournblade backward for an instant but stormbringers next thrust was met again and the next thrust was met and the next if the swordsmen were evenly matched then so were the blades which seemed possessed of their own wills though they performed the wills of their wielders and the clang of the metal upon metal turned into a wild metallic song which the swords sang a joyful song as if they were glad at last to be back to battling though they battled each other and elric barely saw his cousin prince yyrkoon at all save for an occasional flash of his dark wild face elrics attention was given entirely to the two black swords for it seemed that the swords fought with the life of one of the swordsmen as a prize and that the rivalry between elric and yyrkoon was nothing compared with the brotherly rivalry between the swords who seemed full of pleasure at the chance to engage again after many millennia and this observation as he foughtand fought for his soul as well as his lifegave elric pause to consider his hatred of yyrkoon kill yyrkoon he would but not at the will of another power not to give sport to these alien swords mournblades point darted at his eyes and stormbringer rose to deflect the thrust once more elric no longer fought his cousin he fought the will of the two black swords stormbringer dashed for yyrkoons momentarily undefended throat elric clung to the sword and dragged it back sparing his cousins life stormbringer whined almost petulantly like a dog stopped from biting an intruder and elric spoke through clenched teeth ill not be your puppet runeblade if we must be united let it be upon a proper understanding the sword seemed to hesitate to drop its guard and elric was hard put to defend himself against the whirling attack of mournblade which in turn seemed to sense its advantage elric felt fresh energy pour up his right arm and into his body this was what the sword could do with it he needed no drugs would never be weak again in battle he would triumph at peace he could rule with pride when he travelled it could be alone and without fear it was as if the sword reminded him of all these things even as it returned mournblades attack and what must the sword have in return elric knew the sword told him without words of any sort stormbringer needed to fight for that was its reason for existence stormbringer needed to kill for that was its source of energy the lives and the souls of men demonseven gods and elric hesitated even as his cousin gave a huge cackling yell and dashed at him so that mournblade glanced off his helm and he was flung backwards and down and saw yyrkoon gripping his moaning black sword in both hands to plunge the runeblade into elrics body and elric knew he would do anything to resist that fatefor his soul to be drawn into mournblade and his strength to feed prince yyrkoons strength and he rolled aside very quickly and got to one knee and turned and lifted stormbringer with one gauntleted hand upon the blade and the other upon the hilt to take the great blow prince yyrkoon brought upon it and the two black swords shrieked as if in pain and they shivered and black radiance poured from them as blood might pour from a man pierced by many arrows and elric was driven still on his knees away from the radiance gasping and sighing and peering here and there for sight of yyrkoon who had disappeared and elric knew that stormbringer spoke to him again if elric did not wish to die by mournblade then elric must accept the bargain which the black sword offered he must not die said elric i will not slay him to make sport for you and through the black radiance ran yyrkoon snarling and snapping and whirling his runesword again stormbringer darted through an opening and again elric made the blade pull back and yyrkoon was only grazed stormbringer writhed in elrics hands elric said you shall not be my master and stormbringer seemed to understand and become quieter as if reconciled and elric laughed thinking that he now controlled the runesword and that from now on the blade would do his bidding we shall disarm yyrkoon said elric we shall not kill him elric rose to his feet stormbringer moved with all the speed of a needlethin rapier it feinted it parried it thrust yyrkoon who had been grinning in triumph snarled and staggered back the grin dropping from his sullen features stormbringer now worked for elric it made the moves that elric wished to make both yyrkoon and mournblade seemed disconcerted by this turn of events mournblade shouted as if in astonishment at its brothers behaviour elric struck at yyrkoons swordarm pierced clothpierced fleshpierced sinewpierced bone blood came soaking yyrkoons arm and dripping down onto the hilt of the sword the blood was slippery it weakened yyrkoons grip on his runesword he took it in both hands but he was unable to hold it firmly elric too took stormbringer in both hands unearthly strength surged through him with a gigantic blow he dashed stormbringer against mournblade where blade met hilt the runesword few from yyrkoons grasp it sped across the pulsing cavern elric smiled he had defeated his own swords will and in turn had defeated the brother sword mournblade fell against the wall of the pulsing cavern and for a moment was still a groan then seemed to escape the defeated runesword a highpitched shriek filled the pulsing cavern blackness flooded over the eery pink light and extinguished it when the light returned elric saw that a scabbard lay at his feet the scabbard was black and of the same alien craftsmanship as the runesword elric saw yyrkoon the prince was on his knees and he was sobbing his eyes darting about the pulsing cavern seeking mournblade looking at elric with fright as if he knew he must now be slain mournblade yyrkoon said hopelessly he knew he was to die mournblade had vanished from the pulsing cavern your sword is gone said elric quietly yyrkoon whimpered and tried to crawl towards the entrance of the cavern but the entrance had shrunk to the size of a small coin yyrkoon wept stormbringer trembled as if thirsty for yyrkoons soul elric stooped yyrkoon began to speak rapidly do not slay me elricnot with that runeblade i will do anything you wish i will die in any other way elric said we are victims cousin of a conspiracya game played by gods demons and sentient swords they wish one of us dead i suspect they wish you dead more than they wish me dead and that is the reason why i shall not slay you here he picked up the scabbard he forced stormbringer into it and at once the sword was quiet elric took off his old scabbard and looked around for aubecs sword but that too was gone he dropped the old scabbard and hooked the new one to his belt he rested his left hand upon the pommel of stormbringer and he looked not without sympathy upon the creature that was his cousin you are a worm yyrkoon but is that your fault yyrkoon gave him a puzzled glance i wonder if you had all your desire would you cease to be a worm cousin yyrkoon raised himself to his knees a little hope began to show in his eyes elric smiled and drew a deep breath we shall see he said you must agree to wake cymoril from her sorcerous slumber you have humbled me elric said yyrkoon in a small pitiful voice i will wake her or would can you not undo your spell we cannot escape from the pulsing cavern it is past the time whats this i did not think you would follow me and then i thought i would easily finish you and now it is past the time one can keep the entrance open for only a little while it will admit anyone who cares to enter the pulsing cavern but it will let noone out after the power of the spell dies i gave much to know that spell you have given too much for everything said elric he went to the entrance and peered through rackhir waited on the other side the red archer had an anxious expression elric said warrior priest of phum it seems that my cousin and i are trapped in here the entrance will not part for us elric tested the warm moist stuff of the wall it would not open more than a tiny fraction it seems that you can join us or else go back if you do join us you share our fate it is not much of a fate if i go back said rackhir what chances have you one said elric i can invoke my patron a lord of chaos rackhir made a wry face exactly said elric i speak of arioch arioch eh well he does not care for renegades from phum what do you choose to do rackhir stepped forward elric stepped back through the opening came rackhirs head followed by his shoulders followed by the rest of him the entrance closed again immediately rackhir stood up and untangled the string of his bow from the stave smoothing it i agreed to share your fateto gamble all on escaping from this plane said the red archer he looked surprised when he saw yyrkoon your enemy is still alive aye you are merciful indeed perhaps or obstinate i would not slay him merely because some supernatural agency used him as a pawn to be killed if i should win the lords of the higher worlds do not as yet control me completelynor will they if i have any power at all to resist them rackhir grinned i share your viewthough im not optimistic about its realism i see you have one of those black swords at your belt will that not hack a way through the cavern no said yyrkoon from his place against the wall nothing can harm the stuff of the pulsing cavern ill believe you said elric for i do not intend to draw this new sword of mine often i must learn how to control it first so arioch must be summoned rackhir sighed if that is possible said elric he will doubtless destroy me said rackhir looking to elric in the hope that the albino would deny this statement elric looked grave i might be able to strike a bargain with him it will also test something elric turned his back on rackhir and on yyrkoon he adjusted his mind he sent it out through vast spaces and complicated mazes and he cried arioch arioch aid me arioch he had a sense of something listening to him arioch something shifted in the places where his mind went arioch and arioch heard him he knew it was arioch rackhir gave a horrified yell yyrkoon screamed elric turned and saw that something disgusting had appeared near the far wall it was black and it was foul and it slobbered and its shape was intolerably alien was this arioch how could it be arioch was beautiful but perhaps thought elric this was ariochs true shape upon this plane in this peculiar cavern arioch could not deceive those who looked upon him but then the shape had disappeared and a beautiful youth with ancient eyes stood looking at the three mortals you have won the sword elric said arioch ignoring the others i congratulate you and you have spared your cousins life why so more than one reason said elric but let us say he must remain alive in order to wake cymoril ariochs face bore a little secret smile for a moment and elric realised that he had avoided a trap if he had killed yyrkoon cymoril would never have woken again and what is this little traitor doing with you arioch turned a cold eye on rackhir who did his best to stare back at the chaos lord he is my friend said elric i made a bargain with him if he aided me to find the black sword then i would take him back with me to our own plane that is impossible rackhir is an exile here that is his punishment he comes back with me said elric and now he unhooked the scabbard holding stormbringer from his belt and he held the sword out before him or i do not take the sword with me failing that we all three remain here for eternity that is not sensible elric consider your responsibilities i have considered them that is my decision ariochs smooth face had just a tinge of anger you must take the sword it is your destiny so you say but i now know that the sword may only be borne by me you cannot bear it arioch or you would only ior another mortal like mecan take it from the pulsing cavern is that not so you are clever elric of melnibone arioch spoke with sardonic admiration and you are a fitting servant of chaos very wellthat traitor can go with you but he would be best warned to tread warily the lords of chaos have been known to bear malice rackhir said hoarsely so i have heard my lord arioch arioch ignored the archer the man of phum is not after all important and if you wish to spare your cousins life so be it it matters little destiny can contain a few extra threads in her design and still accomplish her original aims very well then said elric take us from this place where to why to melnibone if you please with a smile that was almost tender arioch looked down on elric and a silky hand stroked elrics cheek arioch had grown to twice his original size oh you are surely the sweetest of all my slaves said the lord of chaos and there was a whirling there was a sound like the roar of the sea there was a dreadful sense of nausea and three weary men stood on the floor of the great throne room in imrryr the throne room was deserted save that in one corner a black shape like smoke writhed for a moment and then was gone rackhir crossed the floor and seated himself carefully upon the first step to the ruby throne yyrkoon and elric remained where they were staring into each others eyes then elric laughed and slapped his scabbarded sword now you must fulfil your promises to me cousin then i have a proposition to put to you it is like a market place said rackhir leaning on one elbow and inspecting the feather in his scarlet hat so many bargains the pale kings mercy yyrkoon stepped back from his sisters bed he was worn and his features were drawn and there was no spirit in him as he said it is done he turned away and looked through the window at the towers of imrryr at the harbour where the returned golden battlebarges rode at anchor together with the ship which had been king straashas gift to elric she will wake in a moment added yyrkoon absently dyvim tvar and rackhir the red archer looked inquiringly at elric who kneeled by the bed staring into the face of cymoril her face grew peaceful as he watched and for one terrible moment he suspected prince yyrkoon of tricking him and of killing cymoril but then the eyelids moved and the eyes opened and she saw him and she smiled elric the dreams you are safe i am safe cymoril as are you yyrkoon he woke you but you swore to slay him i was as much subject to sorcery as you my mind was confused it is still confused where some matters are concerned but yyrkoon is changed now i defeated him he does not doubt my power he no longer lusts to usurp me you are merciful elric she brushed raven hair from her face elric exchanged a glance with rackhir it might not be mercy which moves me said elric it might merely be a sense of fellowship with yyrkoon fellowship surely you cannot feel we are both mortal we were both victims of a game played between the lords of the higher worlds my loyalty must finally be to my own kindand that is why i ceased to hate yyrkoon and that is mercy said cymoril yyrkoon walked towards the door may i leave my lord emperor elric thought he detected a strange light in his defeated cousins eyes but perhaps it was only humility or despair he nodded yyrkoon went from the room closing the door softly dyvim tvar said trust yyrkoon not at all elric he will betray you again the lord of the dragon caves was troubled no said elric if he does not fear me he fears the sword i now carry and you should fear that sword said dyvim tvar no said elric i am the master of the sword dyvim tvar made to speak again but then shook his head almost sorrowfully bowed and together with rackhir the red archer left elric and cymoril alone cymoril took elric in her arms they kissed they wept there were celebrations in melnibone for a week now almost all the ships and men and dragons were home and elric was home having proved his right to rule so well that all his strange quirks of character were accepted by the populace in the throne room there was a ball and it was the most lavish ball any of the courtiers had ever known elric danced with cymoril taking a full part in the activities only yyrkoon did not dance preferring to remain in a quiet corner below the gallery of the musicslaves ignored by the guests rackhir the red archer danced with several melnibonean ladies and made assignations with them all for he was a hero now in melnibone dyvim tvar danced too though his eyes were often brooding when they fell upon prince yyrkoon and later when people ate elric spoke to cymoril as they sat together on the dais of the ruby throne would you be empress cymoril you know i will marry you elric we have both known that for many a year have we not so you would be my wife aye she laughed for she thought he joked and not be empress for a year at least what mean you my lord i must go away from melnibone cymoril for a year what i have learned in recent months has made me want to travel the young kingdomssee how other nations conduct their affairs for i think melnibone must change if she is to survive she could become a great force for good in the world for she still has much power for good cymoril was surprised and there was a little alarm in her voice too melnibone has never stood for good or for evil but for herself and the satisfaction of her desires i would see that changed you intend to alter everything i intend to travel the world and then decide if there is any point to such a decision the lords of the higher worlds have ambitions in our world though they have given me aid of late i fear them i should like to see if it is possible for men to rule their own affairs and you will go there were tears in her eyes when tomorrowwhen rackhir leaves we will take king straashas ship and make for the isle of the purple towns where rackhir has friends will you come i cannot imaginei cannot oh elric why spoil this happiness we now have because i feel that the happiness cannot last unless we know completely what we are she frowned then you must discover that if that is what you wish she said slowly but it is for you to discover alone elric for i have no such desire you must go by yourself into those barbarian lands you will not accompany me it is not possible ii am melnibonean she sighed i love you elric and i you cymoril then we shall be married when you return in a year elric was full of sorrow but he knew that his decision was correct if he did not leave he would grow restless soon enough and if he grew restless he might come to regard cymoril as an enemy someone who had trapped him then you must rule as empress until i return he said no elric i cannot take that responsibility then who dyvim tvar i know dyvim tvar he will not take such power magum colim perhaps no then you must stay elric but elrics gaze had travelled through the crowd in the throne room below it stopped when it reached a lonely figure seated by itself under the gallery of the musicslaves and elric smiled ironically and said then it must be yyrkoon cymoril was horrified no elric he will abuse any power not now and it is just he is the only one who wanted to be emperor now he can rule as emperor for a year in my stead if he rules well i may consider abdicating in his favour if he rules badly it will prove once and for all that his ambitions were misguided elric said cymoril i love you but you are a foola criminal if you trust yyrkoon again no he said evenly i am not a fool all i am is elric i cannot help that cymoril it is elric that i love she cried but elric is doomed we are all doomed unless you remain here now i cannot because i love you cymoril i cannot she stood up she was weeping she was lost and i am cymoril she said you will destroy us both her voice softened and she stroked his hair you will destroy us elric no he said i will build something that will be better i will discover things when i return we shall marry and we shall live long and we shall be happy cymoril and now elric had told three lies the first concerned his cousin yyrkoon the second concerned the black sword the third concerned cymoril and upon those three lies was elrics destiny to be built for it is only about things which concern us most profoundly that we lie clearly and with profound conviction epilogue there was a port called menii which was one of the humblest and friendliest of the purple towns like the others on the isle it was built mainly of the purple stone which gave the towns their name and there were red roofs on the houses and there were brightsailed boats of all kinds in the harbour as elric and rackhir the red archer came ashore in the early morning when just a few sailors were beginning to make their way down to their ships king straashas lovely ship lay some way out beyond the harbour wall they had used a small boat to cross the water between it and the town they turned and looked back at the ship they had sailed it themselves without crew and the ship had sailed well so i must seek peace and mythic tanelorn said rackhir with a certain amount of selfmockery he stretched and yawned and the bow and the quiver danced on his back elric was dressed in simple costume that might have marked any soldieroffortune of the young kingdoms he looked fit and relaxed he smiled into the sun the only remarkable thing about his garb was the great black runesword at his side since he had donned the sword he had needed no drugs to sustain him at all and i must seek knowledge in the lands i find marked upon my map said elric i must learn and i must carry what i learn back to melnibone at the end of a year i wish that cymoril had accompanied me but i understand her reluctance you will go back rackhir said when a year is over she will draw me back elric laughed my only fear is that i will weaken and return before my quest is finished i should like to come with you said rackhir for i have travelled in most lands and would be as good a guide as i was in the netherworld but i am sworn to find tanelorn for all i know it does not really exist i hope that you find it warrior priest of phum said elric i shall never be that again said rackhir then his eyes widened a little why lookyour ship and elric looked and saw the ship that had once been called the ship which sails over land and sea and he saw that slowly it was sinking king straasha was taking it back the elementals are friends at least he said but i fear their power wanes as the power of melnibone wanes for all that we of the dragon isle are considered evil by the folk of the young kingdoms we share much in common with the spirits of air earth fire and water rackhir said as the masts of the ship disappeared beneath the waves i envy you those friends elric you may trust them aye rackhir looked at the runesword hanging on elrics hip but you would be wise to trust nothing else he added elric laughed fear not for me rackhir for i am my own masterfor a year at least and i am master of this sword now the sword seemed to stir at his side and he took firm hold of its grip and slapped rackhir on the back and he laughed and shook his white hair so that it drifted in the air and he lifted his strange red eyes to the sky and he said i shall be a new man when i return to melnibone here ends book one of the elric saga
