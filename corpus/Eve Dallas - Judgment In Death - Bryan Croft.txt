 chapter one she stood in purgatory and studied death the blood and the gore of it the ferocity of its glee it had come to this place with the willful temper of a child full of heat and passion and careless brutality murder was rarely a tidy business whether it was craftily calculated or wildly impulsive it tended to leave a mess for others to clean up it was her job to wade through the debris of murder to pick up the pieces see where they fit and put together a picture of the life that had been stolen and through that picture to find the image of a killer now in the early hours of morning in the hesitant spring of her boots crunched over a jagged sea of broken glass her eyes brown and cool scanned the scene shattered mirrors broken bottles splintered wood wall screens were smashed privacy booths scarred and dented pricey leather and cloth that had covered stools or the plusher seating areas had been ripped to colorful shreds what had once been an upscale strip club was now a jumbled pile of expensive garbage what had once been a man lay behind the wide curve of the bar now a victim sprawled in his own blood lieutenant eve dallas crouched beside him she was a cop and that made him hers male black late thirties massive trauma head and body multiple broken bones she took a gauge from her field kit to take the body and ambient temperatures looks like the fractured skull would have done the job but it didnt stop there he was beaten to pieces eve acknowledged her aides comment with a grunt she was looking at what was left of a wellbuilt man in his prime a good sixtwo and two hundred and thirty pounds of what had been toned muscle what do you see peabody automatically peabody shifted her stance focused her vision the victim well it appears the victim was struck from behind the first blow probably took him down or at least dazed him the killer followed through with repeated strikes from the pattern of the blood splatter and brain matter he was taken out with head shots then beaten while down likely unconscious some of the injuries were certainly delivered postmortem the metal bat is the probable murder weapon and was used by someone of considerable strength possibly chemically induced as the scene indicates excessive violence often demonstrated by users of zeus time of death oh four hundred eve stated then turned her head to look up at peabody her aide was starched and pressed and as official as they came with her uniform cap set precisely on her dark chinlength hair she had good eyes eve thought clear and dark and though the sheer vileness of the scene had leached some of the color from her cheeks she was holding motive eve asked it appears to be robbery lieutenant why the cash drawers open and empty the credit machines broken mmmhmm snazzy place like this would be heavier in credits but theyd do some cash business zeus addicts kill for spare change true enough but what would our victim have been doing alone in a closed club with an addict why would he let anyone hopped on zeus behind the bar and with her sealed fingers she picked up a small silver credit chip from the river of blood why would our addict leave these behind a number of them are scattered here around the body he could have dropped them but peabody began to think she wasnt seeing something eve did could have she counted the coins as she picked them up thirty in all sealed them in an evidence bag and handed it to peabody then she picked up the bat it was fouled with blood and brain about two feet in length she judged and weighted to mean business mean business its good solid metal not something an addict would pick up in some abandoned building were going to find this belonged here behind the bar were going to find peabody that our victim knew his killer maybe they were having an afterhours drink her eyes narrowed as she pictured it maybe they had words and the words escalated more likely our killer already had an edge on he knew where the bat was came behind the bar something hed done before so our friend here doesnt think anything of it hes not concerned doesnt worry about turning his back she did so herself measuring the position of the body of the splatter the first blow rams him face first into the glass on the back wall look at the cuts on his face those arent nicks from flying glass theyre too long too deep he manages to turn and thats where the killer takes the next swing here across the jaw that spins him around again he grabs the shelves there brings them down bottles crashing thats when he took the killing blow this one that cracked his skull like an egg she crouched again sat back on her heels after that the killer just beat the hell out of him then wrecked the place maybe in temper maybe as cover but he had enough control to come back here to look at his handiwork before he left he dropped the bat here when he was done he wanted it to look like a robbery like an illegals overkill yeah or our victim was a moron and im giving him too much credit you got the body and immediate scene recorded all angles yes sir lets turn him over the shattered bones shifted like a sack of broken crockery as eve turned the body goddamn it oh goddamn it she reached down to lift the smeared id from the cool congealing pool of blood with her sealed thumb she wiped at the photo and the shield he was on the job he was a cop peabody stepped forward she heard the sudden silence the crime scene team and the sweepers working on the other side of the bar stopped talking stopped moving a half dozen faces turned waited kohli detective taj eves face was grim as she got to her feet he was one of us o o peabody crossed the littered floor to where eve stood watching the remains of detective taj kohli being bagged for transferal to the morgue i got his basics dallas hes out of the one twentyeight assigned to illegals been on the job for eight years came out of the military he was thirtyseven married two kids anything pop on his record no sir its clean lets find out if he was working undercover here or just moonlighting elliott i want those security discs there arent any one of the crime scene team hurried over his face was folded into angry lines cleaned out every one of them the place had full scope and this son of a bitch snagged every one we got nothing covered his tracks with her hands on her hips eve turned a circle the club was tripleleveled with a stage on the main dance floors on one and two privacy rooms ringed the top for full scope she estimated it would need a dozen cameras probably more to snag all the record discs would have taken time and care he knew the place she decided or hes a fucking security whiz window dressing she muttered all this destructions just window dressing he knew what he was doing he had control peabody find out who owns the place who runs it i want to know everybody who works here i want to know the setup lieutenant a harassedlooking sweeper trudged through the chaos theres a civilian outside there are a lot of civilians outside lets keep them there yes sir but this one insists on speaking to you he says this is his place and ah and ah what and that youre his wife roarke entertainment peabody announced as she read off the data from her palm pc she sent eve a cautious smile guess who owns purgatory i shouldve figured it resigned eve strode to the entrance door o o he looked very much as hed looked two hours before when theyd parted ways to go about their individual business sleek and gorgeous the light topcoat he wore over his dark suit fluttered a bit in the breeze the same breeze that tugged at the mane of black hair that framed his poetically sinful face the dark glasses he wore against the glare of the sun only added to the look of slick elegance and when he slipped them off as she stepped out the brilliant blue of his eyes met hers he tucked the glasses in his pocket lifted an eyebrow good morning lieutenant i had a bad feeling when i walked in here its just your kind of place isnt it why do you have to own every damn thing it was a boyhood dream his voice cruised over ireland picked up the music of it he glanced past her to the police seal it appears weve both been inconvenienced did you have to tell the sweeper i was your wife you are my wife he said easily and shifted his gaze back to her face a fact which pleases me daily he took her hand rubbing his thumb over her wedding ring before she could tug it free again no touching she hissed at him which made him smile thats not what you said a few hours ago in fact shut up roarke she glanced around though none of the cops working the scene was outside or close enough to hear this is a police investigation so im told and who told you the head of the maintenance team who found the body he did call the police first he pointed out but its natural hed report the incident to me what happened there was no point in griping because his business had tangled around hers again she tried to console herself that he could and would help her cut through some of the muck of paperwork do you have a bartender by the name of kohli taj kohli i have no idea but i can find out he took a slim memo book out of his breast pocket keyed in a request for data is he dead as dead gets yes he was mine roarke confirmed and the irish in his voice had taken on a cold note for the past three months part time four nights a week he had a family yes i know such things mattered to him and it always touched her heart he was a cop eve said this time his brows lifted didnt have that data in your little scan did you no it seems my personnel director was careless that will be fixed am i allowed inside yeah in a minute how long have you owned the place four years more or less how many employees full and parttime ill get you all the data lieutenant and answer all pertinent questions annoyance gleamed in his eyes as he reached for the door himself but now id like to see my place he pushed inside scanned the destruction then focused in on the thick black bag being loaded on what the death attendants called a stroller how was he killed thoroughly eve said then sighed when roarke simply turned and stared at her it was ugly okay metal bat she watched roarke look toward the bar and the spray of blood sparkling on glass like an incomprehensible painting after the first few hits he wouldnt have felt anything ever had a bat laid into you i have he said before she could answer its not pleasant it seems farfetched to think its robbery even one that got well out of hand why thered have been enough prime liquor easily fenced to keep anyone cozily fixed for some time why break the bottles when you could sell them if you hit a place like this its not for the bit of cash that might be copped but for the inventory and perhaps some of the equipment is that the voice of experience she teased a grin out of him naturally my experience that is as a property owner and a lawabiding citizen right security discs gone he got all of them then it follows hed cased the place carefully beforehand how many cameras once again roarke took out his pad checked data eighteen nine on this floor six on two and the other two on the top level for full scope before you ask closing is at three which would have staff out by half past the last show and weve live ones here ends at two the musicians and the entertainers strippers as you like he said mildly they clock off at that time ill have names and schedules for you within the hour appreciate it why purgatory the name the ghost of a smile flirted with his mouth i liked it the priests will tell you purgatorys a place for atonement rehabilitation perhaps a bit like prison ive always seen it as a last chance to be human he decided before you strap on your wings and halo or face the fire which would you rather she wondered the wings or the fire thats the point you see i prefer being human as the stroller wheeled by he ran a hand over her short brown hair im sorry for this so am i any reason a new york city detective would have been working undercover in purgatory i couldnt say its certainly likely that some of the clientele might dabble in areas not strictly approved by the nypsd but ive not been informed of anything overt some illegals might change hands in privacy rooms or under tables but theres been no large transactions here i would have known the strippers dont turn tricks unless theyre licensed which some are no one under age is allowed through the doors as client or staff i have my own standards lieutenant such as they are im not coming down on you i need a picture youre pissed that im here at all she waited a minute her short choppy hair disordered from its dance outside in the early breeze as the morgue techs opened the door to transfer kohli the sounds of the day punched into the club traffic was already thickening cars crammed irritably on the street air commuters swarmed the skies she heard the call of an earlybird glidecart operator call to the techs and ask what da fuck okay im pissed that youre here at all ill get over it whens the last time you were in here months it ran well and didnt need my direct attention who manages it for you rue maclean ill get her information to you as well sooner than later do you want to go through the place now no point in it until ive refreshed myself on how it was ill want to be let back in once ive done that ill take care of it yes peabody she said turning as her aide inched forward and cleared her throat sorry sir but i thought youd want to know i reached the victims squad captain theyre sending a member of his unit and a counselor to inform next of kin they need to know if they should wait for you or see the wife alone tell them to wait well head over now and meet them i have to go she said to roarke i dont envy you your job lieutenant because he needed it he took her hand linked their fingers firmly but ill let you get back to it ill have the information you wanted to you as soon as i can roarke she called as he started for the door im sorry about your place wood and glass theres plenty more he replied as he looked at her over his shoulder he doesnt mean it eve murmured when hed shut the door behind him sir they messed with him he wont let it go eve heaved out a breath come on peabody lets go see the wife and get this particular hell over with o o the kohlis lived in a decent midlevel building on the east side the kind of place eve mused where you found young families and older retired couples not hip enough for the single crowd not cheap enough for the struggling it was a simple multiunit pleasantly if not elegantly rehabbed posturban wars door security was a basic code entry eve spotted the cops before shed doubleparked and flipped her on duty light to active the woman was well turned out with giltedged hair that curved up to her cheeks in two stiletto points she wore sun shades and an inexpensive business suit in navy the shoes with their thin twoinch heels told eve she worked a desk brass eve was sure of it the man had good shoulders and a bit of pudge at the middle hed let his hair go gray and there was a lot of it currently it was dancing in the breeze around his quiet composed face he wore cop shoes hardsoled and buffed to a gleam his suit jacket was a little small in the body and starting to fray at the cuffs a longtimer eve judged whod moved from beat to street to desk lieutenant dallas the woman stepped forward but didnt offer her hand for a polite shake i recognized you you get a lot of play in the media it wasnt said with rebuke but there was a hint of it in the air nonetheless im captain roth from the one twentyeight this is sergeant clooney out of my house hes here as grief counselor thanks for waiting officer peabody my aide what is the status of your investigation lieutenant detective kohlis body is with the me and will have priority my report will be written and filed subsequent to notification of next of kin she paused to avoid shouting over the sudden blast of a maxibus that pulled to the curb half a block down at this point captain roth i have a dead police officer who was the apparent victim of a particularly brutal beating in the early hours of this morning while he was in a club after hours a club where he was employed as a parttime bartender robbery unlikely then what is the motive in your opinion a little seed of resentment planted itself in eves gut it would she knew fester there if she wasnt careful ive formed no opinion as to motive at this stage of my investigation captain roth do you want to stand on the street and question me or would you prefer to read my report when its filed roth opened her mouth then sucked in a breath point taken lieutenant detective kohli worked under me for five years ill be straight with you i want this investigation handled out of my house i appreciate your feelings in this matter captain roth i can only assure you that as long as im primary the investigation into the death of detective kohli will receive my complete focus take off the damn shades eve thought i want to see your eyes you can request the transfer of authority eve continued but ill be straight with you i wont give it up easy i stood over him this morning i saw what was done to him you couldnt want his killer any more than i do captain clooney stepped forward laying a hand lightly on roths arm at the elbow there were lines fanning out from his pale blue eyes they made him look tired and somehow trustworthy lieutenant emotions are running pretty high right now for all of us but weve got a job to do here and now he glanced up homing in on a window four stories above whatever were feeling doesnt come close to whats going to be felt upstairs youre right youre right art lets get this done roth turned to the entrance bypassed the code with her master lieutenant clooney hung back i know youll want to question patsy tajs wife i have to ask if you could go a little easy just now i know what shes about to go through i lost a son in the line of duty a few months back it rips a hole in you im not going to kick her while shes down clooney eve shoved through the doors caught herself turned back i didnt know him she said more calmly but he was murdered and he was a cop thats enough for me okay yeah yeah okay christ i hate this she followed roth to the elevator how do you do it she asked clooney the counseling thing how do you stand it to tell you the truth they tapped me for it because i have a way with keeping the peace mediation he added with a quick smile i agreed to survivor counseling to give it a try and found i could do some good you know what they feel every stage of it he pressed his lips together as they stepped onto the elevator the smile was long gone you stand it because maybe you can help just a little it makes a difference if the counselors a cop and ive discovered in the last few months it makes a bigger one if the counselors a cop who experienced a loss you ever lose a family member lieutenant eve flashed on a dingy room the bloody husk of a man and the child shed been huddled broken in a corner i dont have any family well was all clooney said as they stepped off on the fourth floor she would know and they were all aware of it a cops spouse would know the minute she opened the door how the words were spoken varied little and it didnt matter a damn the minute the door opened lives were irrevocably changed they didnt have the chance to knock before it began patsy kohli was a pretty woman with smooth ebony skin and a closely cropped thatch of black curls she was dressed to go out a baby sling strapped across her breasts the small boy at her side had his hand clasped in hers as he danced frantically in place lets go swing lets go swing but his mother had frozen in place the laughter that had been in her eyes dying away she lifted one hand pressing it to the baby and the baby to her heart taj roth had taken off her sunshades her eyes were coldly blue rigidly blank patsy we need to come in taj patsy stood where she was slowly shaking her head taj here now patsy clooney moved in sliding an arm around her shoulders why dont we sit down no no no the little boy began to cry wailing yelps as he tugged on his mothers unresponsive hand both roth and eve looked down at him with stares of sheer hot panic peabody eased inside crouched down to his level hi pal going swing he said pitifully while great tears spilled down his chubby cheeks yeah lieutenant why dont i take the boy out good idea good thinking her stomach was busily tying itself into knots at the rising sobs mrs kohli with your permission my officer will take your son outside for awhile i think that would be best chad patsy stared down as if coming out of a dream were going to the park two blocks over the swings ill take him mrs kohli well be fine with an ease that had eve frowning peabody lifted the boy set him on her hip hey chad you like soy dogs patsy why dont you give me your little girl there gently clooney unhooked the sling slipped the baby free then to eves shock he passed the bundle to her oh listen i cant but clooney was already guiding pasty to the sofa and eve was left holding the bag or so she thought of it wincing she looked down and when big black eyes stared curiously up at her her palms went damp and when the baby said coo she lost all the spit in her mouth she searched the room for help clooney and roth were already flanking pasty and clooneys voice was a quiet murmur the room was small and livedin with a scatter of toys on the rug and a scent one she didnt recognize that was talc and crayons and sugar the scent of children but she spotted a basket of neatly folded laundry on the floor by a chair perfect she decided and with the care of a woman handling a homemade boomer laid the baby on top stay she whispered awkwardly patting the dark downy head and started to breathe again she tuned back into the room saw the woman on the sofa gathered into herself rocking rocking with her hands gripped in clooneys she made no sound and her tears fell like rain eve stayed out of the way watched clooney work watched the unity of support stand on either side of the widow this she thought was family for what it was worth and in times like this it was all there could be grief settled into the room like fog it would she knew be a long time before it burned away again its my fault its my fault they were the first words patsy spoke since shed sat on the sofa no clooney squeezed her hands until she lifted her head they needed to look in your eyes he knew to believe you to take comfort they needed to see it all in your eyes of course its not hed never have been working there if not for me i didnt want to go back to work after jilly was born i wanted to stay home the money the professional mothers salary was so much less than patsy taj was happy you were content to stay home with the children he was so proud of them and of you i cant chad she pulled her hands free pressed them to her face how can i tell him how can we live without taj where is he she dropped her hands looked around blindly i have to go see him maybe theres a mistake it was eve knew her time im sorry mrs kohli theres no mistake im lieutenant dallas im in charge of the investigation you saw taj patsy got shakily to her feet yes im sorry very sorry for your loss can you talk to me mrs kohli help me find the person who did this lieutenant dallas roth began but patsy shook her head no no i want to talk taj would want me to hed want wheres jilly wheres my baby i ah feeling sticky again eve gestured to the hamper oh patsy wiped tears from her face smiled shes so good such a love she hardly ever cries i should put her in her crib ill do that for you patsy clooney rose you talk to the lieutenant he gave eve a quiet look full of sorrow and understanding thats what taj would want do you want us to call someone for you your sister yes patsy drew in a breath yes please if youd call carla for me captain roth will do that for you wont you captain while i put the baby down roth struggled set her teeth it didnt surprise eve to see the annoyance clooney had essentially taken over gently and this wasnt a woman who liked taking orders from her sergeant yes of course with a final warning look at eve she walked into the next room are you with tajs squad no im not no no of course patsy rubbed her temple youd be with homicide she started to break the sound coming through her lips like a whimper and eve watched with admiration as she toughened up what do you want to know your husband didnt come home this morning you werent concerned no she reached back braced a hand on the arm of the couch and lowered herself down hed told me hed probably go into the station from the club he sometimes did that and he said he was meeting someone after closing who he didnt say just that he had someone to see after closing do you know of anyone who wished him harm mrs kohli he was a cop she said simply do you know anyone who wishes you harm lieutenant fair enough eve thought and nodded anyone specific someone he mentioned to you no taj didnt bring work home it was a point of honor for him i think he didnt want anything to touch his family i dont even know what cases he was working on he didnt like to talk about it but he was worried she folded her hands tightly in her lap stared down at them stared eve noted at the gold band on her finger i could tell he was worried about something i asked him about it but he brushed it off that was taj she managed with a trembling smile he had well some people would say it was a male dominant thing but it was just taj he was oldfashioned about some things he was a good man a wonderful father he loved his job she pressed her lips together he would have been proud to die in the line of duty but not like this not like this whoever did this to him took that away from him took him away from me and from his babies how can that be lieutenant how can that be and as there was no answer to it all eve could do was ask more questions chapter two that was a rough one yeah eve pulled away from the curb and tried to shake the weight shed carried out of the kohli apartment with her shell hold it together for the kids shes got spine great kids the little boys a real piece of work conned me into a soy dog three chocolate sticks and a fudgy cone bet he really had to twist your arm peabodys smile was sweet ive got a nephew about his age you have nephews every possible age more or less tell me something through your vast experience with family you got a husband and wife seem pretty tight good solid marriage kids why would the wife who appears to have a backbone and a brain know next to nothing about her husbands job his business his daytoday routine maybe he likes to check work at the door doesnt play for me eve muttered you live with someone day after day you have to know what they do what they think what theyre into she said he was worried about something but doesnt know what didnt press it she shook her head frowning as she wove through crosstown traffic i dont get that you and roarke have a different couple dynamic what the hell does that mean well peabody slid her eyes over to eves profile that was a nice way of saying neither one of you would let the other get away with holding back somethings going on with one of you the other sniffs it out and hammers away until its all out there youre both nosy and just mean enough not to let the other one slide by now you take my aunt miriam do i have to what im saying is she and uncle jim have been married for over forty years he goes to work every day comes home every night they have four kids eight no nine grandkids and a very happy life she doesnt even know how much he makes a year he just gives her an allowance eve nearly backended a rapid cab a what yeah well i said you have a different dynamic anyway he gives her the house money and stuff shell ask how his day was hell say it was fine and thats the end of the topic of work she shrugged thats how it goes for them now my cousin freida i get the point peabody eve engaged the carlink and called the me she was transferred directly to morse in autopsy im still working on him dallas morses face was uncharacteristically sober hes a goddamn mess i know it you got the tox reports yet i tagged them first no illegals in his system hed had a couple ounces of beer some pretzels just prior to death it appears he was having the beer when he was hit last meal some six hours before was a chicken sandwich on whole wheat pasta salad coffee at this point i can tell you the victim was in excellent health and good physical condition before some son of a bitch pounded him to pieces okay the skull fracture the killing blow didnt i say i was still working on him morses voice sliced out laser sharp before eve could respond he held up a hand protectively sealed and bloody to the wrist sorry sorry i can piece this much together the assailant came at him from behind first blow to the back of the head facial lacerations indicate the victim hit glass face first the second blow jaw strike took him down then the bastard opened his head like a goddamn peanut hed have been dead before he felt it the other injuries are postmortem i dont have a final count of those injuries you gave me what i needed sorry for the push no its on me morse puffed out his cheeks i knew him so its a little too personal he was a decent guy liked to show off holoshots of his kids we dont get many happy faces around here his eyes narrowed on hers im glad hes yours dallas it helps knowing hes yours youll have my report by end of shift he broke transmission and left her staring at a blank screen popular guy eve commented who had it so in for a decent guy proud daddy loving husband whos going to beat a cop to a bloody pulp knowing the system bands together to collar a cop killer somebody hated our popular guy in a big nasty way somebody hed busted you couldnt worry about the ones you busted eve mused but you always kept them in mind a cop has a drink with and turns his back on someone hes busted hes asking to have his head bashed in lets pump up the speed on getting all his records peabody i want to see what kind of cop taj kohli was o o eve stepped into the squad room had just turned toward her office when a woman stood up from a bench in the waiting area lieutenant dallas thats right im rue maclean ive just heard about taj i she lifted her hands roarke indicated youd want to speak to me so i thought id come in right away i want to help i appreciate that just one moment peabody she stepped aside with her aide give the record drones a boost on kohli then run his financials sir his financials thats right you run into any blocks on that call feeney in edd do some digging find out who he was tight with in his squad he didnt talk to his wife about work maybe he talked to someone else i want to know if he had any hobbies side interests and i want to know what case files he was working on or was looking into i want his life in front of me by end of shift yes sir ms maclean id like to take you into an interview room my office is a little cramped whatever you like i cant believe this happened i just cant understand how it could happen well talk about it on the record eve thought as she led rue through the warren of central to the interview area id like to record this she said and gestured rue into the boxlike room with a single table and two chairs of course i only want to help have a seat eve activated the recorder dallas lieutenant eve in interview with maclean rue subject has volunteered to cooperate on record in the matter of kohli taj homicide i appreciate you coming in ms maclean i dont know what i can tell you that might help you manage the club where taj kohli worked as parttime bartender she was just the type roarke would choose eve thought slick sleek lovely deep purple eyes full of concern now that shone like jewels against creamy skin delicate features close to elegant with just a hint of steel in the line of the chin curvy petite and perfectly groomed in a plumcolored skirt suit that skimmed her body and showed off great legs her hair was the color of sunlight and was drawn severely back in a fashion that required perfect confidence and good bones purgatory yes ive managed the club for four years now and before that i was hostess at a small club downtown prior to that i was a dancer a performer she added with a thin smile i decided i wanted to move off the stage and into management where i could keep my clothes on roarke gave me the opportunity to do so first at trends as hostess then as manager of purgatory your husband appreciates ambition lieutenant that was an avenue best not traveled on record are part of your duties as manager of purgatory the hiring of employees yes i hired taj he was looking for parttime work his wife had just had a baby and was opting for professional mother status he needed some extra money was willing to work the late shift and being happily married wasnt likely to hit on the talent are those the only requirements for employment at purgatory no but they matter rue lifted her fingers she wore a single ring a trio of stones twisted together like snakes and studded with stones the same color as her eyes he knew how to mix drinks how to serve he had a good eye for troublemakers i didnt know he was a cop his application stated he worked in security and it checked out what company lenux i contacted the office spoke with his supervisor well or so i assumed and was given his employment record i had no reason to question it and his record was solid i hired him on a twoweek probationary he did the job and we went from there do you have the contact at lenux in your files yes rue blew out a breath ive already tried to call all i got this time around was that the code had been discontinued id like it anyway just to follow up of course rue reached into her bag took out a day book i dont know why he didnt tell me he was a cop she said as she keyed in the code number on an ememo for eve maybe he thought i wouldnt hire him but when you figure the owners a cop i dont own the club no well she shrugged and handed eve the memo he was in the club after closing is that standard no but it isnt unheard of routinely the head bartender on duty and one of the security team close up together taj was serving as head last night and according to my records it was nester vines turn to close with him i havent been able to reach nester as yet are you in the club every night five nights a week sundays and mondays off i was there last night until twothirty the place was clearing out and one of the girls was having a bad night boyfriend trouble i took her home held her hand for awhile then went home myself what time was that when i went home rue blinked a moment about threethirty quarter to four i guess the name of the woman you were with until that time mitzi rue drew in a breath mitzi treacher lieutenant the last time i saw taj he was alive and working the bar im just putting the facts on record ms maclean do you have a take on detective kohlis state of mind the last time you saw him he seemed fine we didnt talk much last night i stopped by the bar for some mineral water a couple of times hows it going busy night that kind of thing god she squeezed her eyes shut he was a nice man quiet steady always called his wife on his early break to see how she was doing he use the bar phone no we discourage personal calls barring emergencies on the business line he used his palmlink did he use it last night i dont know he always did i cant say i noticed no wait this time she closed her eyes and seemed to drift he was eating a sandwich back in the break room i remember walking by the door was open he was making cooing noises talking to the baby she said opening her eyes again i remember that because it was so sweet and silly hearing this big bruiser of a guy make baby noises into the link is it important just trying to get a picture there hadnt been a palmlink on or near the body eve recalled did you notice anyone who came in last night or any other night when he was on somebody he knew hung out at the bar with him no weve got some regulars of course people who come in several times a week taj got so hed know their usual drinks clients appreciate that did he get tight with anyone who worked there not particularly like i said he was a quiet guy friendly enough but he didnt hang with anyone in particular he did the bartender thing watched listened do you keep a metal bat behind the bar its legal rue said quickly then paled is that what did taj ever have occasion to use it or threaten to he never used it she rubbed her upper chest with the flat of her hand in long soothing strokes he had it out once or twice i guess tapped it on the bar as a deterrent thats mostly all you need especially with a guy his size the clubs upscale we rarely have any real trouble there i run a clean place lieutenant roarke wont tolerate less o o the preliminary report was straightforward and for eve unsatisfactory she had the facts a dead cop bludgeoned to death with serious overkill and the wild destruction that pointed to an addict popping on zeus or some lethal combination of illegals a sloppy attempt to cover with the look of attempted robbery a missing palmlink and thirty loose credit chips the victim was apparently moonlighting to supplement his family income had no blemishes or commendations on his service record was well liked by his associates and loved by his family he had not at least as far as she had uncovered lived above his means engaged in extramarital affairs or been involved with a hot case that could have led to his death on the surface it looked like just bad luck but she was damned if that suit fit she brought his id photo up on her screen studied it big guy with a proud look in his eyes firm jaw wide shoulders somebody wanted you out kohli whod you piss off she shifted sat up again computer run probability current case file scheming cause of death and me prelim running primarys report on victim what is the probability that victim kohli knew his assailant working probability given known data and primarys report is ninetythree point four percent that victim kohli knew his assailant yeah well good for me she leaned forward scooped her fingers through her hair who do cops know other cops weasels bad guys family neighbors who do bartenders know she let out a short laugh every fucking body which hat were you wearing for your meet this morning detective lieutenant peabody poked her head in the door ive got kohlis current case load theres no record of him asking for files other than apply to his open logs i ran into a trip with the financials everythings jointly owned so we need a warrant or spousal permission to poke around ill take care of it full service record right here nothing special caught my eye he was in on a big bust about six months ago some dealer named ricker max ricker yeah kohli was down in the feeding chain mostly leg or drone work he didnt get the collar that went to a lieutenant mills and detective martinez they tied the warehouse of illegals to ricker got him indicted but he slipped through still they nailed six others in the cartel rickers not the type to ruin his manicure by getting blood on the polish but he wouldnt think twice about paying for a hit even on a cop and the idea of it gave her a little ping of excitement find out if kohli testified seems to me it got to court before the whole business was dismissed on techs see just what his part was in the bust get it from captain roth and if she hassles you over it pass her to me ill be with the commander o o commander whitney stood at his window while eve reported on the status of her investigation he had his big hands folded together behind his back and stared out at the sky traffic one of the new cloud dusters winged by close enough for him to see the color of its young pilots eyes and in direct violation of traffic codes ballsy whitney thought absently and stupid he added as he heard the high whining beep of the air patrol busted he thought it should always be so easy to uphold the law when eve fell silent behind him whitney turned his face was dark and wide his hair a closecut military crop that was showing hints of gray a big man with cool and sober eyes hed spent the first half of his career on the streets though he was spending the second half riding a desk he hadnt forgotten what it meant to strap on a weapon before i comment on your report lieutenant i want to inform you that ive had communications from captain roth of the one twentyeighth shes put in a formal request to have the kohli homicide transferred to her squad yes sir she indicated she would do so and your opinion of that request its understandable and its emotional agreed he waited a moment inclined his head you dont ask if i intend to grant captain roths request theres no tactical reason to do so and if youd decided to put the investigation in captain roths hands youd have told me up front whitney pursed his lips then turned back to the window correct on both counts the investigation remains on you the case is emotional lieutenant for captain roths squad and for every cop on the nypsd its difficult when one of us goes down even though each of us knows the risks but the nature of this killing takes it to another level the excessive violence doesnt smack of a professional hit no but im not discounting that angle if rickers involved whoever he hired may have been using or may have had instructions to make it messy i dont know what kind of cop kohli was yet commander whether he was foolish enough or cocky enough to put himself in a vulnerable position with one of rickers hammers i have peabody digging into his record and case load i need to know who he was close to the names of his weasels and how involved he was in the ricker investigation and trial its not the first time rickers suspected of arranging a cop killing but hes generally more subtle there was something personal in this commander whether for the badge or for kohli i dont know but it was very personal roarke owned the club she added yes so ive heard he turned back skimmed his gaze over her face and walked to his desk personal all around lieutenant it will be easier and quicker to obtain data on the club and on its staff and clientele the managers already come in voluntarily for interview the fact that kohli concealed his attachment to the nypsd makes me wonder if he was on the job on his own he deliberately misrepresented himself and went so far as to arrange a cover theres no indication he was working in soft clothes for the department so it would have been unofficial i have no knowledge of any investigation official or otherwise that required detective kohli to go under in purgatory but i will pursue that matter with captain roth he held up a hand before eve could object itll be smoother if that particular inquiry comes from this office rather than from you dallas lets keep it smooth yes sir but it grated i want a warrant to open kohlis financials theyre jointly held with his widow at this time i prefer not to request permission from mrs kohli or alert her before theyre open he finished he spread his hands on the desk you think he was taking id like to eliminate that angle sir do it he ordered and do it quietly ill get your warrant you get me a cop killer o o eve spent the rest of the day poring over kohlis record familiarizing herself with his case load trying to get a handle on the man the cop what she saw was an average officer whod performed steadily if slightly under his potential hed rarely missed a shift and just as rarely put in any overtime hed never used his weapon for maximum force and therefore had never undergone extensive testing still hed closed or been in on the closing of a good number of cases and his reports on those closed and those open were efficient carefully written and thorough this was a man eve thought who followed the book did the job then went home at night and put his day away how she wondered how the hell did anyone manage that his military record was similar no trouble no glow he enlisted at the age of twentytwo served six steady years the last two in the military police every t was crossed every i dotted it was to her mind a perfectly ordinary life almost too perfect the call to nester vine from purgatory got her as far as his harassedlooking wife who informed eve that vine had come home before the end of his shift the night before dogsick she herself had just gotten in from the hospital where shed taken her husband at three that morning for what turned out to be appendicitis as alibis went it was a beaut the only tip she pried out of mrs vine was that she should get in touch with some stripper named nancie whod apparently stuck around after kohli had urged vine to go home still she contacted the hospital and verified one nester vine had indeed had his appendix removed in emergency early that morning scratch nester she thought and put the stripper on her talkto list calls to lieutenant mills and detective martinez went unreturned in the field and unavailable was the response she left one last message for each gathered the files and prepared to go home shed take a hard look at kohlis financials that evening she caught peabody in her cubicle in the bullpen dealing with the followup paperwork leave the rest of that until tomorrow go home yeah peabodys face lit up as she glanced at her wrist unit almost on time too ive got an eight oclock dinner with charles now ill have just enough time to go snazz myself up when eves response was a grunt peabody grinned you know the problem with juggling two guys do you consider mcnab a guy on a good day hes a nice contrast to charles anyway you know the problem with seeing both of them no peabody whats the problem with seeing both of them there isnt one with a hoot of laughter peabody grabbed her bag and shot out of her cubicle see you tomorrow eve shook her head one guy she decided was plenty problem enough for her taste and if she got the hell out of central she might even beat him home for a change o o in a kind of test she tried to click her mind off her case files traffic was ugly enough to keep her mind occupied and the current blast of the billboards were hyping everything from spring fashions to the latest hot sports car when she caught a familiar face burst across one of the animated screens she nearly sideswiped a glidecart mavis freestone her hair a riot of flamecolored spikes whirled over the street at thirtyfourth she jiggled spun in a few sassy and amusingly placed scraps of electric blue with each revolution her hair changed from red to gold to blinding green it was eve thought with a foolish grin on her face just like her jesus mavis would you just look at that what a kick in the ass a long way her oldest friend had come a long way from the street grifter eve had once busted to performance artist in thirdrate clubs and now to bona fide musical star musical eve thought in the broadest sense of the word she reached for her carlink intending to call mavis and tell her what she was looking at when her personal palmlink beeped yeah she couldnt take her eyes off the billboard even when several impatient drivers honked rudely dallas hey dallas webster instantly eves shoulders tensed she might have known don webster on a personal level but no cop liked receiving a transmission from internal affairs why are you calling on my personal link iabs required to use official channels i was hoping to talk to you got a few minutes you are talking to me facetoface why come on dallas ten minutes im on my way home tag me tomorrow ten minutes he repeated ill meet you at the park right across from your place is this internal affairs business lets talk he gave her a winning smile that only increased her level of suspicion ill meet you there im right behind you she narrowed her eyes checked her rearview and saw he meant it literally saying nothing she broke transmission she didnt stop across from the gates of her home but drove another block and a half on principle then made certain she found the only convenient parking spot before she pulled in it didnt surprise her when webster simply doubleparked and ignoring the snooty glares from an elegant couple and their three equally stylish afghan hounds flipped on his on duty light and joined her on the curb his smile had always been a handy weapon and he used it now keeping his light blue eyes friendly his face was thin sharpangled and would probably be termed scholarly as he aged his dark brown hair waved a little and was cut to flatter youve come up in the world dallas this is some neighborhood yeah we have monthly block parties and get crazy what do you want webster hows it going he said it casually and started strolling toward the lush green and the trees still tender with spring sucking in temper she jammed her hands in her pockets and matched her steps with his its going fine how about you cant complain nice evening you gotta love spring in new york and how about those yankees now that should conclude our period of small talk what do you want you never were much on chat he remembered very well the one and only time hed managed to get her into bed they hadnt done any talking why dont we find a bench like i said its a nice evening i dont want to find a bench i dont want a soy dog and i dont want to talk about the weather i want to go home so if you dont have anything interesting to say thats what im going to do she turned took three steps you pulled the kohli homicide thats right she turned back and her inner alarm system flashed to red light what does that have to do with iab i didnt say it had anything to do with iab other than the usual run we do when a cop goes down the usual run doesnt mean a private meet off duty with the primary we go back a ways he lifted a hand hell all the way back to the academy it seemed friendlier this way she kept her eyes on his as she walked to him stood toe to toe dont insult me webster where does iab come into my investigation look ive seen the prelim this is a rough one rough on the department his squad his family something started clicking in her brain did you know kohli not really webster gave a thin smile just a little bitter at the edges most detectives dont care to socialize with internal affairs funny how we all frown over a dirty cop but nobody wants to rub elbows with the ones digging them out are you saying kohli was dirty im not saying that at all i wouldnt be at liberty to discuss an internal investigation with you if there was an internal investigation bullshit webster just bullshit i have a dead cop if he was mixed up in something off i need to know i cant discuss iab business with you it came to my attention that youve opened his financials she paused a minute as her temper threatened to spike i cant discuss a homicide investigation with you and why would part of the procedure of that investigation come to the attention of the rat squad now youre trying to piss me off he kept his composure gave a little shrug i thought i would give you a headsup unofficially and in a friendly manner that the department as a whole will be better off if this investigation is closed quickly and quietly was kohli in bed with ricker this time a muscle jumped in websters cheek but his voice stayed smooth i dont know what youre talking about digging into detective kohlis financials is a dead end dallas and will upset his family the man was killed off duty a man was beaten to death a cop a womans been widowed two children lost their father and its supposed to matter less that it happened when he was off duty no he had the grace or the wit to look uncomfortable and then to look away thats just the way it went down thats all there is to it dont tell me how to do my job webster dont ever tell me how to conduct a homicide investigation you gave up cop work i didnt dallas he caught up with her before she reached the curb again he gripped her arm and braced himself for the storm when she whirled on him instead she met his eyes her own cold flat empty move your hand now he complied slipping his into his pocket im just trying to tell you iab wants this closed quiet what makes you think i give one good fuck about what iab wants you have something to say to me regarding my investigation into the death of detective taj kohli you do it in an official capacity dont tail me again webster not ever she climbed into her car waited for a break in the mild traffic and swung into a uturn he watched her cover the distance then turn into the high gates of the world she lived in now he took three deep breaths and when that didnt work kicked viciously at his own rear tire he hated what hed done and more he hated knowing hed never really gotten over her chapter three she was steaming when she barreled down the drive to the great stone house roarke had made his home and hers so much she thought for checking your work at the door what the hell were you supposed to do when it followed you to the damn threshold webster was up to something which meant there was an agenda here and the agenda was iabs now she had to calm herself down so she could filter out her annoyance at being waylaid by him it was more important to puzzle out what hed been trying to tell her and more important yet to calculate what hed been so damn careful not to tell her she left the car at the end of the drive because she liked it there and because it annoyed roarkes majordomo the consistently irritating summerset she grabbed her bag that held the files and was halfway up the steps when she stopped deliberately she blew out a long cleansing breath turned and simply sat down it was time to try something new she decided time to sit and enjoy the pleasant spring evening enjoy the gorgeous simplicity of the flowering trees and shrubs that spread over the lawn speared into the sky shed lived here for more than a year now and rarely very rarely took time to see time to appreciate what roarke had built or the style with which hed built it the house itself with its sweeps and turrets and dazzling expanses of glass was a monument to taste wealth and elegant comfort there were too many rooms to count filled with art antiques and every pleasure and convenience a man could make for himself but the grounds she thought were another level this was a man who needed room who demanded it and commanded it at the same time he was a man who could appreciate the simple appeal of a flower that would bloom and fade with its season hed decorated his grounds with those flowers with trees that would outlive both of them with shrubs that spread and fountained and closed it all away with the high stone walls the iron gates and the rigid security that kept the city outside but it was still there the city sniffing around the edges like a hungry restless dog that was part of it part of the duality of roarke and she supposed of her hed grown up in the alleys and tenements of dublin and had done whatever was necessary to survive shed lost her childhood and the flickers of memory the images of what had been of what shed done to escape haunted the woman shed become his buffer against yesterday was money power control hers was a badge there was little either of them wouldnt do hadnt done to keep that buffer in place but somehow together they were normal she decided theyd made a marriage and a home that was why she could sit on the steps of that home with the ugliness of her day smearing her heart look at blossoms dancing in the breeze and wait for him she watched the long black car slide quietly toward the house waited while roarke climbed out the back had a word with his driver as the car drove off he walked to her in that way he had with his eyes on her face shed never had anyone look at her as he did as if nothing else and no one else existed no matter how many times he did so just that long focused look made her heart flutter he sat beside her set his briefcase aside leaned back as she was hi she said hi lovely evening yeah the flowers look good they do yes the renewal of spring a cliche but true enough as most cliches are he ran a hand over her hair what are you doing nothing exactly thats out of character for you darling eve its an experiment she crossed her scarred boots at the ankles im seeing if i can leave work at central and how are you doing ive pretty much failed still with her head back she closed her eyes and tried to recapture some of it i was doing okay with it on the drive home i saw maviss billboard ah yes fairly spectacular you didnt tell me about it it just went up today i figured youd see it on your way home and thought it would be a nice surprise it was and remembering brought her smile back i nearly clipped a glidecart and i was sitting there grinning at it about to call her but i had a transmission come through so work intruded more or less it was webster because the smile was gone again and she was scowling at the trees she didnt notice the slight tension in roarkes body don webster from internal affairs yes i remember who he is what did he want im trying to figure that out he called on my personal and asked for a private meet did he roarke murmured his voice deceptively mild he went out of his way for it tailed me from central i met up with him just down the block from here and after he got finished trying to make nice he started a song and dance on the kohli case just thinking about it again got her blood boiling tells me how iab wants it put away quiet doesnt like the idea that im going to look into kohlis financials but he wont confirm or deny anything claims its just a friendly unofficial headsup and do you believe him no but i dont know what hes feeding me and i dont like iabs sticky fingers poking into my case files the man has a personal interest in you webster she looked over now surprised no he doesnt we blew off some steam one night years back thats the beginning and end of it for you perhaps roarke thought but let it go anyway i cant figure if the meet was really about kohli or if its more about the ricker connection max ricker yeah her eyes sharpened you know him i shouldve figured that weve met whats the connection kohli worked on the task force that busted ricker about six months back he wasnt a key player and ricker slithered through but it had to cost him a lot of time and money could be ricker put out contracts and is getting some of his own back by whacking cops what i saw in purgatory today didnt seem like rickers style i dont figure hed want his fingerprints on it theres that roarke was silent for a moment you want to know if i ever did business with him im not asking you that yes you are he took her hand kissed it lightly then got to his feet lets have a walk i brought work home with me she let him pull her up smiled so much for the experiment i should get to it youll work better if we clear this up he kept her hand in his started across the lawn the breeze had shaken some of the petals from the trees so they lay like pink and white snowdrops on the green flowers banks of them she couldnt name flowed out of beds in soft blurry blues and shimmering whites the light was beginning to go softening the air she caught drifts of fragile perfumes country sweet he bent snapped off a tulip its cup as perfect as something sculpted from white wax handed it to her i havent seen or dealt with max ricker in a number of years but there was a time we had business of sorts she held the tulip and heard the city sniffing at the gates what kind of business he stopped tipped her head back so their eyes met then saw with regret that hers were troubled first let me say that even one with my lets call it eclectic palate hasnt the taste for certain activities murder for hire being one of those i never killed for him eve nor for that matter for anyone but myself she nodded again lets not go there not now all right but theyd come too far to shy away now she walked with him illegals there was a time in the beginning of my career i couldnt no he corrected knowing that honesty was vital when i wasnt particularly selective in the products i handled yes i dealt in illegals from time to time and some of those dealings involved ricker and his organization the last time we associated was christ more than ten years back i didnt care for his business practices and id reached a point where i wasnt obliged to negotiate with those who didnt appeal to me okay eve he kept his hand on her face his eyes on hers when i met you most of my business was legitimate i made that choice long ago because it suited me after you i dispensed with or reconstructed those interests left that were questionable i did that because i knew it would suit you you dont have to tell me what i already know i think i do just now theres little i wouldnt do for you but i cant and i wouldnt change my past or what brought me here she looked down at the tulip perfect and pure then back up at him not pure god knew but for her perfect i wouldnt want you to change anything she put her hands on his shoulders were okay o o later after theyd shared dinner where they were both careful not to discuss his business or hers eve settled down in her home office and began to study the data on taj and patsy kohlis financials she came at them from several different angles drank three cups of coffee reached certain conclusions then rose she knocked briefly on the door that adjoined her work space to roarkes then stepped inside he was at his console and from what she could gather he was talking to someone in tokyo he held up a hand out of the range of his screen in a signal for her to wait i regret that projection will not meet my needs at this time fumisan the projection is of course preliminary and negotiable the voice through his desklink was precise and cool but no cooler eve thought than her husbands mild and polite expression then perhaps we should discuss it further when the figures are no longer preliminary i would be honored to discuss the matter with you roarkesan in person it is the feeling of my associates that such a delicate negotiation would be better served in this way tokyo is lovely in the spring perhaps you will visit my city at our expense of course some time in the near future i regret that such a trip as appealing as it may be is impossible given my current schedule however i would be happy to meet with you and any of your associates in new york if this is possible for you you have only to contact my administrator she will be delighted to assist you in any travel arrangements there was a slight pause thank you for your gracious invitation i will consult with my associates and contact you through your administrator as soon as possible i look forward to it domo fumisan what are you buying now eve asked that remains to be seen but how do you feel about owning a japanese baseball team i like baseball eve said after a moment well then what can i do for you lieutenant if youre busy buying sports teams it can wait im not buying anything at least not until negotiations are completed the wolf came into his eyes and on my turf okay first a question if i were to refuse to discuss any part of my work with you or my professional business what would you do slap you around of course he rose amused when she laughed but i imagine we can both be spared that unhappy event as the question doesnt apply so why do you ask it let me put it another way since im so terrified of being slapped around can two people be married live in the same house have a solid marriage and one of them have no clue about the others outside business when he merely lifted his eyebrows she swore you dont apply nobody could keep up with your outside business besides i know stuff you do you buy everything you can get your hands on and manufacture and sell almost every product known to humankind and right now youre considering buying a japanese ball team see my god my lifes an open book he came around the desk but to go back to your question yes i suppose its possible for people to live together and not know the thrust or at least the intricacies of the others work or outside interests what if i liked to fish to fish as an example well hypothesize that fishing is a passion of mine and i often toddle off for a wild weekend of dry fly fishing in montana would you pay attention to my recitation of every cast and catch upon my return to fish she repeated and made him laugh and there you have my point so yes to your question now why do you ask just tying to get a picture anyway since you might be tempted to belt me and then id have to take you down im willing to share some of my professional business with you how about taking a look at something all right but you couldnt take me down can and have only when you cheat he said and walked by her into her office shed left the financials on the wall screen roarke eased a hip onto her desk angled his head and scanned them figures they both knew were like breath to him he simply drew them in standard outlays for a typical middleclass lifestyle he commented reasonable rent payments made in a timely fashion vehicle payments and maintenance costs garage fees are a little on the high side they ought to shop around a bit taxes clothing food entertainment are a bit light they dont get out much deposits are regular bimonthly which would coincide with salaries you certainly couldnt accuse this family of living over their incomes no you couldnt interesting though about the vehicle expenses seeing as kohli had a city unit and neither he nor his wife own a personal vehicle is that so frowning he refocused so theres some skimming or padding going on but at just under four thousand a month its hardly big time every little bit eve murmured now take a look at this investment account college funds retirement savings she flipped the screens and heard roarkes quiet ah someone was looking to the future a half million in the past five months and earning decently though id advise a bit more diversity and more of the pie in growth areas if college tuition is indeed the goal he wont be needing a portfolio consult a cop doesnt come up with a half million by watching his pennies he comes up with it by being dirty with anger simmering she sat he was taking the question is from who and why the deposits and the accounts were down a couple of levels but not buried deep not covered up so a full scan didnt pop them right out pretty damn cocky she rose again to pace pretty damn cocky i dont think he was stupid i think he was just sure of himself sure hed be covered if he hadnt been killed no one would have been looking at his financials roarke pointed out his lifestyle wasnt sending up red flags he lived within his means yeah he did his job no more no less went home at night to his pretty wife and pretty kids then got up the next morning and did it all over again no flash the kind of cop nobody pays a lot of attention to and everybody likes nice guy quiet guy but iab was looking at him she stopped in front of the wall screen they were looking and they knew about the take they dont want it coming out last time i looked iab didnt have a heart so its not concern for his grieving widow so whos covering whose ass perhaps theyre simply being territorial if they had him under investigation they want to close that internal business up themselves yes could be i wouldnt put it past them but it stuck in her craw dirty or not ive got a dead cop and hes mine she nodded at the screen i want to talk to max ricker lieutenant roarke moved behind her rubbed her shoulders i have every confidence in your abilities your intellect and your instincts but ricker is a dangerous man with a taste for the unpleasant particularly where women are involved youll appeal to him on several levels not the least of which is your connection to me really she murmured and turned around we didnt sever our business association on the best of terms so i can use that if hes interested itll be easier to wade through his lawyers and set up a meet let me do it no stop and think i can get you to him quicker and more directly not this time and not this way you cant change your past she said and hes part of that but hes not part of your today hes part of yours thats right lets try to keep this if not separate sort of side by side if hes part of it youll probably know before i do because you wont leave it alone but whatever kind of cop kohli was im the one standing for him now ill set up the meet when the times right let me look into it a bit first then youll have more in your pocket when you do and hed have more time to do what needed to be done to keep her away from ricker go ahead and look but she was careful not to agree tell me what you know about him give me an inside track troubled roarke walked away poured a brandy hes very smooth educated and can be charming when it suits him hes quite vain and enjoys the company of beautiful women when they please him he can be very generous when they displease him roarke turned swirling the brandy he can and will be brutal hes the same with his employees and associates i once saw him slit the throat of a servant over a chipped wine goblet its hard to get good help these days isnt it his main income is through the manufacture and distribution of illegals on a wide scale but he also dabbles in weapons assassinations and sex he has several highplaced officials in his pocket which keeps him protected within an hour of your contact with him hell know whatever there is to know about you hell know eve things you would prefer no one knew her gut clenched but she nodded i can handle that does he have family he had a brother rumor is ricker dispensed with him over some sibling dispute in any case his body was never discovered he has a son about my age perhaps a few years younger alex i never met him as he was living primarily in germany when i had dealings with ricker word is hes kept close and insulated weaknesses vanity arrogance greed so far hes been able to indulge himself in all three with relative impunity but over the last year or so thereve been rumors quiet very cautious ones that his mental health is deteriorating and as a result some of his businesses are in mild distress thats one of the avenues ill explore more carefully if hes involved in kohlis death that impunity ends if hes mentally defective it wont keep him out of a cage do you figure hell agree to meet me if i make an approach hell see you because hell be curious and if you take a shot at him hell never forget it hes cold eve and hes patient if he has to wait a year ten years to circle back to you he will then if i take a shot at him ill have to make it count more roarke thought as he finished his brandy if she went after ricker ricker would have to die he too could be cold and patient o o she turned to him in the night it was rare for her to do so unless the dreams were chasing her when she slept she slept deep and unprotected perhaps she knew he needed it needed to feel her wrapped around him in the dark the intimacy of it that stated more truly than words what theyd come to be to each other her mouth found his offered while her hands roamed up the solid length of his back down again to his hips they shifted on the wide bed a tangle of limbs of warm flesh of breath beginning to quicken with each touch the taste of her lips throat breasts filled him as it always did even as it stirred hunger for more her heartbeat under his hand under his mouth and her first sign of pleasure trailed off into a quiet moan she arched against him strength and surrender opened for him invitation and demand he slipped inside her hot and wet and waiting and it was he who moaned as she closed around him shadows in the dark their bodies rose and fell together a slow silky rhythm to draw out the night pleasuring her pleasuring himself he slipped his hands under her hips lifted her gave her more she locked herself around him rode the edge and when she felt herself begin to fall she said his name he lifted his head saw the gleam of her eyes open on him eve he said and let himself fall with her o o into the night in the dark he lay beside her listening to her breathe he knew the varied and sundry reasons a man would kill but none were more fierce none were more vital than to hold safe what he loved chapter four lieutenant alan mills caught eve on her communicator as she was grabbing her second cup of coffee her first thought was that he looked as though he could have used a good jolt of caffeine himself his eyes were sleepy and irritable a watery gray in a pale face dallas mills here you looking for me thats right im primary on the kohli homicide son of a bitch mills snorted sniffed id like a piece of the dickweed who did kohli what have you got this and that she wasnt about to share investigative data with a man who looked like hed yet to roll out of bed and had probably rolled into it with a little chemical enhancement not strictly departmentally approved you and a detective martinez worked with kohli on a task force over the past year max ricker yeah yeah mills rubbed his face she could actually hear the scrub brush sound of his stubble against his palm him and about a dozen other cops and the slick bastard still oozed through the cracks you think rickers tied to this im covering my bases here i need a picture of kohli then maybe ill get a picture of his killer you got some time this morning mills maybe you could hook martinez and meet me at the crime scene id appreciate any input i heard the case was being transferred to our house you heard wrong he seemed to digest this information and not find it particularly to his liking kohli was one of ours and now hes mine im asking for some cooperation on this are you going to give it to me i want a look at the scene anyway when no time like the present ill be at purgatory in twenty minutes ill round up martinez probably still taking her siesta shes a mex he ended transmission and left eve regarding her communicator thoughtfully before she stuck it in her trouser pocket gee mills nobody told me you were a complete and total asshole go figure the asshole is still going to want to prove he has harder balls than you roarke commented hed stopped scanning the morning stock reports to watch her handle her colleague yeah i got that she snagged her weapon harness strapped it on in a way roarke thought another woman clipped on earrings he rose slid a finger down the dent in her chin hell find out very shortly hes wrong no one has harder balls than you lieutenant she checked her weapon settled it is that a compliment or a dig an observation id like to take another look at the scene myself for insurance purposes for insurance purposes her ass eve thought not today pal but ill try to clear it for you by tomorrow as property owner im entitled to an onsite scan to determine damage costs as primary in a homicide investigation im entitled to seal and preserve the crime scene until im satisfied all evidence has been gathered the sweep was completed yesterday afternoon and the scene was fully recorded he reached down to the table in the sitting area of the bedroom lifted a file disc at this point the property owner is allowed admittance in the company of a police representative and his insurance agent to estimate repair and replacement costs the memo from my attorney on the matter lieutenant she snatched the disc he offered now whos rattling their balls she muttered and made him grin maybe i dont have time for you this morning he strolled to his closet selected a suit jacket from the vast forest of his wardrobe she had never figured out how he knew what went with what when there was so damn much to choose from maybe youll have to make time ill ride with you ive made arrangements to be picked up at the club when im finished there you had this set up before you got home last night hmmm he moved to her closet found the gray vest that matched her trousers if shed thought to look for it herself it would have taken her an hour not to find it its cool out this morning he said as he handed it to her you think youre slick dont you yes he bent down kissed her deftly did up the vest buttons for her ready o o you dont talk to the other cops eve warned as they approached the club what in the world would i have to say to them he continued to read and respond to overnight correspondence on his ppc while she pulled to the curb you dont go anywhere on scene unless youre accompanied by me peabody or an officer i designate she continued and you take nothing that means nothing off scene are you interested in a small summer home in juno alaska he glanced at her met her narrowed eyes no i see youre not i dont believe i am either ah here we are he pocketed the miniunit and we appear to be the first to arrive roarke no funny business fortunately i left my red rubber nose at the office he climbed out of the car shall i open it for you he gestured at the police seal on the clubs entrance door dont start with me struggling not to rise to the bait she strode to the door uncoded the seal if you screw around i promise im calling a couple of big burly uniforms and having them remove you from the scene but darling its so much more arousing when the police brutality comes from you keep it up smart guy she shoved open the door the light was dim through the windows and she could still smell the unpleasant aroma of spilled liquor and stale blood that mixed with the chemical stench of sweeper dust lights on she ordered main bar area those that were still operational brightened and cast a cool white light over the destruction doesnt look any better today does it roarke scanned the room felt the little stir of temper close the door she said it quietly took a breath and did what she did best she put herself in the middle of murder he comes in after closing hes been here before he has to know the place the setup the security maybe he worked here but if he did and was on last night he left with everyone else nobodys going to tag him as being alone here with kohli she moved around and through the debris toward the bar he sits down asks for a drink friendly casual theyve got business to discuss something to talk over that needs privacy why doesnt he have kohli disarm the security cameras roarke asked hes not worried about the cameras hes going to take care of them after just a friendly afterhours drink a little conversation nothing thats going to set off kohlis cop vibes if he had any kohli gets himself a beer stays behind the bar hes comfortable eats some nuts he knows this guy theyve probably had a drink together before she glanced up checking out the locations of the cameras kohlis not worried about the security cams either so either theyre not talking about anything thats going to jam him or he has turned them off all the while this guys sitting here thinking about how to make his move he comes behind the bar helps himself to a drink this time she walked behind the bar seeing it in her head kohli big strong and alive wearing his purgatory uniform black shirt black slacks sipping at a beer popping some bar nuts the bloods pounding in his head and his hearts thumping like a drum but he doesnt let it show maybe he makes a joke asks kohli to get something just enough to make him turn his back for an instant long enough for him to grab the bat and swing a second she thought no more no more than that to close a hand around the bat jerk it free swing the first crack of it sings up his arms right into the shoulders blood sprays and kohlis face smashes into the glass bottles crash and its like an explosion an explosion she repeated with her eyes slitted flat that screams in his head it makes his blood swim pump boosts the adrenaline he turned the corner now no going back he swings the second time into the face its good to see kohlis face the pain and the shock in it when he takes him out the third swing does the job cracks his head wide open blood and brains but its not enough she lifted her hands fisted them one over the other like a batter waiting for a clutch pitch he wants to obliterate he strikes again and again and the sound of snaps and crunches when bones go is like music raging through him he tastes blood his breaths whistling when he pulls himself back pulls back just enough to think again he gets kohlis shield out of the pocket tosses it down in the blood that means something blood on the shield then he rolls the body on top of it she stopped a moment thinking hes covered with blood his hands his clothes his shoes but there arent any signs of it in the rest of the club he changed he had the sense to clean up first the sweepers found traces of kohlis blood skin brain matter in the drain of the bar sink she turned looking at the bowl covered with powder now under the bar he washed up right here with the body behind him cold stone cold then he took care of business went around smashing everything made a real party out of it celebrate but hes still got his wits he tosses the bat with kohli behind the bar heres what ive done and heres how i did it then he takes the security discs and walks away do you know what it takes to put that kind of image inside your own head lieutenant courage an amazing level of courage im just doing what has to be done no roarke laid a hand over hers found it cold you do a great deal more dont sidetrack me she drew away because she was cold and faintly embarrassed anyway its just a theory a damn good one you made me see it blood on the shield if youre right about that meaning something he was probably killed because he was a cop yeah thats what i keep circling back to she glanced over as the door opened she recognized mills right away though he was bigger than shed assumed and most of the big had run to fat didnt take advantage of the departments physical fitness program she thought or the break they were given on body sculpting the woman beside him was small and lean built for action her skin had the olive cast that always made eve think of sunbaked countries her hair was black and glossy and tamed back into a long sleek tail her eyes were nearly as dark and seemed to snap with vibrancy beside her mills looked like an overfed sloppy mongrel word came down it was bad martinezs voice was clipped and faintly exotic but its worse her eyes skimmed over roarke lingered an instant then locked on eve youd be lieutenant dallas thats right eve moved back across the room thanks for coming down the civilians the property owner with barely a nod in acknowledgement mills lumbered to the bar he moved like a bear an overfed one bought it back here huh shitty way to die most ways are crap martinez turned to the door fingers dancing a little too quickly for eves taste toward her side arm my aide eve said when peabody stepped in officer peabody detective martinez and lieutenant mills with a slight shift of her body she tapped a finger to her collar then turned back to follow martinez to the bar recognizing the signal peabody clipped on her recorder and engaged how long did you know kohli eve asked me a couple of years i transferred to the one twoeight from brooklyn she looked down at the mess murder had left behind the lieutenant knew him longer yeah since he came in rookie spit and polish and by the book did some military time and brought that with him he was a oneshift wonder give him a break mills martinez muttered were standing in his goddamn blood here hey just saying it like it was the guy did his shift clocked out couldnt get an extra minute out of him without it being a direct order from the captain but he did his job while he was on howd he get picked for the ricker team martinez wanted him mills shook his head at the mess behind the bar last cop idve figured for getting taken out ida made book hed have done his twentyfive and spent his retirement building birdhouses or some shit i tagged him for the task force martinez confirmed she angled her body away from mills in a way that told eve the detective wanted distance from the lieutenant bad i was head investigator under lieutenant mills kohli was a detail freak he never missed a word you had him on surveillance you got a report that described everything he saw for four hours down to the garbage in the gutter he had good eyes she frowned at the blood splatter if youre thinking ricker ordered a hit on him i cant see it kohli was background he was a drone on that investigation he was in on the bust but he didnt do anything but record the scene i took ricker down for all the fucking good it did kohli was the one with the details eve said anyway some of those details couldve gotten through to ricker helped him slide there was a long pause eve saw martinezs eyes meet millss before they both turned toward her i dont like what im hearing coming out of your mouth dallas millss tone was a jagged threat like rusted metal in a sweaty hand out of the corner of her eye eve saw roarke shift and damn it peabody as well she took a step forward as if to shake off the guard dogs what youre hearing coming out of my mouth is standard yeah for some halfass or lowlife who ends up in a bag its not fucking standard for a cop kohli carried a badge same as you same as me where do you come off saying he was dirty i didnt say he was hell you didnt mills jabbed a finger at her you start heading down that road dallas you wont get any help from me this is why the case belongs in our house and not with some bitch down at central the case is with some bitch down at central mills live with it at her easy response eve thought she caught martinez biting back a grin the question has to be asked i asked it i still havent heard the answer fuck you theres your answer mills martinez murmured take it down and fuck that too he rounded on her his fists were clenched and the blood had surged to his face goddamn skirts dont belong on the job anyway you go ahead and play with whitneys pet cunt martinez and see where it gets you no cop turns on another no matter what he was and gets by me with a last vicious look at eve he stalked out martinez cleared her throat scratched her head the lieutenant has a problem working with women and minorities is that so yeah so you shouldnt take it more personal than that look the ricker deal was mine and kohli was a straight arrow thats one of the reasons i tagged him for some of the drone work i dont like your question either but i figure its like you said it had to be asked kohli may not have been one to go the extra mile but he respected his badge he liked being a cop standing for the law and order thing i cant see him going on the take lieutenant just doesnt fit it depended eve thought on where you put the pieces what did mills mean no matter what he was on kohli her eyes sparkled with what might have been humor or temper meaning kohli was black mills is of the opinion the only real cop is male and white and hetero personalitywise mills is pretty much a flaming asshole eve waited until martinez left you get all that peabody yes sir record off make a copy for my file keep the other under wraps walk roarke through the place so he can get his damage report youve got fifteen minutes she told him then youre out and the place is sealed until i say different shes lovely when shes annoyed isnt she peabody ive always thought so fourteen minutes eve warned and counting why dont we start at the top he offered peabody his arm and work our way down when they were out of earshot she pulled out her communicator and called feeney in the electronic detective division i need a favor she said the minute his worn and weary face floated onscreen if it ties to the cop killing we wont count it every man in my unitll put in whatever time you need on it son of a bitch thinks he can get off with doing a cop like that hes gonna find out different and the hard way eve waited until hed run down switch this transmission to privacy mode would you feeney frowned but made the switch and slipped on his headset whats the deal youre not going to like it lets clear that up front so you dont have to give me grief on it i need you to run two cops for me lieutenant alan mills and detective julianna martinez both in illegals out of the one twentyeight i dont like it i need a quiet run feeney i dont want any flags going up his already mournful face dropped into sags i especially dont like it im sorry to ask id do it myself but you can do it faster and quieter she glanced up to where roarke and peabody walked along the top level i dont like it either but ive got to open the door before i can close it though he was alone in his office feeney lowered his voice you just looking dallas or are you looking for dirt i cant fill you in now but ive got too many connections to ignore do this for me feeney and when its done let me know well hook up somewhere and ill bring you up to date i know mills hes an asshole yeah ive had the pleasure but i cant see him dirty dallas thats the problem isnt it we never want to see it she pocketed the communicator righted a bar stool and sat in her notebook she began listing names putting kohlis in the center with arrows out to ricker connecting his with mills and theirs with martinez she added roth curving a line to all then in the bottom corner she added webster iab she arrowed his to kohli and wondered if she would be connecting him to anyone else before it was done then because it had to be done she added roarke hooked him to kohli and to ricker and hoped to god that would be the end of it death she thought left a picture told a story from both the victims and the killers point of view the scene itself the body the method time and place what was left behind what was taken away they were all part of the story illegals she thought continuing to scribble in her book blood on the shield overkill strippers missing security discs vice sex money thirty credit chips she continued to make notes frown over them as roarke and peabody worked their way back to her why the credit chips she asked out loud because he died for money not to make it look like a robbery another symbol blood money why thirty chips thirty pieces of silver roarke said watching eves blank stare your state education lieutenant wouldnt have included bible study judas was paid thirty pieces of silver for betraying christ thirty pieces of silver it clicked with her and she nodded as she pushed to her feet we can figure kohli stands for judas but whos standing as jesus she scanned the scene one last time times up she told roarke youll want to call your ride hell be outside by now roarke opened the door himself holding it as eve moved by him he caught her yanked her against him and closed his mouth warmly over hers thank you for your cooperation lieutenant oh man he can really kiss peabody all but sang it as roarke strolled to the limo waiting at the curb you can tell just by watching him do it hes a seriously excellent kisser just stop imagining he was kissing you i cant peabody rubbed her lips together as eve resealed the door and i can tell you that ones going to get me through the day and into the night youve got your own men now not the same peabody sighed as she trudged to eves car just nowhere near the same where are we going to see a stripper tell me its a male stripper and my day is made youre doomed to disappointment o o nancie lived in an attractive prewar building on lexington there were window boxes spilling with flowers on several of the upper levels and a cheerfulfaced uniformed doorman gave eve a dazzling grin when she held up her badge i hope theres no trouble lieutenant dallas maam if theres anything i can do you just let me know thanks i think we can handle it i bet he makes tons in tips peabody commented as they entered the small dignified lobby great smile nice butt what else could you ask for in a doorman she studied the lobby with its discreet name plaques polished brass elevator and attractive arrangement of spring flowers i never figured a place like this for a nude dancer its more like what youd think of for upperlevel office drones and junior execs i wonder what she makes a year thinking of switching professions yeah right peabody snorted as they stepped onto the elevator guys are lining up to see me naked though mcnab dont go there i just cant take it eve hurried off the elevator on six made a beeline for apartment c she was relieved when the door opened promptly and cut off any idea peabody might have harbored about finishing the statement nancie gaynor yes lieutenant dallas nypsd can we come in and speak with you oh sure this is about taj nancie fit the image of the apartment tidy attractive and pretty as a sunbeam she was young midtwenties by eves estimation and cute as a damn button with a curling mop of golden hair dollbaby lips painted rosy pink and huge green eyes the buttercupyellow skin suit she wore showed off her talent and still managed to look sweet she stepped back into the room on bare feet leaving a faint trace of lilies in the air im just sick about it she began just sick rue called us all yesterday to tell us those big eyes filled swam like irrigated green fields i just cant believe something like this could happen at purgatory she made a helpless gesture toward a long curving sofa covered in velvety pink fabric and an avalanche of shimmering pillows i guess wed better sit down should i get you something like to drink no dont bother do you mind if we record this conversation miss gaynor oh oh golly nancie bit her pretty bottom lip clasped her hands together between her truly spectacular breasts i guess not are you supposed to with your permission a stripper who said golly was all eve could think just when youd thought youd seen it all okay gee i want to help if i can but we can sit down right because i guess im a little nervous ive never been involved in a murder case i was questioned once right after i moved here from utumwa because my roommate she was an lc and shed let her license lapse but im sure it was just an oversight anyway i talked to the officer in charge of the licensing committee and all but that was different eve just blinked utumwa iowa i moved here from iowa four years ago i was hoping maybe to be a dancer on broadway she smiled a little i guess girls move here thinking stuff like that all the time im really a pretty good dancer but well so are a lot of other girls and it can be pretty expensive to live here so i took a job in a club it wasnt a very nice club she confided blinking those big eyes and i was getting pretty scared and discouraged and thinking maybe i should just go back to iowa and marry joey but hes sort of a cluck you know and then rue came in to catch my act and got me a job at this better club it was nice and the pay was much better and the customers didnt paw at you then when rue went to purgatory she took some of us with her thats a really classy club i just want you to know that nothing hinkydink goes on there hinkydink eve repeated slightly dazed by the tumble of words and information i appreciate you telling me all that oh i want to help nancie leaned forward leading with her eyes rue said if any of us knew anything we should contact you lieutenant eve dallas and that we should answer all your questions and do whatever we could because well its the right thing and youre married to roarke he owns purgatory i heard that somewhere oh gee id answer the questions even if you werent married to roarke i mean its my civic duty and all and taj was a really nice guy he respected your privacy you know even in a classy club some of the staff can take peeks when theyre not supposed to but you could walk right in front of taj naked as a jay and he never looked i mean he looked because you were right there but he never looked he had a wife and kids and was a real family man how did you shut this one off eve wondered miss gaynor oh you can call me nancie fine nancie you were working last night was a dancer named mitzi also on sure we work pretty much the same schedule mitzi left kind of early last night she was blue you know because that asshole excuse my french of a boyfriend dumped her for some sky waitress she kept breaking down and crying in the dressing room because like well he was the love of her life and all and was going to marry her and buy a house in queens i think or maybe it was brooklyn and then miss gaynor i guess that doesnt matter huh she said with a cheery smile anyway rue took her home rues really good at taking care of us dancers she used to be one maybe i should call mitzi and see how shes doing im sure shed appreciate that a tangle of information it might have been eve thought but it corroborated rue macleans alibi why dont you tell me about the last time you saw taj okay nancie sat back wiggled her butt into the cushions and folded her hands tidy as a schoolgirl in her lap i had two shows that night plus the two group dances and three private performances so i was kind of busy on my first break i saw taj eating a chicken sandwich i said hey taj that looks good enough to eat you know like a joke because you make a sandwich to eat it ha eve managed so he laughed a little and said that it was and that his wife had made it for him i got a soda pop a cherry fizz and said how id see him later because i had to go change costumes did you talk about anything else no just his chicken sandwich then i went back to change and the dressing room was a real zoo one of the girls thats dottie couldnt find her red wig and like i told you mitzi yes we covered mitzi uhhuh one of the other girls i think it was charmaine was telling mitzi how she should say good riddance which only made mitzi cry harder so wilhimena who used to be a guy but opted for the sex change told her to shut up charmaine i mean not mitzi and everybody was running around because we had a group dance coming up so we did that the group dance then i had a private i saw taj working the bar and i waved her ears were going to start ringing in a minute eve was sure of it was he talking to anyone in particular not that i noticed he had a way of working the bar so everybody had their drink and didnt get all huffy so i did the private for this businessman from toledo he said it was his birthday but sometimes they say stuff like that so youll do extra but rue doesnt want any of the dancers doing extra unless theyre licensed he gave me a hundred tip anyway then i had a turn in the spinner thats the level that revolves i dont really remember seeing taj again till closing because we were pretty packed i wanted another cherry fizz and he got me one and i sat at the bar for a little while after the place cleared out just unwinding sort of she sucked in a breath eve opened her mouth but nancie recovered first oh and viney was sick um nester vine we girls call him viney cause hes long and skinny isnt it funny how sometimes people look just like their names anyway he was all pale and sweaty and kept going back to the john until taj told him to go home and take care of himself i was feeling a little blue because i heard how joey got engaged to barbie thomas back home in utumwa right she was always chasing after him nancie frowned over it then appeared to let it go so taj was being sweet and telling me not to fret over that how i was a pretty young girl and would find the right man when the time came he said how when you found the right person that was just it and you didnt even have to wonder about it id just know i could tell he was thinking about his wife because he always got this soft look in his eyes when he thought about her it made me feel good so i stayed a little longer viney should have been there to close up with him but he was sick did i tell you that yes eve said a little dizzy you did okay he was sick like i said we arent really supposed to close up alone but sometimes we do taj said to me how it was getting late and i should go on home he said hed call me a cab but i was going to take the subway he wouldnt let me because the streets can be dangerous at night so i called a cab and he waited at the door until i got in it that was like him she said and her eyes went damp again he was sweet that way did he tell you anything about expecting a friend to come by that night i dont think she trailed off pursed her lips maybe maybe he did when i was crying the blues a little over joey and missing my friends from home i think he said something about how friends were always friends i think maybe he said he was looking forward to seeing a friend later but i didnt take it to mean that night at the club anyway she sighed dabbed under her eyes with a fingertip a friend didnt hurt taj that way friends dont do that it depends eve thought it very much depends on the friend chapter five eve calculated she could spend the next three days interviewing strippers table dancers customers and club crawlers or she could zero in on max ricker it wasnt a tough choice but both areas had to be covered she walked into the detectives squad room scanned faces some cops worked the links others wrote reports or studied data a team was taking a statement from a civilian who appeared to be more excited than distressed the scent of bad coffee and aging disinfectant stung the air she knew these cops some were sharper than others but all of them did the job pulling rank here had never been her style and she thought she could get what she wanted without resorting to it now she waited until the civilian looking flushed and pleased with himself left the bullpen okay listen up a dozen faces turned in her direction she watched expressions shift every one of them knew the case in her hands no she thought when links were disengaged and screens ignored she wouldnt have to pull rank ive got over six hundred potential witnesses to either eliminate or interview in the matter of detective taj kohli i could use some help those of you who arent on priority cases or who can see their way clear to put in a couple of extra hours over the next few days can see either me or peabody baxter was the first to get to his feet he was an occasional pain in the ass eve thought but christ he was dependable as sunrise i got time we all got time he glanced around the room himself as if daring anyone to disagree good eve slipped her hands in her pockets to give you an update on the investigation and here she had to step carefully detective kohli was bludgeoned to death while moonlighting in a highclass strip club called purgatory the club was closed and it appears kohli knew his attacker im looking for someone he knew well enough to be alone with to turn his back on someone she thought who was contacted by him or contacted him on his personal palmlink during his shift thats why the killer removed it from the scene at this point it doesnt appear that kohli was working on a sensitive case or pursuing information regarding one but its possible the killer was a weasel or outside informant robbery isnt a motive that holds this was personal she added watching faces a personal attack on the badge the one twentyeight thinks the investigation belongs with them i say it stays here damn right it stays here a detective named carmichael lifted her coffee mug scowled into it the medias leaving this alone so far eve continued its not a hot story a bartender doesnt boost ratings and the fact that he was a cop doesnt make much of a ripple onscreen he doesnt matter to them she waited scanned faces but he matters here any of you who want in can let peabody know how many witnesses you feel you can handle shell assign copy all statements and reports to me hey dallas can i have the strippers baxter teased just the wellstacked ones sure baxter we all know the only way youre going to see a woman naked is if shes paid for it there was a chorus of snorts and whoops ill be in the field most of the day anyone pulls anything i need to know tag me as she headed toward her office peabody hurried after her youre going in the field alone i need you here coordinating the witness assignments yeah but peabody up until last year i did most of my field work solo as she shoved back her desk chair to sit she caught the gleam of hurt in peabodys eyes nearly rolled her own that doesnt mean you havent aced the job peabody get a hold of yourself i need you here right now running this and scanning data youre better at the tech stuff than i am that appeared to brighten peabody again yeah i am but i could hook up with you when im clear here ill let you know why dont you get started while everyones in the mood to put in extra time in dismissal eve turned to her desk unit lets get moving yes sir eve waited until peabody left then got up to close the door back at her desk she called up all known data on max ricker she didnt want any surprises shed seen his picture before but she studied it more carefully now he had a powerful look a strongly carved face with prominent planes that looked glass sharp his mouth was hard with the silver brush of a mustache doing nothing to soften it his eyes were silver as well opaque and unreadable the vanity roarke had spoken of showed in the waving mane of dark hair tipped with silver wings in the single diamond stud he wore in his right ear and in the smooth polish of his white white skin that showed neither line nor fold but looked as if it had been stretched taut as bleached silk over those iceedged bones subject ricker max edward height six feet one inch weight two hundred two pounds caucasian dob february born philadelphia pennsylvania parents lean and michelle ricker deceased one sibling deceased educated university of pennsylvania with degree in business no marriages or legal cohabitations one son alex dob june mother listed as morandi ellen mary deceased current residences include hartford connecticut sarasota florida florence italy london england long neck estates on yost colony and nile river hotel on vegas ii profession listed as entrepreneur with interests and holdings as follows eve sat back now closed her eyes and listened to the rundown of rickers businesses there had been another time shed done a run on a man who had extensive and varied interests whod owned strings of companies and organizations whod looked as ricker did dangerous that run had changed her life she intended for this one to change rickers computer list criminal record all arrests and charges working she sat up again when the data began to roll and her eyebrows lifted there were a number of charges over the years beginning with petty larceny in continuing with gun running illegals distribution fraud bribery and two conspiracies to commit murder none of it had stuck hed slipped and slithered through but his sheet was long and varied not as clever as roarke are you she murmured he never got caught theres the arrogance you dont mind getting caught not really she studied his face again because it gives you a kick to fuck the system thats a weakness ricker a big one computer copy all data to disc she turned to her link it was time to find out just where ricker was currently cooling his wellshod heels o o she considered it good luck that ricker was spending some time in his connecticut compound she considered it his arrogance that hed agreed to meet with her without making her dance through a sea of attorneys she made the drive in good time and was met at the gate by a trio of hatchetfaced guards who put her through an id scan for forms sake she was instructed to leave her vehicle just inside the gates and get into a small sleek cart its operator was an equally small and sleek female droid who drove her along the winding treelined path to a sprawling threestory house of wood and glass that perched on a rocky slope over a restless sea there was a fountain at the entrance where a stone woman draped in a flowing gown gracefully poured pale blue water from a pitcher into a pool teeming with red fish a gardener worked a plot of flowers at the east side of die house he wore baggy gray pants and shirt a widebrimmed hat and a doublescoped distance laser another female droid met her at the door this one a comfortably built serving model in a starched black uniform her smile was welcoming her voice warm good day lieutenant dallas mr ricker is expecting you i hope you had a pleasant trip if youd follow me please eve studied the house as they walked through here the money all but dripped it didnt have the class of roarkes place where the mood was rich but somehow homey with its polished woods and muted colors ricker went for the modern and the garish surrounding himself with eyesearing colors too much fabric and not enough taste everything was sharpedged and accented by what she now concluded was his signature silver thirty pieces of silver she thought as she stepped into a room done in bloodred with a breathless view of the sea through the windowwall the other walls were jammed with art all of it modernistic or surreal or whatever the hell they called stuff that was nothing more than slashes of paint on canvas and pulsing slides of ugly colors on glass the scent of flowers was heavy here and funereal the light overbright and the furniture all sliding sinuous curves with glimmering cushions and silver limbs ricker sat in one of the chairs sipping something violently pink out of a long slim tube he got graciously to his feet smiled ah eve dallas we meet at last welcome to my humble home what can we offer you in the way of refreshment nothing oh well youve only to ask if you change your mind there was a roundness to his voice something that reminded her of the dialogue in some of the old blackandwhite videos roarke liked to watch that will be all marta yes mr ricker she backed out of the room closing the doors behind her eve dallas he said again eyes sparkling as he gestured to a chair this is absolutely delightful may i call you eve no the sparkle turned cold silver sleet now even as he let out a hearty laugh pity lieutenant then wont you sit down i have to admit to some curiosity about the woman who married one of my old i was going to say proteges he said as he sat again but im sure roarke would object to the term so ill say one of my former associates i had hoped he would accompany you today he has no business here or with you not at the moment please sit be comfortable comfort wasnt one of the options in the ugly chair but she sat how attractive you are he spoke smoothly while his gaze crawled over her men who looked at a woman in just that way wanted her to feel sexually vulnerable physically uneasy eve only felt mildly insulted in a competent unpretentious sort of fashion ricker finished not what one expected of roarke of course his taste always ran to the more stylish more obviously female he drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair and she noted he had his nails painted in his signature color and the tips were filed to vicious little points but how clever of him to have selected you a woman of your more subtle attributes and profession it must be very convenient for him to have such an intimate ally on the police force it was meant to get a rise out of her so she only angled her head really and why would that be convenient for him mr ricker given his interests ricker sipped his drink business interests and does his business concern you mr ricker only in an academic sense as we were once connected so to speak she leaned forward would you like to speak on record about your connections his eyes narrowed snakelike would you risk him lieutenant roarke can take care of himself can you have you tamed him lieutenant neutered the wolf and made him a lapdog this time she laughed and meant it the lapdog would rip out your throat without breathing hard and you know it i had no idea you were so afraid of him thats interesting youre mistaken but his fingers had tightened on the tube she watched his throat work as if he were struggling to swallow something particularly vile i dont think so but roarke isnt the reason im here its your business id like to discuss mr ricker she took out her recorder with your permission his lips curved a hard line under that brush of silver that was nothing like a smile of course and he tapped a finger on the arm of his chair across the room a hologram swam into view six darksuited men sat side by side at a long table hands folded eyes sharp my attorneys he explained eve set the recorder on the silver table between them read off the necessary data and recited the revised miranda youre thorough roarke would appreciate that as do i you understand your rights and obligations mr ricker i do indeed and you have engaged your right to have your attorneys all six of them present at this informal interview you were arrested six months ago for she held up a hand and though she knew the charges by rote took out her memo book and read them off precisely the manufacture possession and distribution of illegal substances including hallucinogens and known addictives the international and interplanetary transportation of illegal substances possession of banned weapons the operation of chemical plants without a license the lieutenant to save us both valuable time i will state that i was aware of all charges levied against me at the time of my unfortunate arrest last fall as im sure you are aware that most of those ridiculous charges were subsequently dropped and those that were not resulted in a trial in which i was acquitted im aware that your attorneys and the prosecuting attorney of new york negotiated a deal in which several of the more minor charges against you were dropped in return the names of four arms and illegals dealers and information against them were given to the pas office through your representative youre not overly loyal to your associates mr ricker on the contrary im exceedingly loyal to them i have no associates who are arms and or illegal dealers lieutenant im a businessman one who makes considerable donations to charitable and political causes every year yes i know about your political donations you gave generously to an organization known as cassandra i did he lifted a hand as one of his attorneys started to speak and was shocked shocked to the bone when i discovered their terrorist activities you did the world a great service lieutenant by breaking open that ugly sphere by destroying it until the story came out in the media i had been deluded into believing the cassandra group was dedicated to insuring the safety and rights of the american public yes through paramilitary means but legal ones a pity you didnt research cassandra more closely mr ricker as i would assume someone with your resources would do before he tossed in more than ten million of his hardearned dollars a mistake i deeply regret the employee who oversaw the donations has since been terminated i see you were scheduled for trial on several of the charges not within the scope of the deal with the prosecutors office however evidence went missing and certain data from the operation leading to and including the raid on the warehouse owned by you was damaged is that the official word for it he tossed his head causing his silver wings to flutter the data was thin incomplete and ridiculously weighted with misinformation by the police in order to arrange for the attack on a warehouse which though one of my properties was run and operated by an independent contractor his eyes began to gleam she noted his voice to rise and those lethally tipped fingers to beat a fast tattoo on the arm of the chair the entire matter was nothing more than police harassment and my attorneys are looking into a suit against the nypsd as a result what is your connection with detective taj kohli kohli he continued to smile the hard glitter bright in his eyes im afraid that name doesnt ring a bell i do have acquaintance with many in your profession lieutenant i am a strong supporter of the men and women who serve but that particular name wait wait he rubbed a finger against his lips and damn him she heard the light chuckle kohli yes of course i heard about the tragedy he was killed recently wasnt he kohli was on the task force that busted your new york warehouse and cost you several million dollars in goods mr ricker was never legally connected to the warehouse labs or distribution center in new york city which was discovered by and closed down by the new york city police and security department we object to the statement claiming otherwise being read into this record the lawyers voice droned but neither ricker nor eve bothered to glance in his direction its most unfortunate that your detective kohli was killed lieutenant am i to be questioned every time a police officer meets a tragic end it could be construed as additional harassment no it couldnt as the request for this interview was granted without condition now she smiled im sure your fleet of lawyers will verify that kohli worked details mr ricker he was good at details as a businessman and man of the world im sure youll agree that the truth is in them and the truth has a way of surfacing no matter how deep its buried it just takes the right person to dig it out i have a real fondness for the truth and a serious objection to having a fellow officer executed so finding that truth and finding the person who killed kohli or arranged for it is going to be a personal mission of mine im sure it offends you to have had your colleague murdered and brutally in an establishment owned by your husband excitement jangled in his voice just a little offkey sticky isnt it lieutenant for both of you is that why youre troubling me with veiled accusations rather than calling your own husband into interview i didnt say the murder was brutal or that it took place in an establishment owned by roarke how did you come by that information mr ricker for the first time he appeared flustered his stare going blank his mouth drooping all six lawyers began talking at once a buzz of noise that was no more than cover and wasted air it gave ricker time to compose himself i make it my business to know things lieutenant my business i was informed that there was an incident at one of your husbands properties informed by who another associate i believe he waved a hand idly but it curled into a fist before it rested on the arm of the chair again i cant recall is it against the law to have that information i collect information a kind of hobby information on people who interest me such as yourself im aware you see that you were raised by the state found in considerable distress when you were but a child of eight his hand uncurled as he spoke but his eyes grew brighter hungrier eve thought like a man anticipating a particularly fine meal raped werent you and quite violently it must be difficult to live with a trauma such as that to reconcile yourself to such viciously stolen innocence you dont even have your own name do you but one given to you by a harried social worker eve a rather sentimental choice indicating the first woman and dallas a practical one reflecting the city where you were discovered broken bruised and all but mute in a filthy alley it did the job it took her back slicked her insides with illness chilled her bones but she never took her eyes off his face never flinched we play the cards we were dealt i collect information too mostly on people who disturb my sense of style dig up all the data you want on me ricker itll only help you get a good clear picture of just who youre up against this time kohlis mine now and ill find the who and why and how for him depend on it interview end she said and picked up her recorder even as his lawyers erupted with warnings and objections ricker clicked off the hologram if possible he was paler than hed been when shed come in be careful lieutenant those who threaten me meet unpleasant ends look at my data again ricker and youll see the unpleasant doesnt worry me he rose as she did took a step forward in a way that had her bracing and hoping hoping hed lose control just for an instant an instant would be long enough you think you can pit yourself against me you think your badge is power he snapped his fingers in front of her face like that you can be gone and forgotten try it and see muscles worked in his face but he drew himself back perhaps you believe mistakenly that your connection to roarke will protect you hes weak gone soft and sentimental and over a cop i had plans for him once i have different ones now youd better take a closer look at your data ricker and youll see i dont and never have needed anyone to protect me but ill tell you this roarkes going to get a real kick out of knowing just how much you fear him well have a good laugh over it over you later when she turned he grabbed her arm her heart leapt in anticipation as she looked up coolly oh please do she murmured his fingers dug in once viciously the nails drilling into her flesh before they released control she thought no he wasnt nearly as controlled as he believed he was ill show you out i know the way youd better get to work ricker make sure youve covered your tracks im going to be turning up every rock you crawl under im going to enjoy it she strolled out unsurprised to see the servant droid hovering close by and smiling homily i hope you enjoyed your visit lieutenant dallas ill see you to the door as she walked away eve heard the unmistakable sound of glass smashing no she thought and smiled herself not nearly as controlled she was taken back to her car and was watched carefully as she drove through the gates ten minutes later she spotted the first tail they didnt even try to be subtle about it she let them tag her kept her speed just over the legal limit and passed another twenty miles before the second car swung on from a ramp and pulled in front of her caged her in lets play she decided and hit the accelerator she changed lanes threaded through traffic but didnt make it too hard for them as she calculated the lay of the land she made a call on her link almost casually with what she hoped looked like panic she pulled off the freeway just over the new york line i knew you wouldnt let me down she murmured as the cars closed in behind her morons satisfied the road was quiet enough she punched the accelerator again flew along then swung in a hard circle and drove headlong toward the pursuing cars one veered right one left and at the speed they were traveling they skidded off the road just as she hit her sirens she hopped out weapon drawn police out everybody out hands where i can see them she saw the passenger in the second car reach inside his jacket and she shot a blast at the headlights glass exploded even as the screams of other sirens joined hers get your asses out of those vehicles right now with her free hand she whipped out her badge nypsd youre under arrest one of the drivers got out looking cocky but he kept his hands in sight as two black and whites pulled up behind whats the charge why dont we start with speeding and go from there she jerked a thumb hands on the roof you know the position the uniforms swarmed in like bees want them cuffed lieutenant yeah i think they were resisting and would you look at this she stopped patting down the first driver and plucked out his side arm concealed weapon man a banned weapon too wow youre in really big trouble a quick search turned up more weapons six ounces of exotica two of zeus a fancy set of burglary tools and three short steel pipes handy for spine cracking haul these losers into central for me will you she asked the uniforms book them on carrying concealed possession of illegals transporting banned weapons in a motor vehicle and crossing state lines with same possession of suspicious merchandise she grinned fiercely as she dusted off her hands oh and dont forget speeding mr rickers going to be very unhappy with you boys very unhappy she slid back into her car rolled her shoulders temper temper ricker she thought and rubbed absently at the ache where his fingers had dug never give orders when in emotional distress round one goes to me chapter six ian mcnab tried to look casual as he wandered into the detectives bullpen it wasnt easy for a man sporting a waistlong braid and wearing orange flight pants to look casual but he worked at it he had an excuse for being in that area a few of the detectives had tossed run requests on the witnesses listed in the kohli case over to edd that was mcnabs story and he was sticking to it he also had a reason for being in that area and the reason was tucked into a skinny cubicle in the far corner studiously doing tech work she looked so cute when she was studious he was gone on her all right he wasnt particularly happy about it as his plan had always been to scoop as many women into his life as humanly possible he just plain loved women but then peabody had marched into his life in her ugly cop shoes and spitspot uniform and that as the historians say was that she wasnt completely cooperating oh hed finally gotten her into bed on the kitchen floor in an elevator car in an empty locker room and anywhere else his fluid imagination could devise but she wasnt moony over him he was forced to admit though it grated daily that he was well over that moon as regarded officer delia peabody he squeezed into her cubicle settled his skinny butt on the corner of her desk hey shebody whats up what are you doing out of edd she kept right on working didnt even glance up you break your chain again they dont lock us up in edd like they do over here how do you work in this cage efficiently go away mcnab im really swamped here the kohli deal its all anybody can talk about poor son of a bitch because there was pity in his voice she did glance up and noted that his eyes cool and green werent just sad they were pissed yeah well well get the slime who killed him dallas is working the angles nobody does it better some of the guys here asked us to run some names everybody in edd from feeney down to the lowest drones on it she worked up a sneer why arent you i was elected to swing over and see if i could wangle an update come on peabody were in it too give me something to take back i dont have that much keep this part to yourself she said lowering her voice and peeking through the narrow opening of her work space i dont know what dallas is up to she went out in the field and didnt take me with her didnt tell me where she was going either then a few minutes ago i get a call from her shes got uniforms bringing in four mopes booking them on various charges including carrying concealeds and she wants me to run the names quick fast and now shes on her way in whatd you find all four of them have been guests of various government facilities mostly violent crimes assaults assaults with deadlies spinecrackers and persuaders from the sheets but get this she lowered her voice even more so that mcnab had to lean in catch a teasing whiff of her shampoo theyre connected to max ricker mcnab opened his mouth then sucked in the exclamation when peabody hissed at him you think rickers behind the kohli deal i dont know but i know kohli was part of the team that busted him last fall because dallas had me get the case file and the trial transcript i took a quick look and kohli was low level didnt testify either of course the case was tossed out of court within three days but dallas has some reason for hauling in four of his goon squad this is good stuff you can pass on the mopes shes bringing in but keep quiet about the ricker connection until weve got more i could do that but i want some incentive how about you come by tonight i dont know what dallas has planned he was grinning at her for reasons peabody couldnt figure she was finding it harder and harder to resist that dopey grin but i could probably swing by speaking of swinging when you get there we could he started to lean closer make a suggestion he thought would keep her revved through shift then he shot off the desk like a pebble from a sling jesus its the commander chill down but peabody came to attention herself it wasnt unprecedented for whitney to make an appearance in the squad room but he didnt make a habit of it either oh man hes coming over here she saw it and had to resist the impulse to tug at her uniform jacket to make certain it was straight detective whitney stopped filled the entrance to the cubicle and pinned mcnab with dark steely eyes have you transferred out of the electronic detective division no sir commander edd is working in conjunction with homicide on the matter of detective taj kohli were confident that this interdepartmental cooperation and effort will result in closing the case quickly he was good peabody thought with annoyed admiration slick as cat spit then perhaps you should get back to your division and continue that cooperation detective instead of disrupting this officers work but not she thought quite slick enough mcnab nearly saluted but managed to restrain himself then vanished like smoke officer do you have the data your lieutenant requested on the four individuals currently in booking in booking already jeez yes sir hard copy he said and held out a hand peabody ordered the printout as ordered commander ive sent copies of the data to lieutenant dallass vehicle and office units he merely grunted then turned away already reading the data he paused glanced over as eve walked in lieutenant your office peabody winced at the tone it was hard as granite and courageously she stepped out of her cubicle she couldnt say she was disappointed when eve signaled her back then swung toward her office there was a fire being lighted peabody thought but wasnt sure who was going to get burned sir eve held the door open waited for whitney to pass through then closed it behind them explain lieutenant why you left the state and your jurisdiction interrogated max ricker without discussing your intentions or going through the chain of command commander as primary i am not required to clear investigative interviews through any chain of command and i am authorized to leave my jurisdiction to do so if the interview is pertinent to the case and to harass a civilian in another state she felt the first sting of temper ignored it harass sir i received a call from rickers attorney who has also contacted the chief of police and who is threatening to sue you this department and the city of new york for harassing his client and for assaulting and detaining four of rickers employees really hes running scared all right she murmured i didnt think id gotten to him that deep commander she said bringing herself back i contacted ricker requested an interview at his convenience and was granted same she pulled a sealed disc from a drawer the request made from this unit and the agreement to said request were recorded as was my interview with ricker in his home where he was properly mirandized in the presence of six of his attorneys by holograph this time she took a disc from her bag recorded commander with his full knowledge with respect sir hes pissing in the wind on this good i thought as much he took both discs however angling for ricker on a cop killing is a dangerous and delicate matter youd better have a foundation you can stand on its my job to pursue all possible leads im doing my job and does your job include rousting four men on a public road endangering their lives and the lives of innocent bystanders with reckless driving and causing two vehicles to incur damage her training was too solid to permit her to snarl but she thought about it while in transit from connecticut to new york city i was tailed then pursued by two civilian vehicles containing two men each while i took evasive maneuvers said vehicles continued pursuit exceeding the posted speed limits concerned at the possible danger to other civilians i left the heavily traveled freeway for an empty stretch of road at this time the two pursuing vehicles further increased speed shifting into a charge pattern the vehicles crossed the state line unsure of their purpose i called for backup and rather than risk continuing a highspeed chase into a populated area i engaged my sirens executed a uturn as a result the pursuing vehicles ran off the road lieutenant sir i would like to complete my report of the incident her temper might have been spiking but her tone was very cool go ahead lieutenant complete your report i identified myself as a police officer ordered them out of the vehicles at this time one of the individuals made a suspicious move toward what i perceived and later discovered was in fact a weapon i fired a warning shot which damaged a headlight two radio cars arrived as backup and the four individuals were restrained during the resulting search which is permissible given the probable cause banned weapons two forms of illegals in small quantities suspicious tools and two weighted steel pipes were found to be in the individuals possession or concealed in their vehicles at this time i requested that the uniformed officers transport the individuals to central for booking on various charges contacted my aide to execute a standard run on each man and returned with the intention of writing my report and questioning the individuals i had so detained her voice remained flat cool and dead calm she refused to allow any temper or triumph to glimmer in her eyes once again she reached in her bag took out two discs all of the aforesaid was recorded through my unit during the pursuit and during the arrest by my collar clip it is my opinion that proper procedure was followed as closely as possible whitney took the discs and allowed himself the tiniest of smiles as he pocketed them nice work damn nice work she ordered herself to change gears and change them smoothly but her thank you sir came out with a bite pissed off that i questioned you whitney asked yes sir i am cant blame you idly he tapped his fingers on the discs in his pocket then wandered as much as he was able to her skinny window i was confident youd have covered yourself here but not completely confident above that youll be hammered at by the lawyer even with the record i wanted to see how youd hold up to it you held dallas as always i can handle myself with the lawyer no doubt whitney drew a breath studied the miserable view out her miserable window and wondered how she stood working in that box of a room are you waiting for an apology lieutenant no no sir good he turned back to her his face closed and hard again command rarely apologizes you followed procedure and id expect no less however this doesnt negate the fact that by pulling ricker into the case youve put the department in a strained situation a dead cop makes a strained situation for me dont secondguess me lieutenant he snapped and dont underestimate my personal and departmental stand on the murder of detective kohli if ricker was involved in this i want his ass more than you do yes more he added now tell me why if he agreed to interview he sent four assholes after you i got under his skin specifics lieutenant then he looked around where the hell do you sit in this hole saying nothing she pulled out her creaky desk chair he stared at it a moment then in a gesture that popped the tension out of the room like a pin in a balloon he threw back his head and roared you think i dont know thats an insult i put half my ass on that excuse for a chair and im through it and on the floor for christs sake dallas youve got rank you can have an office instead of this cave i like it here you get something bigger you end up putting more chairs in maybe a table then people start dropping by to chat whitney hissed through his teeth tell me let me have some of that coffee roarke scores you she moved to the autochef programmed for two cups hot strong and black commander id like to speak off the record for a moment give me that coffee and you can speak any way you damn well want for the next hour jesus god what a scent she smiled to herself remembering the first time shed tasted roarkes coffee the real thing not soy or any of that manmade bean crap she should have known then and there hed be it for her and because he was it for her she turned with the coffee and put her faith in her commander roarke was connected to ricker in some areas of business roarke ended the association more than ten years ago ricker hasnt forgotten it or forgiven it hed like to sting roarke if he could through me if it works that way during the meet i used roarke to poke at him it worked he lost his cool a couple of times i keep pressing that sore spot hell keep losing it how bad does he want roarke bad enough i think but hes scared of him that scrapes at him more than anything that underlying fear because well he doesnt see it as fear but as intense loathing he sent those morons after me because he wasnt thinking he was reacting hes too smart to order four pissbrains to hassle a cop pissbrains that can be tracked back to him but he lost control just long enough to send them out he wanted me hurt because i sneered at him because im roarkes cop and i sneered at him you baited him consider this he might have hurt you before you got clear of the house he wouldnt foul his own nest it was a risk but calculated if i can get one of those jerks to roll we could bring ricker in put more pressure on him these types dont roll easy it wouldnt take much i want ricker inside he skated on the illegals bust he shouldnt have ive studied the reports and transcripts it looked like textbook every angle covered then there were all these screwups the mix in the chain of evidence one of the primary witnesses disappearing when he was supposed to be under protection some clerk in the pas office misfiles a statement little holes make bigger holes and he slides through i agree and theres no one whod like to nail ricker more than i would but his connection to kohli is tenuous at best i cant see your angle on it im working it was all she would say she thought of webster the hints but she wasnt ready to talk about it dallas ricker cant be your personal vendetta hes not let me work it through commander its your investigation but watch your step if ricker was the trigger on kohli he wont hesitate to point at you from what youve told me he has more reason to i get in his face enough hell make a mistake i wont make one she went around with the lawyers one for each of the men shed brought in they were she thought slime in fivethousanddollar suits they knew every trick but they were going to have a hard time weaseling around the fact she had everything on record records the head slime named canarde said with a lift of his perfectly manicured fingers you alone had possession of you have no corroboration that the discs were not manufactured or tampered with for the purpose of harassing my client what was your client doing riding my back bumper from connecticut to new york it isnt against the law to drive a public road lieutenant she simply flipped back tapped her finger on the file carrying concealed and banned weapons my client claims you planted those weapons eve shifted her gaze toward the client a man of about two hundred and fifty pounds with hands like hams and a face only a mother could love if she were seriously nearsighted as yet he hadnt opened his mouth i mustve been pretty busy so your client who apparently has been struck mute purports that i just happened to be carrying four selfcharging hand lasers and a couple of longscoped flame rifles in my police unit with the hopes that some innocent civilian might come along and i could frame him seeing as what i didnt like his face my client has no knowledge of your motives your client is a piece of shit whos been down this road before assault and battery carrying concealeds assault with a deadly possession with intent youre not standing for some choirboy canarde with what weve got on him he goes in and he stays in my best guess is twentyfive hard time with no parole option offplanet penal colony never been on an offplanet facility have you pal eve showed her teeth in a smile they make the cages here look like suites at the palace police harassment and intimidation is expected canarde said smoothly my client has nothing more to say yeah hes been a real chatterbox up till now you going to let ricker make you the sacrificial lamb here you think hes worried about the twentyfive youll do in a cage lieutenant dallas canarde interrupted but eve kept her eyes on the man saw the faintest shadow of worry in his eyes i dont want you lewis you want to save yourself you want to deal with me who sent you after me today say the name and i cut you out of the herd this interview is over canarde got to his feet is it over lewis you want it over you want to start your first night of twentyfive in a cage does he pay you enough can anyone pay you enough to make you swallow sitting in a hole twenty hours every day for twentyfive years with a slab for a bed with security cams watching you piss in a steel toilet no luxuries offplanet lewis the idea isnt rehabilitation no matter what the politicians say its punishment be quiet mr lewis i have ended this interview lieutenant and demand my clients right to a hearing yeah hell get his hearing she rose youre a sap lewis if you think this mouth in a pricey suits standing for you i got nothing to say to cops or cunts lewis looked up sneered but eve saw the glitter of fear in his eyes i guess that counts me out altogether eve signaled to the guard take this sack of shit to his hole sleep tight lewis i wont tell you to sleep canarde she said as she walked out i hear sharks dont she rounded the corner slipped down a hall and through a door where whitney and peabody stood in observation the hearings are set for tomorrow starting at nine whitney told her canarde and his team put on the pressure to get them in fine our boysll still spend the night in a cell i want to sweat lewis again before the hearing we can push his hearing to the end of the group give me some time with him tomorrow morning hes the one wholl crack agreed youve never visited an offplanet rehabilitation center have you lieutenant no sir but ive heard theyre gutters worse lewis will have heard too keep playing that note go home he added get some sleep if id been in there peabody said when they were alone idve rolled over on my mother could he really cop twentyfive offplanet oh yeah you dont mess with a cop the system frowns severely on it he knows it too hes going to be thinking about it tonight thinking hard i want you back here at sixthirty i want to hit him again early you can stand in look mean and heartless i love doing that are you going home she asked knowing how often her lieutenant sent her off and stayed on the job herself yeah yeah i am after rubbing shoulders with that bunch i want a shower sixthirty peabody yes sir o o shed missed dinner and wasnt pleased to discover the candy thief whod targeted her as patsy had found her newest stash she had to settle for an apple someone had foolishly left in the squads friggie still it filled the hole so that by the time she got home she was more interested in a long hot shower than a meal she was slightly disappointed that summerset didnt slide into the foyer on her arrival so they could have their evening pissing match shower first she decided jogging up the stairs then shed track roarke down the shower would give her time to figure out just how much of her day she wanted to share with him editing ricker out of it for the time being seemed like the best path to marital harmony when she stepped into the bedroom she saw the flowers first it was difficult to miss them as there was a fourfoot spread of them dead center of the room and the scent was sweet enough to hurt her teeth it took another moment to realize the flowers had long skinny legs in black trousers summerset the shower could wait for me gee you shouldnt have if you dont try harder to control your passion for me roarkes going to fire your bony ass and make my life complete your humor the flowers said in a dry faintly slavic voice eludes me as usual this obnoxious and overstated arrangement just arrived by private messenger watch the cat she began as summerset stepped forward and galahad strolled in his path to her surprise and reluctant admiration summerset neatly sidestepped avoided galahads tail by a well a cat hair and neatly set the enormous bouquet on the wide table in the sitting area galahad leaped up sniffed at it then padded over to butt his head on summersets leg the flowers are for you summerset said and since she was looking ignored the cat and as of now they become your problem who sent them theyre not roarkes style certainly not summerset sniffed a great deal as galahad had done and eyed the elaborate arrangement with distaste perhaps one of your felonious acquaintances considers it a suitable bribe yeah right she snatched out the card ripped it open then snarled in a manner that had the cat leaping down and standing between summersets legs ricker that son of a bitch max ricker distaste turned to ice the jagged sort that flayed skin why would he send you flowers to get my goat she said absently then a ripple of fear worked into her belly or roarkes get them out of here bum them stuff them in the recycler get rid of them fast and dont tell roarke she grabbed summersets sleeve dont tell roarke she made it a point never to ask summerset for anything the fact that she was and urgently had alarm bells sounding in his brain whats ricker to you a target get them out damn it wheres roarke in his office upstairs let me see the card have you been threatened theyre bait she said impatiently for roarke take the elevator move get them gone she crumbled the card in her hand before summerset could grab it from her now dissatisfied summerset lifted the arrangement again be very very careful he said then maneuvered them onto the elevator she waited until the doors closed before she smoothed out the card read it again i never had the chance to kiss the bride m ricker ill give you the chance she muttered and carefully tore the card to bits the first time we meet in hell she flushed the pieces breathed a little easier then stripped she left her clothes where they fell laid her weapon harness over the long counter then stepped into the glasswalled shower all jets full she ordered closing her eyes one hundred and two degrees she let the water beat at her everywhere warm away the little chill the flowers had brought with them she would put that aside and calculate how she would drill at lewis the next morning feeling better she turned the jets off squeezed some of the water out of her hair and turned yelped jesus jesus christ roarke you know i hate when you sneak up on me like that yes i do he opened the door to the drying tube knowing she preferred it to a leisurely toweling off while the fan whirled he strolled over to take her robe from the hook on the back of the door but when she stepped out he held onto it rather than offering who put those marks on you huh your arms bruised yeah she glanced down had an image of ricker his eyes burning as his fingers dug into her flesh youre right mustve run into something she reached for the robe only to have him hold it out of reach come on im not going to play your sick games in the bathroom such a statement usually made him smile her stomach began to quiver when his eyes stayed cool and steady on hers theyre finger marks lieutenant who handled you for gods sake working up irritation she snatched the robe im a cop remember it means i tend to run into a number of nasty characters in any given day have you eaten im starving he let her walk back into the bedroom stand and fiddle with the autochef waited until she punched in a request where are the flowers oh shit what flowers the flowers eve that were delivered just a while ago i dont know what youre talking about i just got hey hed spun her around so quickly her teeth nearly rattled might have if they hadnt frozen solid at the fury in his eyes the chill had turned to fire very quickly dont lie to me dont ever fucking lie to me cut it out he had her arms but even now she realized even when he was furious he didnt hurt her and was careful to keep his grip away from the bruise flowers come here all the time what am i supposed to know about it now let me go im hungry ill tolerate and by god do tolerate a great deal from you eve but you wont stand here and lie to my face you have bruises on you put there since i last saw you and by someones hand summerset is downstairs feeding a bunch of flowers into the recycler on your orders i assume since he brought them up here first goddamn it i can still smell them what are you afraid of im not afraid of anything then who who put the fear behind your eyes you she knew it was wrong knew it was cruel and hated herself for it when his eyes went blank when he stepped just a little too carefully back from her i beg your pardon she hated when he used that rigid and formal tone hated it worse than a shout and when he turned to walk away from her she gave up roarke damn it roarke she had to go after him take his arm im sorry look im sorry i have work dont freeze me out i cant take it when you do that she dragged her hands through her hair pressed the heels of them hard on her forehead where it had begun to throb i dont know how to do this any way i do its going to piss you off disgusted she stalked back to the sitting area flopped on the couch scowled at nothing in particular why dont you try the truth yeah all right but you have to make me a promise first which would be oh get the stick out of your ass and sit down would you the stick in my ass is surprisingly comfortable just now hed been studying her face calculating speculating and he knew you went to see ricker what are you psychic then her eyes popped wide and she was up and running again hey hey hey you promised no i didnt she caught up to him in the hallway considered trying to muscle him to the floor then decided to go for his weak spot she simply wrapped her arms around him please he put his hands on you roarke look at me roarke she laid her hands on his face the look in his eyes was murder she knew he could accomplish it hot or cold i baited him ive got my reasons and right now ive got him shaken the flowers were just a dig at you he wants you to come after him he wants it and why shouldnt i oblige him because im asking you not to because taking him down is my job and if i play it right im going to do that job there are times you ask a great deal i know it i know you could go after him i know youd find a way to get it done but its not the right way its not who you are anymore isnt it but the rage the first blinding rush of it was leveling off no its not i stood with him today and now im standing with you youre nothing like him nothing i could have been but youre not the crisis had passed she felt it lets go in and sit down ill tell you all of it he tipped her face back a finger under her chin though the gesture was tender his eyes were still hard dont lie to me again okay she closed a hand over his wrist squeezed there in silent promise where his pulse beat okay chapter seven so she told him running through the steps and movements of her day in a tone very close to the one shed used in her oral report to whitney dispassionate professional cool he said nothing not a word stretching out the silence until her nerves were riding on the surface of her skin his eyes never left her face and gave her no clue to what he was thinking feeling just that deep wicked blue cold now as arctic ice she knew what he was capable of when pushed no not even when pushed she thought as her nerves kicked into a gallop when he believed whatever methods he used were acceptable when she was finished he rose walked casually to the wall panel that concealed a bar he helped himself to a glass of wine held up the bottle would you like one ah sure he poured a second glass as steadily as naturally as if theyd been sitting discussing some minor household incident she wasnt easily rattled had faced pain and death without a tremor had waded through the pain and death of others as a matter of routine but god he rattled her she took the glass he offered her and had to remind herself not to gulp it down like water so thats all there is to it he sat again gracefully arranged himself on the cushion like a cat she thought a very big very dangerous cat he sipped his wine watching her over the crystal rim lieutenant he said in a voice so mild it might have fooled another what do you expect me honestly expect me to do nothing she set her glass down it wasnt the time for wine yes youre not a stupid woman your instincts and intellect are two of the things i admire most about you dont do this roarke dont make this personal his eyes flashed a hard glint of blue steel it is personal okay no she could handle it had to and leaned forward toward him its not unless you let him string you he wants it to be wants you to make it personal so he can fuck with you roarke youre not a stupid man your instincts and intellect are two of the things i admire most about you for the first time in more than an hour his lips curved in a hint of a smile well done eve he cant hurt me seeing her opening all but diving through it she shifted onto her knees put her hands on his shoulders unless you let him he can hurt me through you dont let him do that dont play the game do you think i wont win she lowered to her heels i know you will it scares me knowing you will and what the cost could be to both of us to us roarke dont do this let me work it he said nothing a moment looking in her eyes studying what he saw there felt there if he touches you again puts his mark on you again hes dead no be quiet he said before she could speak ill stand back so far for you but he crosses the line and its over ill find the way the time and its over i dont need that darling eve he touched her now just a skim of his fingertips over her jaw i need that you dont know him as much as youve seen as much as youve done you dont know him i do sometimes she reminded herself you had to settle for what you could get you wont go after him not at the moment and that costs me so leave it at that when he pushed off the couch she felt the chill swore under her breath youre still pissed off at me oh yes yes i am what do you want from me exasperated she scrambled to her feet and wished she didnt want to punch a fist into his gorgeous face for lack of a better solution i said i was sorry youre sorry because i pinned you okay right thats mostly right out of patience with him with herself she kicked viciously at the sofa i dont know how to do this i love you and it makes me crazy isnt that bad enough he had to laugh she looked so baffled christ jesus eve youre a piece of work i ought to at least get some sort of handicap for damn it she hissed as her communicator beeped she resisted the urge to simply pluck it out and wing it against the wall instead she just kicked the sofa again dallas what dispatch dallas lieutenant eve dos reported george washington bridge eastbound level two victim is preliminarily identified as mills lieutenant alan assigned to precinct one twoeight illegals division you are ordered to report to scene immediately as primary oh god oh christ acknowledged contact peabody officer delia to act as aide im on my way she was sitting now her head weighing heavily in one hand her stomach dragging to her knees another cop another dead cop im going with you with you lieutenant roarke said when she shook her head or alone but im going get dressed ill drive i can get us there faster o o the bridge sparkled an arch teeming with lights against the clear night sky in that sky busy air traffic streamed all but obliterating the tentative light of a thumbnail moon life surged on on the second level of the bridge closed now to traffic a dozen black and whites and city units crowded together like hounds on a hunt she could hear the link chatter the mutters and oaths as she cut through the uniforms and plainclothes more lights cold blue iced white and blood red washed over her face she didnt speak but walked to the dirty beige vehicle parked in the breakdown lane mills was in the passengers seat his eyes closed his chin on his chest as if hed stopped to take a catnap from the chin down he was blood eve stood coating her hands with sealit and studied the position of the body posed she thought as she leaned in the open window she saw the badge facedown on the bloody floor of the car and she saw the dull glint of silver coins who found him good samaritan one of the uniforms stepped forward as if hed been waiting anxiously for his cue we got him stashed in a unit with a couple of cops hes pretty shook you get a name a statement yes sir smartly the uniform flipped out his notebook keyed in james stein ninetyfifth he was heading home from work worked late tonight and saw the vehicle in the breakdown lane wasnt much traffic he said and he saw somebody sitting in the car felt bad about it stopped went over to see if he could lend a hand when he saw the deceased he called it in when did the call come in ah twentyonefifteen my partner and i were first onscene and arrived at twentyonetwentyfive we recognized the vehicle as departmental called it in and transmitted the vehicle identification number and a physical description of the deceased all right have stein taken home sir you dont want to question him not tonight verify his address and have him taken home she turned away from the uniform and saw peabody and mcnab hustle out of another black and white lieutenant peabody glanced toward the car and her mouth went tight i was with mcnab when the call came through i couldnt shake him off yeah eve looked over to where roarke stood dark against the lights i know the feeling seal up record the scene all angles she didnt bother to bite back an oath when yet another car squealed up and captain roth jumped out eve walked over to meet her report lieutenant eve didnt report to roth and they both knew it they studied each other a moment a subtle flexing of muscles at this point captain you know what i know what i know lieutenant is you fucked up and ive got another man dead the chatter around them cut off as if someone had severed vocal chords with a knife captain roth ill give you leeway for emotional distress but if you want to try to set me down you do it officially you dont come at me on my crime scene its no longer your scene eve simply sidestepped and blocked roth from shoving by her yes it is and because it is i have the authority to have you removed should it become necessary dont make it necessary you want to take me on dallas roth jabbed a finger between eves breasts you want to go a round with me not particularly but i will if you put your hands on me again or try to interfere with my investigation now you either back off fall in or remove yourself from the sealed area roths eyes flared her teeth bared and eve braced herself for what was to come captain clooney pushed his way through the crowd of cops his face was flushed his breath short as if hed been running captain roth may i speak with you sir in private roth vibrated another moment then seemed to pull herself in with a brisk nod she turned and strode back to her vehicle im sorry about that lieutenant clooney murmured his gaze slid past her rested miserably on mills this cuts deep with her understood why are you here clooney word travels he sighed long and deep im going to be knocking on another door tonight sitting with another widow goddamn it he turned away walked to where roth waited shes got no cause slapping at you that way mcnab said it from just behind her eve shifted stared at the scene peabody meticulously recorded thats cause she said he didnt think so but decided to let it go can i help out here ill let you know she took a step away looked back mcnab yes sir youre not always a complete asshole it made him grin and he slipped his hands into his pockets and wandered over to roarke hey you doing a ridealong too apparently roarke had a lowgrade urge for a cigarette which annoyed him whats the story on captain roth when mcnab started to shrug roarke smiled ian no one knows the gossip like an edetective you got that right okay maybe we poked around a little when we heard about kohli seeing as he was hers shes a hardass eighteen years on got a shitpot load of busts under her belt a slew of commendations and a couple minor reprimands for insubordination they came early on though moved up the ranks and took a lot of crap work to do it been captain under a year and word is shes holding onto it by her fingernails since the ricker case blew up under her they both glanced back to where roth and eve had squared off and that roarke said makes her touchy looks like had a little problem with alcohol a few years back did voluntary rehab before it became a big one on her second marriage and my source says it looks pretty shaky right now she lives and breathes the job he paused a minute watching roth talk to clooney you want my take shes territorial and competitive probably have to be to wear captains bars losing two men stings having another cop handle the cases is going to eat at her especially when its a cop with a rep like dallas and what would that rep be shes the best there is mcnab said simply he smiled a little peabody wants to be her when she grows up speaking of peabody i just wanted to say how that advice you gave me you know about the romance angle its working pretty good glad to hear it shes still seeing that slickhanded lc though burns my ass roarke glanced down as mcnab held out a jumbo pack of wild grape bubble gum what the hell he thought took a cube chewing thoughtfully they watched their women work o o eve ignored the onlookers she could have ordered the scene cleared except for essential personnel but it felt wrong to do so the cops were there a kind of homage to the badge and to reassure themselves they were alive both were valid reasons to stand by victim is identified as mills lieutenant alan attached to the one twoeight illegals division caucasian age fiftyfour eve recited the data into the record as she gently lifted the chin the victim was found by civilian stein james in the passenger seat of his official vehicle on the breakdown lane on the george washington bridge eastbound cause of death not yet determined hed been drinking peabody sir gin from the smell of it i dont know how you catch it peabody muttered breathing between her teeth with the rest of the stench here with a sealed hand eve turned back millss jacket saw his weapon still holstered doesnt look like he even went for it why wasnt he driving its his unit most cops have to have their hands pried off the wheel before they let somebody else man their ride she wrinkled her nose thats more than blood and bowels and gin im smelling she released the seat belt then jerked her hands back an instinctive move as his guts slithered out sliding nastily from under his shirt oh oh christ peabody choked went glassily pale stumbled back dallas get some air go on im okay i but her head spun her stomach revolted she managed to get to the side of the bridge before she lost the cheese and bean tacos shed shared with mcnab eve closed her eyes a moment bore down and bore down hard there was a dull roar in her head like the sea cresting she blanked her mind until she was certain the rumbles she heard were from the traffic on the level below and from the sky overhead with steady hands she unbuttoned millss fouled shirt hed been sliced one long wide swath from breastbone to crotch she noted it into the record while peabody retched sickened she straightened stepped back let the marginally fresher air fill her lungs her gaze skimmed over a sea of faces some grim some horrified some frightened peabody wasnt the only cop leaning over the bridge im all right im okay through the pounding bells in her ears eve heard peabodys weak voice come on sit down a minute sit down honey mcnab get her recorder i need it here no i can do it i can peabody nudged mcnabs patting hands away straightened her shoulders her face was dead white to the lips she shuddered once but she walked back im sorry lieutenant theres no shame in it give me your recorder ill finish this no sir i can hold after a moments study eve nodded get him on record dont think about it close your mind to it how peabody asked but turned to do the work eve lifted a hand had nearly rubbed it over her face before she remembered what it was smeared with where the hells the me lieutenant roarke stepped to her held out a pristine white silk handkerchief yeah thanks she used it without a thought you cant be here you have to stay back she looked around for somewhere to dispose of the smeared silk and ended up stuffing it into an evidence bag you need to take a minute roarke said quietly anyone would i cant afford it i fold even look like im going to and i lose control of the scene she stayed crouched added a fresh coat of sealant to her hands she got to her feet handed him the ruined handkerchief in its bag sorry about that then she planted her feet legs spread as roth marched back to millss car with clooney in her wake roth stopped short as if shed run into an invisible wall and stared at what there was of the man whod served under her command ah holy mother of god it was all she said her only sign of distress while her eyes were burning dry clooneys misted with tears jesus mills jesus look what they did to you he closed his eyes breathed long and deep we cant tell the family this cant give them the details of this captain roth we have to go inform next of kin before they hear some other way we have to cover over the worst of this for their sakes all right art all right she looked over as eve took out her communicator what are you doing checking on the me captain ive just done so eta is under two minutes a moment lieutenant in private clooney assist the lieutenants aide in keeping the scene secure i dont want any of those cops moving closer eve walked away with her away from the glare of lights into the softer shadows the air cleared the scent of exhaust and pavement was like balm after a burn lieutenant i apologize for my earlier outburst apology accepted that was very quick so was your apology roth blinked then nodded slowly i hate making them i havent gotten where i am on the job by indulging my temper or apologizing for it neither i imagine have you women are still more closely scrutinized in the department and more strictly judged that may be true captain i dont let it concern me then youre a better woman than i dallas or a great deal less ambitious because it burns the living hell out of me she inhaled hissed the breath out through her teeth my coming at you as i have has been an emotional reaction an indulgence again that was both inappropriate and illadvised im going to tell you that i overreacted to kohlis death because i liked him very much i believe i overreacted to mills because i disliked him very much she glanced back at the car he was a son of a bitch a meanspirited man who made no secret that in his opinion women should be having babies cooking pies and not wearing a badge he disliked blacks jews asians hell he disliked everyone who wasnt just what he was an overfed white male but he was my cop and i want whoever opened him up that way so do i captain roth nodded again and together they watched the me arrive morse eve noted only the top dog for one of the boys in blue homicide isnt my sphere dallas as clooney in his calm reasonable manner has pointed out to me i know your rep and im depending on it i want she trailed off and seemed to bite down on impatience id appreciate being sent a copy of your report youll have it in the morning thank you she looked back her eyes skimming over eves face are you as good as they say i dont listen to what they say roth gave a short laugh you want to wear bars youd better start and she held out a hand eve took it they parted ways one to speak of death and the other to stand over it as she walked eve glanced up and spotted the first media copter that she decided was a problem for later well they made a mess out of him didnt they morse took the time to pull on a protective gown then placidly sealed his hands and shoes while eve waited beside him push the tox reports im betting he was unconscious when he was sliced his weapons still on safety and there arent any defensive wounds i could smell gin on him take a hell of a lot of gin to take a man his size under far enough that this could be done to him without his objection you think he was killed while he sat there too much blood for otherwise the killer got him drunk doped whatever took the time to unbutton his shirt sliced him right down the middle then he buttoned him up again strapped him in even tipped the seat back just enough so that his insides would stay in more or less until some lucky winner unstrapped him bet i can guess who that lucky winner was morse smiled at her with a great deal of sympathy yeah i rang that bell she was damn it going to feel the sensation of millss intestines slopping over her hands for a long very long time the killer drove mills here she continued and walked away we wont find any prints she scanned the area ballsy ballsy again hed have to sit here maybe he even did it here but im thinking hes not that much of a fucking daredevil but hed have to sit here and wait until he was sure it was clear enough for him to get out of the car he had to have another transpo close by an accomplice maybe maybe i cant rule it out well check with the traffic cops see if they spotted another car in the breakdown lane tonight he didnt just walk off the goddamn bridge he had a plan he knew the steps get me the tox morse peabody was standing by the rail mcnab beside her shed gotten her color back but eve thought she knew the kind of images her aide would see when she closed her eyes that night mcnab you want in on this yes sir go with peabody get the traffic discs from the toll booths all discs all levels for the last twentyfour hours all were going to be thorough and maybe well get lucky start scanning them starting backward with this level from twenty hundred hours find me this vehicle you got it peabody do a standard background on james stein the good samaritan i dont expect you to find anything but lets clear him out report my home office oh eight hundred youve got lewis in the morning peabody reminded her im scheduled for sixthirty at central ill handle lewis youre going to be putting in a long night so are you peabodys face turned mulish ill report to central as ordered lieutenant christ have it your own way eve dragged a hand through her hair and reorganized her thoughts have the first uniforms onscene provide your transpo one of thems a hot dog he needs something to do she turned away from them strode to roarke i have to ditch you ill ride with you to central then find transportation home im not going to central straight off i have some stops to make ill have one of the black and whites take you back he looked toward the units with mild disdain i believe ill find my own transportation thanks all the same why she thought was everyone arguing with her tonight im not going to just leave you on the damn bridge i can find my way home lieutenant where are you going just some things i have to do before i write my report his voice was so damn cool she thought his eyes so detached how long are you going to be pissed off at me i havent decided but ill be sure to let you know youre making me feel like a jerk darling you managed that perfectly well on your own guilt and temper tangled inside her had her glaring at him well fuck it she said then grabbed him by the lapels of his coat yanked him to her and kissed him hard see you later she muttered and stalked away count on it chapter eight don webster was awakened out of a dead sleep by what he initially took to be a particularly violent thunderstorm when the clouds cleared from his brain he decided someone was trying to beat through the walls of his apartment with a sledgehammer as he reached for his weapon he realized someone was pounding on his door he pulled on jeans took his weapon with him and went to look through his security peep a dozen thoughts ran through his head a morass of pleasure fantasy and discomfort he opened the door to eve just in the neighborhood he said you son of a bitch she shoved him back slammed the door behind her i want answers and i want them now you never were much on foreplay the minute it was out he regretted it he covered that with a cocky grin whats up whats down webster is another cop the grin vanished who how you tell me they stared at each other a moment his gaze shifted first i dont know what do you know whats iabs angle on this because there is one i can smell it look you come barging in here at christ after one in the morning jump down my throat and tell me a cops dead you dont even tell me who or how it happened and im supposed to be some fount of fucking information for you mills she snapped detective alan illegals same squad as kohli you want to know how somebody sliced him wide open from neck to balls i know because his guts spilled out on my hands christ christ he rubbed both hands over his face i need a drink he walked away she stormed after him she remembered vaguely his old place the one hed had when hed worked the streets this one had a lot more space and more of a shine on it iab she thought bitterly paid well he was in the kitchen at the refrigerator pulling a beer out he looked back at her took out a second want one when she simply stared at him he put it back guess not he flipped off the top let it fly then took one long swallow whered it happen im not here to answer questions im not your goddamn weasel and im not yours he countered then leaned back against the refrigerator door he needed to get his thoughts in order his emotions under control unless he did shed spring something out of him he wasnt free to say you came to me she reminded him either fishing or smelling bait or maybe youre just iabs messenger boy his eyes hardened at that but he lifted the bottle again sipped you got a problem with me you take it to iab see where it gets you i solve my own problems what do kohli and mills and max ricker have in common youre going to stir up a hornets nest and get stung if you mess with ricker ive already messed with him didnt know that did you she said when his eyes flickered that little gem hasnt dropped in your lap quite yet ive got four of his storm troopers in cages right now you wont keep them maybe not but i might get more out of them than im getting from one of my own you used to be a cop im still a cop goddamn it dallas then act like one you think because i dont get all the press dont go out closing highprofile cases so the crowds cheer i dont care about the job he slammed the bottle on the counter i do what i do because i care about the job if every cop was as hardline straight as you we wouldnt need internal affairs were they dirty webster mills and kohli were they dirty his face closed in again i cant tell you you dont know or youre not saying he looked into her eyes for an instant just an instant she saw regret in his i cant tell you is there an ongoing investigation in iab involving kohli mills and or other officers in the one twoeight if there was he said carefully it would be classified i wouldnt be at liberty to confirm or deny that or to discuss any of the details where did kohli get the funds hes funnelled into investment accounts websters mouth tightened spring it out of him shed pry it out he thought with her fingernails i have no comment regarding that allegation am i going to find similar funds in an account under millss name i have no comment you should be a fucking politician webster she turned on her heel eve hed never used her first name before not out loud watch your step he said quietly watch your back she never stopped never acknowledged the warning when shed slammed the door behind her he stood for a moment while a war waged inside him then he walked to his link and made the first call o o her next stop was feeneys for the second time she woke a man from a dead sleep heavyeyed more rumpled than usual and wearing a ratty blue robe that had his pale legs sticking out like a chickens he answered the door jeez dallas its going on two ofucking clock i know sorry well come in but keep it down before the wife wakes up and thinks she has to come out and make coffee or some damn thing the apartment was small several steps down from websters in size and style a big ugly chair sat in the center of the living area facing the entertainment screen the privacy screens on the windows had been pulled giving the place the feeling of a tidy and wellworn box she felt more at home immediately he went toward the kitchen a short skinny space with a battered counter running along one wall she knew hed added that on himself because hed bragged about it for weeks saying nothing she boosted herself on one of the stools and waited while he programmed the autochef for coffee i thought you were going to tag me earlier waited around awhile sorry i got held up on something else yeah i heard taking ricker on thats a big chunk to chew im going to swallow him down before im finished just make sure he doesnt give you permanent indigestion he set two steaming mugs on the counter settled onto the other stool mills is dirty mills is dead well shit feeney paused thinking while he drank some coffee he died rich found two and a half million tucked into different accounts so far and there may be more he did a good job of burying them used names of dead relatives mostly can you trace where it came from havent had any luck with that yet with kohli either moneys been through the wash so many times it oughta be sterilized but i can tell you mills started pumping up his goddamn pension fund and portfolio big time two weeks before the ricker bust there were dribbles before that but thats when it started rolling he rubbed his hand over his face where the nightly complement of chin hair itched kohli started later months after dont have anything on martinez yet shes either clean or more careful i took a look at roth and shes had some sizable withdrawals over the last six months big chunks taken out of her accounts on the surface it looks like shes damn near broke any of the withdrawals connect im still looking he blew out a breath thought maybe id see if i can work into their logs and links take a little time since i have to be careful okay thanks howd mills go down she sat drank her coffee and told him it was still raw inside her but by the time shed finished it was easier he was an asshole feeney said but thats ugly somebody he knew youre not going to get that close in on a cop open him up that way without some solid resistance unless the cops relaxed hed been drinking my hunch is hed been drinking with somebody just like kohli taking a meet in his ride maybe having a drink he gets sloppy gets drugged gets dead yeah most likely you did good putting mcnab on the traffic scans hell do the job ive got him and peabody in my home office at eight can you come in on it he looked at her smiled his sorrowful bassethound smile i thought i already was o o it was nearly four when she got home and a soft spring rain had started to fall in the dark she showered off the greasiness of the night resting her forehead on the tiles until she stopped smelling blood and bile she set her wrist alarm for five she meant to hit at lewis again and that meant another trip to central in just over an hour for that hour she promised herself shed sleep she climbed into bed grateful for roarkes warmth hed be awake she thought even if hed slept before she got home he slept like a cat and would have sensed her but he didnt turn to her as he usually did didnt reach out or say her name to help her slip into comfort she closed her eyes willed her mind to blank and her body to sleep and when she woke an hour later she was alone she was out in her car nearly ready to pull out when peabody ran out of the house behind her nearly missed you missed me what are you doing here i bunked here last night me and mcnab in a bedroom she thought shed dream about for the rest of her life we brought the traffic discs back here roarke said itd be easier to do that instead of running us back to mcnabs then all of us coming here this morning roarke said well yeah she settled into the passengers seat strapped in he rode along with us to pick up the discs then hed called for a car so we drove back here with him and got to work who got to work peabodys brain had engaged enough now to catch the edginess in eves tone shed have squirmed if it hadnt been so undignified well me and mcnab and roarke hes done some tech consults with us before so i didnt think anything of it are we in trouble no what would be the point there was a weariness in the answer peabody didnt like we broke off about three she infused her voice with cheer as they headed down the drive i never slept in a gel bed before its like sleeping on a cloud except i guess youd fall through a cloud mcnab was snoring like a cargo tram but i fell out about two seconds after i hit the bed anyway are you mad at roarke she blurted out no but hes mad at me still did you spot millss vehicle on the disc oh man i cant believe i didnt tell you yeah we got it passed the toll through the epass at twentyeighteen youd swear he was just sleeping until you enhance and see the blood the driver peabody thats the notsogood news there was no driver mcnab said youd need to go over the indash computer but it looks like it was on auto he programmed it she hadnt thought of that very slick very confident took mills out somewhere else then programmed the auto if it ran into a snag and there was nobody in the vehicle to correct what did he care yeah thats what we came to mcnab started calling it the meteor of death you know it was a meteor model peabody said lamely gets to be that late you start making stupid jokes i guess you need a code to program a police unit you need a code or you need clearance itll have security override to keep it from being boosted even by electronicsavvy carjackers yeah roarke said peabody yawned comfortably but if you know what youre doing it can be finessed hed know eve thought sourly if it was finessed itll show she snagged her link called feeney and asked him to go down to vehicle impound and run the test personally if it doesnt show she said thinking out loud as she swung into centrals garage he had the code or clearance he couldnt have had clearance dallas that would make him another cop thats right peabody goggled at her you dont really think listen to me murder investigation doesnt just start with a body it starts with a list with potentials with angles you close the case by cutting down that list narrowing the potentials working the angles you take that the evidence the story the scene the victim and the killer and you put it together as many different ways as you have to until it fits you keep this to yourself eve added you dont say anything but if we put it together and it fits a cop then we deal with it yeah okay a lot of this ones making me kind of sick i know it eve pushed out of the car call in have lewis brought up to interview o o she fueled herself with coffee took her life in her hands and bought what was reputed to be a cherry danish from vending on the interview level it tasted more like cherryflavored glue over sawdust but it was something in her stomach she strolled into interview carrying an oversized mug of her own or roarkes own coffee because she knew the smell of it could make a grown man beg she settled down all smiles while peabody took up her post by the door and glowered she set the recorder read in the current data morning lewis beautiful day out there i heard its raining hey dont you know the rains good for the flowers so howd you sleep i slept just fine she smiled again sipped from her mug he had circles layering the circles under his eyes she doubted hed gotten much more sleep than she had well as we were saying when last we met i dont have to say dick to you without my lawyer did i ask you to say dick peabody replay the record and verify that i at no time requested that the subject say dick that shit dont work on me i got nothing to say im sticking with silence its one of my civil rights you hold onto those civil rights lewis while you can they dont count for a whole hell of a lot on penal station omega thats where im sending you im going to make it my mission in life to put you in one of their smaller concrete cages so you stick with that silence and ill do the talking conspiracy to kidnap a police officer you cant prove that we never touched you four armed men in two vehicles pursuing poor little me at high rates of speed over the state line you shouldnt have gone over the state line ace i can make that federal and my guess is the fbi would just love a shot at you with your record the concealeds are enough to shoot you on the next transit to omega add the illegals i dont use no drugs they were in the vehicle you were driving that was another mistake you know if youd been a passenger you might have had a better chance to cut back on that hard time but being the driver the driver with concealeds with illegals that makes you my favorite patsy rickers not even going to wave byebye when youre strapped in the prison transport i got nothing to say yeah i heard that but he was starting to sweat i bet the lawyers made you promises i bet i can list them right off for you youll do some time but youll be compensated theyll work the politics and get you into a nice cushy facility five years seven tops and you walk out a rich man i bet thats real close she could see by the worry in lewiss eyes that it was more than close it was bullseye of course hes a lying sack of shit and i think youre smart enough to have figured that out during the night once youre in youre in and if youre unhappy with the arrangement and make noises one of your upstanding fellow inmates is going to get a message poison sprinkled in your rehydrated mashed potatoes a shiv in the kidneys during your single hour a day in the yard an accident in the showers where you slip on the soap and break your neck you wont know where its coming from until youre dead i talk to you im dead before i get there that was it she thought leaning forward the first crack witness protection fuck that he can find anybody anywhere hes not a magician lewis im offering you a nice ride lewis you give me what i need i can get you immunity a free walk a new life anywhere you want to go on or off planet why should i trust you because ive got no reason to want you dead thats a big one isnt it lewis said nothing but he licked his lips i got the impression rickers not real stable he strike you as real stable lewis she waited a moment while he thought about it rickers going to tell himself you screwed up doesnt matter wont matter that he sent you out after me that he was stupid hes going to blame you for missing me and for getting caught you know it you know that and you know hes just a little crazy hed stewed about it all night tossing turning as best he could on the narrow bunk in the dark cell hed come around to that himself and he didnt like the fisheye look of canarde ricker wasnt known for forgiving what he considered employee mistakes i dont do any time thats what were going to work on work on screw that you get me immunity i dont say squat until i see the pa and the paperwork immunity dallas a new name a new face and a hundred fifty thousand in seed money maybe youd like me to arrange a pretty wife and a couple of rosycheeked children while im at it hah funny he was feeling better now better than he had in hours you get me the pa get me the deal then ill talk to you ill start on it she got to her feet you might have to go through the hearing keep cool about it and try out that silence as a civil right you let canarde get a whiff of this hell go straight to ricker i know how it works get me the deal o o you called that one right peabody commented as they headed down the hall yeah eve was already calling the pas office and was disgusted when she got the snooty recording listing working hours looks like im getting somebody else out of bed today lets head back while i start the wheels rolling on this i want a look at the disc then everyone needs to be briefed everyone feeneys coming in on it o o she expected to find roarke there huddled with mcnab over her office unit working some of his magic when she found mcnab alone she was surprised irked and disappointed a glance at their adjoining doors showed the red locked light engaged damn if shed knock i cant get you more than ive got lieutenant mcnab told her i cleaned up the image and its crystal now but all you sees a dead guy riding in a car she picked up the hard copy hed printed out for her studied mills go through the discs following this segment i want you to freeze and enhance every car van scooter and fucking jet bike that came through that level from this point until the area was blocked off you want every vehicle that crossed eastbound on the gw on level two for over an hour she shot him a cool look that was my order detective do you have a problem understanding it no no sir but he allowed himself one weighty sigh she went to her link contacted dr miras office and set up a conference for the next day with the departments top profiler after a moments hesitation she put through a transmission to her commander sir ive requested that captain feeney and detective mcnab assist in the electronics work as regards my current case youre cleared to enlist edd or any assistance you deem appropriate or necessary thats standard lieutenant and per your judgment what is the current status on the mills homicide i would prefer to report that

concerns very well lieutenant ill see to it commander are you aware of any investigation involving kohli mills and or martinez currently being run through iab his eyes went to slits i am not are you aware of any such investigation i am not but i have concerns so noted i want a report by noon the medias sniffed this out and theyre clamoring two cops dead is news yes sir she put the next call through to nadine furst from channel and caught the reporter at home dallas great minds i just got an interesting lead from a source whos killing cops my office eve checked her wrist unit calculated time tenthirty sharp she would finish with feeney zip down to lewiss hearing and back to central you get what ive got to give before any scheduled press conference in a oneonone and for this i have to kill who we wont take it quite that far i want a story planted leaked lets say from an unnamed police source you scare easy nadine hey i dated a dentist nothing scares me well youre going to want to cover your pretty ass anyway the leaks going to involve max ricker jesus christ dallas lets get married what have you got on him is it confirmed whats that i smell hey i think its an emmy or no no its a pulitzer slow down tenthirty sharp nadine and if i hear anything about this before then deals off and i fry your ass my pretty ass nadine reminded her ill be there bells on she broke the connection mulled over what she was about to do then turned to see both peabody and mcnab staring at her problem no sir working away here ive already got the first ten minutes run work faster maybe if i had some breakfast youve been here about eight hours theres probably nothing left to eat she looked toward roarkes door again tempted very tempted then was saved from making the decision as feeney came in got the breakdown he laid discs on her desk took a chair stretched out his legs diagnostics computer analysis ran it through up down and sideways the programming wasnt jumped ill swear to that was millss code used eve demanded no if it had been idve figured whoever killed him got the code from him first one way or the other feeney rattled in his pocket and began to nibble mournfully from a bag of nuts it was an emergency clearance code an old one but it still works on that unit its one maintenance used to go by to transport or run scans on disabled units theyve got a new system the past few years but the older units still respond to this one thing is he had to have a master to tie it in he didnt bypass millss master was still in his pocket yeah feeney sighed yeah you said anyway the killer went right through the stages i can follow it like a map she nodded because it fit and the dread in her stomach was ignored on feeneys face she read her own thoughts and her own conflict okay odds are were looking for a cop retired or active feeney crunched down on an almond hell both victims knew their killer and trusted him or considered him no particular threat she moved behind her desk brought up a wall screen kohli she began drawing a diagram to mills mills to martinez roth connects to all three at the center of it is max ricker who else connects as an answer she brought up a list of the names of the task force from illegals who worked on rickers case we run all these cops she paused long enough to scan faces inside and out i want it done without sending up any flags concentrate on financials both kohli and mills had suspicious funds follow the money sucks mcnab commented his eyes were cool and flat as he studied the names lieutenant if these two were dirty taking money from ricker or one of his sources why take them out why would another cop on the take go after them you think theres honor among thieves mcnab no well sort of i mean what would be the point selfprotection covering your ass guilt remorse she lifted a shoulder or it could be as simple as ricker paying one more to cut down the field thirty pieces of silver she mused rickers really fond of silver you may not find the killer on this list but you may find the next target thirty pieces of silver she said again a symbol of betrayal maybe whoever killed these men wanted us to know they were wrong cops we need to find out why you start by finding out how many more are wrong shits going to hit the fan when this comes out feeney told her some arent going to be happy you tossed mud on the badge theres already blood on it ive got to get to central then over to court wed better work out of here today ill get another computer brought in so you can network the lock light was still on the adjoining door she wasnt about to humiliate herself by knocking on it in front of her associates instead she went out walked down the hall and swallowing pride knocked from there roarke opened it himself briefcase in hand lieutenant i was just heading out yeah well me too my teams going to set up here today itd be helpful if they had another computer unit or two summerset will get them whatever they need yeah good well he touched her arm turning her so that they walked toward the steps together was there something else its really distracting trying to work and knowing youre still torqued at me i imagine so what would you like me to do about it it was said so pleasantly she wanted to kick him i said i was sorry damn it so you did how rude of me to still be what was it torqued youre better at this than i am she said grimly were not on even ground life has very little even ground but he couldnt hold out against her misery and stopped halfway down the stairs i love you eve nothing changes that nothing could but christ you piss me off the wash of relief at hearing him say he loved her warred with irritation that she should be slapped again for doing what shed thought best look i just didnt want you involved in ah he tapped a finger on her lips to silence her there it is theres quite a world of trouble with that single statement as i doubt you have time and know i dont to explore that world right at the moment why dont you between your quests for justice today give it some thought dont talk to me like im a moron he kissed her which was something but did so lightly before continuing down the steps go to work eve well talk about this later how come hes in charge she muttered she heard him say something to summerset something quick and careless before the door opened closed she started down replaying the scene in her head with all the sharp pithy and clever things she would have said if shed had a few minutes to think about it lieutenant summerset stood at the base of the stairs holding out her jacket it was something he never did ill see to it that your associates have the equipment they require yeah great fine lieutenant she shoved her arms into the jacket snarled at him what goddamn it he didnt so much as blink regarding your actions of last evening dont you start on me hatchetface she shoved by him wrenched open the doors i believe he continued in the same mild tone those actions were quite correct he might as well have stunned her with her own weapon her mouth fell open as she looked back at him what did you say i also believe your hearing is unimpaired and i dislike repeating myself that said he walked down the hall and left her staring at him chapter nine nadine furst was precisely on time and ready to roll live eve hadnt agreed to a live feed but she didnt object it was a minor point but one that nadine noted they were friends which didnt surprise either of them as much as it once had they settled into the oneonone interview in eves office with the smooth rhythm of practice there were no bombshells nadine was fully aware eve dallas dropped no ammunition unless she intended to use it for her own purposes still the early interview with the primary investigator and the precise and carefully edited data put her report and her ratings considerably higher than her competition with the available information nadine concluded it would appear that detective kohli and lieutenant mills were killed in broadly different manners is it their attachment to the same precinct the same squad that leads you to believe their deaths are connected smart eve thought she had no doubt nadine had done a quick crash course on both victims and knew of their work on the ricker bust but she was clever enough not to bring up the mans name before eve gave her the signal that connection and certain evidence the department is not able to make public leads us to believe both detective kohli and lieutenant mills were killed by the same individual in addition to their attachment to the one twentyeighth these officers had worked on some of the same cases those avenues are being pursued the new york police and security department will employ all available means to track down identify and bring to justice the killer of two of its own thank you lieutenant this is nadine furst reporting live from cop central for channel she tossed the playback to her station nodded at her camera operator then sat back much like eve thought a cat preparing to feast on a fat canary now she began im running a little short on time here i have to be in court nadine popped out of the chair dallas why dont you walk me over eve said casually and gave the camera person a bland stare sure its a nice day for a walk lucy go on back to base ill catch transpo whatever always affable and perfectly aware something more was up lucy hauled her camera out talk to me nadine demanded when they were alone ricker not here lets walk oh you actually meant that nadine glanced down at her stylish but impractical heels hell how i suffer to give the public their right to know you only wear those torture devices because they make your legs look hot damn right resigned nadine followed eve out of the office so how are things on a personal front eve took the glide down surprised at how nearly she skimmed toward telling nadine about her problem with roarke nadine was a woman after all and eve had a feeling she needed to talk to a female about strategy or something then it occurred to her that nadine for all her polished looks sharp brains and basic good humor wasnt one of the top runners in the successful race of malefemale relationships fine well that certainly took some time a little trouble in paradise there was just enough sympathy in the tone to have eve skirting a little closer to the edge im just distracted she stepped outside opting to take the long way around she wanted the air she wanted the time and she wanted the relative privacy of a crowded street an anonymous police source nadine ill give you that dallas but i have to tell you that coming so hard on the oneonone its going to be fairly easy to pin you as that source no kidding nadine studied her friends face excuse me for being one step behind ill just catch up now you want certain parties to tag you or at least suspect you as the source of the information youre going to give me im not going to give you information so much as supposition you do what you like with it you already know or im wasting my time talking to you that kohli and mills were on the task force that busted max ricker yeah ive picked that up but then again there were more than a dozen cops and various official drones on that task force rickers bad news but its a long stretch to think hed scrape his knuckles having a whole group of cops taken out and for what the annoyance factor he lost a big pile of money but he got off theres reason to believe he had a connection to at least one of the victims keep it vague eve thought let the reporter do the digging there are four men coming up for a hearing this morning who are allegedly employed by max ricker they are charged with various crimes including the unlawful vehicular pursuit of a police officer seems to me if rickers ballsy enough to send goons after a cop in broad daylight he wouldnt stick at arranging for the murder of cops he came after you dallas as a reporter that tip makes me incredibly hot and excited but she laid a hand on eves arm as your friend id like to advise you to take a vacation far far away eve stopped at the steps of the courthouse your police source cant tell you that ricker is a suspect in the murder or the conspiracy to murder two nypsd officers but your source can tell you that the investigation is taking a cold hard look at the activities associations and businesses of one max edward ricker you wont nail him dallas hes like smoke just keeps shifting and vanishing watch me eve invited and strode up the steps im going to nadine murmured and im going to worry damn it o o eve pushed through the doors and tried not to sigh over the line for the security scan she chose the shortest for police and city officials inched her way forward and had just cleared when all hell broke loose she heard the shouts from the second level where lewiss hearing was scheduled and charging up the stairs pushed her way through the crowd of lawyers and court groupies that had already gathered lewis was on the floor his face gray his eyes rolled back he just keeled over someone called out just keeled right over somebody call the mts get a doctor she was swearing as she charged forward crouched down maam youll have to move back she looked up at the uniform dallas lieutenant eve this ones mine sorry lieutenant ive called for medical hes not breathing she straddled him ripped open his shirt and started cpr get these people back lock down the area lock down lock it down she ordered and gave her breath to lewis knowing it was futile she worked on him until the medical techs arrived and pronounced him disgusted she cornered his guard report i want to know everything that happened from the time you got him out of his cell standard sir right down the line the uniform was ready to be resentful that anyone would point the finger at him because some hired hammers heart went bad due to the charges the subject was cuffed then transported here who was in the transport myself and my partner the orders were that he wasnt to come into contact with the other three suspects we walked him through walked him up to this level you didnt use the secured elevator no sir he twitched very slightly at that it was jammed lieutenant we brought him up the steps he didnt give us any trouble his lawyer was here and asked us to wait a moment until hed finished up a consult with another client via palmlink we stood by then the subject staggered and fell he gasped for breath and while my partner checked him over i attempted to keep the crowd at a distance shortly thereafter you arrived on the scene what precinct are you with she skimmed a glance over his nameplate officer harmon sir im assigned to central security division who approached or had contact with the subject no one sir my partner and i flanked him per procedure are you telling me no one came close to this guy before he dropped no that is we went through security as required there were a number of people on line and a number moving through the area but no one spoke to the deceased or had physical contact with him someone stopped my partner and inquired about directions to the civil court area the person who wanted directions how close did he get to the subject she sir it was a female she appeared to be in some distress and stopped as we were walking by each other get a good look at her harmon yes sir early twenties blonde blue eyes fair complexion shed been crying sir was crying but trying not to if you understand me she was visibly distressed and when she dropped her handbag some of the contents scattered i bet you and your partner were very helpful picking up those items for her her tone alerted him and harmon began to feel slightly ill sir it couldnt have taken more than ten seconds and the suspect was restrained and never out of our sight let me show you something harmon and you can tell your partner once he finishes jerking off she signaled the mts aside come down here she ordered once again crouching by the body do you see this faint red mark the small circular mark over the deceaseds heart he had to look hard but since he was now close to terrified harmon all but jammed his nose against lewiss chest yes sir do you know what that is officer no sir no sir i dont its the mark left by a pressure syringe your weepy blonde assassinated your charge under your goddamn nose o o she had every corner of the building searched for a woman matching the description harmon gave her but she expected to find nothing and found exactly that she called in a crime scene unit to start the process of a homicide investigation and gave herself the pleasure of interrogating canarde you knew he was going to roll didnt you i have no idea what youre talking about lieutenant back at central idly examining his manicure canarde sat placidly in interview three i will remind you that im here voluntarily i was nowhere near my unfortunate client this morning and you have yet to determine whether his death was other than by natural causes a healthy man under fifty keels over from a heart attack convenient particularly since the pas office was prepared to offer him immunity for turning evidence against another of your clients if immunity was being offered lieutenant i am unaware of it as i was uninformed of such an offer as the deceaseds attorney of record it would have been required that such an offer be made through me or in my presence he had small teeth perfect little teeth and he showed them when he stretched his lips in a smile i believe youve stepped over or certainly around a line of legal procedure it doesnt appear to have worked out well for my client you got that right you can inform your client canarde that all hes done here is piss me off i work harder when im pissed off canarde gave her another of his snakelike smiles my client lieutenant is beyond caring now if youll excuse me i must do my duty by the tragic mr lewis i believe he had an exwife and a brother ill offer them my condolences and if by some quirk of fate you happen to be correct about mr lewis being helped into the grave i will advise his family to sue the nypsd for negligence and wrongful death it would be a great personal pleasure to represent them in the civil case i bet he doesnt even have to pay you canarde he just tosses you the fish and you jump up squeal and dive into the muck to get it back the amusement faded from his eyes though his mouth continued to smile he got to his feet nodded then left the room o o i should have anticipated it eve told her commander i should have figured ricker had sources in the department and in the pas office you covered yourself a low burning anger simmered inside whitney he would use it like fuel only necessary personnel were informed of the plans to grant immunity still it leaked and with lewis taken out this way ill never turn any of the others on ricker i cant even assure myself theyll do the maximum time i need a lever commander i got under his skin once and i can do it again but i need something no matter how minor to justify bringing him in to interview that wont be easy hes too well insulated mills whitney said you have no doubt he was taking no sir i dont but as to connecting the funds back to ricker i dont know feeneys on it and i have several different angles im going to pursue from this point on in this investigation i want daily reports of every step you and your team makes every step lieutenant yes sir i want the names of every cop youre looking at the ones youve cleared to your satisfaction and the ones you havent yes sir if you believe the involvement in the department goes beyond mills and kohli iab will have to be informed they watched each other a moment treading a line sir i would hesitate to inform internal affairs until such time as i have evidence substantiating what at this point in the investigation is only a suspicion of further involvement and how much time do you estimate your hesitation will encompass if i could have twentyfour hours commander one day dallas he said with a nod neither of us can afford to dance around it longer than that o o she didnt waste time but tracked down martinez contacted her and requested a meeting off police territory eve thought would make it easier all around she met martinez at a small coffee shop between both their bases far enough away from each location to insure it wasnt a cop hangout martinez arrived a few minutes late giving eve the opportunity to observe to judge going by body language it was clear martinezs defenses were up i had to take personal time for this her shoulders as stiff as her voice martinez slid into the booth across from eve and i dont have a lot of it fine my clocks ticking too you want coffee i dont drink it how do you live martinez gave a sour smile signaled the serving droid and ordered water and dont pour it from the tap she warned ill know and fry your circuits lets just cut through the crap martinez continued turning back to eve youre looking for me to hang something on kohli and mills and it aint gonna happen youre looking to dig up dirt doing scut work for iab that turns my stomach eve picked up her coffee and watched martinez placidly over the rim well that covers that now just where do you get all this information word gets around when one cops hunting others its all over the one twoeight weve got two dead cops it seems to me youd be more interested in finding out who did them than in turning up muck before theyre even in the fucking ground that kind of temper while eve respected it wasnt going to help martinez work her way up the chain in rank whatever youve heard whatever you think finding out who did them is my priority yeah right your priority is covering your husbands ass excuse me he owns purgatory i figure maybe something was up there and kohli tuned into it they didnt know he was a cop so maybe they werent careful and when he got too close they took him out and mills martinez shrugged youre the one saying theyre connected you know martinez when i first met you and mills i figured he was the moron of the pair now here you are seriously damaging my selfesteem by showing me my character judgment stinks youre not my commanding officer martinez had dark eyes now they fired like black suns i dont have to take crap from you then take some advice from someone whos been on the job longer learn when to jab and when to wait youve been here under five minutes and told me more than ive asked i havent told you dick you told me that someones starting talk at your precinct that words already out likely through that source that theres reason to believe kohli and mills were taking ask yourself where that came from whod want to put cops on their guard and looking sideways at me think detective to give her a minute to do so eve sipped at her coffee i dont have to cover for roarke hes been handling himself for a long time nobody but someone whod have something to worry about has cause to suspect or know that part of my investigation is turning up dirt on the two victims word gets out martinez said but her tone wasnt quite so confident she reached for her water the minute it was on the table yeah especially when someone wants it to you think i arranged to put over three million dollars in kohlis and millss accounts to cover my husbands ass you think ive maybe been funneling it there for months to try to create a scandal involving fellow cops youre the one saying the money was there thats right im saying it martinez said nothing for a moment just staring back into eves eyes then she closed her own hell oh hell im not turning on another cop im fifth generation theres been a cop in my family for over a hundred years that means something to me we have to stand up for each other im not asking you to judge im asking you to think not every one of us respects the badge two of the men on your task force are dead both of them had more money stashed away than most cops can save in a lifetime on the job now theyre dead somebody got close enough to them to take them out before they could blink are you ready to be next next you see me as a target the fire came back into martinezs eyes you think ive been taking i havent seen anything to make me think that and ive looked goddamn bitch i worked my ass off to make detective now youre going to toss me to iab im not tossing you anywhere but if youre not straight with me youre going to hang yourself one way or another whos at the core of this eve demanded leaning forward be a detective for christs sake and figure it who connects kohli and mills and has the money to turn a cop into a weasel ricker martinezs fingers curled on the table until her fist ran white across the knuckles goddamn it you had him didnt you you went into that bust knowing you had everything you needed for an arrest an indictment and a conviction you were careful it took me months to set it up i lived with that case twentyfour seven i made sure i didnt miss anything didnt rush it then to have it all fall apart i couldnt figure it i kept telling myself the son of a bitch was just too slick too well covered but still part of me knew he had to have somebody inside had to but i didnt want to look there i still dont but now you will martinez lifted her glass drank water as though her throat was scorched why am i being tagged spotted the surveillance did you yeah i spotted it i figured you were going after me next if i find out youre in bed with ricker i will right now the tags for your protection i want it off if im going to throw in with you i need to move without somebody breathing down my neck i have a personal copy of all the data all my notes every step leading up to rickers bust after the case fell apart i looked over them but my heart wasnt in it it will be now id like a copy its my work and when we take him down ill see to it you get the collar it means something to me the job means something to me this case the captain said id lost my objectivity she was right martinez added with a twist of her lips i did i ate that case for breakfast every morning and i slept with it every night if id kept the right distance i might have seen all this coming i might have seen how mills insinuated himself into it until he was calling shots i just took it as his usual macho bullshit were supposed to stand for each other you had no reason to look his way kohlis memorials scheduled for day after tomorrow it comes to me without doubt that he was looped with ricker ill spit on his grave my grandfather went down in the line of duty during the urban wars he saved two kids theyre somewhat older than i am and they write my grandmother every year at christmas and again on the anniversary of the day it happened they never forget its not just about the collar dallas its about being a cop eve nodded and after a moments hesitation leaned in again martinez i worked on one of rickers spine crackers had him ready to roll the deal was going through the pas office for immunity he had a hearing this morning walking down the hall in the courtyard between two cops he got hit hes dead just like that there are leaks and i dont know where to begin to plug them i want you to know before you start on this that i may not be able to keep a lid on it i may not be able to keep your name out of the mix and that could put you in the crosshairs martinez pushed her empty glass aside like i said its about being a cop o o eve spent the rest of the day backtracking reading data until her eyes stung she went back to patsy kohli under the pretext of a followup after twenty minutes she was convinced the grieving widow had known nothing thats what her gut told her eve thought as she got into her car again she just wasnt sure she could trust her gut anymore she had a new list working in her brain the one mcnab was shooting her every few hours a line of cops hed cleared another line of those who remained suspect because central was closer she slipped back to her office there and ran a series of probabilities using the new data and the new list of names no matter how she juggled it she found nothing conclusive and would find nothing she thought until she dug deeper they would have to pick the lives of these cops apart like crows on fleshy bones every time they cleared one it would put more weight on the rest she knew what it was to undergo an internal investigation to have the hounds of iab sniffing at her heels being clean didnt make it less nasty being clean didnt wash the vile aftertaste out of your throat she couldnt go deeper without sending up flags unless she made use of roarkes unregistered and illegal equipment she couldnt make use of it without his help she didnt have the skill to peel those layers away on her own and she couldnt ask him for help when shed made such a big damn deal about wanting him uninvolved she put her head in her hands unsurprised in fact almost pleased that it was throbbing a good solid headache would give her something else to be unhappy about she decided to head home and on the way passed maviss billboard before she could think about it shed engaged her link and tried mavis at home without any real hope of catching her there hello hey hey dallas guess what im looking at a naked onearmed pygmy damn okay youre too good at this talk to you later wait wait giggling mavis shifted in front of her own link as if that would somehow give her the angle of eves view what is it really you about a million times bigger than life over times fucking square oh is that iced or what is that beyond arctic i keep finding excuses to go down and look at it i want to give your husband a big wet sloppy kiss leonardo says its all right with him under the circumstances but i thought i should clear it with you i dont tell roarke who he can kiss maviss eyebrows currently a neon magenta rose straight up into her blueberrycolored hair oh oh are you having a fight no yes no i dont know what the hell were having hes barely speaking to me are you never mind am i what she put a hand over her screen made eve roll her eyes while she had a whispered conversation with someone else in the room sorry leonardos trying out a new stage costume hey why dont you come by no youre busy uhuh come on dallas you never come by the old place if youre in times square you can be here in a heartbeat i was just thinking i was going to make a big batch of screamers so ill see you in a few no i she hissed a breath at the blank screen nearly called back and made excuses then she shrugged felt her back go up when she remembered that coolly distant tone roarke had used on her that morning what the hell she muttered just for a few minutes chapter ten mavis freestone and her lover leonardo cohabited in eves old apartment what a difference a year made eve had lived in the singlebedroom unit contentedly enough with a few basic pieces of furniture no decor to speak of and an autochef that was empty more often than stocked shed preferred to think of her lifestyle as simple rather than bland then again compared to mavis a surf on saturns outer rings in a comet buster was bland the minute mavis opened the door eve was struck with color blasts of it every hue and tone on the palette was turned up to scream level in patterns and textures that boggled the eye and that was just mavis the living area of the apartment was draped with miles of fabrics some she supposed were art of some kind others leonardos designs in progress the rather lumpy sofa eve had left behind when shed moved in with roarke was covered now with a bright and nervy pink material that shimmered like polished glass if that wasnt enough it was heaped with pillows and throws of clashing colors that seemed to drip onto the floor where more cloths were cleverly tossed in lieu of rugs beads and spangles and ribbons and god knew what rained down the walls tinkled gaily from the ceiling which had been painted a highsheen silver studded with crimson stars even the tables were fabric arty lumps of shape that could be called in for seating in a pinch eve didnt think there was a hard surface or a right angle left in the place and while she was vaguely concerned that staying there for any length of time might bring on a stroke it was a frame that suited the picture of her oldest friend perfectly the effect was something like a stormedged sunrise on venus im so glad you came by mavis dragged eve into the psychedelia then turned a stylish circle what do you think of what exactly of the new gear tiny slim and bright as a fairy wand mavis turned again showing off a shortskirted you couldnt call it a dress eve decided a costume she supposed of crossed diagonal stripes that ran from deep purple to neon pink and back again the bodice scooped low just tucking the nipples under and left maviss shoulders adorned now with twin pansy tattoos bare sleeves they had to be sleeves because as far as eve knew gloves had hands skimmed down her arms needleheeled boots in the same dizzy stripes rode up her legs to just under crotch level its she had no idea amazing yeah isnt it ttt too totally terrific trinas going to do my hair to match leonardos a complete genius leonardo dallas is here hes making a batch of screamers she told eve you came by at the exact moment i hate drinking alone and you know how leonardo cant she kept up the chatter pulling eve toward the pink couch she wasnt giving her friend a chance to escape until she knew what was going on here he is her voice went to coo her eyes went gooey thanks honey love leonardo a giant of a man with long glossy braids gold eyes and the smooth copper skin of a mixedrace heritage swirled into the room he moved with uncanny grace for a man topping sixfive and wearing a hooded ankle duster of atlantic blue he beamed at mavis and the ruby studs beside his mouth and just under his left eyebrow winked flirtatiously he cooed right back at her youre welcome turtledove hello dallas i put together a little snack in case you havent had dinner isnt he ttt you bet eve said as mavis cuddled up against him even in the boots she didnt make it to his breastbone you didnt have to go to any trouble leonardo none at all he set down a tray loaded with food and drink its nice you came by so mavis wont spend the evening alone i have some appointments mavis sent him an adoring look their plans had been to have a rare quiet evening together when shed told him eve was coming by and something was wrong hed agreed without a murmur to her request that he make himself scarce he was mavis thought with a sigh perfect i cant stay long eve began but leonardo was already scooping mavis up in his long arms kissing her in a deep and intimate way that had eve wincing and looking away enjoy yourself my dove he sent eve a quick flashing smile and managed to glide out of the apartment without running into anything he didnt have any appointments mavis started to protest then grinned shrugged and plopped down to pour the first round of screamers i told him we wanted a little girl time he was ultracool with it so she passed eve a glass the size of a small birdbath filled to the rim with emerald green liquid you wanna get a buzz on then tell me about it or just dive in eve opened her mouth then closed it and pursed her lips it had been a hell of a long time since shed downed a batch of screamers with mavis maybe i can get a buzz on while i tell you solid mavis tapped her glass against eves and knocked back the first of what promised to be many o o so mavis was on her third screamer and most of the soy chips wheycheese dip and corn doodles leonardo had arranged were long consumed let me sort of put this in a box you went to square off with some bad guy who used to have business with roarke without telling roarke you were going its police business its my job okay okay im just scoping it down then the bad guy sent secondstring bad guys after you i handled it mavis glanced over with a gimlet look in her eye you want my take or just your own im shutting up eve muttered and poured another screamer when you got back home there were flowers from the bad guy and a smarmy card because eves mouth opened again mavis held up a purpletipped finger you figured he did it to rile you up and to get roarkes goat so you had summerset ditch the posies but roarke saw them and called you on it then you were like duh what flowers i didnt say duh the screamers were doing the job i never say that i think maybe i said huh thats entirely different whatever you whats a word that means lie buts nicer than lie mavis closed one eye as if to sharpen her focus fib you fibbed because you didnt want roarke to go out and crush the bad guy like a bug and maybe get messed up in the process eve actually preferred the word lie to the word fib but decided not to make an issue of it more or less well that was stupid eves mouth fell open stupid youre saying i was stupid youre supposed to tell me i was right thats how this works dallas mavis leaned over then slid gracefully to the floor you didnt figure the man factor they got dicks you cant ever forget the dick when youre dealing with a man whatre you talking about eve slid to the floor as well sucked down the rest of her drink i know roarke has a dick he uses it every chance he gets the dicks connected to the ego its medical fact or maybe its the other way around with a shrug mavis emptied the last of the screamers its a mystery to all womankind you didnt trust him to handle himself he didnt trust me to handle myself dallas dallas shaking her head mavis patted eves thigh dallas she said a third time with great pity lets make more screamers well need them when we get to the men are pigs stage o o halfway through batch two eve lay on the floor staring up at the beads raining from the silver ceiling if men are pigs why do so many of us have one because women work on an emotional level mavis hiccupped delicately even you eve rolled over eyed mavis narrowly do not do too first he got you by the hormones i mean jesus look at him the mans a sexual gimme a minute a sexual banquet yeah thats a good one then he clicked into your head because hes smart and interesting and mysterious and all that stuff youd really go for but then the whammer was when he jammed right into your heart whatcha gonna do then a guys got his hooks in your heart he just reels you right in im not a goddamn fish we are all fish mavis said in rounded tones in the great sea of life eve had swallowed enough screamers to find that hysterically funny you moron she managed when she got her breath back hey im not the one in emotional crisis here on her hands and knees mavis crawled over and kissed eve smackingly on the cheek poor baby mommys gonna tell you just what to do to make it all better she crawled off for the screamers crawled back and poured them out into the glasses somehow managing not to spill a single potent drop well what fuck his brains out thats it thats mommys best advice its the only advice men being pigs and having the dick factor will usually forget what they were pissed about if you lay them right so im supposed to use sex to fix this somewhere in her alcoholdulled brain there was a glimmer of a thought that this approach was seriously marred but she couldnt quite grab onto it it could work she decided guaranteed but i knew there was a but i could almost feel it its only a what do you call it a temporary measure dallas youve got like you know issues so you gotta figure out why you went behind his back not that theres anything really wrong with that cause sometimes you just gotta do what you do but what you got here are two really rock heads that are rapping up against each other she demonstrated by banging her hands together and spilled some screamer after all oops youre saying im a rock head sure you are thats why i love you and when you got those rock heads smacking together like that youre gonna have something crack now and again hes hardly speaking to me hes so mean mavis polished off the screamer then gave eve a hard hug want some ice cream ill be sick what kind o o they ended up back on the floor with enormous bowls of triple fudge decadence topped with clouds of pink whipped cream i wasnt wrong eve said between bites of course you werent were women were never wrong even summerset went on my side and he hates me doesnt hate you i love the stupid son of a bitch aw thats so sweet maviss eyes seriously blurred went moist with sentiment if youd tell him you guys would get along better it took eve a minute not summerset jeez roarke i love that stupid son of a bitch youd think he could cut me a break when this case is hammering at me and i dont know what im doing you always know what youre doing thats why youre dallas lieutenant eve not with the job mavis i know what im doing with the job with roarke with the marriage deal with this love crap you must be drunk of course im drunk we each drank an entire batch of leonardos isnt he the cutest thing special screamer mix youre right eve set her empty bowl aside pressed a hand to her stomach i have to go throw up now okay im next so let me know when youre done as eve stumbled to her feet staggered out of the room mavis simply curled up tucked one of the satin throws under her head and went blissfully to sleep o o eve washed her face studied her pale sloppyeyed reflection in the mirror she looked soft she thought soft a little stupid and more than drunk with some regret she raided maviss supply of soberup after brief consideration she decided to take only one she wasnt quite ready to give up the buzz a full dose would dull when she found mavis asleep on the floor like a doll among a forest of colorful toys she grinned what would i do without you she leaned down gave maviss shoulder a little shake when she got a sexy little purr as a response she decided to forgo her plan to help mavis to bed instead she plucked one of the many fabric throws off the sofa tucked it around her sleeping friend and straightening again had her head spin yep still half drunk good enough she left the apartment rolling her shoulders like a boxer prepping for a bout she would deal with roarke all right she thought she was more than ready for it the fresh air hit her knocked her back she stood a moment breathing slowly then walked in mostly a straight line to her car she had wit enough to program it to auto and let it take her home she was going to straighten this out she told herself yes she was and if she had to get roarke into bed to do it well the sacrifices she had to make that made her snort with laughter and settle back to enjoy the ride new york looked so cheerful she decided the glidecarts were doing brisk business as the pedestrian traffic was thick the street thieves she thought with mild affection were having a field day plucking the tourists and the unwary greasy smoke stinking of overcooked soy dogs and rehydrated onion bits plumed in front of her car two street lcs were in a shoving match on the corner of sixth and sixtysecond while a hopeful john cheered them on one rapid cab tried a sneak maneuver around another missed and scraped fenders the two drivers were out of the cars like jacks from the box squaring off with fists god she loved new york she watched a flock of the headshaven pure sect well out of their bailiwick herd each other uptown an ad blimp past curfew glided overhead and touted the delights of a package trip to vegas ii four days three nights roundtrip and deluxe accommodations for two all for the lowlowlow price of twelve thousand and eightyfive what a deal the blimp chugged its way downtown as she continued up the pedestrian traffic thinned out and trimmed up the glidecarts took on a sheen welcome to roarkes world she thought amused at herself as she approached the gates a figure stepped into the path of her vehicle eve let out a yelp and fortunately the programming accessed the obstruction and hit the brakes mild annoyance turned to disgust when webster stepped out of the shadows she rolled down her window glared at him you got a death wish this is a city vehicle and i was on auto good thing as you look a little impaired sleepy he thought sleepy smashed and sexy night on the town bite me webster what do you want i need to talk to you he glanced at the gates its not easy getting into this place how about a lift i dont want you in my house the engaging smile hed fixed on his face hardened ten minutes dallas i promise not to steal the silver i have an office at central make an appointment if it wasnt important do you think id be hanging out in front of your house waiting to give you a chance to bust my balls she wished she didnt see the logic of that wished she wasnt sober enough to resist the urge to roll the window up and leave him outside the gates she jerked a thumb toward the passenger seat while he walked around the car to get in it occurred to her that for the last few hours murder hadnt entered her head it better be important webster if youre hosing me im going to do a lot more than bust your balls she completed the turn toward the gates her vehicle id was scanned and they opened silently pretty heavy security for a residence he commented she didnt nibble at that particular bait but she wished shed gone for both soberups so her mind would be absolutely clear she left the car at the end of the drive led the way up the steps he was doing his best not to gape at the house but didnt manage to swallow the low whistle when she opened the front door ive got a meeting she said even as summerset stepped into view and opened his mouth with her hands jammed in her pockets she headed upstairs webster gave up stared down at the elegant butler scanned what he could see of the lower floor some place im trying to picture you in this palace you never struck me as the princess type but when he stepped into her office one roarke had modeled to reflect her previous apartment he nodded this is more like it streamlined and practical now that i have your approval spill it ive got work to do you had time to go out and knock a few back tonight she angled her head folded her arms are you under the impression you have any say in what i do with my time on or off the job just an observation he prowled the room picking up setting back items at random then nearly jolted when he saw the enormous cat curled up in his sleep chair and watching him out of narrowed bicolored eyes palace guard damn right one word from me and hell claw your eyes out and eat your tongue dont make me set him off he laughed ordered himself to relax got any coffee yes she stood just where she was he laughed again a short resigned sound i was going to say you used to be friendlier but you werent something about that mean streak of yours always did it for me i must be sick get to the point or get out he nodded yet still he stalled walking to her window staring out your current avenues of investigation are infringing on an iab movement aw i feel so bad about that i warned them about you they didnt listen had this idea that you could be handled he turned back met her eyes im here to order you off ricker you have no authority to order me off anything request he amended im here to request you back off your investigation of max ricker request denied dallas you push the wrong buttons you could screw up an investigation thats been in the works for months an internal investigation im not at liberty to confirm or deny then leave im trying to give you a hand here if you just back off well both end up getting what were after she eased a hip on the edge of her desk i want a cop killer what do you want you think it doesnt matter to me his voice took on heat his eyes flashed with it the way those two men went down i dont know what matters to you webster why dont you tell me doing the job he shot back making sure the job gets done right and it gets done clean and mills and kohli were dirty he started to speak then jammed his fists in his pockets i cant comment i dont need your comments iab might have its reasons for wanting to keep that information under wraps for now fine as it happens so do i but its not going to stay under the connection to rickers going to explode before much longer how many more dead cops do you want me to stand over while you guys dick around with your internal investigation you knew they were dirty and you left them out there its not as black and white as that you knew she repeated heating up and that they were in rickers pocket that theyd helped him slide on charges that should have put him in for the rest of his unnatural life how long have you known knowing isnt proving is it lieutenant bullshit webster thats just bullshit in a matter of days ive put together enough on those two cops to have pulled them in and taken their badges you left them out for a reason now you want me to back off ricker how do i know he hasnt made room in his pocket for you his eyes flashed again and he was on her before he could stop himself dragging her off the desk thats low iab gives lessons in low you want to go through the door with a dirty cop with one who might hesitate just long enough to have you on a slab theres a reason for what i do and i dont have to justify it to you you used to draw a hard straight line dallas when did it start to go crooked about the time you hooked up with roarke step back now but he didnt couldnt mills was garbage you want to risk destroying the case weve been building for months so you can stand for him hed have sold you out for pocket change now hes dead is that iabs sense of justice to have your guts spilled out for being on the take if ricker took him out he used another cop to do it does that balance it in your world his eyes flickered thats reaching no no its not she watched him closely now its accurate and you knew it you knew it starting with kohli and thats why you she trailed off as pieces began to shift and fall into another pattern one that made her stomach churn kohli you didnt mention him just mills because kohli wasnt garbage was he webster he was just a tool you set him up you used him leave it alone the hell i will her fury was like a living thing and it was clawing at her brain he was under for you he wasnt taking you were giving to make him look wrong so he could pick up information for you get closer to rickers police contacts she closed her eyes as she worked it out you picked him because he was clean and more because he was average almost invisible a data cruncher who had a strong sense of right and wrong youd have played to him recruited him she murmured opening her eyes again and studying websters his background in the mps that was on his side he was good at taking orders you probably offered him extra pay help him save for the bigger place he wanted for his family while his wife stayed home with the kids put a real package deal together appealing to his sense of duty sense of family then there was the ricker edge hed put in a lot of time on that had to be bummed when it fell apart you set him up nobody held a blaster to his head websters voice was raw as guilt ate at him theres a serious problem at the one twentyeight kohli fit the profile for what we needed all he had to do was say no you knew he wouldnt because he fit the fucking profile goddamn it webster goddamn it he was killed because somebody believed the setup somebody killed him for being dirty are you going to stand there and tell me we should have anticipated that he had plenty of fury of his own and mixed with it was a sticky guilt that made a bitter brew it came out of the fucking blue he was on the job dallas he knew the risks we all know them yeah we know the risks and we live with them or we die with them but she stepped closer shoved her face into his you used me webster the same way and nobody asked you came to me all friendly all unofficial to toss just enough garbage in my path so id look in the right places so id find the money kohlid put away just like you told him to so id look and id paint him dirty you had me looking at a good cop and tossing muck at him you think that doesnt make me sick i dont know what makes you sick she started to turn away but he grabbed her arm hell be exonerated when the time comes hell be put in for a posthumous promotion his family will be taken care of at her side her hand bunched into a fist but she didnt use it instead she used frigid disdain get away from me get out of my house for gods sake dallas nobody meant for this to happen but you jumped right on it when it did he wasnt even cold its not my choice enraged he took her other arm shook her once im not supposed to be here tonight im not supposed to have told you any of this then why did you the bureau will find a way to kick you off the case or if it suits better to put you right in rickers path either way youre going to walk around with a target on your back you matter to me he jerked her against him and she was too shocked to block the move hey you matter you always have she slapped both hands on his chest felt the rapid pump of his heart the heat jesus webster are you crazy id prefer that you take your hands off my wife before i break them roarke said from the doorway but either way works for me chapter eleven the voice was rigidly pleasant and didnt fool eve for an instant she knew the sound of savagery when she heard it however elegantly it was cloaked just as she recognized it in the frigid blue of roarkes eyes she felt the punch of fear like a blow to her solar plexus as a result her voice was sharp and clipped as she broke websters hold and stepped deliberately between him and her husband roarke webster and i are in the middle of a meeting and a professional disagreement i dont think so go find something to do eve elsewhere insult worked hard to kick fear aside but didnt manage the job she felt her muscles begin to tremble and had an image of capping off the evening by arresting her husband for murder get a grip she did her best to plant her boots youve mistaken the situation here no he hasnt not on my end webster moved away from eve and i dont hide behind women you want to do this here he said with a nod toward roarke or outside roarke smiled much eve thought like a wolf might before a kill here and now they leapt at each other charged she would think later when her brain engaged again like a couple of rams in rutting season for a moment she was too stunned to do more than goggle she watched webster fly come heavily down on a table which crashed under the weight galahad sprang up hissing and took a vicious swipe at his shoulder he was up quickly shed give him that bleeding fists flew with the ugly sound of bone against bone a lamp shattered she was shouting she could hear herself calling out in a voice that seemed oddly unlike her own at wits end she drew her weapon hastily checked to insure it was on lowest stun then fired a stream between them websters head whipped around in shock but roarke didnt so much as flinch and his fist already swinging smashed into websters face another table went splintering into toothpicks and this time webster stayed down or would have if roarke hadnt leaned over and hauled him up by the collar roarke her hand steady eve kept her weapon trained thats enough let him go or ill stun you i swear i will his eyes met hers hot now hot enough to burn he released webster so the halfconscious man crumpled in a heap even as roarke started toward eve summerset slid into the room ill just show your guest out do that roarke said without taking his eyes from eves and close the door stun me will you he murmured it silkily when he was a foot away she backed up all but hearing her nerves fray if you dont calm down yes im going to go see how bad hes hurt youre not no that youre not stun me then he invited and she heard the alleyways of dublin in his voice do it she heard the doors close the locks click fear had her by the throat infuriating her even as she took another step in retreat there was nothing going on here its insulting for you to think there was darling eve if i thought thered been anything on your part going on here he wouldnt have left breathing there was no change in his expression as his hand snaked out and knocked the weapon from hers yet you stood between us to try to avoid this she threw out her arms this testosterone explosion damn it you wrecked my place and assaulted an officer and over nothing over my having a professional disagreement with a colleague a colleague who was once a lover and what i walked in on was personal okay all right maybe but thats no excuse if i jumped every one of your old lovers id be bashing every female face in new york and the known universe thats entirely different why she had him now she thought with satisfaction why is it different for you because i dont invite those former lovers into my home and let them put their hands on me it wasnt like that it was and because he fisted a hand at the front of her shirt hauling her up until she was forced to her toes youre mine her eyes all but bulged out of her head what what like property like one of your damn hotels aye if you like i dont like not one damn bit she shoved at his hand twisted and only succeeded in ripping the shoulder seam of her shirt alarm bells went off in her head even as she tried to break his hold with another counter maneuver she ended up with her back pressed into him and her arms pinned youve crossed a number of lines in a short time lieutenant his voice was warm against her ear warm and dangerous erotic do you think im a man wholl go meekly about your bidding do you think loving you has taken my teeth as if to prove otherwise he sank them lightly in her throat she couldnt think not with the red haze covering her brain she quite simply couldnt get her breath let go of me im too mad to deal with you tonight no youre not mad he whipped her around again slammed her back to the wall and yanked her arms over her head and his face the face of a condemned angel was close to hers intrigued is what you are and reluctantly aroused your pulse is pounding and you tremble some of its fear just a touch of it to add an edge he was right she could have damned him for it but need was crawling through her like savage little ants youre hurting me let go of my hands no im not but perhaps ive been too careful too often not to hurt you have you forgotten what you took on with me eve no her eyes skimmed down to his mouth god help her she wanted it on her youre mine and youll say it before were done tonight he reached out with his free hand and ripped her shirt down the center and now ill have whats mine she resisted but that was pride and pride was weaker than lust she twisted her body hooking a foot behind his in an attempt to overbalance him he merely shifted his weight into the move and took her down with him the shock of the fall knocked the breath out of her but her knee came up an automatic jerk of defense he rolled away from it still gripping her hands pinned her she bucked swore at him whipping her head to the side as his mouth came down he settled for her throat savaged it and sent the pulse beneath his teeth and lips bounding he might have stopped himself the civilized veneer hed coated over himself was hard set and hard won but the beast inside him had been teased to raging he wanted it loose and the scent of her of his mate was humming in his blood she was strong hed pit his strength and his will against hers before but always with a sense of fair play underneath not this time was all he could think not this time he clamped a hand over her breast found the skin hot and damp she made some sound between a snarl and a moan and when he crushed his mouth to hers she bit the quick flash of pain only appealed to the primal lust surging inside him when he lifted his head his eyes were wild and fierce liomsa hed said it to her once before in the language of his youth mine she struggled fighting herself now but when his mouth came to hers again hot and hard and hungry she lost desire with its more primitive barbs scraped through her she wanted wanted and now her body arched not in protest but in demand and her mouth met his with feral force he released her hands only to jerk her up yanking what was left of her shirt over her shoulders her weapon harness tangled locking her arms as effectively as restraints and now the fear leaped back she was defenseless say it back to me damn you eve say it his mouth fused to hers again then streaked down her throat over her breasts his teeth raked at her and his hands on a sharp cry her head fell back pleasure its edge as keen as razors sliced at her leaving what was left of pride in tatters then she was rolling with him over a floor littered with splintered wood in something too fierce to be surrender she fought free of the harness and tore at his shirt she wanted flesh his flesh the feel of it the taste every breath she took was a desperate gasp his hands took possessed bruising as they moved over her those long skilled fingers arousing mercilessly until she was mad for more he yanked her trousers down her hips flung them aside and ruthlessly used his mouth on her release gushed through her a flood that scorched her system floundering she dug her fingers into the rug tried to find some anchor to hold her but she was flying catapulted out of control and still he wouldnt stop couldnt stop the small mad sounds she made inflamed him whipped his already crazed blood into a fever of greed every gulp of air he took in was full of her the hot sharp taste of woman his his mouth raced up her shuddering body feasted on her breasts while he plunged his fingers into her she came again brutally and her shocked cry was a dark thrill to him the sudden bite of her nails on his back a vicious pleasure say it say it back to me he demanded while his breath heaved while he watched her eyes go blind as he pushed her to the edge yet again damn it ill hear it from you somehow through the madness ruling her she understood not surrender even after this it wasnt surrender he asked for but acceptance her throat burned her system screamed to mate as she opened for him lifted to him she fumbled out the gaelic mine was what she said youre mine too and her mouth rose to his as he drove himself inside her o o she lay beneath him enervated stupefied her ears were ringing making it impossible to think she wanted to find herself in this body that had responded so primitively but more she simply wanted to wallow in the echoes of sensations that still rippled through her when he shifted she would have rolled to her stomach the position she assumed when exhaustion ruled but he plucked her off the floor into his arms were not done yet leaving the wreckage of her office behind he carried her out and took her to bed o o when she woke light was streaming through the sky window her body pulsed with a thousand sly aches and he was gone she lay where she was on a bed that had been well used on sheets that were tangled to ropes and let the tugofwar between shame and pleasure play out inside her nothing was resolved she realized nothing was balanced she rose went in to shower wondering if theyd fixed anything or only damaged it further she managed to dress for the day without once meeting her own eyes in the mirror her harness and weapon were on the table in the sitting area wondering when hed put them there she strapped it on and with her weapon in place she felt steadier or did until she walked into her office and found peabody staring at the carnage ah some party peabody said we had an incident eve kicked the broken lamp aside strode directly to her desk her only goal at that moment was to stay in charge i have information that needs to be considered in the investigation sit down peabody cleared her throat righted a chair it was the first time in her memory her lieutenant had started a morning briefing without a cup of coffee in her hand but peabody sat took out her memo book an iab operation has come to my attention eve began and told her aide what she needed to know when she was done peabody set her book on her knee if i can offer an opinion sir that sucks your opinion is noted and agreed with theyve been impeding two homicide investigations by withholding pertinent data even iab doesnt have that right no they dont and im going to deal with it in the meantime id like you to contact dr mira and request that our consult be moved here i dont want iab catching any scent call mcnab in i want a harder closer look at the list from the one twentyeight and i want that done here too until weve worked out the feeding chain officially we give internal affairs nothing so much for solidarity peabody muttered those rat bastards put your personal feelings aside cops are being murdered we cant afford the indulgence of resentment but she felt it deep and dark inside her i want to inform whitney of this new information in person ill be back within two hours or contact you if im delayed yes sir would you like me to clean up in here thats not your job eve snapped then squeezed her eyes shut took a breath sorry personal distraction dont worry about it unless somethings in your way relay to mira that this consult is now a priority have the backgrounds on as many from the one twentyeight as possible before that consult she hesitated then shrugged as she walked toward the door and id appreciate it if youd inform roarkes offices that well clear purgatory by end of day o o he wasnt the least bit interested in purgatory even the time he assumed hed spend there for his sins nor was roarke overly surprised to find don webster waiting for him in the reception area of his midtown offices roarkes admin an exceptional woman of great efficiency and insight moved into reception cutting neatly between the two men your schedule is quite full this morning this gentleman would like to see you and is reluctant to make an appointment for later in the week ill make time for him now thank you caro webster he gestured toward the corridor that led to his office and wasnt displeased to note webster sported a violent bruise running from under his right eye to his cheekbone and a split lip that had yet to be treated his own ribs were aching like a bitch something hed refused to see to as a matter of pride he stepped into his office moved directly to the desk but didnt sit with his hands lightly in his pockets his body balanced on the balls of his feet he measured his adversary you want another round mate more than i want to see the sunrise webster replied then shook his head when the light came into roarkes eyes but im going to have to pass i hate saying this but you had every right to pound the shit out of me last night and there roarke said smoothly were in perfect accord and if i find your hands on whats mine again youll lose them thats a promise shed have taken care of that herself if youd been five minutes later shit five seconds later i want you to know that eves fidelity was never in question okay webster felt part of the weight that had hung on him through the night lift i didnt want you to get the idea that she hell he raked a hand through his hair we have a professional problem which i used to move on a personal one a problem i have webster elaborated i think im in love with your wife thats indeed a problem i have to admire your courage in saying that to my face considering roarke chose a chair took out a cigarette he caught websters quick glance at it lifted a brow would you like one i havent had one in five years three months and i think its twentysix days ive managed to lose track of the hours fuck it he took one drew deep until his eyes all but crossed i dont know you webster continued but i know about you i can say the same roarke replied did you think eve hadnt told me youd once had a night together doing his best to shrug webster sat as well it didnt mean anything to her i knew it then and i know it now i know your rep roarke if you want to come after me thats what youll do im up for that i just didnt want dallas to take any heat for it an attempt like that to protect her would tempt her to kick your balls into your throat for the first time webster smiled then swore as the cut lip burned like fire yeah well he pressed a finger gingerly to his lip when i screw up i dont like anybody else catching the flak whatever you know or think you know about me know this i dont strike out at women particularly when theyve done nothing but be who they are he thought of the way hed handled her the night before then ruthlessly pushed that aside again for later and going after you would make eve unhappy i might risk that but ive no reason to webster stared down at his cigarette youre not what i expected i could have been could have beens dont mean squat biting back a sigh webster took one last drag its what is that counts thats ah he tapped his bruised cheek something i needed to be reminded of he crushed out the cigarette before getting to his feet meeting roarkes eyes he held out a hand i appreciate the time roarke rose he felt a stir of pity another of respect each as unexpected as the other he accepted the hand smiled ive a fucking bruise the size of a dinner plate on my ribs and my kidney feels like its been slammed with a brick despite the split lip webster grinned thanks he started for the door turned back briefly you fit you know you and dallas christ the two of you fit they did yes roarke thought when the door closed but the fit wasnt always comfortable o o commander whitney didnt explode when eve relayed the information shed come by but it was a close thing can you verify no sir not at this time but my information is accurate my source unimpeachable and that source is shed considered this debated it and saw no choice i regret sir that im unable to reveal the name of my source im not a goddamn reporter dallas commander this information was given to me in confidence i have no compunction about using the information but cant name the source youre making it more difficult for me to kick ass in iab im sorry about that ill hit them with it he continued drumming his fingers on his desk theyll deny stall prevaricate if as you relate this operation has been in place some time theyre going to be very reluctant to open it even with this office he sat back eyes slitted with concentration politics is a dirty little game im very good at it yes sir eve allowed herself the barest hint of a smile you are be prepared to be called into the tower to discuss this matter lieutenant he said referring to the offices of the police commissioner ill start the wheel rolling ill be available commander at this time and until this area of my investigation is resolved to our satisfaction ill be working with my team at my home office he nodded already turning to his link dismissed o o as she jogged through the garage toward her vehicle carmichael hailed her got a little something that might interest you ive been through most of the witnesses on my list and hit with one of the waitresses hit what seems this server did some short time for running scams nothing major a little bait and switch but it gave her a good eye for cops she claims she made kohli as one but didnt think anything of it didnt make much of the other cop who came in from time to time and sat at the bar sucking down whiskey sours what other cop yeah carmichael said with a grin that was my question and the answer was the lady cop the goodlooking blonde when i nudged her a little more she gave me a pretty fair description of captain roth of the one twoeight son of a bitch yeah the general description could have fit a few hundred women but it rang bells so i pulled some photos and had her do a match she plucked roths out first shot thanks keep this quiet will you can do i was on my way up to drop the record of the interview on your desk carmichael pulled a disc out of her bag want it now yeah thanks again eve jammed the disc in her pocket hurried to her car she was going to squeeze in time for a trip to the one twoeight peabody she tagged her aide on the run pull up data on roth and dig dont worry about flags i want them to wave yes sir your consult with dr mira is set for your home office at tenthirty ill try not to keep her waiting pull the data now make it noisy o o eve didnt expect a brass band welcome when she walked into the one twentyeighth what she got was a number of cool stares muttered asides one particularly inventive officer oinked rather than ignoring it she strolled over to his desk smiled youve got a lot of talent there detective do you hire out for parties he curled his lip i got nothing to say to you thats good because i dont have anything to say to you either she kept her eyes on his until he shifted looked away satisfied she made her way back to captain roths office it was a corner room one eve imagined had been hard won with a pair of windows a good solid desk and a thriving vining plant on the sill the door was glass and through it eve saw roth surge to her feet when their eyes met eve didnt bother to knock how dare you run my personal file without notification roth began youre over the line lieutenant one of us is eve closed the door at her back why are you worried about what i might find in your personal im not worried im furious theres a matter of professional courtesy which youve summarily ignored in some vendetta you have to smear my house i intend to report your conduct to commander whitney and all the way up to the tower your privilege captain just as its mine as primary on two homicides to ask you why you concealed the fact from me that you had visited detective kohli at purgatory a number of times she added when she saw roth flinch your information is inaccurate i dont think so we talk about it here captain or at central your choice as a professional courtesy if you think im going to let you ruin me youre mistaken if you think im going to let you hide behind your captains bars youre mistaken where were you on the night detective kohli was murdered i dont have to answer your insulting questions you will if i pull you into interview and i will i was nowhere near purgatory the night kohli was killed prove it oh i hope you rot in hell roth marched around her desk snapped her privacy screens into place to block the view from the bullpen my whereabouts on that night are personal nothings personal in a murder investigation im a cop lieutenant a good one better at the desk than on the street but a goddamn good cop my having a drink at a club now and then has nothing to do with kohlis death or my position as captain of this squad then why did you withhold the information because im not supposed to drink her color came up a flag of mortification i have a problem with alcohol and have already been through rehab but you know that she muttered and walked back behind the desk im not going to have a lapse in my recovery endanger my job i didnt know kohli was moonlighting in purgatory when i went in the first time i went back because he was a familiar face i didnt mention it because it was irrelevant you know better than that captain all right goddamn it i was protecting myself why shouldnt i they were squared off again with roth planted behind the desk defending her territory shed do whatever it took to hold what shed worked to win i know damn well youre trying to say kohli was dirty that mills was dirty you wont say i am there have been a number of substantial deposits in your husbands financial accounts goddamn it im calling my rep she reached for her link then curled her hand into a fist the room was silent as eve watched her battle for control i do that and this goes on record youve got me by the short hairs she took a deep breath expelled it a few months ago i began to suspect my husband was involved with someone else the signs were there distraction disinterest late arrivals missed appointments i confronted him he denied some men have a talent for turning such an accusation around until youre at fault even when in your gut you know better very simply lieutenant my marriage was falling apart and i found myself unable to stop it youre a cop a woman married you know its not easy eve didnt reply nor did roth expect her to i was upset edgy distracted i told myself it wouldnt hurt to smooth out the nerves with a drink or two and i ended up in purgatory kohli was working the bar we both pretended it was no big deal for either of us to be in there meanwhile my marriage was crumbling i discovered that my husband was not only rolling around on someone elses sheets but had been steadily transferring funds from our account to one under his own name before i could stop it hed ruined me financially had me heading right back into the bottle and was adversely affecting my work performance about two weeks ago i pulled myself together i kicked his lying lazy ass out and put myself back into rehab i did not however report my counseling which is a violation of procedure a minor one but a violation since that time i have not been back to purgatory nor had i seen detective kohli outside of the job captain roth i sympathize with your personal difficulties during this period but i need to know your whereabouts on the night of kohlis death until midnight i was at an aa meeting in a church basement in brooklyn she smiled thinly not much chance of running into anyone i know there which was the point after that i went out for coffee with several of the other participants we tell war stories i returned home alone about two and went to bed i have no alibi for the time in question steadier now roth looked into eves eyes everything i told you is off record and inadmissible as i wasnt mirandized if you take me in lieutenant im going to make it very hard on you captain if i decide to take you in i can promise itll be a lot harder on you chapter twelve she needed time to absorb and access to let the new pieces shift into patterns and she needed to consider carefully whether she wanted to damage another cops career before she was certain that cop had done more than be careless but under it she was afraid her own marital strain made her too sympathetic to anothers she would have her consult with mira input the new data run probabilities she would do it all by the book when she walked into her home office she saw mira sitting in a chair in the now tidy office while peabody and mcnab worked backtoback at their individual keyboards im sorry i kept you waiting thats perfectly all right mira set aside a cup of what eve assumed was tea peabody explained you might be delayed do you mind if we take this in another room not at all mira rose elegant as always in a sleek suit of spring leaf green i always enjoy seeing parts of your home though she wasnt sure if it was strictly appropriate for a consult eve led the way to one of the lounging rooms mira sighed in appreciation what a lovely space she murmured studying the soft colors the gracious lines of the furniture the gleam of wood and glass my god eve is that a monet eve glanced at the painting something in that same soft pallette that seemed to flow together and form a garden i have no idea it is of course mira said after shed walked over to admire the painting oh i do envy you your art collection its not mine mira only turned and smiled i envy it nonetheless may i sit yeah sure sorry im sorry too that ive dumped so much data on you in such a short time were both accustomed to working under pressure these killings have ripples radiating throughout the department being in the center of those ripples is a very difficult position im used to that too yes something else here mira thought she knew eve too well to miss the small signs but that would wait i concur with your analysis that both victims were killed by the same hand the methodology notwithstanding there is a pattern the coins the victims themselves the brutality and the knowledge of security its another cop eve said or someone who used to be very likely your killer is enraged but controlled enough to protect himself by removing evidence the rage is personal id go as far as to say intimate this may substantiate your coptocop profile because he believed mills and kohli were dirty or because he is the former i believe this isnt the act of someone protecting themselves but one of avenging your killer is systematic and sees himself as dispensing justice he wants his victims marked as judas wants their crimes to be revealed then why not simply expose them the datas there if you want to find it that isnt enough the loss of the badge the disgrace its too easy their punishment must come from him he or she was punished in some way very likely through the job in a manner that is perceived as unjust perhaps he was falsely accused of some infraction the system somehow failed him and now cannot be trusted they knew him or her yes im sure of it not only because the victims seem to have been unprepared for the attack but because psychologically this connection only increases the rage its very likely they worked with their killer possibly some act of theirs was responsible at least in the killers judgment for the injustice that occurred to him when you find him eve youll find connections do you see him in a position of authority a badge is a position of authority of command then possibly but not as one whos confident of command no his confidence comes from his rage and his rage in part from his disillusionment in the system hes represented in the system his victims had sworn to represent the system screwed him they screwed the system why blame them because they profited by its flaws and he lost eve nodded it jelled for her youre aware now that the one twentyeight is suspected of having a serious internal problem the connection with organized crime with max ricker yes your report to me made that clear i have to tell you dr mira that its been established that detective kohli was clean and part of an iab operation attempting to uncover this corruption i see her clear eyes clouded i see i dont know if the killer is aware of this as yet but i doubt it what will his reaction be when he learns kohli was clean mira got to her feet her training and her position made it necessary for her to put herself into the mind of murderers as she did so she wandered to the wide band of windows and looked out on the gardens where a sea of candypink tulips danced she saw beyond them to the sweeps of shape and color very much as monet had reflected them in oil there was nothing so comforting she thought as a well planted garden he will disbelieve it initially hes not a killer but a servant of justice when he cant deny it hell turn to rage its his salvation once again the system has betrayed him and tricked him into taking an innocent life someone will pay perhaps someone in internal affairs where it began perhaps you eve she said and turned back as you are the one who has indirectly at least shoved this horror into his face hell be doubly fueled now for himself and for kohli very shortly after he learns and accepts hell kill hell kill eve until hes caught how do i make him turn to me specifically mira walked back sat down do you think i would help you with that even if i could its better to know his target than to guess yes youd think so mira said placidly particularly if you can make yourself that target but you cant direct his mind eve his logic is his own hes already selected his next victim this information when he learns of it may alter his plans hell have to grieve then hell have to balance his scales eve frowned he has a conscience yes and kohli will weigh on it kohli will cost him but who hell blame thats the shading i cant give you why the hell doesnt he go after ricker he may but first hell clean his own house how do you protect and investigate every cop in a precinct eve murmured and how do you manage it when they look at you as if youre the enemy is that whats troubling you having your own step away from you no she shrugged it off no i can handle it then since theres little to nothing more i can give you on this profile at the moment i wish you would tell me what is troubling you i have a lot on my mind in dismissal eve got to her feet i appreciate you taking the time to come here i know its an inconvenience eve wasnt the only stubborn woman in the room sit down im not finished a little surprised by the authoritarian tone eve sat you said i said to tell me whats troubling you youre unhappy and distracted and i suspect its cause is personal if its personal eve said coolly then it has no place in this consult have the nightmares increased are you having more flashbacks no damn it this has nothing to do with my father with my past with any of that its my business you need to understand something i care very much about you dr mira be quiet and the command in that warm pleasant voice brooked no argument i care on a very personal level however much it may discomfort you eve i look on you as a kind of surrogate daughter its a pity that causes you embarrassment she said mildly when that emotion ran over eves face you dont know my children but i can promise you that they would tell you i am relentless when concerned about their happiness while i will try not to interfere i will know the cause eve was dumbfounded and she was chased by so many emotions they ran over themselves on their way to clog her throat she had no mother no memory of one and no defense against the offer from the woman who watched her and seemed so determined to stand as one i cant talk about it of course you can if its not your past its your present if its personal its roarke have you had a disagreement the term so tame so civilized caused a reaction eve never expected she laughed laughed until her sides ached and she realized to her utter shock the sound was coming perilously close to sobs i dont know what we had hes not speaking to me basically eve mira reached for her hand clasped it the gesture snapped the last lock it poured out of her everything from the time shed walked into the bedroom and seen summerset staggering under the weight of the flowers i went to see mavis eve continued and got drunk that sounds stupid but on the contrary it sounds perfectly sensible you went to a trusted friend one who knows both of you and is herself in a committed monogamous and loving relationship getting drunk was a release valve but talking it over with her was an avenue she said i should eve couldnt quite bring herself to repeat maviss descriptive phrase seduce him again sensible sex opens doors to communication and relieves tension it didnt work i didnt really get the chance to try it out there was an individual i cant give you the name who has a connection with the case and an older one with me who was waiting outside i brought him up to my office to discuss the case and jesus i dont know what got into him i guess you could say he made a move on me which i was about to repel with some violence when roarke oh dear i imagine he was seriously displeased eve simply stared for a minute stunned by the phrase she was afraid to laugh again afraid she wouldnt stop you could say that words were exchanged and then they went at each other the worst is for a minute i just stood there with my mouth open theyre breaking furniture and bloods flying and i stand there stupid not for long i take it no but still anyway i drew my weapon good god eve it was on stun she made a defensive move with her shoulders i fired a warning which roarke ignored unfortunately for for the other individual he didnt and roarke coldcocked him summerset got the guy out and im telling roarke to calm his ass down or ill stun him i meant it im sure you did he didnt seem to care he sort of backed me into a corner and i couldnt seem to then he hmmm he oh mira felt something flutter in her belly i see no no he didnt punch me or anything thats not what i thought he made love to you no thats not the way it was he just took me over i wasnt going to stand for it i told myself i wouldnt but i was damn it i was aroused and he knew it and he was ripping my clothes and we were sort of struggling a little then we were on the floor and i was ripping his clothes and we were on each other like animals or something i couldnt stop him or myself or any of it and i didnt want to because god i was so hot id have let him eat me alive oh my mira managed i shouldnt have told you mortified eve squeezed her eyes shut what was i thinking no no sweetheart that was a very unprofessional reaction and i apologize but it was a very female one and she thought her husband was going to be quite delighted with the aftereffects of this hearttoheart with eve i didnt just let him take me i helped him i enjoyed it she looked down miserably at her empty hands thats got to be sick not enjoying what you just described to me might be enjoying it was completely healthy extremely healthy if i might say so eve you love each other passionate sex it went over the top of passionate please my system can only handle so much and now mira laughed you and roarke are two strong stubborn physical people who are wildly in love he was angry with you for your attempt to protect him at your own risk as you would be if he did the same but you know thats true as much as you know youd do the same thing again just as he would you dented his ego always a tricky proposition with a man particularly a man like him then before he could come to full terms with it he walks in on you being hit on by another man he had to know that i wouldnt have he did of course but he wouldnt stand for two slaps at his ego think a moment and answer honestly would you really want him to stand for it i maybe not she admitted grudgingly then she blew out a breath surprised that she felt considerably better no i wouldnt want him to stand for it of course not and his reaction was given who he is physical the fight reasserted his ego territoriality eve this woman is mine thats what he said she muttered naturally enough you are just as hes yours then you stand there holding your weapon on him oh what a sight that would have been so he metaphorically speaking drew one of his own eves lips quivered dr mira i think thats crude nonetheless both of you reacted as natural for you engaged in a bout of rough sweaty sex that no doubt satisfied you youd have thought so but we hadnt even cooled off when he picked me up off the floor and carried me into bed and did it all over again mira stared rather blankly does he have a particular diet vitamins eve felt her grin spread and the muscles that had been tied all day loosen thanks and i dont even have to throw up like i did after drinking screamers and eating ice cream with mavis thats a plus the man loves you with everything he has everything he is eve that means you can hurt him make the time and go talk to your husband i will i have to get back to the office mira rose i plan to finish up early today go home and ravish my husband amused eve watched mira dignity and grace walk to the door doctor yes the um mother thing that was weird but nice its nice for me too goodbye eve o o recharged eve walked into her office and ordered peabody and mcnab to take a twentyminute break but when mcnab made a beeline for the kitchen in her office she headed him off no downstairs upstairs outside somewhere else i want quiet stay out of the bedrooms she added when she caught the gleam in his eye she settled down contacting feeney first if and when she was called to the tower she wanted him along computer run probability using all available data re roth captain eileen as perpetrator in homicide cases in file working eve wandered the room while the computer crunched data and percentages recharged yes she thought she was also restless energized ready to move she thought of roth desperately trying to blend her professional and personal lives failing at one endangering the other thats not going to happen to me whatever it took she thought she was going to make it work on both sides requested analysis as follows using available data probability roth captain committed homicides on file is sixtyseven point three percent low eve thought but not out of the running computer recalibrate with additional data for my eyes only captain roths recurrent alcohol addiction failing marriage and financial crisis in addition subject roth was aware of victims employment at purgatory and had visited the scene in the weeks prior to the incident working additional data increases probability by twelve point eight percent for a total percentage of eighty point one yeah it makes a difference that puts you on the short list captain who else have we got before she could move on her link beeped dallas martinez there was background noise a great deal of it air and street traffic eve decided martinez wasnt calling from the squad room you got anything for me ive got holes in the data files holes that dont match my own records ive backtracked crossreferenced but i cant pin down who did the shifting somebody sure as hell messed with the reports just a little twist here and there you get me a copy ill have a friend a discreet friend in edd pin it down hes a bloodhound hell smell it out i dont want to send it through the system at central home office eve rattled off the proper identification code got it hey i thought you were going to pull the tag on me i did well if you did ive picked up another one and theyre cops i know a cop tag just go about your routine dont contact me on any departmental line i know the drill lieutenant right you need to talk to me contact through my home or my personal link ready she reeled off the numbers dont take any chances dont be a hero and dont trust anybody i dont not even you fine eve murmured when the transmission ended just so you keep breathing she turned away from the link she scanned through peabodys current runs and results and found an additional three potentials in the one twentyeighth wanting a visual impression she called up id photos stopped smiled a little and focused on one well well if it isnt our oinking detective vernon jeremy k i dont like your face jerry lets have a closer look at you and the hell with the flags she dug through his financials and saw nothing to ring alarms she did a search and scan on connecting accounts keying in variations of his name trying for the numbers by using date of birth address his precinct his badge number she was well into it when peabody strolled back in did you know you have paella with honesttogod shellfish ive never had paella for lunch yum yum eve didnt bother to look up use the other unit and copy the data on detective jeremy vernon you got something yeah i got me a nibble here how many cops have numbered bank accounts in another city now she did glance up giving peabody a speculative look not me by the time i pay the first of the months factor in transpo costs and food allowance im lucky to have enough left over for new underwear which im in desperate need of at the moment having a sex life is great and a nice change but you have to have decent drawers detectives make more than uniforms eve speculated but unless the pay scales gone up since my day this guy shouldnt be able to tuck away three hundred grand and change but its not enough dead relatives she murmured mills used dead relatives where the hells mcnab he was still stuffing his face you also have strawberry shortcake dont make me go get him im weak and it looked really mag eve turned to her link shed never used the house intercom but now seemed like a good time to start she flipped it to full open mcnab get your bony ass up here now its not bony so much as tight peabody offered and earned a killing look from eve ive told you about that just saying peabody muttered do you want me to start a search for ancestors let mcnab do it hes faster than both of us and delegating she thought would give her time to balance those scales she rose i want him to do the run then the two of you split the names look for current accounts if the names crap out go for numbers dobs dods ids drivers license and anything else that comes to you all combinations im taking an hour personal time she headed out as mcnab rushed in man dallas it was like hearing the voice of god you nearly scared me to death youve got strawberry gunk on your lip clean up and get to work wheres she going mcnab demanded when eve breezed out an hour personal time dallas personal time maybe it was the voice of god and this is the end of the world that got a smirk out of peabody but she told herself shed been too nice to him lately and refused to let the laugh loose shes entitled to a life like everybody else and if you dont get that bony ass in gear shes going to kick it to new jersey when she gets back i didnt get my coffee but he wandered to the desk on his way to the kitchen whats she running this guy she wants a financial search hey i know him vernon you do yeah yeah i remember him i got called onscene backup for an illegals bust when i was in uniform hes an asshole whys that wasnt he properly awed by the brilliance of your mind he gave her a sour look hes a strutter preening around hitting on the lcs we hauled in during the bust made a big deal out of himself and it was a pennyante bust too bunch of street hookers couple of johns and a couple kilos of exotica acted like hed just taken down some major cartel and he treated the uniforms like slaves i heard one of the lcs yelled sexual harassment and he got called in on it took a knuckle rap nice guy yeah a prince seems i heard a rumor that he liked to bust the hookers for exotica because he could skim a couple ounces for personal use well jerry old pal what goes around comes around he forgot the coffee dramatically flexed his fingers and got to work chapter thirteen roarkes midtown offices were in his own sleek black tower that speared up from the street like a shaft into the blue belly of the sky that sheer ebony lance was a favorite image on the tourists postcards and holocubes inside it was just as sleek with edges of the lush in banks and pools of stunning flowers tropical trees acres of animated maps and an ocean of glossy tile not all the businesses housed in the tower were his but he owned a piece of most that were including the shops restaurants and chic salons he worked on the top floor which eve could access through a private elevator she arrived unannounced and unexpected and with a chip the size of a meteor on her shoulder the receptionist beamed at her because she was a clever and experienced woman that welcoming smile stayed in place even when she caught the combative expression on eves face lieutenant dallas how nice to see you again im afraid roarkes in a meeting at the moment and cant be disturbed is there anything i can do to is he back there yes but oh lieutenant she scrambled up from her post as eve marched past her please you really cant watch me its an extremely important meeting the receptionist risked her very attractive face by throwing herself in eves path if you could just wait possibly ten minutes they should be breaking for the lunch portion very shortly perhaps i can get you some coffee a pastry eve gave her a considering look whats your name im loreen lieutenant well loreen i dont want coffee or a pastry but thanks and ill be sure to tell roarke you tried now move but i tried really hard eve added then simply shouldered loreen aside and yanked open the door roarke was in front of his desk leaning back against it looking cool casual and completely in control with the staggering view of the city behind him he was listening with polite interest to something one of the six people all sobersuited and seated said to him but his gaze shifted to the door as it burst open and eve had the pleasure of seeing surprise flash into his eyes he recovered instantly ladies gentlemen with lazy grace he straightened my wife lieutenant dallas eve the representatives attorneys and financial advisers of green space agricultural port you know caro my admin yeah hi hows it going we have to talk excuse me a moment he walked to the door took her arm firmly and pulled her through im sorry sir loreen began nearly stuttering i couldnt stop her dont worry about it loreen no one can its all right go back to your desk yes sir thank you with obvious relief loreen fled with the singleminded intensity of a woman fleeing a burning building this isnt a convenient time eve then youll have to settle for an inconvenient time because i have things to say and im saying them now she peered past him want me to say them in front of the representatives attorneys and financial backers of green space agriculture port and your trusty admin caro he didnt care for her mood or the position she put him in and his hand stayed a not particularly subtle warning on her arm well talk at home we havent been doing a lot of that lately i say we talk now she lifted her chin a not particularly subtle challenge and if you think you can call security and have them change my mind ill haul you downtown on some trumpedup charge in fact i like the idea of that im making time she said quietly now you make it he studied her face if hed seen only temper hed had met it with his own or dismissed it but he saw something more give me ten minutes caro when his hand ran down eves arm like a caress she felt the clutch in the gut that came with relief would you show my wife to conference room c please of course this way lieutenant shall i get you some coffee i got an offer of a pastry with that before when i scared loreen caros smile remained polite as she steered eve through the corridors but her eyes twinkled with humor ill make good on that offer im sure youll be quite comfortable in here she opened one of a pair of double doors and escorted eve into a pretty almost homey room with two cozy seating areas a gleaming wood bar and a spectacular and lofty view of the city doesnt look like any conference room ive ever seen amazing really how much business can be done in comfortable surroundings what kind of pastry would you like lieutenant hmm oh i dont know whatever are you allowed to tell me what that meeting was about certainly placidly caro programmed the autochef behind the bar green space is floundering though they claim otherwise their costs of maintaining the space port have steadily overrun their profits for the past three years their production level is down though the quality of their produce remains very high transportation costs in particular are taking an enormous bite and causing their overhead to soar she removed a china cup and saucer steaming with coffee and a pretty matching plate with a selection of flaky pastries so is he making them a deal on transpo quite possibly i imagine hell have done so and have a controlling interest in the port with his handselected team assigned to restructure green space from the ground up so to speak before he joins you caro do they want to sell him controlling interest they didnt she set the tray on a table they will before its done is there anything else i can get you lieutenant no thanks does he always win caros smile didnt shift by a single degree she didnt even blink of course just ring loreen if you need anything she walked to the door then turned back her smile waning a little you surprised him lieutenant thats not easy to do yeah well eve muttered when caro quietly closed the door you aint seen nothing yet she was revved edgy and didnt have any interest in the damn pastries but she ate one anyway decided the sugar rush could only help and started on another she was licking flakes from her thumb when roarke walked in he aimed those eyes at her closed the door at his back pissed she thought not just surprised but seriously pissed good when you were dealing with the richest and potentially the most deadly man in the world you needed every advantage you could get im pressed for time so lets save some he began if youre here for an apology regarding last night you wont get it now is there something else you need to discuss with me ive people waiting for me thats how he worked it she mused all those deals all those wheels draw your line in cold cold sand then intimidate he was good at it but there were any number of cons doing time who could have vouched that eve dallas was a bitch in interview well get to that but since im pressed for time myself lets start right at the beginning and move along going to see ricker was my job and im not apologizing for that he inclined his head thats one each okay i dont know if id have told you about it or not probably not if i thought i could skate by it and i didnt intend to tell you about him sending his hammers after me because i dealt with it he could feel temper fighting to get out of his belly and into his throat but said nothing he merely walked to the bar and got himself a cup of coffee i have no dispute over your job lieutenant but the fact is ricker and i were connected you knew that going in we discussed it thats right thats right exactly and we discussed the fact that i would set up a meet you didnt indicate youd move on that intention immediately without preparation i dont have to indicate anything when it comes to my work i just have to do the job and i was prepared i knew after five minutes with him that his fondest wish was to get to you using me to do that wasnt going to be an option i tossed in his lap he studied the pretty pattern on his china cup even as he fantasized about hurling it against the wall im quite able to take care of myself yeah well me too so what did you tell me about your plans to corner the market on broccoli he shot her a look of mild interest excuse me oh she hated when he used that formal adulttoidiotchild tone on her and he knew it this deal with the green space people did you bring me in on it why would i have you developed a stirring interest in fresh produce its a big deal taking them over its what you do you didnt consult me about it i dont have to consult you about what i do its an entirely different matter i dont see it that way the representatives of green space arent likely to put out a contract on my life the way you work they may want to but yeah thats a point on the other hand dealing with the criminal element is part of the package with me you married a cop live with it i do this is different its my head he wants taking yours would simply be a bonus oh i got that i got that as soon as i saw the flowers why do you think i panicked she strode over slapped her hands on the bar okay i panicked and i dont like knowing it when i read the card i was annoyed and then it hit me hit hard what you might do what he was hoping youd do and all i could think was to get rid of them to make them go away so you wouldnt see them or know about them maybe i wasnt thinking at all but just reacting i was afraid for you why isnt that allowed he had no answer for that and setting the coffee aside struggled to put his own thoughts in order you lied to me i know it and i said i was sorry but id do it again i wouldnt be able to stop myself i dont care if it put your dick in a twist he stared at her now torn between annoyance and amusement do you really think this is about my ego youre a man arent you i have it on good authority that what i did put a big dent in your ego which is the same as a kick in the groin to a man and who he said with deceptive sweetness is this authority i talked to mavis she caught the glint in his eye and narrowed her own she made sense and so did mira i had a right to talk to somebody since you were freezing me out he had to take a minute had to walk it off he paced to the window stared out until reason could make its way through the haze of temper all right you had every right and every reason to talk to friends but whether or not some of my reaction had to do with ego isnt the sticking point eve you didnt trust me youre wrong and if the kick to his ego had made him believe that she had to fix it altogether wrong ive never trusted anyone the way i trust you dont turn away from me again damn it dont do that i was afraid she said when he turned back to her i dont deal well with fear i dont let it in but it snuck up on me i wasnt wrong and neither were you we were just right on different levels thats an amazing and accurate analysis one id nearly reached myself before i happened upon that little scene last night he walked to her then until they were facetoface do you expect me to take two kicks in the groin eve then just sit meekly like a puppy when ordered another time she might have laughed at that image the man in front of her would never be meek he would do as he pleased when he pleased and hang the consequences that was about work he took her chin in his hand fingers strong and firm dont insult me it started out that way i dont know how it got where it did webster had information confidential the kind that could get his ass burned for passing it to me we were going around about it arguing then i dont know what the hell got into him no roarke murmured not particularly surprised i see you dont she was refreshingly sometimes frustratingly oblivious to her own appeal he caught me off balance she continued but idve dealt with it next thing i know there you are and the two of you are like a couple of rabid dogs fighting over a bone talk about insulting you pulled your weapon on me he couldnt get over that one wasnt sure he ever would thats right she shoved his hand away from her chin you think im stupid enough to jump physically between two crazy men trying to break each others faces i had it on stun oh well then what am i whining about you had it on stun he had to laugh christ eve i wouldnt have used it on you probably and if i had idve been really sorry she tried a smile thought she saw the hint of one in return it made her decide to give him the rest of it then you were standing there sweaty and messed up and mad as hell and so fucking sexy i wanted to jump you bite you right there she said tracing a finger on the side of his neck it wasnt a reaction i was expecting before i could work it out you had me against the wall slugging you seemed like the less enjoyable of the two options why werent you there this morning why have you only touched me twice since ive been here i said i wouldnt apologize for what happened between us last night i wont i cant still still he repeated and touched her now just a brush of his fingers on the ends of her hair i took your choice away if not physically he said before she could argue then emotionally i meant to its given me some bad moments since some concern that it might have reminded you of your childhood my childhood she could have no idea what her confused expression did to him how it cooled and smoothed every hot and ragged edge inside him your father eve now confusion turned to shock no how could you think that i wanted you you knew i wanted you theres nothing between us that would make me it stirred hideous images to think of it but she faced them there was no love there no passion not even need he raped me because he could he raped a child his own child because he was a monster he cant hurt me when im with you dont let him hurt you i wont say im sorry he lifted his hand skimmed his fingers over her cheek i wouldnt mean it but i will say i love you ive never meant anything more he drew her into his arms she pressed her face to his shoulder and held on ive been so messed up so have i he brushed his lips over her hair felt his world balance again ive missed you eve i wont let the job screw this up it doesnt we manage that on our own he drew her back touched his lips gently to hers but it keeps things lively doesnt it she sighed stepped back its gone what is ive had this lowgrade headache for a couple of days its gone i guess you were my headache darling thats so sweet yeah im sugar did i queer this green space deal for you well now whats a few hundred million in the grand scheme of things hed have played with that awhile but she looked so appalled just kidding its fine glad you found your sense of humor anyway ive got a lot going on maybe unless you want to talk more about that broccoli we could go into it later i think weve said all there is to say about broccoli already good you know even though were all mushy again its hard to say this but i could use some help your kind of help on this case why lieutenant youve made my day i thought it would though it doesnt do a lot for mine her communicator sounded she pulled it out listened to whitneys aide order her immediately to the towers acknowledged theres the bell for the next round she told roarke my moneys on you sos mine she rose on her toes kissed him hard before she broke away to stride to the door by the way ace you owe me a new lamp o o she was revved and ready to do battle when she entered the tower chief tibble ruled here with a steady if an occasionally ruthless hand a great many cops feared him eve respected him lieutenant dallas he wasnt behind his desk but stood in front of it the style the positioning made her think of roarke standing put him in control of the people who sat in the room and of the situation that brought them there at his signal she took a seat between whitney and captain bayliss from iab captain roth sat rigidly on the other side of bayliss feeney lounged or appeared to lounge on roths far side well begin with information that has come to my attention regarding an internal investigation centering most specifically on the illegals division of the one hundred and twentyeighth precinct chief tibble i wish to state my objection that such an investigation was initiated and proceeded without my knowledge so noted he said nodding at roth however it is within the authority of the iab to conduct such an investigation without informing the squad captain however he continued shifting his hard gaze to bayliss neglecting to inform the commander and myself of the operation exceeds that authority sir bayliss started to get to his feet but tibble gestured him down good move eve mused keep the little rodent in his place bayliss kept his seat but a faint wash of color stained his cheeks the internal affairs bureau is allowed some leeway on technical procedure when it deems an investigation warrants secrecy after consideration of the information the suspicion of certain leaks and confirmation of others it was agreed that this operation be held within the confines of iab and its chosen officers i see tibble leaned back against his desk in a way that forced eve to bite back a small satisfied smile and may i ask captain who made this agreement it was discussed between myself and several highranking members of my division i see you decided among yourselves to disregard the chain of command yes sir he said it stiffly stubbornly we had reason to believe that the leaks reached up that chain by informing other departments we would compromise that investigation before it began then am i given to understand that commander whitney is under suspicion in your division no sir perhaps i am part of your internal investigation bayliss opened his mouth wisely closed it again to give his brain time to engage sir you are under no suspicion any longer tibble finished silkily thats a comfort captain and having established that neither myself nor the commander were suspected of infractions or crimes that warrant iab action you still neglected to inform either of us of this investigation witch hunt roth said under her breath and earned a glare from bayliss it seemed unnecessary to do so sir until the operation was satisfactorily completed shall i explain to you captain why you are mistaken bayliss bore up under the penetrating stare no sir i regret the oversight and as ordered chief tibble all records all documents all notes on said operation are now in your possession including i presume all data pertaining to the homicide investigations currently under the hand of lieutenant dallas stubbornness set like concrete on baylisss face it is my opinion that the two matters do not connect really do you have an opinion on that lieutenant dallas yes sir my opinion is that captain bayliss has made another error in judgment two police officers both from the one twoeight have been murdered in under a week by the same hand i believe that one lieutenant mills was under iab investigation and will prove to be guilty of accepting bribes tampering with evidence and conspiring to undermine a criminal case detective kohli an iab plant agreed to pose as an nypsd officer who was also taking while this portion of the operation is acceptable the investigation into his death was compromised and tampered with by the withholding of kohlis status there is no precedent that im aware of that gives iab the authority to compromise a homicide investigation in order to protect one of its own operations i am also unaware of such a precedent captain our operation was at a delicate point he was beginning to ruffle badly and swerved in his chair to scowl at eve look kohli went into this eyes open nobody pressured him he wanted the extra duty and the extra pay we had no reason to believe his life was in danger and every reason to believe that he would in his position at purgatory connect with ricker she wanted to ask what ricker had to do with purgatory but she didnt dare not here and now and when he was dead captain we couldnt change that but we felt if we maintained kohlis cover let it leak to the primary that he was dirty it would open opportunities to uncover other leaks in the one twentyeight you used one of my men roth shot out do you think ive got the only squad with a mills cops on the take arent the exclusive property of my house youve got more than your share of them i was given false information eve cut in thats a violation of code above that above it beyond it over it and under it trying to push the investigation of a murdered fellow cop into a dead end using that dead cop as a blind is contemptible as far as im concerned kohli died in the line of duty he damn well deserved respect lieutenant whitney muttered but without heat enough no sir its a long way from enough when she got to her feet tibble said nothing iab has a purpose because a wrong cop smears all of us but when some tin desk soldier takes on his own agenda using his position to order those under his authority to circumvent procedure tries to twist a homicide investigation for his own purposes hes as dirty as the cops he purports to hunt youre over the line bayliss surged to his feet you think you can point the finger at me ive spent fifteen years keeping the department clean youre not lily white lieutenant your husbands link to ricker may be buried but it can be dug up you shouldnt be on this case you will back away from my officer whitney said quietly he held up a hand to waylay feeney whod come out of his chair and was moving toward bayliss and you will cease and desist any comments on her personal life or her professional abilities if i were to indulge myself in personal snipes i would say with pleasure that you can only aspire to achieve half the integrity lieutenant dallas has but i wont so indulge chief tibble id like to make a statement tibble spread his hands commander after reviewing the documentation belatedly provided by internal affairs it is my opinion that captain bayliss seriously overstepped his authority and should face disciplinary action further while said data is being analyzed and confirmed and until the decision is made whether to continue or abort the internal investigation its my recommendation that captain bayliss take a leave of absence there are cops feeding ricker bayliss objected im on the point of breaking that network open be that as it may captain there can be no law without order tibble watched him particularly with those of us who have sworn to uphold that law youll take leave with pay and without the suspension of benefits disciplinary action will be considered you are advised to consult your union rep and or your private attorney you are dismissed chief tibble dismissed captain believe me when i tell you you dont want me to indulge myself in personal comments at this time bayliss set his teeth turned on his heel his eyes burned over eve before he strode from the room captain roth sir if i might speak she got quickly to her feet i request that the documentation on the investigation into my squad be made available to me my men are under suspicion my house under the gun captain roth your house is a mess request denied you have until noon tomorrow to write a full report and a complete analysis of the status of your squad im making your house my personal business and will expect you in this office with that report and analysis at noon yes sir chief tibble yes captain i accept full responsibility for that status mills was under my hand and i cant claim to have held that hand steady if after this situation is resolved you wish for my resignation lets not jump our fences captain noon tomorrow yes sir when she left tibble once again leaned on his desk now lieutenant just how deep into this mess are you and who is your informant you are required to give me that name when ordered to do so consider this such an order sir i am hip deep and regret i am unable to follow orders and divulge the name of my informant tibble shot a look at whitney i owe you fifty it seems your commander bet me and i was foolish enough to accept that youd hold the name its come to my attention you did a deep search on captain roth yes sir i initiated the search as part of my investigation into the homicides of kohli and mills its my belief they were killed by one of our own so i gather thats a very serious avenue to walk yes sir you suspect roth she captains the squad it would have been negligent not to consider her ive questioned her analyzed her data and run a probability and the result in the sixties low but troubling i wont take up your time or mine by asking you to go through the steps of your investigation at this time he qualified but i will ask you lieutenant if your husband is connected to max ricker on a personal level or a business one and if that connection should concern this office my husband is not connected to max ricker on a business level it is my understanding that at one time over a decade ago there may have been some business between them and on a personal level this was tougher it was my impression sir during my interview with ricker that he held a personal grudge against roarke he did not specify this but intimated roarke is a successful man and a glamorized one she said for lack of a better term such status invites resentment and envy in certain types of individuals however i see no reason why a potential grudge held by ricker for roarke should concern this office youre honest dallas carefully so almost politically so and my saying that i see insults you somewhat eve managed do you have any conflict of feeling or loyalty in pursuing a killer who may be a fellow officer even though the victims were dirty or perceived to be so none whatsoever law and order chief tibble we uphold the law we are not allowed to nor are we equipped to judge and sentence good answer she does you credit jack lieutenant he continued while she dealt with the sheer surprise of his comment youll report your findings to your commander and keep him closely apprised of your progress go to work yes sir thank you one last thing he said as she reached the door bayliss would like your skin on a rack roasted yes sir im aware of that he wouldnt be the first when the door closed tibble went behind his desk its a fucking mess jack lets pick up some shovels and start cleaning it up chapter fourteen nice job dallas feeney rode down with her to lobby level now im going to tell you what they didnt if bayliss gets back behind his desk hes going to be gunning for you i cant let a rat turd like bayliss worry me i got two cops and one witness in the morgue until i work through the layers of that bayliss can blow all the hot air he wants enough hot air blows at you you get scalded just watch your back im going over to your place switch off with mcnab for awhile ill meet you back there i want to swing by kohlis have another talk with the widow ill pull peabody you know an illegals detective jeremy vernon lips pursed feeney ran through his head files nope doesnt ring for me hes got an attitude and a fat bank account im probably going to pull him in for a chat tomorrow latest you want in on that i always like sitting in on one of your chats they separated with eve moving through the latelunch pedestrian traffic to her vehicle she waited for a maxibus to clear contacting peabody as she pulled away from the curb im on my way to kohlis meet me there i want a followup with the widow ill head out now dallas mcnabs picked up three more accounts for detective vernon weve got a total of two million six and still counting isnt that interesting look feeneys on his way over there i want mcnab to pick his way through vernons financials make certain the son of a bitch didnt win some lottery or inherit a bundle from one of those dead relatives pin down his income and his outlay i dont want to give him any wiggle room when i pull him in yes sir ill report to the kohli residence as soon as our citys marvelous public transportation system will get me there take a cab put it on expense account do i have one jesus peabody put it on mine get moving she cut transmission and let her mind wander through the tiers of her case while she cut across town there was a corruption problem in the one twoeight in the illegals division and potentially elsewhere the corruption pointed at max ricker and two of the detectives on the task force formed to take him down were dead one of them had been in rickers pocket iab had conducted an unauthorized and clandestine operation involving the other of those detectives as a plant in purgatory she reminded herself roarkes place what did ricker have to do with roarkes club had bayliss been fishing there trying to dig up the old connection the man struck her as a fanatic but that was reaching still iab had sent webster an old connection of hers to feed her misinformation on kohli the captain of the squad had either let her men get beyond her control or was part of the corruption she had a problem or she was one either way eve had a ranking officer on her short list of murder suspects ricker was a key maybe the key hed lured the cops and most certainly knew which members of the department were on his payroll his businesses she imagined depended heavily on them if she found enough of them pulled them out of the loop would he come out come after her as much as shed enjoy that and emptying the dirty cops out of his pocket those were secondlevel goals her first was to flush those cops in order to find a killer avenging a loss or betrayal mira had said not revenge avenge and the difference was in eves mind another key scouring off the badge with blood to purify it a fanatic she wondered on a parallel line with bayliss one who tossed the rules aside when it suited his agenda she scouted out a parking place pleased to find one on street level less than half a block from the kohli residence even as she pulled in a car rolled up beside her distracted she glanced over as the doors of the blocking car swung open her instincts kicked in she was out of her vehicle on a forward roll and came up with her weapon drawn there were four of them and she saw with one sweeping glance they were better and more heavily armed than the ones ricker had sent after her the first time no point in making a fuss here lieutenant the man on the far left spoke politely and held his longnosed laser pistol just under the open flap of a natty spring topcoat out of the corner of her eye eve saw the one on the far right begin to circle she considered trying for a stunsweep her finger all but quivered on the trigger and a boy of about ten zipped behind the group of men on a dented street bike one of them plucked him off the bike skidded down the street and while the boy yelped the man nudged his stunner against the young throat at the pulse him or you it was said almost offhandedly and it enraged her let him go deliberately she clicked the power up on her weapon the boys eyes were wide and terrified he made sounds like a small cat being choked she couldnt risk looking at him get in the car lieutenant quietly and quickly before innocent civilians are injured she had a choice to make and made it fast the weapon seemed to leap in her hand as she fired it struck the man holding the boy between the eyes she saw the kid fall heard with sweet relief his screams of terror and diving for cover fired again she rolled under the car grabbed the boy by the foot and scraped off a few layers of his skin when she dragged him under stay shut up even as she rolled again to block his body with hers and come out on the other side she heard the whine of another weapon drop it drop it fucker or whats left of your brainsll be leaking out of your ears webster she thought then came out from under the car like a lightning bolt hit her target midbody with a full tackle and sent him crashing to the street she lifted his head bounced it smartly off the pavement then looked up to see that webster had the only remaining problem standing unarmed with his hands lifted you trailing me again webster i needed to talk to you she got to her feet winced a little and glanced down to see a long nasty gash in her knee you sure run off at the mouth a lot lately you got that one yeah he smiled a little at the sound of sirens theres the backup i took the liberty of calling for some she limped over picked up weapons scanning the three unconscious men then she went back crouched and peered under the car the kid had shut up she gave him that and big fat tears ran down his freckled face come on out its okay i want my mom cant blame you come on he crabwalked out swiped his hand under his nose i wanna go home okay in a minute you hurt much no his lip trembled did i wreck my bike i dont know well get somebody to look at it for you im not supposed to ride in the street my mom said yeah well next time listen to your mother she gestured to a uniform the minute the black and white pulled up send somebody after the kids bike give your name to this policeman she told the boy hes going to take you home if your mom wants to talk to me she dug in her pockets mildly surprised when she discovered shed remembered her cards tell her to call me at this number kay he sniffed again studying her with more interest than fear now are you a policeman too yeah she pulled her restraints out of her back pocket im a policeman too she rolled the first man over checked for a pulse lifted one of his eyelids she wasnt going to need restraints for this one you couldnt risk a stun webster said from behind her you had to take a kill shot to insure the safety of the civilian i know what i had to do she said bitterly youd been slower less accurate or if youd lowered your weapon that kid wouldnt be going home to his mother i know that too thanks for the help here he nodded then stood back and waited while she organized the scene and had one of the uniforms disperse the small crowd that had gathered the mts rolled up and right behind them a cab he saw peabody leap out rush to her lieutenant to his surprise she shook her head when eve gestured her aside what appeared from his viewpoint to be a short snarly argument took place in the end eve threw up her hands then hobbled over to one of the mts to have her leg treated amused he wandered up to peabody howd you manage that she was surprised to see him and it showed but she shrugged i threatened her with roarke what do you mean reminded her that if she went home without having that gash seen to hed be pissed treat it himself and pour a pain blocker into her she hates that so he handles her they handle each other it works for them i noticed will you give me a minute with her its not up to me but peabody walked away to oversee the transportation of the suspects webster strode over to the medivan crouched down and studied the gash being treated not so bad but those pants will never be the same its a scratch got grit in it the mt stated got grit in it she mimicked and scowled at him as he closed the cut i hate you guys oh we know my partner paid me twenty so id treat you instead of him he finished the job while she sat and stewed then stepped back there now want a lollitape because her lips quivered she didnt risk cursing him but simply got to her feet easiest twenty you ever made pal she walked away still limping a little and webster fell into step beside her now that weve had our little party can i have a minute ive got a followup to do then ive got to go in and hammer these guys write a report she sighed what do you want to apologize okay accepted but before she could walk away he took her arm webster just a minute cautiously he removed his hand put both in his pockets i was way over the line last night and im sorry for it i put you in a bad spot i was pissed at myself a lot more than you but it gave me an excuse to okay truth goddamn it i never got over you he could probably have given her a quick roundhouse kick in the face and shocked her less what what was to get over well ouch that should have my ego limping for the next couple of weeks lets just say i got hung up its not like i thought about you every waking minute for the past few years but there were moments and when that shit came down on you last winter and we had a few facetofaces it got stirred up again its my problem not yours she considered strained for something but her mind stayed blank i dont know what im supposed to say nothing i just wanted to clear it up get it out of my gut roarke has every right to kick my teeth in experimentally webster ran his tongue around them now which he damn near did anyway he tried a shrug id like to set that aside if its just the same to you yeah lets do that ive got to one more thing while im clearing my conscience i was following orders when i came to you on kohli i didnt like doing it i know you had a meet at the tower with bayliss your captains an asshole yeah yeah he is he sucked in a breath look i went into iab because i wanted to do good work because i believed in keeping a clean house im not going to give you a song and dance on abuse of power but good because i could sing a hell of a tune about your captain i know it i didnt come to you last night just because i was hung up on you this operation the direction its taken has stuck in my craw bayliss says look at the big picture but if you dont see the details what the hells the point he looked back as the medivans and their police escort headed out im adding up the details dallas and theyre making a whole new pattern youre going after a cop killer and its going to swing you right into rickers face tell me something i dont know okay i will he looked back at her i want in forget it if you dont think you can trust me youre wrong and if you think ill give you any personal grief youre wrong there too im not worried about personal grief even if i wanted you in i dont have the authority to sanction it youre primary you pick your team she stepped back hooked her thumbs in her front pocket and measured him with a deliberately insulting upanddown glance whens the last time youve been on the street webster awhile but its like sex you dont forget the moves i just saved your ass didnt i i was saving my own thanks why the hell should i bring you in ive got information i can get more it may be my last duty in iab im thinking about transferring out maybe putting back in for homicide or violent crimes im a good cop dallas we worked together before we did all right give me a shot i could use some redemption there were a dozen reasons to refuse but there were one or two offsetting those ill think about it good enough you know how to reach me he walked away then turned walking backward as he grinned at her dont forget i share the collar for these assholes she stood frowning after him trying to figure the angles were cleaned up here lieutenant peabody curiosity burning walked up to her the uniforms are taking the single subject who was still standing into booking weapons are confiscated the dead guys on his way to the morgue the other two en route to the hospital under guard i have the name and address of the little boy should i notify child services so a rep can be present while you take his statement hold off on that lets have a female uniform take his statement later today since maximum force was used its better cleaner if i dont take it myself ill write it up when i get back and report to whitney after i talk to the scum whos still standing lets go on and do what we came for hows the leg its fine because peabody was eyeing her she made a concerted effort not to limp sure was handy webster was around huh yeah handy lets leave it at that for now youre the boss try to remember that next time eve said with some heat as they entered kohlis building and dont nag me about medical treatment in front of a bunch of uniforms and gawking civilians got the job done peabody thought but she was wise enough to button her lip a woman eve didnt recognize opened the door of the kohli apartment yes lieutenant dallas nypsd eve held her badge to eye level id like to speak with mrs kohli shes indisposed im sorry to disturb her at this difficult time but im in charge of her husbands case i need to ask mrs kohli some questions that may aid in my investigation who is it carla patsy came to the door peered out its you she wrenched open the door while the other woman made helpless soothing noises how dare you come here how dare you show your face in my house patsy come on now patsy you should go lie down go away the woman said to eve just go away no no let her in i have things to say as eve stepped in sergeant clooney hurried to the group by the door patsy you have to stay calm im supposed to stay calm when im burying my husband tomorrow and this woman is trying to smear him to ruin his reputation everything he worked for there were no tears but there was fury eve preferred it mrs kohli youre mistaken you think i havent heard you think i dont know she sneered as eves glance shifted to clooney no not from him he says youre doing your job but i know what youre doing patsy clooney laid a hand on her back kept his voice low and calm you dont want to upset the children and there were plenty of them eve noted a couple of babies and one of those bigger babies who waddled around on shaky legs and made her nervous the young boy peabody had taken to the park on their first visit sat on the floor with a girl of about the same age their eyes were wide and focused on her she much preferred the four men with guns shed just dispatched carla with rigid control patsy turned to the woman eve now identified as her sister would you take the children to the park would you do that for me i dont like to leave you alone im all right just take the children theyve been cooped up too long eve stood where she was and watched what appeared to be a wellrehearsed if chaotic circus babies were packed into some sort of rolling cart where they wiggled and shook pudgy fists the one who could walk more or less tumbled onto his padded butt laughed uproariously and was hooked into a safety harness the older children were ordered to hold hands there was a short but desperate moment until the little boys jacket was discovered the noise level reached a dangerous peak then cut off abruptly when the entire contingent trailed out the door i will not ask you to sit down patsy said stiffly i will not offer you refreshment my husband was a good man her voice trembled nearly broke but she continued an honest man he would do nothing to shame his name or me or his children i know that mrs kohli eve said and stopped what promised to become a tirade in its tracks everything ive learned in my investigation of your husbands death confirms that he was a solid cop then how can you spread vicious lies about him how can you let people think his own coworkers believe he was taking money patsy before eve could speak clooney took the womans arm lieutenant dallas is doing her job just as taj did his job come sit down now i want answers but she went with clooney now let him guide her to a chair i deserve answers yes maam you do im only able at this time to tell you that ive learned detective kohli was working under cover and part of that cover involved the pretense that he was accepting illicit funds he was part of an operation formed to expose corruption in the department his death mrs kohli was in my opinion in the line of duty and that will be stated in my official findings i dont understand tears threatened as she lowered her face into her hands i dont understand any of this i cant explain it to you in detail at this time mrs kohli i intend to find your husbands killer you can help me i dont know how to help im sorry please sit down ill get coffee theres no need i have to settle myself she drew herself up i need a moment to think excuse me shes been holding up so well clooney muttered when patsy left the room almost too well for the children i imagine then this what this clooney eve didnt sit but turned her full attention on him what have you been telling her that her husband was a good man he shot back and that youre doing your job he paused held up a hand as he took the time to compose himself look i dont know where she got the information that you were heaping dirt on him she wont tell me all i know is i got a call from her a few hours ago she was close to hysterical he picked up a little toy truck from the cushions of the couch turned it over in his hand kids he said as if to give himself a moment to calm down as well you never know what youre going to sit on when youve got kids in the house what did she want from you sergeant reassurance thats all survivors want in the end and thats what ive tried to give id heard the talk around the squad the last day or two but didnt put much credence in it he paused another moment i dont know you so i didnt discount the talk either but its not my function here to stir up the survivors ive been working to calm her down since i got here fair enough can you think of any reason id decide to smear an honest cop i didnt even know no clooney sighed thats what ive been telling her thats what ive been telling myself what he thought it would be unwise to admit hed been telling his captain but youve stirred up a lot of bad feelings in the one twoeight its hard to ignore that patsy came back with a tray set it on the table taj would want me to try she said quietly hed want me to cooperate i didnt know about this operation he never told me i know about the money now the other accounts i i thought youd put it there you have a rich husband i was so angry now we both are eve sat i dont like being used to bring you pain or to damage the reputation of the man ive sworn to stand for who told you i put the money there no one told me exactly she looked tired again and embarrassed the heat of fury had burned away and left her empty and confused it was just one of the things some people were saying in the heat of the moment he had a lot of friends in his squad i didnt know he had so many theyve been so kind his captain came here herself to assure me that taj would have an official memorial did captain roth tell you i was going after your husbands reputation no no not really just that no matter what anyone said i could be proud of taj it meant a lot to me for her to say that to my face most of the squads come by to pay their respects and to offer to help in any way but someone contacted you today yes but he was only trying to help he only wanted me to know the squad was behind taj a hundred percent i didnt understand at first then he said that i shouldnt let any of the trash coming out of your office concern me it was all a setup he even backed off when he saw i didnt know anything but i pushed then he told me who told you i dont want him to get in trouble she clasped her hands together all but wrung them as she weighed confidentiality against justice for her husband jerry vernon detective vernon but he was only trying to help i see was he a close friend of your husbands i dont think so not particularly taj didnt socialize a great deal with his coworkers there were a few who came here to dinner and some whose wives i got together with now and then it would help me to know who his friends were oh all right she listed off a few names seemed to relax a little more as she spoke youre going to hurt my feelings patsy clooney said of course you art she took his hand seemed to anchor to it taj was friendly with my son clooney explained now and again they let the old man tag along for a beer on a boys night out for the most part taj was a homebody mrs kohli you told me taj called you that night told you he was meeting someone after hed finished at purgatory yes but he didnt tell me who and i didnt ask i guess i was getting a little tired of the long hours he was putting in i was a bit short with him at first but he brought me around he always could she said with a smile he promised it wouldnt be for too much longer that he was close to having what he needed i thought he meant the extra money for the new place we wanted then he told me to kiss the babies for him and he said i love you patsy it was the last thing he said to me it was like him for that to be the last thing chapter fifteen the assailant with the polite voice and the natty topcoat went by the name of elmore riggs a quick search proved that it had been the name hed been born with some thirtynine years before in vancouver canada there had been a small dispute with the canadian authorities over smuggling explosive devices across the border and elmore had done some time before hed been considered rehabilitated and had moved to new york his address was listed in a tidy moderately wealthy enclave north of the city and his profession was reported to be security consultant a fancy name for a hired hammer eve decided armed with this data she headed toward the interview level to link up with feeney and put elmore riggs through his paces vernon stepped in front of her when she reached the top of the glide a little out of your territory arent you detective you think you can shake me he gave her a body bump that had a number of the cops moving through the area pausing eve simply waved the hand she held at her side to keep them back i dont know jerry you look shaken everybody knows youre trying to throw trash at the squad iab sows what you are if you think you can dump on me like youre doing on kohli and mills think again ive contacted my union rep and were coming down on you gee vernon now youre scaring me not the union rep she gave a deliberate shudder you wont be so smart when youre hit with a lawsuit and i start bleeding that rich husband you hooked my god peabody a lawsuit i feel faint dont worry lieutenant ill catch you theyll take your badge vernon sneered like they did before only this time theyll keep it before im done youll wish you never heard my name we arent close to done and i already wish that jerry she grinned at him ive got you cold and when ricker gets wind of it when he starts worrying how im tracing those numbered accounts you set up back to him hes going to be very unhappy with you i dont think your union reps going to be much help where hes concerned you got nothing youre just trying to set me up i figure you want roths job over the one twoeight so youre messing us up so she gets the boot and you can sail in thats what she thinks too make sure you put that in your lawsuit how i pulled your name out of a hat and decided to dedicate myself to destroying you and your squad so i can sit behind a desk that ought to fly she shifted a little closer her eyes drilling into his only youd better start thinking how to cover yourself the money youve been taking isnt going to help much since im arranging to have those accounts frozen and while youre dealing with that remember im the only one coming at you who has even a marginal interest in keeping you breathing while im coming at your face rickers going to be at your back and theres a cop killer hunting dirty cops you wont know which direction hes coming from thats a rash of shit he lifted his fists she cocked her chin i wouldnt she said softly but you go right ahead im taking you down he stepped back clenched those fists at his sides youre finished he shoved past her hopped on the downward glide no but im getting there eve murmured lets put some men on him i dont want him rabbiting she rolled her shoulders you know what im in the mood for now kicking righteous ass sir got it in one lets go sweat riggs youre limping again i am not and shut up she limped damn it to interview a where feeney was waiting and popping nuts in his mouth what kept you just a little kissyface with a close personal friend did riggs lawyer nope made his phone call claimed it was to his wife i gotta say hes a cucumber and polite with it cool and well mannered thats our boy hes canadian oh i guess that explains it they walked in to where riggs sat patiently in a miserably uncomfortable chair good afternoon mr riggs eve said and moved to the table lieutenant nice to see you he glanced down at the rip in her pants a pity about those trousers they look so well on you yeah im pretty torn up about it record on she read in the information as she took her seat no lawyer riggs not at this time though thank you for asking you do then understand your rights and obligations in this matter perfectly first let me say im full of remorse for my actions clever she thought this was no moron are you absolutely i regret what happened today it was of course never my intention to cause any injury i see now how reckless and foolish it was to approach you in the manner i did id like to apologize thats really big of you how did it happen you were armed with banned weapons while traveling on a new york street with the intention of abducting and or assaulting a police officer i fell in with bad companions he said with a soft smile i have no excuse for having illegal weapons in my possession i would like to say however that in my line of work security consultation its often part of the routine to rub shoulders with criminal elements and to find oneself in possession of illegal weapons naturally i should have turned those weapons over to the proper authorities where did you acquire those weapons from the man you killed i was hired by him you see just this morning the dead guy hired you yes i was unaware of course that you were a police officer when i accepted the commission i was told that you were a dangerous individual who had threatened him and his family with bodily harm obviously i was deceived and im afraid i accepted his story and the weapons at face value very poor judgment on my part if you werent aware i was a police officer why did you call me lieutenant at the scene i have no recollection of having done so so you just took this job what was the name of the guy who hired you haggerty clarence haggerty or so he told me at the time imagine my shock when i discovered his purpose was not as he told me to frighten away by show of force a woman who was endangering his family im trying to do just that eve said mildly i guess having him grab some innocent kid and hold a stunner to his throat where it could cause permanent paralysis or death seemed like a fine way to frighten me it happened so fast i was shocked when he grabbed the boy im afraid my reaction was slow obviously haggerty or whoever he was was not the man i believed him to be anyone who would endanger a child in that manner he trailed off sadly shaking his head im quite glad you killed him lieutenant he smiled again i cant begin to tell you how glad i am im sure youre dancing she leaned forward do you really think this lame story is going to fly riggs why shouldnt it if you require any documentation to corroborate my brief employment by mr haggerty ill be happy to supply it i keep excellent records ill just bet you do this of course in no way negates my responsibility for what took place i will no doubt lose my security license i face a prison term or at the very least home incarceration im prepared to take my punishment as the law demands you work for max ricker im afraid i dont recall the name if a mr ricker has hired me as a consultant at any time it would be in my records ill be happy to sign an authorization so that you can search those records youre looking at twentyfive years riggs minimum i hope the courts wont be too harsh as i was unaware of the true purpose when i was hired and i certainly did nothing to harm that little boy i was duped he lifted his hands his face still placid but i stand prepared to accept the punishment due me you figure thats better than ending up like lewis im sorry do i know a lewis hes worm food and we both know ricker may cut his losses with you so you end up the same i just dont understand lieutenant im sorry lets run it through again in words of one syllable she worked him for more than an hour shifting over to feeney to change the pace coming back hard leading in soft riggs never broke a sweat never varied his story by an iota it was she thought like interrogating a goddamn droid with perfect programming get him out of here eve ordered in disgust then stalked out of the room this guy wont roll she said when feeney joined her ricker sent brains this time but riggs wasnt completely in control he didnt expect that creep to grab the kid so while hes got brains theres no saying the others do i want to double the guards on the two in the hospital get an update on their condition riggs gets a decent lawyer using that line holds to it wont even do five years i know it and so does he selfsatisfied son of a bitch lets get a run on the two in the hospital find a level ill take that we dont need the smoke now so id as soon work out of my office okay im going to go write this up then head home ive got some lines to tug on that end o o by the time she was finished it was well after shift she cut peabody loose then headed down to the garage her leg hurt which pissed her off her head throbbed which was only a minor annoyance but when she reached her parking level and saw the condition of her vehicle she was ready to spit rock goddamn it goddamn it shed had this unit one that actually worked for less than eight months it was ugly had already been wrecked once and repaired but it was hers and shed kept it in decent shape now the hood the trunk the doors on both sides were smashed in the tires slashed and the rear glass looked like it had been attacked by lasers and all she thought in a police garage with full security cams whoa baxter strolled up behind her i heard you had a little trouble earlier but didnt know youd wrecked your vehicle maintenance isnt going to be happy with you i didnt wreck it how the hell did somebody walk in here and beat the crap out of my ride she took another step toward it and baxter grabbed her arm lets just keep some distance call the bomb squad youve got a very temperamental enemy at the moment could be rigged youre right yeah youre right if it blows up theyll never issue me another one they hate me in requisitions o o it wasnt rigged and she managed to cop four new tires because baxter called down for them and sweettalked maintenance while they were being changed and two crabby maintenance men were doing something to the doors to make them open and close again she checked with garage security a blip she was told in the disc run whats the verdict baxter asked when she came back a blip fifteen minutes of snow and blocked audio this level only they didnt notice her eyes narrowed into tawny glints i guarantee theyll notice the next time you didnt have to hang baxter this may be your game dallas but we all want part of the ball you should take something for that leg youre limping i am not she sighed as she wrenched open her dented car door thanks dont i get a kiss goodbye sure honey come on over here he laughed backed away youll hit me you heading home yeah he wandered to his vehicle im heading uptown myself he said it casually and didnt fool her for a minute ill follow you up i dont need a babysitter im heading uptown he said and got in his car she wanted to be annoyed with him but couldnt quite pull it off on the drive she stayed alert watching for tails preparing for ambush other than her vehicle making ominous whining noises when she got over thirty miles an hour and thumping ones when she turned left the trip home was uneventful she waved baxter off at her gates figured shed raid roarkes liquor supply for a bottle of unblended scotch as payment for the favor she wanted a drink herself she thought as she walked up the front steps a nice cool glass of wine maybe a quick swim to work out the kinks she had a feeling it was going to be a long night i assume summerset began while the cat streaked between his legs to greet eve youve been involved in some sort of vehicular accident you assume incorrectly my unit was involved in some sort of vehicular accident she bent picked up galahad and found a little comfort by rubbing her cheek against his fur wheres roarke he is not yet home for the evening if you had consulted his schedule youd be aware he isnt expected for another hour those trousers are ruined people keep telling me that she set the cat down stripped off her jacket and tossed it over the newel post she walked past him intended to go down to the pool house youre limping she kept going but she did indulge herself in a single short scream o o the swim helped and once she was alone and naked she took a good look at the wound on her leg the mt had done a good job she had to admit it was healing up well even if it did ache like hell there were a number of scrapes and bruises to go along with it some of which she decided shed gotten during the jungle sex with roarke it didnt seem so bad when she backed those out of the mix feeling better she tugged on a robe and giving in to her knee took the elevator up to the bedroom and coming out nearly rapped straight into roarke on the point of going in hello lieutenant i was coming down to join you i took a long swim but i could sit and watch you take one if youre naked why dont we take one together later he drew her into the bedroom what happened to your car i cant prove it but my guess is ricker it was like that when i got down to the garage we seem to keep annoying each other she started toward her closet why are you limping she rolled her eyes but resisted banging her head against the wall i rapped my knee look i want to get dressed have a drink ill tell you about it she started to tug off the robe remembered the range of bruises and scrapes i ran into some trouble today took a roll on the street im a little banged up so dont go crazy on me ill try to retain my sanity his only reaction when she stripped was a sigh very colorful lie down no eve lie down so i dont have to knock you down ill treat them and itll be done she grabbed out a shirt listen ace i missed a very much desired asskicking round today i can substitute you for my intended target but when he took a step toward her she tossed down the shirt all right all right im not in the mood to fight but if youre going to play doctor i want a drink she stalked to the bed flopped onto her stomach and said in a tone she hoped would irritate him a little wine white and cold were here to serve he got the glass slipped a pain blocker into it knowing it would irritate her when she figured it out he retrieved the medication for her injuries set them down and flipped her over sit up and no whining i dont whine rarely he agreed but when you do you make up for the lack of quantity with quality she picked up the glass while he ran the healing wand over the worst of the bruises why dont you crawl up in here with me doc i intend to a bit later thats how i collect my fee shed finished half the glass before she noticed the effects what did you put in here she demanded you put a blocker in here when she started to set the glass aside he simply plucked it out of her hand gave her hair a yank to pull her head back and poured the rest down her throat she choked sputtered i hate that yes i know but i so enjoy it turn over kiss my ass darling i will once you turn over she had to laugh she rolled forced to admit at least to herself that the worst of the pain had eased better yet she decided with a sigh when that wonderful mouth of his brushed over her butt keep going she invited later i want these aches to settle down first i feel okay i want to make love with you eve he turned her over again gently this time leaned over her slowly thoroughly and for a very long time i want you to feel much better than okay before that happens im starting to feel really good she reached for him but he took her hands tugged her up tell me what happened well if youre not going to jump me im getting dressed the robe he held it out youll be more comfortable in something loose and itll be less for me to take off you later finding it hard to argue with his logic she put the robe back on then walked to the autochef you want something whatever youre havings fine she ordered pasta for two going for the spicy sauce she sat with him began to eat to fuel herself for the night to come and told him about her day he listened and the fact that he made no comments while she spoke had the nerves dancing at the base of her neck even when the delicate pasta began to taste like paste in her throat she continued to eat ive got some angles i want to play and it takes a load off knowing i have the full support of the chief of police it did my heart good to watch him skewer bayliss bloodlessly you have to admire that eve she met his eyes cold as winter blue as an iced ocean odd she thought how facing down four armed men only hours before had merely kicked her adrenaline into gear one look from roarke was a great deal more potent hes gone after you three times however much you dislike it disapprove of it i will deal with him two times she corrected the third was just my car and the scores been in my favor every time but she continued i anticipated your reaction its not going to do any good but im going to point out that given my job ive been gone after before and will be again this personal thing between the two of you shouldnt enter into it youre mistaken and his voice was terrifyingly mild but since it does i want you to work with me on this she could sense his underlying fury do you think you can placate me eve no hell no stop staring at me that way youre spoiling my appetite she tossed down her fork i could use your help i asked for it before this happened today didnt i all thats changed is he sent another goon squad after me and i took them down hes got to be royally burnt by that if we go at this from the same angle work together we can both get what we want well you wont get exactly what you want which is at my guess eating rickers liver after youve roasted it on a spit over a slow fire but we can get as close to that as the law allows the laws your yardstick not mine roarke she put a hand over his i can get him without you but it wouldnt be as quick and it sure as hell wouldnt be as satisfying you could get him without me maybe quicker and maybe more satisfying to you but think about this wouldnt you rather picture him living a long miserable life in a cage than just throwing the switch on him he considered it no youre a scary guy roarke a very scary guy but ill work with you on this lieutenant and ill contemplate depending on how that work goes settling for that image ill do that for you i promise you it costs me more than i can tell you i know that so thanks dont thank me until its done because if it doesnt work your way it will work mine what do you need she let out a breath first i need to know why iab sent kohli into purgatory what is there in the club or who is there they wanted bayliss said something today about rickers connection to it but you told me you severed business with him over ten years ago thats right i did taking some of his more lucrative accounts with me ive sold them off since or adjusted them as for purgatory he has no connection to it but he did i bought it from him five years ago or i should say he added when she gaped my representatives acquired it from his representatives he owned the place and you didnt tell me lieutenant i have to point out you didnt ask for gods sake she grumbled and got to her feet to pace to think and at the time your kohli was murdered i didnt think of it see a connection or consider it relevant its been mine for a number of years and has been completely overhauled remodeled and restaffed if he used it for a front it could be some of his people still come in do business none thats ever been reported to me if thats the case its very minor business a cop died there thats not minor point taken why did he sell it my research at the time indicated that it was becoming a little too warm he often dispenses of businesses and property when theyve outlived their usefulness to him its basic business practice if hes got this hardon for you why did he sell it to you he didnt know until after the fact i assume he was displeased but the deal was done he sat back doing some thinking himself possibly he put out word that there was outside business being done there or had some of his people come in to do some he may have hoped to take a swipe at me that way i can see that hed have waited until the club was well established until it was running smoothly then tried to disrupt it hes a patient man a few years wouldnt have been any time to wait and with his connections in the department hed have had a funnel for the rumors iab picked up on them started looking into it and put kohli in it plays and its looking more and more like the poor guy died for nothing youll fix that roarke got to his feet yeah ill fix it i want to look at some data data im not supposed to see without anyone knowing im looking he smiled now lieutenant i believe i can help you with that o o in his brilliantly lit lounging room in his expansive connecticut estate max ricker stomped viciously on the face of a house droid hed called marta she would never be the same canarde wisely kept his distance during this torrent of temper hed seen it before and it wasnt always a droid ricker broke to pieces when the rage was on him for a time the only sounds in the room were harsh ragged breathing and the distressing crunch of plastic and metal canarde had seen it before yes indeed but these lapses of control were getting much worse he began to think it would soon be time to put his carefully outlined escape plan into action and spend the rest of his days in the relative peace and elegance of the home hed purchased under a false name on the paradise colony but for now he was confident he could weather the storm one woman one single woman and they cant deal with her cant deal with her i promise you promise you they will be dealt with he kicked what was left of marias head out of his way the air stank with the stench of fried circuits calmer as he always was after an episode he walked to the bar filled a glass with his favored pink liquid that was sweetened rum with a heavy lacing of barbiturates one dead you say his voice was mild now as were his eyes as he glanced toward canarde he might have said two for dinner for all the inflection in the tone yes yawly ines and murdock are being treated for injuries riggs has been booked and has followed my instructions as to his story hell stick to it hes an intelligent man hes a fool like the rest of them i want them disposed of prepared for this directive canarde stepped forward that may be prudent with ines and murdock i believe however that if you act on riggs when he proves himself to be loyal it will seriously damage your organizations morale ricker sipped and his silver eyes slithered over canardes face why would you be under the impression im the least bit concerned with morale you should be canarde said knowing he risked a great deal by demonstrating goodwill even lenience to an employee under these circumstances as you showed instant discipline to lewis under different circumstances you send a clear message to those who work for you and he added riggs can always be handled after a period of time has passed ricker continued to drink continued to calm youre right of course youre right his smile was quick and almost terrifyingly brilliant thank you im afraid i let the matter of this annoying cop influence my better judgment some things are worth waiting for he thought of roarke hed waited there years now and hadnt he found just the right place to strike but it was harder to wait harder to see clearly when he could almost taste the blood assure mr riggs that his loyalty is appreciated and will be rewarded he started toward the windowwall saw the droid debris scattered over the floor for a moment he was blank for another simply puzzled then dismissing it from his mind he walked around it slid open the glass and stepped out on the deck overlooking his lawns i spent a lifetime building what i have and will one day pass it all to my son a man needs a legacy to pass on to his son he was mellowing now his tone turning dreamy but i have a number of goals to reach before that time comes and one i intend to achieve very soon is to crush roarke to have him on his knees i will accomplish that canarde make no mistake he sipped his bright drink and looked out over the grounds a man satisfied and still vital ill accomplish that he said again and have his cop begging for mercy chapter sixteen in the sealed room of roarkes private office the equipment was state of the art expansive and unregistered the wide searching eye of compuguard was blind to it nothing generated on it or scanned from it could be detected by any outside factor and in the hands of a man with roarkes talents there were no data that could not eventually be unearthed despite the fact that besides roarke only eve and summerset had ever been through the secured doors and the purpose of the area was business it was a handsome room with generous privacyscreened windows and a floor of beautiful tile shed often thought the glossy ushaped control deck resembled the bridge of a particularly welldesigned spacecraft and when he was behind those controls roarke was very much captain of the ship here she would bend the rules or let roarke bend them for her roth first eve began her story is her husbands been bleeding out her financial accounts setting up a nest egg for himself and his ontheside piece roth captain eileen her address is that isnt necessary he enjoyed this type of work nearly as much as he enjoyed the annoyed look on eves face when he easily danced through the blocks and obstacles even the brains and talents in edd couldnt budge he put the data on a wall screen rather than commanding the computer to read it off not a very impressive nest egg he commented but enough one supposes to set himself and his ontheside piece up cozily enough hes an unemployed writer some women are attracted to the struggling artist type all those pale byronic moods is that so eve said in a voice dry as dust indeed in my experience she isnt his first he added shooting more data to a second screen he has two marriages and three cohabitations under his belt and repeats this pattern of tapping into his partners financial resources toward the end of the run youd think shed be too smart for that kind of con christ shes a cop love roarke said is blind the hell it is i see you clear enough dont i his grin was quick and gorgeous why lieutenant youve made my heart flutter he grabbed her hand kissed her knuckles lavishly no funny stuff she slapped him aside an absent gesture that only made him smile again it was good he thought to be back in synch shes got two payments to a lucius breck eve noted three thousand a pop whos breck because she hadnt realized hed cued her into the system she nearly jumped when the computers polite voice answered breck lucius substance abuse counselor private practice office address sixth avenue new york city residence never mind that jibes with the story she gave me jesus shes close onto flat busted financially and still paying through the nose for private counseling when she could get it through departmental sources for nothing and shes going to lose anyway she wont keep her squad command when this all washes down and she thinks im bucking for her desk eve shook her head no thanks eve would wear captains bars one day but damn if theyd drag her off the street by them you cant find any other accounts linked to her i cant find whats not there roarke said reasonably as youve seen for yourself your captain roth is very nearly in financial ruin shes borrowed from her retirement account in order to pay brecks fee her living expenses are otherwise frugal so shes clean and her squads dirty which may go to motive she commanded both victims and had visited kohli at purgatory her probability scans still fairly low but that could change if i can add in her personality analysis from the department files and my own take on her and your take is shes hard got a mean temper and shes been so busy rising up the ladder shes been missing details shes covering up personal mistakes in a scramble to protect her position could be shes covered up more in her squad to keep her superiors from yanking her out a lot of temper went into that first murder like i said shes got a mean one she turned back to roarke vernon detective jeremy ive already got enough on him to haul him in after i let him sweat awhile what do you need from me i want to connect the money to ricker getting it this way i wont be able to use it as evidence but i can make him think i can i break vernon ive got new lines to tug hes connected to both victims and to roth and to ricker rickers going to be insulated thickly any funds he disperses in that manner would have been washed can you find it his brow winged up that is i assume a rhetorical question itll take time then why dont you get started can i use this subunit to check a few other names hold on he issued some commands she didnt understand keyed in something manually the computer acknowledged him and began a low hum itll sift through the initial layers on auto he explained as quickly as i could do it what are the other names she looked at him rue maclean if he was annoyed or surprised he didnt show it you suspect her she manages purgatory knows or should know what goes down there now you tell me ricker used to own the place and we know iab suspects or suspected a connection if hes doing any business there she shouldve known about it and she concluded you already thought of that i did a run on her yesterday deep search computer results of search on maclean rue on screen three you can study the data yourself he told eve i found nothing to alarm me overmuch but then again if shes playing with ricker shed be careful she knows me would she risk it i wouldnt have thought so eve scanned the financial first jesus roarke you pay her a goddamn mint which traditionally inspires loyalty she essentially runs the club she earns her salary youll see she enjoys the financial rewards and doesnt pinch her credits she took a vacation to saint barthelemy this winter rickers known to have a base near there he paused for a moment strolling over to pour himself a brandy i intend to ask her about that tomorrow just ask her thats right and ill know if shes lying eve studied his face cool hard ruthless yes he would know and god help maclean if she lied id rather you didnt ill ask her if shes connected in any way to ricker its a very tenuous connection to your case shes my employee and i deal with my own if you scare her off if she has reason to be frightened shell have nowhere to go then shell be yours to question do you have more names youre not cooperating on the contrary he spread his hands indicating the room and the busy equipment let me ask you a question lieutenant are you after a killer or max ricker im after a killer she snapped and since rickers hooked to it somewhere i intend to haul them both because hes connected to the case or once was to me both she shifted her stance an unconscious move into combat so what nothing unless when the time comes you intend to stand between us he studied his brandy but why borrow trouble names she didnt intend to borrow anything but she fully intended to get to ricker first webster lieutenant don the faintest smirk touched his mouth well now isnt that interesting what do you suspect him of being the killer or being a target at the moment neither which is the same as both he tailed me today maybe it was like he said to apologize for being an idiot or maybe that whole business was staged i want all the facts before i decide to trust him saying nothing roarke tapped keys and had data shooting onto a screen you already ran him did you think i wouldnt roarke said coolly webster appears to be as clean as the traditional whistle which using the standard you applied to roth puts him on your suspect list except for one thing she moved closer to the screen frowning over the data he knew about kohli helped set it all up why take out a straight cop going from evidence from my own instincts and from miras profile im looking for someone avenging themselves someone whos taking out cops who went wrong webster was one of the few who knew kohli hadnt so no im not looking at him for this not if hes clean and if he wasnt then maybe i couldve stretched it that he took kohli out because kohli was clean and knew webster wasnt what are these payments here steady outlay every month for the last two years to ladonna kirk hes got a sister divorced shes going to medical school hes helping her out hmmm could be a blind its legitimate i checked shes in the top ten percent of her class by the way he gambles occasionally roarke continued sipping his brandy small stakes typical entertainment gambling pattern he springs for season tickets for arena ball every year and has an affection for suits made by an overpriced and in my opinion woefully inferior designer he doesnt put much away for a rainy day but lives within his means which isnt difficult he makes twice as much as you do at the same rank id complain about that desk jockeys eve said with obvious disdain who can figure it you went awfully deep on him i prefer being thorough she decided under the circumstances to leave it at that he wants in i beg your pardon on the case roarke he wants me to let him in on the homicide investigation hes feeling used and abused at the way it was set up i believe him are you asking me my opinion relationships she thought darkly were so often a major pain in the ass im asking you if its going to cause any problems around here if i let him in if i said yes then he stays out hed be useful but i dont need him darling eve you neednt worry about he remembered her phrase and her tone when shed used it about my dick getting in a twist do what suits you this needs my attention he said as the computer signaled a pause do you have more names a few be my guest he gestured to the side unit then took his seat behind the console marriage eve thought as she took her seat was a puzzle she didnt think shed ever solve too many damn pieces and the shapes of them were constantly changing on her he seemed perfectly fine with the idea of her working with webster a man hed pounded on gleefully the night before but maybe he wasnt and this complacent agreement was just a ruse shed just have to worry about it later she got down to work at least that was something she understood she ran the names patsy kohli had given her her husbands cop friends detectives gaven and pierce and an officer goodman along with sergeant clooney on her first pass every one of them looked clean enough to glint gaven detective arnold had a nice pocketful of commendations and a solid number of closed cases he was tidily married had a fiveyearold daughter and was leadoff batter in the squads softball team pierce detective jon ran along a parallel route only he had a son age three goodman officer thomas was younger by two years and considered a shoein for a detectives shield he was recently married and a lay minister at his church religion she thought thirty pieces of silver clooney a twentysixyear vet had been attached to the one twoeight for the last twelve years hed partnered with roth at one time eve noted intrigued then roth had sprinted past him up the brass ladder that could piss a certain type of individual off he had a wife and though her residence listed was different than his there was no record of a legal separation or divorce his son thadeus had been killed in the line of duty while attempting to prevent a robbery walked in on in progress eve noted frowning according to witness reports hed drawn his weapon stepped in to shield one of the civilians and had been attacked from behind hed suffered numerous stab wounds and had been pronounced dead on the scene his assailants had cleaned out the store and escaped the case remained open thadeus clooney had left behind a wife and infant daughter suffered a loss she considered a big one could that turn a twentysixyear vet with a spotless record into a killer but why blame other cops for the loss last she ran bayliss captain boyd oh he was clean she thought as she read his data if you looked only at that slick surface churchgoer community volunteer chaired a couple of charitable organizations had his two kids in posh private schools married for eighteen years to a woman whod come to him with money and social status never worked the streets she mused even in uniform which hed shed quickly hed been assigned to a desk administration evidence management office aide a born drone but a smart one hed moved up then over into iab and there she thought hed found his calling interesting she noted that this last business wasnt his first official sanction hed been warned before about his methods but whatever his means hed dug the dirt the department had stepped nimbly aside with a frown perhaps but no serious block hed skirted the rules entrapment illegal tapping and surveillance his favored ploy was to set cop against cop cop against cop how big a leap was it from destroying a career to taking a life most interestingly she discovered that shortly after the ricker debacle bayliss had found himself under review and had earned another sanction for his attempt to discredit the sergeant in charge of the evidence area hed gone so far as to harass the mans wife and children to haul the sergeant into an iab interview room and keep him there without benefit of counsel or representation for over four hours the irs had received an anonymous tip and though it hadnt been traced to bayliss or his crew it had resulted in a full audit of the sergeants financials nothing suspicious had been found but the audit had cost the unlucky cop thousands of dollars in legal fees and lost time she would have to take a much closer look at bayliss and now at the beleaguered sergeant matt myers she wanted to go deeper but lacked the tech skill she glanced over at roarke but she knew from his intent and focused expression that he wouldnt welcome the interruption rather than humiliate herself with failure by attempting to access baylisss personal files she tried another route she contacted webster bayliss she said without preamble talk to me a fanatic disguised as a crusader a disguise i bought im sorry to say for a considerable amount of time dedicated to his particular mission charismatic along with it like some prophet preaching a new religion she sat back hummed really yeah gets you hyped which is what can pull you along before you realize youve just stepped kneedeep in a pile of shit on the other hand hes exposed corruption and moved a lot of dirty cops out of the system by any means necessary okay webster sighed rubbed the back of his neck thats true particularly over the last year his methods have been making me uneasy im pretty sure he has files extensive ones on every cop in the department not that he shares them with me he crosses over the line privacy and procedure wise i used to think it was justified what changed your mind sergeant myers he was officer of record on the ricker evidence that mysteriously vanished or became corrupted jesus bayliss hounded him to death he was convinced myers was in rickers pocket though there was no evidence overt or covert to substantiate it my take is he figured hed get myers off the job one way or the other but the guy stood up he just wouldnt break he wouldnt shake when the department cleared him he transferred to a house in queens bayliss never forgot it and hes been burning low over the slap on the wrist he took from the tower tibble rapped him thats the word right after the rap he started the operation with kohli maybe he figured hed vindicate himself and end up with a shine i dont know dallas hes a hard one to figure do you know if this myers is still alive and well in queens i never heard otherwise websters eyes widened christ dallas you dont think bayliss is out there killing cops it would get them off the job wouldnt it she countered one way or the other you said you wanted in webster did you mean it yeah yeah i meant it then heres your first assignment check out myers make sure he hasnt met with any recent accidents and if hes still breathing see if you can find out if hes been visiting our fair city he hadnt worked homicide for years but he picked up fast nodded hed have plenty of reason to resent dirty cops what angle are you working ive got plenty of them right now im going to get a warrant for baylisss personal files ill believe that when i see it he muttered when i do she continued coolly i want your help sorting through them ill be in touch she cut transmission then turned to see roarke watching her are you looking at bayliss for this theres dirty and theres dirty hes got grime under his manicure how much distance is there between deliberately ruining lives and taking them she shrugged webster can keep busy getting me some data on myers and well see where that goes i cant say bayliss is my first choice i dont think hes got the stomach for blood and weve still got kohli being clean but one way or the other hes a connection its a simple matter to access his personal files it would be for you ill get a warrant do it straight if im going to bring bayliss into interview and i am i want it straight and i want it clean then you may want to ask for another warrant while youre at it on vernon its already on my list she began then got slowly to her feet you followed the money i did indeed through a circuitous convoluted and tedious route back to max ricker unlimited that doesnt give you ricker personally passing funds from his hand to vernons but it does involve his corporation hes not as clever as he once was roarke murmured or as careful it should have taken me twice this long to trace it back to him maybe youre more clever than you once were she walked over to study the screen laying a hand on roarkes shoulder most of what she saw was a jumble of accounts names companies but one name in particular jumped out made her smile canarde am i reading this right hes attorney of record for northeast manufacturing a subsidiary of rickers main deal thats right and am i reading this one canarde authorized the electronic transfer of funds funneled through the main deal into northeast over into this other corporation up into the casino in vegas ii where vernon picked it up ostensibly as gambling winnings im so proud he took the hand on her shoulder pressed his lips to her palm thanks but youve diagramed it here so a moron could connect the dots i wanted a shot at that smug son of a bitch canarde now ive got one except i cant use it she said in disgust and paced away unless i can get vernon to roll shed get him to roll she promised herself then moving away from the control center so that her communicator screen would show nothing but the screened window she contacted her commander she wanted some brass knuckles roarke sat where he was watching her listening to her make her case clear he thought concise detailed and dispassionate he knew her like a book and could already see the steps she planned to take he wasnt the least surprised when she pressed whitney after he agreed to throw his weight into her request for a warrant in the morning sir i want to move on captain bayliss tonight lieutenant captain bayliss remains a ranking officer in the nypsd convincing a judge to grant an immediate warrant ordering him to submit to interrogation regarding two homicides is going to be tricky i realize that commander which is why i contacted you in the hopes that you will in turn contact chief tibble you want me to call tibble in on this certain information has come into my hands that leads me to believe chief tibble will be receptive to this request i cannot at this point in my investigation ascertain whether captain bayliss is a suspect or a target however i have no doubt he falls on one side of the line if hes a target quick action may save his life if he is a suspect that same action may save another dallas your personal feelings do not apply sir and have not influenced my current findings be damn sure of it whitney muttered ill contact the chief thank you commander at this time i request a second warrant for detective jeremy vernon of the one twoeight requiring him to report for a formal interview at nine hundred tomorrow morning regarding the same investigation christ it was his first and only exclamation youve been busy yes sir she said so coolly he let out a short laugh ill get the warrants lieutenant expect me and in all probability chief tibble in observation during these interviews lets take some care here were going to look like weve taken a page from iabs book understood ill await verification and receipt of the warrants well done roarke said quietly when she ended the transmission not close to done i have to go get dressed thanks for the help one moment he rose and walked to her he took her face in his hands and lowered his mouth taking hers in a kiss of quiet somehow desperate tenderness she felt it in her heart that answering flutter in her stomach that slow sliding drop her hands came up to settle at his waist roarke just be quiet a minute he changed the angle taking the kiss deeper a long lazy trip into glory her hands slid around him her arms wrapped to bring him close and she understood he was showing her offering her the other side of passion the sweetness of it and the promise when he drew back she found herself smiling even as her head spun i could probably spare one more minute come home soon this time he pressed his lips to her forehead and well take all the time we want good thinking she started for the door then with a half laugh turned back to look at him whenever you do that you know like you just did i always feel a little drunk after i kind of like it she watched his grin flash before she slipped out the door o o in just over an hour she was standing with peabody at another door bayliss lived in a stylish neighborhood in a stylish suburb of new york his home was a graceful if unimaginative twostory dwelling in a tidy forest of others like it lawns were rigorously mowed tastefully fenced and security lighted the house itself was dark and silent with a discreet plaque by the door warning that the premises was guarded by alarm dog security systems inc still when she rang the bell the summons was almost immediately answered by a polite request for identification police eve held up her badge i have a warrant youre required to open the door it was opened quickly by an attractive house droid in a simple gray maids uniform im sorry lieutenant neither captain nor mrs bayliss are at home this evening and where would they be mrs bayliss is in paris on a spring shopping trip with her sister she has been from home for three days i am unable to tell you where captain bayliss is this evening he is not at home this warrant allows me to enter the premises and ascertain that for myself yes lieutenant i am fully programmed on the law she stepped back but you will find the captain is not at home this evening eve stepped in has he been home today oh yes he arrived home at shortly after four oclock this afternoon he left approximately fiftyeight minutes later i do not expect him to return tonight and why is that the captain left with a suitcase wheres his room his bedroom on the second level first door to the left would you like me to escort you no eve bounded up the stairs shoved into the room swore hed been in a hurry she thought the closet door was open two drawers were open as well another clothes horse she muttered hard to say how much he took peabody find out where the wifes staying in paris hes got a weekend place vacation home whatever i think it was the hamptons get the address do you think hes gone under i think hes gone eve said sharply get the addresses hes got to have an office in this place im going to check it out she found his office on the first level and had already formed an opinion of baylisss lifestyle by the time she reached it the house was as cold and as organized as a computer everything in its place and shed noted he and his wife didnt share a bedroom or she assumed a bed as the bedroom down the hall from baylisss was an obvious feminine retreat complete with dressing area twolevel walkin closet and a sitting area that had contained a desk holding fancy writing paper with his wifes name at the top his office was ruthlessly organized as well and she saw immediately hed run through it quickly the desk chair was pushed back and a file box of discs stood with its cover not quite straight nerves she thought nerves that made him not quite so smart and not quite so careful this time what are you afraid of bayliss she pulled out her palmlink and using her badge and identification ran checks on transportation to paris though she found nothing under baylisss name she couldnt be sure he hadnt used an alias she walked to the door gave a shout to peabody who came on the run i have the information for you she ran it off good were going to stretch the warrant to its limit i want you to contact feeney that unit she said jerking her thumb back i want it gone over with microgoggles he took data with him but feeney will find whats on the machine while hes doing that i want you going over this house inch by inch yes sir where are you going she asked as eve strode out im going to the beach chapter seventeen eve checked the fit of her safety harness and resisted the urge the increasingly desperate urge to simply close her eyes im not really in that much of a hurry roarke cocked a brow in her direction while piloting the new air land sports streamer through a sky turning soft with evening thats not what you said when you asked me to get you there i didnt know you had some new toy you were dying to try out jesus she made the mistake of glancing down and saw the coastline and its complement of houses hotels and beachfront communities whiz by we dont have to be this high either were not that high if eve had one phobia it was heights to his way of thinking shed feel better as soon as they landed so why not open the als up and see what it could do high enough to crash she muttered and ordered herself to think of something anything else it would have taken her a great deal longer to make the trip to baylisss beach hideaway in her city unit particularly now that it was acting up even if shed used one of roarkes spiffy cars the distance couldnt have been covered so quickly by road the most logical solution was to draft him to fly her there logical she thought if she lived bayliss is up to something she said over the smooth roar of the alss engines he was in and out of his place too fast didnt reprogram his house droid and he took files youll be able to ask him what hes up to yourself in a few minutes testing the controls roarke took the sleek little streamer up another twenty feet executed a turn eve cut her eyes in his direction as he fiddled with controls manually then through voice command what are you doing just checking id say this babys ready for production what do you mean ready for this is just the prototype she felt the color drain out of her face actually felt it as in experimental with his dark hair whipping in the air blowing through his open window he tossed her a wide delighted grin not anymore were going down what she braced every cell in her body what on purpose darling if hed been by himself hed have taken the streamer into a dive to check the responses but in consideration of his wife he kept the descent slow and smooth targeting the road hovering over it switch to landing mode he ordered switch in mode confirmed flaps lowering retracting touching down touchdown confirmed switching to land drive there was barely a bump as the silver streamer set its wheels on the road and barely eve noted sourly a decrease of speed slow down hotshot this is a posted area were on official business when the weather warms up a bit more we can try this with the top down as far as eve was concerned hell wouldnt be warm enough to induce her to skim along in the fancy little twoseater without a roof but she looked at the dash map impressed that it not only had baylisss house targeted but that roarke had set down less than a mile from their destination logic she thought now that she was on solid ground again had its uses she could hear the water a steady rise and slap of sound to the east houses predominately of glass and recycled wood rose and spread each seeming to try to outdo the next with how many decks they could manage to jut out toward sand and sea the patches between them were manicured with sea oats sand roses and odd little sculptures that carried over the ocean theme lights twinkled here and there but for the most part the houses were dark this was where the rich and the privileged escaped from new york on weekends or during the long hot summer how come you dont have a place here actually i do have a string of properties that rent out but i never had a yen to stay in one too ordinary and obvious he smiled at her but if youd like one no its too much like a neighborhood or something youd come down to kick back and probably have to talk to people and have i dont know gettogethers and stuff hideous thought amused he turned off and pulled into the drive behind a hulking black sedan do we assume thats his car yeah she scoped out the house not so different from the others lining the coast big arches filled with glass that opened to decks and were loaded with enormous urns of enormous flowers or potted trees the structure was blond and gleaming in the half light and came to triple points on the third level where another deck ran in a ring pretty snazzy for a cop she commented but then hes got a rich spouse she glanced at roarke that kind of thing comes in handy so ive heard if hes in there hes in the dark i dont like it it had been her plan to convince roarke to wait in the car something shed assumed would take some doing now her gut told her to try a different plan they got out opposite sides and walked up a narrow boardwalk to the front door there were tall glass panels flanking it etched with stylized seashells through them she could scan the main living area with its soaring ceilings and pale walls instinctively she hitched her jacket back so her weapon would be more accessible and rang the bell youd think the place was empty wouldnt you except for the car he mightve taken a walk on the beach people tend to do that here she shook her head he wouldnt be in the mood to stroll through the surf she made the decision bent down and took her clinch piece from her ankle holster i need you to go around cover the back dont use this okay do not use this unless youre in immediate jeopardy i know the rules he slipped it in his pocket do you think bayliss is dangerous no no i dont but someone is im going up to the second level ill circle around left to right watch your back same goes they separated each confident the other could handle whatever came eve moved to the side up the open steps over the deck the doors here were clear sheets of glass and fully secured with their privacy shields lowered she started to the left moving slowly her eyes tracking the gleam at her feet had her pausing crouching water she mused someone had slopped water on the deck a path of it she noted as she straightened to follow the trail the sound of the sea rose a sly thrash and suck stars were beginning to come out adding faint light to a sky going indigo ears cocked she heard the footsteps mounting the steps to her right her fingers danced to her weapon it was in her hand when roarke rounded the building theres water on the steps he told her here too she lifted a hand signaled the side doors were open roarke nodded moved to the far side of them and she to the near their eyes met she took a breath held it they went through he took high she low take the right she ordered lights on when they appeared she adjusted her eyes to the change sidestepped left captain bayliss she called out this is lieutenant dallas i have a warrant i need you to make your location known her voice echoed off the high ceilings off the sandcolored walls bad feeling she muttered very bad feeling sweeping with her weapon she followed the tracking water she saw baylisss suitcase open on the bed a jacket tossed carelessly beside it she glanced toward roarke watched him check a roomsized closet did the same herself on the other side then moved along the wet to a door she signaled again waiting until hed joined her with her free hand she turned the knob then shoving it open went in under roarkes arm music blared it gave her a jolt to hear maviss voice screeching out into the opulent bathroom all white and gold the room almost hurt the eyes with its sheer white walls gilt pools of mirrors twin sinks large enough to bathe in under the music she heard the rumble of a motor she crossed the floor damp and gleaming white to the leg of the lshaped room the tub was waist high and white as the alps but for the wet river of blood that ran down the side just below a single hand red dripped onto the badge tossed on the floor damn it goddamn it she leaped to the tub and saw immediately it was far too late for the mts bayliss lay on the lounging level his head pillowed on a silver cushion his body strapped down with long ribbons of adhesive his eyes stared up at her wide and horrified and already filmed over with death glinting on the floor of the tub were credits she knew there would be thirty i wasnt fast enough somebody wanted him dead more than i wanted him alive roarke lifted a hand to the base of her neck rubbed once youll want your field kit yeah her assent was a sound of disgust whoever did this is gone but be careful anyway she reached for her communicator i have to contact the locals protocol then im calling it in meanwhile youre drafted as aide seal up before you come back in and dont touch anything he finished hell of a way to die he added hed have been kept alive aware strapped down there while the water level rose the rooms soundproofed no one would have heard him screaming the killer heard him eve said and turning away opened transmission o o she recorded the scene and did a preliminary sweep before the local police arrived knowing she had to balance authority with diplomacy she requested rather than ordered the sheriff to send his men out to knock on doors not many people around here just now sheriff reese told her come june itll be a different story i realize that maybe well get lucky sheriff this is your turf but the victim comes from mine the killer too as this murder links to my ongoing investigation it falls under my authority but i need all the help i can get and your cooperation youll have it lieutenant he studied her for a moment some people might think were in the boondocks here but were not boobs dont get your city crimes too much but we know how to handle them when we do i appreciate it she passed him her sealit did you know captain bayliss sure reese sprayed his shoes his hands he and his wife were regulars they spent the month of august here most every year and about a weekend a month rest of the year popped in now and again otherwise had parties spent some money in the village didnt have much to do with the locals but were friendly enough didnt cause any trouble she started upstairs with him did bayliss make a habit of coming here alone not really hed come down on a friday night now and again once twice a year stay till sunday went out on his boat did some fishing the wife didnt care for fishing you notify her my information is that shes in paris shell be contacted bayliss ever bring anybody here other than his wife cant say he did some do men bring a buddy or a side piece youll pardon the expression women do the same bayliss stuck with his wife never heard of him bringing any entertainment with him she nodded walked to the tub with him reese stared down blew out a breath jesus thats a sorry sight i dont mind saying im glad this is yours lieutenant reese scratched his head if he was trying to make it look like suicide whyd he leave the man strapped in there he wasnt trying to mock a selftermination he just needed the blood on the badge its pattern ive got the scene recorded and now that youve officially witnessed it im going to drain the tub examine the body you go right on he stepped back and watched roarke come in my temporary aide eve explained this is sheriff reese i know who you are reese said seen your face onscreen often enough you own some property around here thats right you keep it in good maintenance we appreciate that around here that your rig out front yes roarke smiled a little as eve turned off the motor its a new line slick ill give you a closer look before we go roarke offered id appreciate that victim is male caucasian eve began identified as bayliss captain boyd age fortyeight cause of death appears to be drowning single laceration in left wrist is potentially lifethreatening she fit on her microgoggles no visible hesitation marks she reported then pushed them off again victim is wearing a gold wedding ring and a gold wrist unit a strong adhesive tape has been used to strap the victim to the tub at throat left forearm chest torso waist hips and on both thighs and ankles no defensive wounds are evident the water drained out little sucking sounds while she spoke as the level lowered baylisss hair and genitals floated toward the surface i need to get in to examine the body sheriff will you record she slipped the recorder off her jacket held it out i like my job better than yours he fixed it to his shirt moved closer she stepped onto the platform swung a leg over the edge already in her mind the scene played out hed have been unconscious she was sure of that it wouldnt have been possible to get a healthy wellbuilt adult male into the tub and restrained without signs of a struggle she planted her feet on either side of the body as she imagined the killer had done bending she began to work at the tape strong stuff it looks like that tape used for packing cargo and heavy shipments he used a smoothbladed tool to cut it no ragged edges probably shears or scissors neat patient work he took his time the tape screeched a little as it pulled away from the smooth damp surface of the tub she took her time with it carefully sliding the tape into evidence bags with his head free eve lifted it turned it and saw no signs of a blow stunned him she thought used a weapon probably a standard police issue damn she worked her way down the body handing roarke the bagged tape as she freed it her movements were brisk and efficient roarke thought her eyes were flat distancing herself as much as she was able focusing her mind her skill on the job she wouldnt have called it courageous but he did to give herself over to stand over death and work doggedly to balance the scales even for a man he knew she had disliked microgoggles she ordered and roarke passed them back to her with them on she crouched examining the abraded skin where bayliss had futilely fought against the tape yeah she thought wanted him alive and awake while the water churned up screaming begging sobbing did he call you by name id lay odds on it she turned him her hands unconsciously gentle on his back his buttocks she saw faint marks where his body had pressed and rubbed against the tub and on his hips was a small tattoo gold and black a replica of the shield that was now smeared with his blood a cop through and through she commented at least thats what he considered himself hed have hated dying like this naked helpless and undignified she gathered the coins littering the bottom of the tub thirty she said jingling them in her palm before dropping them into the bag roarke held out for her he deviates his method but not his symbolism bayliss hasnt been dead long we didnt miss this one by much the blood barely started to settle to its lowest level and whats been spilled out theres still wet i need the gauge to get time of death lieutenant roarke held out the gauge i believe your teams here hmm she took the gauge she heard it now the muted voices traveling from below up the stairs and through the open door okay im almost done in here an hour she said in disgust when she read the gauge we didnt miss him by more than an hour she climbed back out of the tub as peabody strode into the room lieutenant record on see that hes bagged and transports arranged peabody get some sweepers started in here did you bring edd feeney and mcnab are right behind me when they get here have them start on the security then the links for what its worth thank you sheriff she held out a hand for her recorder this is my aide officer peabody shell handle the scene if you have no objection none at all i want to go through the house bayliss had files with him i need to find them firstlevel office roarke put in bringing her eyes to his i can show you where it is something in his tone told her he didnt want to show her with company she blocked off the automatic annoyance that hed gone through the house without her and turned to reese id like you to check with your men doing the doortodoors also if you could contact your patrols inquire as to whether anyone noticed a strange vehicle in this area tonight ill get right on it outside if its all the same to you id like some air thanks she started out with roarke waited until the first wave of the crime scene unit passed them on the stairs whats the idea of poking around the house on your own were on official business i cant have civilians making themselves at home i was acting in my capacity as temporary aide he said smoothly all of the other doors and windows were secured by the way the alarm systems one of mine and top of its line it wasnt tampered with whoever bypassed it had a code and i located the security control he continued feeneys going to find that system was also bypassed there wont be a recording of tonights activities in or out of the house after seven oclock busy boy me or your killer ha ha he doesnt panic he doesnt rush he covers his tracks and he does all that with rage working through him must be a damn good cop she moved through the door roarke indicated into a large office space with views of the sea through the glass wall in the rear here there were signs of hurry here there were things out of place a glass turned over on the desk its contents spilled out on the brushed chrome surface a jumble of discs a disordered pile of clothes heaped on the floor she recognized the suit bayliss had been wearing at the meeting he took him out here from the front she began surprised him at work bayliss had fixed himself a drink she lifted the glass sniffed smells like scotch settled himself down to go through his files he hears something looks up sees someone in the doorway jumps to his feet spills his drink maybe he even has time to say a name then hes out she walked around the room around the desk the killer undresses him here hes already got the plan he came in upstairs checked the place out hell maybe hes been to parties here before and knew the setup he went out disarmed the security cam took the discs that recorded him did he bring the packing tape with him she began opening compartments drawers no look heres a roll of the same stuff unopened he got what he needed right here in baylisss office hell dispose of the rest of the roll and what he used to cut the tape we wont find it lieutenant roarke said quietly look at the discs im getting to them then he carried bayliss upstairs hes strong i didnt notice any signs the victim was dragged no bruising or scrapes on the heels laid him in the tub didnt toss him in no bruising again laid him out strapped him down took his shoes off to do it but not his clothes no scuff marks in the tub and too much water outside of it for him to have dried off yes she could see it that way patience while the rage ate inside you meticulous patience coated over murderous fury then he waited for bayliss to come around when he did a little conversation this is why youre going to die this is why you deserve to die to suffer fear and humiliation and he starts the water a hot gush and listens to bayliss plead for his life as the water rises and the motor kicks in churning into a hot froth he stays cold ice cold thats how it is when you stand over death you stay cold so it cant get inside you he stands there right over it and watches it come it doesnt thrill him doesnt make him sad its just a job that needs to be done and done well done with purpose when water fills baylisss lungs when he stops struggling and his eyes are fixed and staring he takes the coins and throws them in the water over the body the judas coins then he gets out of the tub dripping picks up his shoes and leaves the way he came in he leaves the door open because he doesnt want the murder to go undiscovered for long he wants it known announced discussed the job isnt done until the department knows another cop is dead i cant recreate the way you can roarke said its admirable its basic not the way you do it he murmured how many scenes such as shed described had a place in her memory how many victims lived there with how many killers stay cold shed said so that it doesnt get inside of you that he knew was one skill she lacked the very fact that it all got inside her was what made her brilliant and haunted look at the discs eve i saw them there were dozens many of the names she recognized cops baylisss little rat file of cops reaching she noted all the way to the tower at least he was democratic in his witch hunt she saw the one with her name on the label well bag them all its going to be a tedious and nasty job to go through them his machines still on she sat down frowned at the blank screen theres a disc in and not i think one of the victims you touched this she whirled in the chair snarled at him i told you not shut up eve and run the disc she had more to say a great deal more but it could wait until they were alone and she could pound on him in private she turned back to the screen run current disc she ordered words swirled silently onto the screen there was no audio backup or readout but simply clear cool letters on a smokegray background lieutenant dallas as you are primary in the investigation of the deaths of kohli mills and now bayliss i address this message to you i deeply regret the death of detective taj kohli i was misled largely by the efforts of the man i am about to execute for his crimes crimes against the badge he has misused in his own thirst for power is that any less a sin against his oath than that of mills who betrayed his badge for money whether or not you agree with me is not my concern i have pledged to do what i have done and will continue to do because of our connection i took the time to read the file bayliss generated on you if the allegations the accusations the data he has compiled is based in fact you have dishonored your badge i am not willing to trust the words of a liar of a twisted powerhungry cop but they must be considered i will give you seventytwo hours to exonerate yourself if you are involved with max ricker through your husband you will die if these allegations are false and you are as skilled and dedicated as your reputation indicates you will find the way to break ricker and his organization in the time allotted it will require your full focus and all your skills to be fair as fairness is my goal i give you my word that i will make no move against you or anyone else during this time period take down max ricker lieutenant or i will take you chapter eighteen eve made copies of the message took the disc and the files into evidence and turned the computer over to feeney hed haul it into edd take it apart run his scans and checks that was for form she knew the killer had left nothing of himself on the machine but his single personal message to her ricker was on her list and she meant to take him down but he couldnt be wouldnt be a priority whatever his connection to the killer ricker wasnt the one at the controls she was after a rogue cop and if he wanted to go headtohead with her that was fine but he wouldnt threaten her into shifting her focus there was a process to be gone through and she meant to take it step by meticulous step she harassed the sweepers called the lab personally and issued a few threats of her own along with her demand for priority on the samples she was sending in as far as she was concerned if she had to work twentyfour seven until the case was closed she would do so and so would everyone on her team o o roarke had a different process to work through a different priority and an entirely different style he hadnt wasted time asking what eve intended to do or arguing with her over taking precautions for her personal safety he left her with her work and made the trip back to new york alone by the time hed arrived hed already begun the groundwork on his own plans he pulled up in front of purgatory uncoded the door the wreckage had been removed and the first layers of repair were already under way it wasnt the elegant arena of sin it had been but it would be very soon the lights were on shimmering over the floor with its newly laid squares of reflective silver squares and circles the mirrors behind the bar had been replaced in a deep blue glass per his instructions the overall effect was somewhat otherworldly or perhaps he thought underworldly which was his intent he moved to the bar and was pouring two snifters of brandy when rue maclean came down the long curving stairs i ran a security check she said smiling a little were up and running you work fast well be open for business within seventytwo hours seventy she picked up the snifter he nudged over the bar blew out a breath how ill deal with it i want you to put the staff on notice in the morning get the work schedules done tonight we reopen friday night and we reopen with a bang he lifted his snifter watching her youre the boss thats right he took out his cigarettes left the case on the bar as he lighted one how did he get to you he saw just the barest glint of panic before puzzlement slid over her face what hes been using my place to do a little business oh nothing too overt nothing too important just enough so he can sit smug in his little fortress and imagine fucking me over with my own hell get sloppy after a bit if he hasnt already thats his pattern makes him dangerous that carelessness of his might be that the cop who died here began to sniff something just a whiff of it then he was dead before he could follow through shed gone pale so pale her skin was nearly translucent you think ricker had the cop killed he drew in smoke watching her through the veil of it as he exhaled no i dont at least not directly but the timings interesting bad timing for the cop potentially for me and certainly for you rue i dont know what youre talking about she started to step back but roarke simply laid a hand over hers the pressure firm enough to warn her to hold her place dont he spoke softly and she shivered youll only piss me off im asking how he got to you im asking because weve been in the way of being friends for a considerable amount of time now you know theres nothing between me and ricker id hoped there wasnt he angled his head youre trembling do you think ill hurt you have you ever seen me strike a woman rue no one tear huge glistening spilled over and trailed down her white cheek no you wouldnt its not your way but its his how did he hurt you it was shame now that pushed tears from her eyes had her voice choked with them oh god roarke im sorry im so sorry he had me picked up off the street two of his men right on the street they took me out to his place and he jesus he had lunch this fancy lunch all spread out in his solarium he told me how it was going to be and what would happen to me if i didnt go along so you went along not at first she fumbled one of his cigarettes out tried to light one roarke took her hand held it steady until the flame caught youve been good to me treated me with respect and with fairness i know you dont have to believe me but i told him to go to hell i told him that when you found out what hed tried to do youd well i made up all sorts of interesting nasty things youd do he just sat there that vicious little smile on his face until i ran down i was scared i was so scared the way he watched me like i was a bug he was contemplating squashing if the mood struck then he said a name and an address my mothers name my mothers address her breath hitched as she picked up the snifter drank quick and drank deep to steady herself he showed me videos hed had her watched her in the little house upstate i bought her that you helped me buy her shopping going to a friends house just daytoday stuff i wanted to be enraged i wanted to be furious but i couldnt get through the terror of it i would go along he told me and really he said what harm was it and my mother wouldnt be raped and tortured and disfigured i would have seen her safe rue you could have trusted me to see her safe she shook her head he always knows the weak spot always knows its his gift and he presses down on that spot until youd do anything to make him stop so i betrayed you to make him stop she brushed tears away im sorry he wont touch your mother i promise you ive a place she can go and be safe until were done with this rue stared at him i dont understand youll feel better once shes seen to and i need your energies focused on the club for the next few days youre keeping me on after this i dont have a mother but i know what it is to love beyond yourself and just what youd do to keep that love safe from harm ill say you should have trusted me rue and so you should but i dont blame you she sat then buried her face in her hands he topped off the brandy as she wept soundlessly then got a bottle of water opened it set it in front of her go on drink that first clear your head a bit this is why he hates you her voice was raw but steady because of everything you are everything he could never be he cant understand whats inside you what makes you so he hates he doesnt just want you dead he wants you ruined im counting on it now im going to tell you what it is were going to do o o eve figured shed been playing the marriage game for going on a year so she knew the moves the easiest way to dodge a problem with roarke over her handling of the case was not to talk to him about it for as long as humanly possible to buy time she called home on her carlink shifting to silent mode she channeled the call to the bedside link figuring hed most likely be in his office this way when the message light blinked on he wouldnt be there to see it and intercept hey she gave the screen a quick distracted smile figured i should let you know ill be at central ill catch some sleep there mostly ill be working straight through after a swing by the lab to nag dickhead for results ill tag you when i get a chance see you she broke transmission and wasnt aware she let out a quiet relieved breath until she caught peabodys gimlet stare what want a single womans take on that marriagegoround no you know hes going to have some choice words to say about you ignoring the threat peabody went on unperturbed by eves scowl so youre dancing around him too busy to talk dont wait up she couldnt resist a snort like thats going to work shut up eve shifted in her seat tried biting her tongue then gave up why wont it work because youre slick dallas but he is way slicker he might even let you tango awhile then bop bop what the hell is bop i dont know because im not as slick as either one of you but well both know it when we see it peabody stifled a yawn as they pulled up to the lab i havent ridden in a black and white for awhile she patted the thin miserably uncomfortable seat i havent missed it it was the best i could do im going to get grief for commandeering this at the scene but my units trash nah peabody yawned again rubbed her eyes the uniform you snagged it froms too much in awe hell probably put a plaque in this thing eve dallas sat here give me a break but the idea made her snicker as they climbed out i want you to contact maintenance they dont hate you as much as me yet get them to put my unit back in shape itll go quicker if i lie and put in the request under another badge number yeah youre right use baxters youre punchy she added when peabody yawned again when were done here take an hours down time or pop some wakeup whatever i need you focused ill get my second wind the guard at the door looked as if hed missed his second wind altogether and was sliding under his third his eyes were half closed his uniform wrinkled and he had a sleep crease deep into his right cheek youre coded in was all he said and lumbered back to his station this place is like a tomb at night peabody gave a little shudder worse than the morgue well liven things up she didnt expect dickie to be happy to see her but then again she hadnt expected to once again hear maviss voice blasting into the air when she stepped into the main lab chief lab tech berenski not so affectionately known as dickhead was hunched over a compuscope his skinny butt twitching as he sang tunelessly along at that moment eve knew she could ask for the moon and the stars she had a solidgold bargaining chip hey dickie thats mister dickie to you he lifted his head and she saw shed been right happy he was not his eyes were puffy his oversized lips snarling and she noted his shirt was on inside out get me out of bed middle of the night everythings always an emergency with you dallas everythings priority one just keep off my ass youll get results when i got results and not a minute before go somewhere and stop breathing down my neck but i get off just being near you he slid his eyes up and over studied her dubiously usually she came in with both feet poised to kick him in the ass you just couldnt trust her when she was smiling and joking around youre in a pretty chipper mood for somebody whos got bodies piling up and the brass ready to crawl down your drawers what can i say this music just gives me happy feet you know mavis has a gig coming up here next week i heard it was sold out did you hear it was sold out peabody yeah she might have been tired but peabody clued in quickly a onenightonly too shes pretty hot shes beyond hot dickie said i got me two tickets pulled a few strings second balcony those kind of strings make your nose bleed eve examined her fingernails i can get two in the orchestra with backstage passes if i had a pal that is his head shot up and his clever spiders fingers gripped her arm is that straight shit the straightest if i had a pal she repeated and that pal was busting his ass to get me data i needed id get him those tickets and those passes dickies puffy eyes went moist im your new best

he all but leapt at his scope slick peabody said as they headed out you are so slick o o when they got back to central eve sent peabody off to write the initial report from the record and notes onscene and eve made the miserable call to the next of kin it took longer than she had to spare did little more than depress her baylisss wife had no answers for her and if there were any buried in the shock it would take too long to dig them out the widow declined the option of making a video identification of the deceased became increasingly hysterical until her sister took over the link eve could hear the woman sobbing in the background as a pretty palecheeked brunette came onscreen theres no mistake no theres no mistake i can arrange for a counselor from the local police department to come by your hotel no no shell do better with me shell do better with family strangers only make it worse she bought him cuff links this afternoon god the brunette shut her eyes took a breath she seemed to steady which did a great deal for eves peace of mind well arrange to come back immediately ill take care of it ill take care of my sister contact me as soon as possible ill need to speak with ms bayliss again im sorry for your loss eve sat back stared at the blank screen kohli mills bayliss she took a mental step away from the evidence and tried to see the people cops though theyd all carried badges each one had carried his differently all she was certain had known their killer the first two had known him well enough to trust him especially kohli a latenight chat over drinks in an empty club that was something you did with a friend still hed talked of a meeting with his wife if he meant that literally perhaps it had been more an associate than a friend one hed respected someone hed felt he could ask advice informally over a beer someone she thought from his own house someone she suspected who had some link to ricker computer compile roster from precinct one twoeight this city including any retirees within the last two no correction within the last three years run a search and scan for any cases or investigations connected to any police officer of said precinct

representative during interview or court appearance working multitask request of this nature will require minimum of four hourstwenty minutes to complete then youd better get your ass in gear command unknown please rephrase command christ begin task she fueled up on coffee and let the computer hum while she ducked out and into the conference room on that unit she brought up all the current data on vernon she shouldve been able to run the data on her machine while the search and scan was in progress it was a new one a gem compared to the whining stuttering heap shed been stuck with before but she didnt trust her luck she spent an hour going over vernons data shed be pulling him into interview shortly she intended to hit him and hit him hard the coffee was wearing off and the words beginning to blur when her communicator beeped dallas im going to get me a big sloppy tongue kiss i never said anything about tongues eve said and made a mental note to warn mavis to keep her mouth locked tight when dickhead was backstage what have you got dickie something that should make even your cold cold heart pittypatter i got a little swab of sealit off the edge of the tub jesus tell me you got a print ill kiss you myself cops always want a miracle he hissed out a breath deflated what i got is sealit my guess is he used it to protect his hands and feet but he got a little carried away with it you know what happens if you hit it too thick yeah it glops some you can knock or scrape it on something and end up leaving some behind damn it dickie what the hell does a swab of sealit give me you want to hear this or you want to mouth off he knocked some of the seal off probably when he was getting your guy thrust up for the last spin in the bubble tub thats why its pretty damn likely this little piece of fingernail i got which my diligence and sharp skills located is your killers she held herself level have you checked the dna against baylisss what do i look like a moron she opened her mouth reminded herself she needed him and virtuously shut it again sorry dickie its been a long night tell me it doesnt match bayliss i got it and i mean its barely a sliver the little darling off the underside of the tape got baylisss hair with it you figure that came off his arm as thats the location label on the evidence bag but you dont figure to get a piece of the dead guys nail on the under side of the tape do you no no you dont goddamn dickie thats good thats beautiful i think im falling in love with you they all do in the end got the prelim data coming through now he shot across the room on his favored rolling chair male caucasian male cant give you much more than that right now you want me to try to pin down approximate age and heritage and all that happy stuff its going to take time and i aint got a lot of this sucker to work with could be ill find more he broke the seal one place might be he broke it another so far the only hair is from bayliss keep on it good work dickie yeah you know what dallas you bring this guy in well nail him in court get it nail him yeah i get it thats a real kneeslapper she cut transmission sat back a sliver of a fingernail she thought sometimes a man could hang for nothing more than that a sliver of a fingernail carelessness the first small chink of it thirty pieces of silver symbolism religious symbolism if the victims were judas who was the christ figure not the murderer she decided as her mind drifted christ was the sacrifice he was the pure the son what was the phrase the only begotten son a personal message to the primary conscience the killer had a conscience and his mistake with kohli troubled him enough that he needed to soothe it by explaining by justifying and by setting up an ultimatum bring down ricker it circled back to ricker ricker the son purgatory roarke business she thought old business o o she was in bed in the dark but she wasnt sleeping it wasnt safe to sleep to let herself hide in dreams he was drinking and he wasnt alone she could hear words when their voices raised and they raised often it was her fathers voice she focused on because he was the one who might slide into the dark with her if he didnt drink enough just enough he would come in make a shadow in the doorway with the light hard and bright behind him if he was angry with the man and not drunk enough he would hurt her maybe just slaps maybe if she was lucky but if she wasnt lucky his hands would bruise and squeeze and his breath candyscented would begin to come fast and hard the ragged tshirt she wore to sleep in would be no defense her pleas and struggles would only make him mad make him mad so his breathing got faster faster like a big engine then he would put his hand over her mouth cutting off her air cutting off her screams as he pushed his thing into her daddys got something for you little girl little bitch in her bed she shuddered and listened she was not yet eight i need more money im the one taking the risks im the one putting my ass out there his voice was slurred but not enough not yet enough we made the deal do you know what happens to people who fuck with me the last employee who tried to renegotiate terms didnt live long enough to regret it theyre still finding small pieces of him in the east river this voice was quiet she had to strain to catch it but he wasnt drunk no no she knew the sound of a man whod been drinking and this wasnt it still the tone had her shivering there was a nasty undercurrent to the cultured voice im not looking for trouble ricker there was a whine now which had her cringing if he was afraid hed hurt her and hed use his fists i got expenses i got a daughter to raise im not interested in your personal life but in my merchandise see that its delivered tomorrow night at the appropriate time and place youll get the rest of your fee itll be there a chair scraped the floor for your sake and your daughters it better be youre a drunk i dislike drunks see that youre sober tomorrow night she heard footsteps the door opening closing then silence it was broken by the smashing of glass of roaring oaths in her bed she trembled and braced for the worst the walls shook he was pounding his fists on them better than on her was all she could think let him beat the walls let him find another bottle please please let him go out to find more to drink to find someone else to punish please but the door of her room burst open he stood a shadow big dark with the light bright and hard behind him whatre you staring at you been listening to my private conversations you been poking your nose in my business no no she didnt speak only shook her head fast and fierce i ought to leave you here for the rats and the cops ratsll chew your fingers off and your toes then the copsll come you know what they do to little girls who dont mind their own he lumbered to her dragging her up by the hair so fire burst in her scalp and she cried out despite her efforts to stay quiet they put them in dark holes in the ground and leave them there so bugs crawl into their ears you wanna go into a little dark hole little girl she was crying now she didnt want to but the tears simply spurted out he slapped her once twice but it was almost absentminded and she began to hope get your lazy ass out of bed and pack your junk i got places to go people to see were heading south little girl he smiled then a big toothy grin that left his eyes wild ricker thinks he scares me well hell i got the first half of his money and his goddamn drugs well see who has the last laugh mother fucking max ricker as she scrambled to obey stuffing what clothes she had into a bag she could only think she was saved for one night she was saved thanks to a man named max ricker o o eve shot out of sleep with her heart pounding her throat dry ricker oh god ricker and her father she gripped the arms of the chair to steady herself to keep herself in the now had it been real or just a product of fatigue and imagination real when those little flashes of the past came to her they were always real she could see herself a tangle of hair huge eyes skinny arms huddled in the bed like an animal in a cave she could hear the voices leaning forward she pressed her fingers to her temples max ricker had known her father in new york yes she was sure theyd been in new york that night how long had it been before theyd landed in dallas how long before the night shed found the knife in her hand when her father was raping her how long before the night when shed killed him long enough for the money to run low long enough she realized for ricker to have been hunting to have set wolves on the trail of the man whod stolen from him but shed ended it first rising she paced the room what had happened then didnt apply now and she couldnt allow it to interfere with her investigation or influence her and yet what sneering twist of fate had brought this circle around again ricker to her father ricker to roarke and without question ricker to herself what choice did she have but to end it again chapter nineteen she needed more coffee she needed some sleep dreamless sleep and she needed the rest of the data from the search and scan but something had rooted in her brain something that had her leapfrogging over the current data and running yet another search shed just begun when the summons came from the towers i dont have time for this goddamn politics i dont have time to go running up to tibble and giving him updates he can pass to the media dallas you go up to the towers ill finish the run for you peabody said eve wanted to do the run herself it was personal and that was the whole damn problem she admitted shed let it get personal vernons due in an hour if hes thirty seconds late send uniforms have him picked up familiarize yourself with his profile she added as she grabbed her jacket contact feeney i want him and mcnab in on the interview i want the room full of cops she hesitated looked back at the computer no point in wasting time she reminded herself no point in it add the data im compiling to the file and run a probability on our three homicides yes sir on who youll know eve said as she stalked out if you dont youre in the wrong business i live for pressure peabody muttered and sat down she was going to make it short eve told herself and she was going to make it direct tibble might have to be concerned about departmental image about politics about the drooling and slathering in iab but she didnt she had one job and that was to close her case she wasnt going to sit still for having to squeeze another damn press conference into her schedule and if he thought he could yank her off the investigation to make the proper noises to the media he could just oh boy it wouldnt help matters for her to march into tibbles office leading with attitude any more she thought than this underlying pity would help if her suspicions regarding the killers identity proved out her job was to close the case and the dead whoever they were deserved her best as for ricker she intended to close that circle as well tibble didnt keep her waiting that surprised her a little but it was nothing compared to the jolt she got when she stepped into his office and saw roarke sitting there cooleyed and comfortable lieutenant from his desk tibble gestured her inside have a seat youve had a long night he added his face was calm blank as was that of her commander who sat with his hands on his thighs it was eve thought like coming in late to a highstakes poker game and she didnt know the price of the damn ante sir the preliminary report on bayliss has already been updated with initial lab reports she glanced meaningfully toward roarke i am unable to specify regarding the evidence in the presence of a civilian the civilian came in handy last night tibble said yes sir she too knew how to hold her cards close and merely nodded it was vital to arrange the fastest transportation to baylisss weekend home not quite fast enough no sir that wasnt a criticism lieutenant your instincts regarding captain bayliss were correct if you hadnt followed them as you did we might still at this point be unaware of his murder as i admire your instincts lieutenant im about to follow them myself ive made roarke a temporary civilian attache as regards the investigation of max ricker concurrent with your investigation of these homicides chief tibble you have an objection lieutenant tibble spoke smoothly if her head hadnt been busy exploding she might have heard the whiff of humor in the tone a number of them beginning with the fact that the ricker matter is not priority i am on the point of analyzing new evidence and data that i believe will lead to an arrest in the matter of my current investigation the connection to ricker exists she continued is key but it has no bearing on these leads or on the anticipated arrest the connection is i believe more emotional than tangible therefore the pursuit of ricker is secondary and it is my belief that this pursuit can and will be continued subsequent to interview with the suspect in the homicides i request that any steps in the ricker area be postponed until my current case is closed tibble watched her youre now a target every cops a target the killer is attempting to shift my focus from him onto ricker i dont intend to accommodate him and respectfully sir neither should you there was just enough heat in the last of her statement to cause tibbles brows to lift just enough to have the corners of his mouth lift in what could never be mistaken for amusement lieutenant dallas in my observations of your work i have never perceived your focus shifting one degree once set on course but perhaps ive missed something or perhaps these current matters are more than you can reasonably handle if thats the case ill assign the ricker matter to another officer thats my second ultimatum in the last few hours i dont like ultimatums youre not required to like it youre required to do your job chief tibble roarke voice quiet interrupted weve taken the lieutenant off guard after a difficult night my presence here adds a personal level i wonder if we might explain the reason im here before this goes any farther it was nearly out of her mouth the pissy little snipe that would tell roarke in no uncertain terms she didnt need him defending her but whitney got to his feet nodded i think we might take a breath here calm ourselves down id like some coffee sir with your permission ill get some for all of us while roarke outlines the basic plan for lieutenant dallass benefit tibble gave a brief nod gestured to roarke then sat back in his chair as ive told you and have informed your superiors i once had a brief business association with max ricker an association roarke added which i severed upon discovering not all of rickers dealings were legal we did not have a friendly parting of the ways my ending of our association cost ricker a considerable amount of money and a number of accounts clients hes known to hold a grudge over much less and to bide his time in seeking retribution i cant say this worried me overmuch until recently he glanced up at whitney as the commander offered him a cup of coffee cop coffee roarke thought with an inward wince but took it just the same as you know i purchased through a representative a property owned by ricker i remodeled restaffed and renamed the club purgatory it does good business legal business but since the time of the murder of your associate i discovered that ricker has been using my property and some of my staff to do business of his own maclean eve thought shed been sure of it illegals primarily roarke added as he hardly needs one of my properties for this purpose his goal was to build up these illegal activities essentially under my nose and eventually connect me to them causing me and my wife a great deal of trouble and discomfort she sold you out eve felt fury bubbling in her throat rue maclean on the contrary he never missed a beat she discovered rickers infiltration and reported it to me only last night that was bullshit eve thought but shed let it pass for now iab had a tip on it no doubt through one of rickers sources set kohli up to sniff it out he had a good nose hed have caught the scent i believe he did sooner than ricker might have wanted he was only doing minor business but killing a cop having a cop killed in my place changes the level it wasnt ricker it was out thoughtlessly almost defensively then she made herself consider he lit the fuse she murmured connections inside the department inside the one twentyeight he knew which buttons to push which wounds to pour salt in he couldnt have known what he was starting couldnt have anticipated that but hes been sucking it in just the same she paused then continued at tibbles gesture hed have been distracted angry at the bust last fall it shifted the balance martinez had him all her data clicked but mills moved in and undermined the bust and the subsequent evidence ricker slid through but the whole deal twisted him up and with his need to prove he still had the power he offset that annoyance by arranging for a cop in my place his reasoning there will come out eventually and really does it matter i can get him for you isnt that enough too much she wanted to say she was afraid it would be too much i can get him myself i dont doubt it roarke admitted however i can help you do it quickly without taking your energies and your considerable skills away from your homicide investigation or taking them only minimally purgatory reopens at eight on friday night ricker will be there at ten why to do business with me business ill agree to do because im concerned about my wifes safety eve he murmured surely you can swallow your pride long enough to let me set him up so you can kick his ass he wont believe you he will yes first because its true and second because ill pretend it isnt and let him see through he expects deceit because hes a liar himself im bored you see toeing the line want a bit of excitement back then theres the money so much money to be made when you dont worry about the refinements you already own half the universe why settle for half when you can have all he took a sip of coffee found it just as bitter and bad as expected hell believe me because he wants to wants to believe hes won and because hes not as clever as he once was or as careful hed like me at least under his thumb so he can pick me apart at his leisure well lead him to believe that can happen when the deals made youll have him well put men in the club whitney picked up the plan and roarke is arranging for his security system to record the entire discussion his club manager will be acting as liaison setting up the meet i need you to brief roarke on kohli so that he can steer ricker in that direction if he had any involvement in that murder i want him to go down for it hell know its a setup eve insisted why should he talk business off his own turf hell insist on having his men do a security sweep hell talk roarke corrected because he wont be able to resist because he still considers the club his turf and he can do his sweep he wont find what i dont want him to find she turned from him got to her feet sir roarke lacks objectivity in this matter and hes not trained its probable that under these conditions ricker will attempt to cause him physical harm most certainly a plan along these lines will put a civilian in serious jeopardy and could cause him considerable legal difficulties let me assure you lieutenant dallas the civilian has covered himself in all legal areas hell have his immunity regarding any information or allegations stemming from any areas discussed past present or future in this operation as for physical jeopardy i imagine he can handle himself every bit as well there as he has in the legal arena his cooperation in this matter will save the department untold manhours and financial resources objectively lieutenant this is an opportunity we cant afford to miss if you feel unable to head the team or be a part of the operation you have only to say so under the circumstances it wont be held against you ill do my job good id have been disappointed to hear you say otherwise coordinate your schedule make time to brief roarke on kohli and to be briefed by him on the security setup at purgatory i want every member of the team linked and locked within twentyfour hours therell be no leak no mistake no legal loophole for ricker to slip through this time bring me his goddamn head on a plate yes sir full updates on my desk concurrent cases by sixteen hundred dismissed when roarke walked out with her she said nothing didnt dare anything that spilled out would be hot and lethal and likely burn them both noon she snapped it out when she felt she had some measure of control my home office have your security diagrams all data a list with all background data on any and all staff members wholl be on duty friday night youve already planned to broach some sort of deal to ricker i want to know every angle of it i dont want any more goddamn surprises dont talk to me now she ordered in a hiss dont even speak you ambushed me you fucking ambushed me he took her arm before she could stalk away and she rounded one fist clenched and ready go ahead the invitation was mild take a shot if itll make you feel better im not doing this here it took every scrap of control to keep her voice down its bad enough already just let go im late for interview instead he simply yanked her into the elevator do you think i would do nothing stand back and do nothing she was trembling and she knew it what the hell was wrong with her she was trembling and tired and riding too close to panic i think you have no right poking into my job only when it suits you only when i come in handy then its all right for me to poke in invitation only okay fine fine fine she threw up her hands furious because he was right and that made her wrong do you know what youve done do you know what youve risked can you imagine what i wouldnt risk for you you cant because theres nothing theres bloody nothing he took her by the shoulders fingers hard and tense it was always a weird sort of fascination to see him lose control to hear his voice take on that jagged edge but she wasnt in the mood to be fascinated i was handling it and i wouldve finished it well now were handling it and well finish it when you swallow that pride eve take care you dont choke on it leaving it at that he strode off the elevator when the doors opened and left her fuming inside o o it was vernons bad luck that she was ready to chew glass he leaped to his feet when she walked into interview you had me picked up you had me picked up and dragged in here like a criminal thats right vernon she shoved him hard and knocked him into the chair i want a goddamn lawyer this time she grabbed him onehanded by the collar and shoved him against the wall while feeney mcnab and peabody stood aside and watched with varying degrees of interest ill get you a goddamn lawyer youre going to need one but you know what vernon were not on record yet you notice that and you notice how my pals here arent making any move to stop me from pounding your ugly face in im just going to kick you around the room a few times before we call for that goddamn lawyer he tried to shove her found her elbow hard in his gut get your hands off me he took a swing at her that went wide as she sidestepped then he was doubled over retching from the agony of her knee slamming into his crotch ive got three witnesses here thatre going to testify that you assaulted me thats going to put you in lockup where all the big bad guys will be drawing straws to see who gets to be your date for friday night i bet you know what those big bad guys do to cops in lockup dont you vernon they can do a lot of it in the couple of hours its going to take me given my physical distress as a result of said assault to contact your representative every breath he drew cut into his throat like glass now i came in here in the mood to dance with you but im losing the urge you dont want to talk to me and my pals well just book you on the assault then finish up by slamming you with corruption misuse of authority accepting bribes collusion with suspected members of organized crime and top it all off with conspiracy to murder thats bullshit he had most of his breath back though his face was still white and sheened with sweat i dont think so rickers not going to think so either when it leaks youre in here squealing like a pig and it will leak because ive got a warrant out on canarde not yet she didnt but she would if we let you out youre going to wish you were in a cage playing house with some guy named bruno i came in to make a deal yeah but then you didnt show up on time i got sidetracked and i dont like your attitude fact is vernon i dont need you anymore ill have the case wrapped by end of day and im going to take ricker down just for my own amusement youre what they call superfluous youre bluffing you think i dont know how this works im a fucking cop youre a fucking disgrace and dont you call yourself a cop again in my presence or i will kick your ass if she had canarde he thought if she was that close to ricker he was done and hed better save himself quick and fast you want to make your case youre going to want what i know i know plenty you havent scraped the surface at the one twentyeight ive scraped it and im busy mucking out the slime on the bottom thats where i found you i can give you more desperation had him trying out a shaky smile i can give you a promotion names dallas not just in the one twentyeight names in the mayors office in the media and right on through to east washington i want immunity a new id and the seed money to relocate she yawned hugely jesus vernon youre boring me thats the deal heres mine peabody dump this piece of garbage in lockup and see if brunos back in town i believe he is and hes lonely wait jesus whatd you bring me in for if you didnt want to deal i gotta have immunity you put me in i dont come out we both know it whats the point in my talking if im going to get stuck in the heart gee vernon now youre breaking mine immunity for everything up to conspiracy to murder you get hooked to that you go down as for the new name face location thats your problem thats not enough thats it thats all and even that leaves a taste in my mouth its going to take weeks to get out again i didnt have anything to do with killing cops then you dont have to worry do you i got a right to my union rep he whined now in a voice that reminded her of her fathers in the flashback sure you do was all she said and turned to the door wait okay wait reps just complicate things right well do it straight you put the immunity on the record and we do it straight she turned back to the table sat interview with vernon detective jeremy conducted by dallas lieutenant eve also present are feeney captain ryan mcnab detective ian and peabody officer delia subject vernon has agreed to give statements and answer questions in return for immunity on any related charges of corruption and misuse of authority do you give these statements and agree to answer these questions of your own volition thats right i want to cooperate i want to make things right i feel thats enough vernon you are a ranked detective in the nypsd correct ive been a cop for sixteen years been a detective in illegals at the one twentyeight for the last six and at this time you are prepared to admit that you have accepted financial bribes and other favors in exchange for passing information to aiding in the illegal practices of and generally following the orders of max ricker i took money fact was i was afraid not to im ashamed of it but i feared for my life and wellbeing im not the only one once he got started eve thought you couldnt shut him up in the first hour he reeled off streams of names activities connections he brought down the one twentyeight even as he doggedly treaded water to keep his own neck above the swamp captain roth her vernon feeling perkier sneered she didnt see didnt want to you ask me has her own agenda wants to make commander plays a good game of politics but shes got this problem she dont have a dick and wishes she did always going off about how some of the men didnt like taking orders from her cause shes a woman then shes got that useless husband screwing around on her she drinks she got so hot on this op to take ricker down she didnt watch her back or look down at her feet neither made it easy to pull the rug out you know we just passed the data along lost some key evidence skewed a couple of reports and that was that yeah that was that listen vernon leaned forward rickers smart he knows he doesnt need the whole squad he gets key men and they keep a look out for him and for other recruits you know whos up for a take and whos not kohli wasnt straight as a damn arrow kohli one of the guys in the one twoeight see hed heard something on an op from say the sixfour easy to poke around talking shop then you got a guy knows how to hack data and you get the deets pass that to ricker and you get a nice fee he lifted his hands actually smiling smooth simple if the op was after one of rickers connections he had time to change locations pull out whatever so the ops a bust if its one of his competitors he can sit back wait for the shit to fly then pick up the clients maybe even the merchandise after hes got key men in evidence when he needs them then the media guys to spin stories his way the politicians to keep the heat off thing is ive been noticing last couple years the guys getting erratic ricker yeah hes starting to dip into his own stock a little too heavy slurping that drink of his laced with illegals every time you turn around hes a damn addict now half gone to a funkyjunky i mean hes slipping and sliding in a big way making some bad moves then offing a cop i mean jesus eves hand shot out gripped his wrist do you have knowledge that max ricker arranged for the murder of taj kohli he wanted to say yes somehow it had all taken on the shining sheen of bragging but if he didnt play it straight shed catch him up and find a way to hang him i cant say as he ordered it but i heard some talk give me the talk vernon now and again id maybe have a drink or share an lc with one of rickers guys lemme tell you i wasnt the only one noticing he was losing his touch here and there so this guy jake evans he was telling me about a month ago that ricker was playing games with iab getting his jollies turning cops on cops he knew iab put a man into that club looking for cops doing deals only there werent cops doing deals get me yeah i get you right rickerd put that out playing his games ricker evans tells me has this bug up his ass to cause trouble there in that club and thats why hes having some of his men channeling illegals through it but seems he got a better idea and he thinks hes found a way to put a cop on a cop all the way some psychological shit evans said ricker hes big on mind games hes feeding skewed data to this other cop on the first cop the second cop you following this yes keep going okay the second cops got some problems personal problems or something and rickers chewing away on them making them raw giving this cop lots of little nudges so hell think the first cop thats kohli did something dirty but it was more than that like whatever the dirty was went back on the first cop evans said it was complicated and risky and ricker wasnt saying much but he evans didnt like it then rickers man in iab hes got one there too his man there was supposed to make sure all this shaded data sort of fell in the second cops lap i guess it worked vernon had the good sense to take the excitement off his face i figured when kohli got hit and it came around he got hit by another cop i figured rickerd worked it whats the name in iab i dont know swear to god he said when her eyes narrowed we dont all know each other mostly we found out but not every one every time probably bayliss right bayliss is dead come on dallas ive given you close to twenty names you put a fire under some of them youll get more yeah ill get more she got to her feet but i cant stomach any more from you mcnab get this thing into a safe house two guards at all times on eighthour shifts feeney can you handpick them can do i gave you a hell of a lot dallas you could go to bat for me on the new id she didnt so much as look at him peabody with me dallas hey count your blessings jerk feeney muttered as eve walked out you only got your balls bruised another little while in here with you if she didnt cut them off i would have i cant even get mad peabody stood in the hallway turned away from interview im too sick to my stomach to get mad i love being a cop and hes made me ashamed of it thats the wrong take hes beyond shame you just do the job day after day and youve got nothing to be ashamed of i need you to make a copy of that record and get it to tibble thats going to be his problem thank christ ive got another meet at noon ill fill you in on it when i get back yes sir what about canarde we hold there im saving him for later do you want the results of the search and scan and probability you had me run is it enough to pick him up probabilitys under seventysix percent with known data but but eve repeated the computer doesnt count grief or mind games or ricker playing cop against cop well bring him in well do it quiet when i get back he may try another hit no he gave his word he wont break it chapter twenty eve marched into the house emitted a low rumbling growl at a hovering summerset and headed straight up the stairs she had a great deal to say and intended to get started immediately the growl came again a quiet threat when she noted her office was empty but the door leading to roarkes was open rolling her shoulders she started toward it and heard the impatience in his voice as she approached the door its neither possible nor is it convenient for me to make the trip at this time but sir the situation requires your personal attention with tonaka dragging their feet over this acquisition and the delays in the environmental clearance on the tropical sector we cant hope to meet deadline without your immediate intervention cost overruns and penalties will youre authorized to deal with it i pay you to deal with it im unable to make the trip to olympus for the next several days perhaps longer if tonaka is dragging feet cut them off at the knees understood yes sir if i could have any sort of estimate as to when you might clear the time to survey on site it would ill let you know when i know roarke cut transmission sat back closed his eyes and two things occurred to eve first that he had a complicated vital and demanding life apart from hers one she too often took for granted second and more important he looked tired he never looked tired the temper shed hoarded like gold slipped away unneeded unwanted still instinct moved her into the room and kept a scowl on her face he sensed her instantly his eyes opening lieutenant roarke she said in exactly the same cool and measured tone i have a number of things to say to you im sure you do would you prefer your office we can start right here first in my own fumbling way ive managed to narrow my investigation my homicide investigation to one suspect this suspect will be brought in detained and questioned before end of day congratulations premature questioning is not an arrest at the same time through another source and through police procedure ive tied ricker loosely but tied him to those homicides and hope to charge him with conspiracy its a stretch but it could work and will certainly be enough for me to pull him in and interrogate him i did those things without you going behind my back and over my head to formulate an operation with my superiors an operation that puts you at considerable risk not only physically but in ways we both understand if the operation goes through whats said between you and ricker will be admissible in court im perfectly aware of that your immunity deal will keep you out of a cage but could and you know it potentially damage your reputation and your business even through the fatigue in his eyes she caught the glint of arrogance lieutenant my reputation and my business was forged in the same unsavory fire that may be but things are different now for you do you honestly think i cant weather this no roarke i think you can and will weather anything everything i think theres nothing beyond your capabilities when your mind is set its almost scary you pissed me off she added im perfectly aware of that you knew you would if youd come to me with the idea first time was short and we were both busy this involves me eve whether you like it or not i dont like it but maybe not for the reasons you think regardless i did what makes sense whats most direct im not sorry for it no apologies i could make you apologize pal is that so yeah thats so because youre soft on me ask anybody she moved to the desk now watching him as he rose im soft on you too dont you know thats why or part of why i was pissed off i dont want him close to you i dont want what he is to touch you is that supposed to be your exclusive property not wanting someone who means you harm to lay hands on you no he sighed ran a hand through his hair in a rare show of frustration no its not the other part was pride and i dont have an easy time swallowing it neither do you the thing you said about me going along with you poking in when it works for me you were right im not saying thats going to change but you were right im not real happy about that either and this other thing i know you only walk away like you did when youd like to punch me i must do a great deal of walking away she didnt laugh as he meant her to no thats the thing you dont she came around the counter the console then took his face in her hands you just dont eve he ran his hands up her arms to her shoulders im not finished yet its a good plan not a great one but we can finetune it id rather another way id rather youd use that link to contact whoever it was you were just talking to and agree to go off planet and do whatever the hell it is you do nobody else seems to be able to pull off id rather that roarke because you mean more to me than anything ever has or ever could but its not going to happen and if anything happens to you friday night it wont if anything happens to you she repeated im going to dedicate my life to making yours a living hell fair enough he murmured as her mouth came up to his an hour she wrapped herself around him lets go away from this for one hour i need to be with you i need to be who i am when im with you i know the perfect place o o she had a fondness for the beach the heat the water the sand she could relax there in a manner she allowed herself so rarely he could give her the beach for an hour take it for himself in the holoroom where illusions were only a program away the island he chose with its long sickle curve of whitesugar sand its lazily waving palms and fat fragrant flowers was a setting that suited both of them the baking heat from the gold ball of sun was offset by the breeze that flowed in from the sea like the tide and brought the scent of it to the air this is good she breathed deeply felt the tension in her neck and shoulders melt away she wanted the same for him this is really good she started to ask if hed set the timer then decided not to spoil the moment or the mood instead she stripped off her jacket yanked off her boots the water was a clear and dreaming blue frothed with white at the shore like lace on a hem why resist her weapon harness came next then her trousers she angled her head looked at him dont you want to swim eventually i like watching you strip its so efficient she laughed yeah well enjoy yourself she tugged off her shirt then the little scoopnecked tank beneath naked as a newborn she raced to the sea and dived under the waves i intend to he murmured and watched her strike out always just a little too far for safety before he undressed she swam like an eel fast and fearless for a time he paced himself to her a companionable competition then he simply heeled over on his back to float in the current to let the water the sun the moment wash away the fatigue that had nagged at him and to wait for her she swam up beside him treaded water feel better considerably you looked tired before and she wanted to stroke that fatigue away you hardly ever do i was tired before she let her fingers tangle in his hair you get your second wind ill race you back to shore he had his eyes closed and kept them that way who says i dont have a second wind well youre just floating there like flotsam or maybe its jetsam i never know which is which ive heard in some circles this is called relaxing but his arm sneaked under the water then around her since you have all this energy to spare hey she laughed a little as their legs tangled were way over our heads here just the way i like it his mouth came to hers wet and teasing his arm drew her close against him and they went under warm clear water with the sun dancing on the surface his mouth soft on hers his body firm for both of them she let herself go sliding deeper into the liquid blue sliding deeper into the kiss when they surfaced she filled her lungs and pressed her cheek against his they let the water rock them a steady undulating rhythm that reflected the mood here with light strokes over wet skin was the tenderness theyd both needed the brush of his lips on her shoulder made her smile and let her float on sensation as easily as she floated in the sea she turned her face to his found his mouth again and drugged herself on the taste of him they drifted lazily toward shore rising up on the waves sinking again clinging together drawing apart only far enough to touch when she felt sand beneath her feet she stood in the waisthigh water and watched his face as he traced his fingertips over her i love the look of you darling eve the way you look under my hands her breasts small and firm cupped neatly in his palms seemed to heat as he captured them water sparkled over her skin tiny diamonds that turned to tears and melted back into the blue give yourself to me his fingers trailed down her torso over her hips go under for me and slid into her she let out her breath on a sigh caught it again on a moan pleasure languid liquid lapped at her senses the sun dazzled her eyes until all she could see was blue he dazzled her body until all she could feel was bliss even as that pleasure swamped her as her knees buckled from the thrill of it the wave crashed over them stealing her breath and sweeping them closer to shore he rolled in it with her felt her release crest her body tremble while the water sucked them down tossed them free again she was locked around him trust need invitation everything he wanted as they lay tangled together in the surf he took her mouth again still patient though the need had begun to throb through him like a restless heart he skimmed his lips down her throat her shoulders her breasts while her hands stroked aroused urged the water streamed over them receded and to its constant endless beat he filled her moved with her dreamily with that pulse matching his own he watched her head arch back as the crest took her again roarke her voice was husky with passion her breath already quickening again give yourself to me go under for me love swamped him more than need it gushed through him took his air his heart his thoughts and with his eyes on hers still and always on hers he let himself drown o o the hour had to end but she wouldnt feel guilty for taking it dry dressed standing in her office she fully intended to brief roarke and scan his readout of the security system at purgatory feeney would take a closer look at it she thought and coordinate with roarke on that end shed station herself in control where she could oversee the club monitor the moves supervise all members of the team and be ready for any move ricker might make he knew my father she blurted it out without realizing it was there weighing on the center of her mind roarke about to explain the readout onscreen turned stared at her she didnt have to say a name didnt have to say anything he knew by her face youre sure of it i had a flashback last night this morning she corrected feeling ridiculously unsteady something tripped it i guess in the data i was studying and i was back just back sit down and tell me i cant sit all right just tell me i was in bed in my room i had a room i dont think i always had one i know i didnt always but i think there was some money to spare i think it was rickers money it was dark and i was listening because he was drinking in the next room and i was praying he would keep drinking he was talking to somebody about a deal i didnt understand i didnt care because as long as he kept talking kept drinking he wouldnt come in it was ricker he called him by name it was hard she hadnt expected it to be so hard to say it all when the image of it was still so brutally clear in her mind ricker was telling him what would happen if he screwed up the deal illegals i think it doesnt matter i recognized his voice i mean having the flashback i remembered i dont know if id ever heard it before that night i dont remember did you see him did he see you no but he knew about me my father said something about me when he was trying to get more money for the deal so he knew and after he left my father came in he was mad scared and mad he knocked me around a little then he told me to pack we were going to head south he said he had money and i think the illegals or some of them i dont remember any more except it was in new york im sure we were in new york and i think i think we ended up in dallas after the money ran out we were in dallas there wasnt any more money because we just had that horrible room and hardly any food and he didnt have enough to get drunk enough in dallas god eve he was beside her now his hands running up and down her arms stay here stay with me i am i will it spooked me thats all i know he gathered her in for a moment and realized on the heels of the flashback shed been called to the tower ambushed im sorry he turned her lips into her hair its a circle a circle link to link ricker to my father my father to me ricker to you you to me i dont believe in stuff like that but here i am they wont touch you through me he tipped her head back theyll never get through me to hurt you thats not what i meant i know but its a fact all the same well break the circle well do that together im more inclined to believe in such things as fate only when your irish comes out she managed a smile but moved away could he know about me could he have connected me from all those years ago i cant tell you if hed tried to track my father could he have found out who i am is it possible to dig up the data on me from before eve youre asking me to speculate could you she interrupted facing him again if you wanted the information could you find it she didnt want comfort he knew but facts given the time yes but i have considerably more to work with than he would but he could he has the capabilities particularly if hed begun to track my father when he was doublecrossed its possible i dont believe hed have wasted his time keeping track of an eightyearold girl who was sucked into the system but he knew when i went to see him that i had been in the system he knew where id been found and in what condition because he researched lieutenant eve dallas not because hed been keeping tabs on a young abused girl yes youre probably right it hardly matters anyway she paused by her desk lifted a small carved box hed given her for odds and ends you could find the data yes i could find it if thats what you want no she set the box down again its not what i want what i want is here theres nothing back there i need to know i shouldnt have let it get to me the way it did i didnt realize it had she sighed and this time she did smile when she turned i was too mad at you to think about it weve got a hell of a lot of work to do in a short amount of time you might as well come with me for now i thought you wanted to go over the security i do but back at central i only set up this meet here so i could yell at you in private isnt that odd i agreed to the meet here so i could yell at you in private shows how screwed up we are on the contrary he held out a hand for hers id say it shows were incredibly well suited for each other o o as trying to squeeze more than two people into eves cramped office violated several laws of physics she held the briefing in the conference room times short she began when her team was seated as the homicide cases and the matter of max ricker have dovetailed well be pursuing them both on parallel lines lab results data searches and probability scans regarding the homicides are in your reports i havent requested a warrant but will do so with an obligatory dna test if the suspect refuses to come in on his own volition peabody and i will pick him up quietly after the briefing probabilitys low feeney pointed out frowning at the printout in his file itll get higher and his dna will match that of the fingernail found on the bayliss crime scene due to sergeant clooneys years of service to the department his exemplary record his emotional state and the circumstances that built and were built around him i prefer to bring him in personally and hope to persuade him to make a full statement dr mira is on call to counsel him and offer testing the medias going to rock and roll over this eve gave mcnab a nod of acknowledgment we can and we will spin the media shed already decided to contact nadine furst a veteran officer with a perfect service record whose son only son follows in his footsteps a fathers pride a sons dedication because of that dedication because of that honor to the badge in a squad where a few cops and lets keep it at a few for public record are corrupt the son is targeted proving that feeney began we dont have to prove it she interrupted it just has to be said to be believed ricker she continued he was behind it i dont question that moreover clooney didnt his son was clean intended to stay clean he moved up the ranks to detective he couldnt be bought he was assigned in the early stages of the ricker op i have that from martinezs notes just a peg in the board but a good cop a hereditary cop put this together she suggested and rested a hip on the conference table hes straight hes young and hes smart hes ambitious the ricker task force is a good break for him and hes going to make the most of it he pushes he digs rickers sources in the squad relay that information theyre nervous ricker decides to make an example one night the good cop stops off in his neighborhood he habitually swung by there on his way home after his shift a robberys in progress look at the report that location hasnt been hit before or since but it was being hit that night at just the right time the good cop goes in and is killed the proprietor makes a frantic emergency call but it takes a squad car ten full minutes to arrive onscene and the medtechs due to whats reported to be a technical delay dont arrive for ten more the kid bleeds to death on the floor sacrificed she waited a beat knowing any cop in the room would see it as clearly as she did the squad car was manned by two men and their names were on the list vernon gave me this morning rickers men they let him die one of their own and the signal was sent this is what happens if you cross me okay it plays feeney agreed but if clooneys following the same dots why didnt he hit the cops in the squad car he did one of them transferred to philadelphia three months ago he was hanged in his bedroom ruling was selftermination but i think the ppsd will reopen that case thirty credits were scattered on the bed the other drowned slipped in a bathtub while on vacation in florida ruled accidental the coins were found there too hes been eliminating them for months peabody blew out a breath just ticking them off and going on with business until kohli kohli snapped him he liked kohli knew his family felt close to him more his son and kohli were friends and when ricker through iab planted kohli spread rumors that he was on the take it was like losing his son all over again the eliminations became more violent more personal and more symbolic blood on the badge he cant stop what he does now he does in his sons memory in his sons honor but knowing he killed an innocent man a good cop is breaking him down thats rickers angle he can sit back and watch us destroy each other from within hes not that clever not anymore roarke spoke up he wouldnt understand a man like clooney or that kind of love and grief luck he said he put the pieces on the tray and luck or if you prefer love linked them that may be but putting the pieces on the tray is enough to fry him which brings us to the second avenue of this investigation as you are now aware roarke has been enlisted as temporary civilian liaison on the matter of max ricker peabody are you familiar with the street name for civilian liaison peabody squirmed yes sir when eve merely waited peabody winced um weasel lieutenant the street names weasel i imagine roarke said that weasels are adept at catching rats good one feeney leaned over and slapped roarke on the back damn good one we have a very big rat for you she straightened jammed her hands in her pockets and outlined the plan for the rest of the team there was no doubt who was in command here roarke thought as he watched her who was in control she left no angle unexplored no corner unswept she prowled the room thinking on her feet and her voice was clipped in some past life shed have been wearing a generals braiding or armor and this woman this warrior had trembled in his arms that was the power between them the miracle of it roarke yes lieutenant something in his eyes had her heart stuttering a bit she clamped down on it frowned at him ill leave you to go over the security with feeney and mcnab i dont want any holes in it not a single pinprick there wont be any make sure of it im calling martinez in on this for the bust and shell get the collar when it goes down any objections she waited got none peabody youre with me she started out glanced back roarke was still watching her the faintest of smiles on that killer mouth the faintest glint in those wild blue eyes jesus he makes your mouth water sir nothing mortified she strode out nothing has my unit been repaired or replaced dallas thats so sweet i didnt know you believed in fairy tales damn it well steal one from somewhere then she began to grin ill just take roarkes oh tell me its the xx the its my favorite how the hell are we going to bring in a suspect in a twoseater its some snazzy sedan type today ive got the code wont he be surprised when he goes down and finds it gone i think distracted she nearly walked into webster lieutenant a minute of your time im low on minutes walk and talk youre going for clooney goddamn it though hed kept his voice low she whipped her head around to be sure no one had heard what makes you think that i still have my sources his face was grave and his voice remained quiet you left the breadcrumbs i can still follow the trail have you been in my files dallas he laid a hand on her arm felt the tremor of temper im deep in this part of what i did following orders may have sparked whats gone down i did the internal run on clooneys son i feel responsible let me go with you to pick him up she angled her head someone in iabs dirty in rickers pocket how do i know its not you his hand dropped away you dont he let out a breath you cant okay he stepped back started to turn hold on peabody she gestured moved a few steps away do you have a problem on staying with the briefing finishing the paperwork peabody glanced back at webster who was standing with his hands in his pockets and a miserable look on his face no sir all right set up an interview room block observation i dont want anybody nosing in while im talking to clooney lets give him what dignity we can ill take care of it good luck yeah she walked back to webster lets go he blinked then took in a breath thanks dont thank me youre along for ballast chapter twentyone peabody dawdled she procrastinated she fiddled then when she couldnt avoid it any longer she went back into the conference room some complex schematic was on the wall screen and feeney was whistling at it as though it were the image of a naked and nubile woman hey shebody whats up mcnab asked just a change of plans im going to sit in on the security briefing dallas isnt going for clooney feeney asked yeah yeah shes going as if it was vitally important she selected a chair brushed off the seat settled into it alone roarkes voice made her want to cringe but she looked up over his shoulder shrugged her own no no shes got somebody um youll have to explain the system to me in english i only speak pidgin techspeak whos with her roarke asked though he already knew it was just like her with her oh ah hmmm webster silence fell a clatter of broken bricks peabody folded her hands in her pockets and prepared for the explosion to follow i see when roarke simply turned back to the screen and continued she didnt know whether to be relieved or scared to death o o webster resisted barely making some smart comment about the sleek luxury car and instead settled in to enjoy the ride or tried to but his nerves were jumping okay lets just get this out of the way im not rickers man in iab i guess i figured there had to be one but i dont have a line on it i will have im going to make a point of it webster if i thought you were hooked to ricker youd still be back at central crawling over the floor trying to find what was left of your teeth it made him smile that means a lot to me yeah yeah save it so i went into your files you can kick me about that later if you want i had your code and password bayliss dug it out i didnt have any right to and blah blah but i did it i followed your line on clooney it was good work you expect me to blush and say aw shucks you try that crap again and ill have you up toothless before the review board fair enough you didnt get a warrant thats right what you gots thin but it spreads enough that a judge wouldve issued i dont want a warrant hes entitled to a little consideration bayliss hated cops like you webster looked out at new york the jam of it crowded colorful arrogant id forgotten what it was like to work this way its not something im going to forget again then listen up heres how we do it clooneys living on the west side its an apartment he moved out of his house in the burbs a couple months after his son died hang a busted marriage on ricker while youre at it its the middle of shift hes not going to be home you didnt finish his file its his day off if hes not there we knock on doors until somebody tells us where he might be and we go find him or we wait i do the talking hes going to come in voluntarily thats the way were going to make it happen dallas hes killed three cops five you didnt finish my notes either youre slipping webster a thorough cop is a happy cop she found the address started to doublepark then remembered she not only had roarkes snappy sedan but didnt have her on duty light cursing under her breath she cruised until she found a parking slot two blocks down and one level up its a secured building she noted nodding toward the security cam and code box we bypass it i dont want him to have time to get ready for us webster opened his mouth to remind her of the lack of warrant then closed it again it was her show after all she used her master keyed in her badge number a more sophisticated system would have requested her to state her police emergency but this one simply unlocked the outer doors fourth floor she told him heading inside and to the single elevator you carrying yeah i wasnt sure you guys in iab carried anything but a data book keep your weapon harnessed well hell i was looking forward to going through the door blasting im not a moron dallas iab moron iab moron i can never tell the difference but enough of this frivolity stand back she ordered when they reached the fourth level i dont want him seeing you through the peep he may not open the door for you sure he will he wonders about me she pressed the buzzer on the side of the door waited she felt herself being observed kept her face blank moments later clooney opened the door lieutenant i wasnt he broke off when webster shifted into the doorway i wasnt expecting company can we come in sergeant and speak to you sure sure dont mind the mess i was just making a sandwich the oldfashioned way he stepped back casual easy a good smart cop she thought later thats why she missed it he brought up the knife fast a smooth quick motion aimed at her throat she was a good smart cop too she might have dodged it it was something shed never know for certain webster shoved her hard enough to knock her off her feet and the movement the twist of his body put him in the path of the knife she shouted something as the blood spurted something as webster went down and was already scrambling to her knees already reaching for her weapon as clooney sprinted across the room if shed fired without warning fired into his back she would have had him the instinctive hesitation the ingrained loyalty cost her an instant and he was out the window and clambering down the fire escape she rushed to webster his breathing was short shallow and the blood was coming fast from the long slice that ran from his shoulder down across his chest jesus jesus im okay go shut up just shut up she ripped out her communicator as she leaped to her feet and ran to the window officer down officer down she rattled off the address scanning for clooney immediate medical assistance required this location officer down suspect fleeing on foot heading west suspect is armed and dangerous white male sixty years even as she spoke she was shrugging out of her jacket tearing through the apartment for towels five feet ten inches one hundred and eighty gray and blue subject is suspect on multiple homicides hold on webster you stupid son of a bitch you die on me im going to be supremely pissed sorry he sucked in his breath as she ripped his shirt pressed the folded towels over the wound christ it really hurts what the hell kind of he bore down fighting to stay conscious what the hell kind of knife was that how the hell should i know a big sharp one too much blood was all she could think too much blood already soaking through the towels it was bad it was really bad they sew you up youll get a goddamn commendation out of this scratch then youll be able to show it off to all your women and make them giddy bullshit he tried to smile but he couldnt see her the light was going gray he opened me up like a trout shut up i told you to shut up he made a little sighing sound then obliged her by passing out she cradled him sopping at blood and listened for the sirens o o she met whitney in the surgical waiting room her shirt and trousers were soaked with websters blood her face pale as death i screwed up i was sure i could reason with him that i could reach him and bring him in instead hes at large and another good cops dying websters getting the best care available every one of us is responsible for himself dallas i took him along it could be peabody on the operating table she thought oh god no way to win he took himself along regardless youve identified the suspect and have done so through skilled investigative work sergeant clooney wont be at large for long we have an allpoints hes known he fled with the clothes on his back he has no funds no resources a smart cop knows how to go under i let him go commander i did not take the opportunity to take him down nor did i pursue if you were again faced with making the choice of pursuing a suspect or saving a fellow officers life which way would you go id do the same thing she looked toward the operating room for what its worth so would i lieutenant go home get some sleep youll need all the resources of your own to finish this sir id like to wait until they can tell us something on webster all right lets get some coffee cant be any worse here than it is at central o o when she dragged herself home her system was begging to shut down but her mind refused she replayed the moment in clooneys doorway a hundred times had there been a flicker in his eyes one she should have seen responded to an instant before the knife came up if webster hadnt moved in could she have dodged and deflected what was the point she asked herself as she stepped into the house nothing changed eve roarke came out of the parlor where hed waited for her shed come home bloody before exhausted before and carrying a cloak of despair now she stood with all three hovering around her and just stared at him oh roarke im sorry he moved to her wrapped his arms around her im so sorry they dont think hes going to make it thats not what they say exactly but you can read it on their faces massive blood loss extreme internal damage the knife nicked his heart his lung and god knows theyve called his family in advised them to hurry however selfish it was didnt matter to him all he could think was it could have been you it could have been you and i would be the one advised to hurry come upstairs you need to clean up and get some sleep yeah nothing more to do but get some sleep she started toward the steps with him then just sank down on them buried her face in her hands what the hell was i thinking who the hell do i think i am miras the shrink not me what made me think i could get inside this mans head and understand what was going on in it because you can and you do you cant always be right he rubbed her back tell me what hes thinking now she shook her head got to her feet im too tired im too tired for this she walked upstairs stripping on her way across the bedroom before she could step into the shower roarke took her hand no into the tub youll sleep better for it he ran the water himself hot because she liked it hot added scent to soothe programmed the jets to comfort he undressed got in with her and drew her back against him he did it for me clooney was going for me and webster knocked me down and stepped into the knife roarke pressed his lips to the top of her head then i owe him a debt i can never repay but you can by finishing it and thats what youll do yeah ill finish it for now rest fatigue was a weight bearing down on her she stopped resisting and fell under it o o she woke to sunlight and the scent of coffee the first thing she saw was roarke with a mug of coffee in his hand how much would you pay for this name your price she sat up took it from him drank gratefully this is one of my favorite parts of the marriage deal she let the caffeine flow through her system i mean the sex is pretty good but the coffee the coffee is amazing and youre allaround handy yourself most of the time thanks dont mention it she took his hand before he could rise i wouldnt have slept easy last night without you being here she gave his hand a squeeze then shifted toward the bedside link i want to call and check on webster ive already called she wouldnt want it cushioned so he told her exactly what he knew he made it through the night they nearly lost him twice and took him back in for more surgery he remains critical okay she set the coffee down to scrub her hands over her face okay he felt like he needed vindication lets give it to him o o purgatory had taken on an edge glamour with a bright smear of sin fast repair work eve muttered as she wandered through scanning the trio of winding open stairs with their treads edged with hot red lights on closer study she noted the banisters that curved down them were sleek and sinuous snakes and every few feet one was swallowing its brothers tail interesting yes roarke ran one of his elegant hands over a reptilian head i thought so and practical start up why humor me with a shrug she climbed the first three so feeney do we register on weapon check you bet scanner shows policeissue laser on staircase one and secondary weapon in ankle harness eve glanced up toward control and the hidden speakers where feeneys voice boomed with a thin smile she looked back at roarke why dont you come on up for a weapon scan ace i think not similar scanners are set in all entrances and exits in the bathrooms and privacy rooms well know what were up against in that area boomers she said coming down again knives we can scan for explosives knives are trickier though the metal detectors will take care of any fashioned from that material an hour before opening the entire building will be swept a final time just as a precaution where do you plan to hold the meet weve divided the area into twentytwo sectors each will have individual security and all will line to the main control ill have a privacy booth in sector twelve there he gestured to a table on the edge of the entertainment platform she ran her gaze up over the gold and red poles that lanced up from the stage the pie plate topped columns the humansized gilded cages close to the action well now the show must go on the booths been rigged specifically for our purposes audio and video will be transmitted directly to the control hell insist on a scan probably a jammer yes he will but the system design will override anything he has youre awfully cocky confident lieutenant i designed the system myself and have already tested it two of my handpicked security will be onstage performing during the meet youve got security strippers dont hate them because theyre beautiful if its necessary to deal with any of rickers men theyll do so the deal didnt include civilian hammers well have cops in every sector he nodded pleasantly i could of course simply set up my personal security team without informing you of it but as a temporary civilian attache i feel obliged to relay all pertinent information to the team commander smartass i love you too the bathrooms are mag peabody reported as she strode up wait till you see dallas the sinks are like little lakes and there are like a million miles of counter all this sexy art painted on the walls and even sofas she caught herself before eve could reply cleared her throat mcnab and i completed our runthrough sir and all security audio visual and scans are operational your uniform jacket is improperly secured officer peabody my she looked down turned bright pink to the roots of her bowlcut hair and hastily began to secure the brass buttons mcnab had so hastily undone oh for christs sake peabody are you a damn rabbit go fix yourself up somewhere and put your hormones on hold for awhile yes sir sorry sir peabody slunk away and left eve scowling at roarke dont think i dont know what a big fat kick youre getting out of this i told you this thing with mcnab was going to screw up my aide as a recent liaison to the nypsd i found the conduct disgraceful he turned back leading with the grin that made his face impossibly young ridiculously beautiful absolutely disgraceful i think we should go do a runthrough of the lounges personally right now pervert she jammed her hands in her pockets and was about to walk away from him and up to control when the main door opened rue maclean stepped in she hesitated when eves cold stare blasted her then straightened her shoulders and crossed the room they met in front of the bar where kohli had served his last drink ms maclean lieutenant im perfectly aware of what you think of me and youre entitled to say it to my face why waste my breath i walked through a cops blood on this floor that says enough eve roarke touched her shoulder he turned to rue youve seen ricker yes hes not here he gestured to the side wall the control panel as the elevator it operated was hidden in the mural depicting the fall of adam the door slid open to a small private car they rode silently to the owners office roarke moved to a friggie behind a smoked mirror took out chilled bottles of spring water poured why dont you sit down rue conversations with ricker have a tendency to shake the spirit yes thanks arent we polite furious eve gestured away roarkes offer of water arent we just delightful and civilized you want to trust her pal thats your privilege dont expect the same consideration from me she set you up thats right roarke put the glass in rues unsteady hand and now shes returning the favor and not without risk roarke took rues hand and though she tried to jerk free he calmly unbuttoned her cuff and rolled the sleeve up on the arm hed noticed her favoring dark ugly bruises ran from wrist to elbow he hurt you im sorry he likes hurting people bruises fade im sure your wife will agree i deserve a great deal worse he has fingers like spikes was all eve said but she felt herself shift inside why did he use them on you because he could for the most part if he hadnt believed me id have gotten that and worse passing on the information from you put him in a good mood she took a drink set the glass aside it ran almost exactly as you thought it would i went to him asked for money for information that pissed him off so i let him push me around a little until i gave it for free that also cheered him up absently she rebuttoned her cuff i told him you were distracted badtempered how you were cracking the whip to get the place open because it was costing you money to keep the doors closed that and your feathers were ruffled because the cops were breathing down your neck i topped it off by saying i overheard you arguing with your wife good roarke sat on the arm of a chair you were going around about the investigation how it was looking for you and more about the position she was putting herself in youre frantic about that and pushing her to resign from the force you two had a real blowup about that i told him there were some hard words about being on opposite sides of the line and you just lost it i hope you dont mind that i painted a very clear picture of a man on the edge you were getting damn tired of walking on eggshells tired of losing money by keeping your business on her side a lot of threats and recriminations you cried she said to eve not without some satisfaction well thanks he liked that part anyway after you stormed out i went in offered roarke a sympathetic ear he was prime for it so we had a couple drinks thats when you told me youd had enough of the straight life you were bored restless and your marriage was shaky not that you didnt love your wife but you needed an outlet she didnt have to know you were dipping back into the pool did she you needed something to distract you from worrying about her and you figured you might kill two birds by going to ricker and making a deal a nice quiet business association the high side of profit for him and he leaves your wife alone youre going to get her off the force but you want her in one piece while you work on that youre stupid in love with her but damned if shes going to castrate you and keep you on a leash i agreed with you then offered to talk to ricker for you that was the part that took him awhile to buy she touched her fingers to her sore arm i convinced him you agreed to it because you havent been yourself youd gone soft and careless in certain areas i think he swallowed it because its what he wanted and because he doesnt believe id have the guts to lie to him she picked up her glass again wet her throat it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be she decided he was biting at the bait before id finished hanging it the lawyer canarde he doesnt like it but ricker told him to shut up when he didnt ricker threw a paperweight at him missed but it left a hell of a dent in the wall ah to be a fly eve murmured it was a moment rue agreed in any case canarde shut up then and ricker will be here he wont miss the chance to humiliate you to grind you under his heel a bit and if he sniffs out that he shouldve listened to the lawyer to take you out where you stand if he cant have you ruined hell have you dead those were his words exactly then its perfect roarke decided and he felt the thrill of the hunt heat his blood not quite eve hooked her thumbs in her front pockets and turned toward rue why didnt you have roarke cry rue shot her a look of such profound gratitude eve had hope it was all going to work chapter twentytwo time was running short running two critical operations meant every hour was crammed with two hours work and worry she left purgatory in roarkes perhaps toocompetent hands and switching gears drove out to clooneys suburban house whitney already had baxter question the wife peabody said and earned a steeltipped stare from eve im following up do you have a problem with that officer no sir no problem at all time might have been rushing by for eve but for peabody it seemed the next thirty hours were going to crawl like a slug she decided it best not to mention the surveillance car parked in full view of the singlestory ranch house on the postagestamp lot clooney would spot it too if he attempted to get to the house maybe that was the point keeping her silence she followed eve up the walk waited at the door the woman who opened it might have been pretty in a round homey way but at the moment she merely looked exhausted unhappy and afraid eve identified herself and held up her badge you found him hes dead no no mrs clooney your husband hasnt been located may we come in theres nothing i can tell you that hasnt already been said but she turned away shoulders slumped as if they carried a fierce burden and walked across the tidy little living area chintz and lace faded rugs old comfortable chairs an entertainment screen that had seen better days and she noted a statue of the virgin mother of christ on a table with her serene compassionate face looking out over the room mrs clooney i have to ask if your husbands contacted you he hasnt he wouldnt its just as i told the other detective i think somehow theres been a terrible mistake absently she pushed a lock of brown hair as faded as the rugs away from her face art hasnt been well hasnt been himself for a long time but he wouldnt do the things youre saying he did why wouldnt he contact you mrs clooney youre his wife this is his home yes she sat as if her legs just couldnt hold her up any longer it is but he stopped seeing that stopped believing that hes lost lost his way his hope his faith nothings been the same to us since thad died mrs clooney eve sat leaning forward in an attitude that invited trust and confidence i want to help him i want to get him the kind of help he needs where would he go i just dont know i would have once she took a tattered tissue from her pocket he stopped talking to me stopped letting me in at first when thad was killed we clung together we grieved together he was the most wonderful young man our thad she looked toward a photograph in a frame of polished silver of a young man in full dress uniform we were so proud of him when we lost him we held on tight to each other to that love and pride we shared that love and pride with his wife and sweet baby it helped having our grandchild close by she rose picked up another photograph this time thad posed with a smiling young woman and a roundcheeked infant what a lovely family they made her fingers brushed lovingly over the faces before she set the photograph down again sat then a few weeks after we lost thad art began to change to brood and snap he wouldnt share with me he wouldnt go to mass we argued then we stopped even that existing in this house she said looking around at the familiar the comforting as if it all belonged to strangers instead of living in it do you remember mrs clooney when that change in your husband began oh nearly four months ago doesnt seem like a long time i suppose when you think of more than thirty years together but it felt like forever the timing worked eve calculated slid the puzzle piece of the first murder into place some nights he wouldnt come home at all and when he did he slept in thads old room then he moved out he told me he was sorry that he had to set things right before he could be a husband to me again nothing i could say could change his mind and god forgive me at that point i was so tired so angry so empty inside i didnt care that he was going she pressed her lips together blinked away the tears i dont know where he is or what hes done but i want my husband back if i knew anything that would make that happen id tell you eve left canvassed the neighborhood talked to neighbors and was given nothing but a picture of puzzled disbelief clooney had been a good friend a loving husband and father a trusted member of the community no one had heard from him or would admit to it do you believe them peabody asked as they headed back to the city i believe his wife shes too afraid and confused to lie he knows wed cover the house friends and relatives hes not stupid enough to go to any knowns but i had to check well go back to central run through his data again maybe something will click but two hours through and nothing had she pressed her fingers to her eyes thought about more coffee then opened them and saw mira in the doorway youre overdoing it eve my backs to the wall im sorry did we have a meeting no but i thought you could use my professional opinion on clooney at this point yeah i could she glanced around sighed this place is a dump i wouldnt let the cleaning crew in the last few days security clearances arent enough right now dont worry about it mira made herself comfortable with a hip on the side of eves desk i dont believe he has or can change his agenda hell still be focused on you which means hell stay close he said he wouldnt kill another cop too but he sure didnt hesitate to slice that knife into webster that was impulse rather than calculated he wanted you and even then he would have considered it selfdefense you were coming for him you and a member of internal affairs i believe hes still in the city still using whatever considerable skill he has to observe and regroup wouldnt you yeah thats exactly what id do if id decided i had to end something would die trying shed thought it over carefully in one of her journeys into clooneys head he means to die doesnt he doctor yes i think so hell give you until the stated deadline and if you dont prove yourself to his satisfaction hell try to kill you he may finish this by an attempted assassination of ricker then he will almost certainly selfterminate he will not be able to face his wife his colleagues his priest but he will face his son im not going to let that happen o o she intended to go straight home shed called the hospital to check on webster and was told there was no change but as with clooneys wife she had to check for herself she strode down the corridor toward icu dreading every step hating the scent the sound the feel of the hospital when the nurse on duty demanded if she was family she didnt hesitate she lied and moments later found herself in the narrow cubicle made smaller by the bed and machines looking down on websters white face well this is just dandy isnt it didnt i tell you this was going to piss me off you know how bad it makes me look for you to be lying here taking the easy way damn it webster she broke down and laid a hand over his cold she thought his was too cold you think i have time for this im up to my ears in work and instead of lending a hand youre just stretched out hiding in a coma youd better get up off your ass she leaned down spoke clear and strong into his face you hear me you bastard youd better get up off your ass because ive had too many cops die on my watch just lately im not letting you add to the number and if you think ill put a posy on your grave and shed a tear you are wrong pal ill spit on it she squeezed his hand waited for a response that didnt come jerk she muttered with more affection than shed realized she had for him she turned away came to a skidding halt when she saw roarke at the door a thousand thoughts jumbled into her head and not a single one of them came through clearly i thought you might drop by here i was just her hands found her pockets on the end of a shrug trying to help a friend he finished and crossed to her he laid his hands on her shoulders touched his lips to her forehead the gesture was very gentle very supportive and very married do you think i begrudge that i guess not its a the situation is a little weird thats all do you want to stay with him awhile longer no i said what i came to say but she glanced back when he comes out of this im going to kick his ass just for the hell of it ill hold your coat roarke slipped an arm around her lets go home lieutenant we have a busy day tomorrow o o it was busy and went by too quickly from her station in security control she was able to watch any and every section of the club onscreen she argued about the lights too dim but he hadnt changed them she sniped about the music too loud but hed gone his own way there as well now she saw shed missed one more angle to hassle him over the crowd she hadnt anticipated the number of people whod pour in jam in elbow in for the clubs reopening she went on slow burn realizing that roarke would have anticipated it we dont have enough cops she said to feeney he hasnt been open an hour and theyre packed in like hes offering free drinks and group sex to every second customer might be he is hes got a way with drumming up business were okay dallas this security setupll handle it look there we got a joker in sector two table six spiking his ladys drink a little exoticad be my guess let roarkes security handle that kind of thing she rested a hand on feeneys shoulder as they both watched the screen i dont want police interference in the routine and she wanted to see just how good his security was damn good she decided when within thirty seconds a large man in a black suit strolled up to the table in question confiscated the drink and lifted the offender out of his chair in one smooth move slick and quiet feeney commented thats the way to keep things steady i dont like it i dont like the whole deal too much can go wrong nothings going to go wrong you just got the heebiejeebies the what ants in your pants nervous twitters damn it feeney ive never twittered in my life doing it now he said solemnly but there was a chuckle in his tone the man can handle himself dallas nobody better yeah maybe thats what worries me onscreen she picked roarke out easily watched him move through the crowd as if his biggest concern was the cut of his suit and she was two floors up and breaking a sweat because she was two floors up she admitted shed have felt better been cooler if shed been down in the action like peabody she thought idling at the bar in plain clothes peabody you read at the bar peabody gave a barely perceptible nod as eves voice hummed in her ear that better be a soft drink youre guzzling then came the smirk for some reason it made eve feel better the buzzer sounded at the door with one hand on her weapon she stepped over checked the security screen disengaging locks she opened it martinez youre away from your station theres time can i have a minute i didnt have the chance to say it before she continued lowering her voice and if things go the way we want there wont be time after i want to thank you for bringing me in on this you earned it you better believe it but you didnt have to bring me in you ever need a favor from me or my squad youll have it acknowledged and appreciated thought youd like to know the word on roth too shes getting slapped on record theyre sending in an evaluator and shes going to be required to submit to counseling she gets a sixmonth probationary period before they decide if she keeps her command it was a hard knock for a woman like roth eve mused but couldve been a lot worse for her yeah some were betting shed just toss in and resign but no way shell tough it out yeah i think she will now if weve finished our gossip session get back to your station martinez flashed a grin yes sir eve secured the door again and returned to the screens she started to sit to settle then tensed god why didnt i think of it thats mavis mavis and leonardo going with the gut or the heart she switched to roarkes channel mavis just walked in she and leonardo are moving through section five get rid of them make them go home ill take care of them was his murmured response and all she could do was stand by helplessly roarke mavis gave a squeal of delight and launched herself decked out in swirl of blue feathers over a gold body paint job into his arms the place is mag even more mag than before wheres dallas isnt she here for the big night shes working oh bumtime well well keep you company listen to that band theyre incendiary cant wait to dance youll have a better view from the second level lots of action down here there too hed never get them out not without an explanation but he could calm eves nerves by moving them as far away as possible rue he signaled his manager these are friends of mine get them the best table on the second level their tabs on the house thats gracious of you leonardo clasped hands with mavis and unnecessary its my pleasure ive got some business to see to shortly when its done ill come up and join you for a drink aw youre so sweet well see you upstairs later when he was sure they were on their way roarke strolled over to mcnab keep an eye on them make certain theyre tucked up until this is played out dont worry he replied onstage the dancers stripped and shimmied and managed to look as though they were enjoying the exercise while the band pounded out a brutal drum beat a thin and atmospheric blue mist crawled over the floor prowling around the dancers was a hologram of a snarling black panther wearing a collar of silver spikes each time he threw back his head and called the crowd roared back at him roarke turned his back on gleaming skin and hunting cats and watched ricker walk into purgatory he hadnt come alone nor had roarke expected him to a dozen men fanned out scoping the room with hard eyes half of them began to move through the crowd they would be the front sweep he concluded and would be carrying miniscanners highpowered to locate and record the security cams the alarms the scopes they would find only what hed elected to have them find ignoring them he cut through the bright glitter of people to face ricker okay eve said from her station run through the marks i want everyone to acknowledge everyone to move into first position lets do this right and where before shed sweat out the wait she was now coldly in command feeney give me a weapons check i want to know whos carrying and how many already coming through and so she thought as she kept her eyes on the screen was roarke its been awhile roarke said rickers lips curved just at the corners quite a long while he looked away from roarke just long enough to sweep his gaze over the club impressive he said with the slightest hint of boredom but a strip club is still a strip club however its trimmed and business is still business id heard youve had a little trouble with yours nothing that hasnt been dealt with really you lost a few of your clients last year i did some restructuring ah yes a wedding present perhaps to your most charming wife leave my wife out of it difficult if not impossible it was satisfying extremely satisfying to hear that hint of tension in roarkes voice thered been a time ricker thought it wouldnt have shown but we can discuss just what youre willing to trade for that kind of consideration as with an effort roarke took a breath appeared to calm himself well use my booth ill buy you a drink as he started to turn one of rickers guards laid a hand on his arm stepped in to check him for weapons roarke simply shifted gripped the mans thumb and jerked it backward too much weakness too quickly would after all be suspect do that again and ill rip it off at the knuckle and feed it to you his eyes went back to rickers and you know it im glad to see at least that much hasnt changed ricker gestured his man back but you can hardly expect me to have a drink without some basic precautions have one of the sweepers scan me and the booth if that doesnt satisfy fuck yourself its my place now a muscle in rickers cheek jumped and he felt the rush of heat through his gut but he nodded i never cared for that irish temper of yours however colorful but as you say its your place for the moment all right eve said theyre moving to the booth feeney tell me his systems going to override their scan it overrode mine i asked him to show me the design but he just smiled he swiveled toward a secondary monitor look see their sweeps coming up clean getting just what roarke said it would get and nothing else now well settle us down for a little alcoholic refreshment and conversation peabody eve said reading off the weapons scan your man is left end of the bar mixed race black suit fiveten a hundred fifty shoulderlength black hair hes armed with a policeissue laser waist holster got him at peabodys nod she continued everyone keep individual targets in close visual range but do not move in do not move in to apprehend or disarm until ordered martinez your man is o o your droid squad stays out of the booth roarke said as he stepped into the tube i dont talk business with an audience my thoughts exactly ricker moved into the privacy dome sat as the opening whisked shut behind him he had what he wanted now what hed planned for over the years roarke would beg roarke would fall and if he struggled too hard too long the laser scalpel up rickers left sleeve would carve considerable regret in that young and handsome face hell of a view he commented as the dancers spun onstage you always did have a taste for women a weakness for them true enough as i recall you just like to knock them around you put bruises on my wife did i ricker asked innocently oh this is what he craved what hed been itching for so very long how careless of me does she know were having this conversation or does she let you keep your balls now and then roarke took out his cigarettes tapping one on the table as he met rickers sneer an inner struggle showed on his face and made ricker laugh then roarke turned to the menu whiskey he ordered lifted a brow the same for old times sake two whiskeys jamesons doubles and straight up then he sat back lighted the cigarette and ill say this straight up and thats for old times sake as well my marriage stays out of your reach roarkes voice took on an edge then he paused as if to control it youve tried for my wife and shes tossed what youve sent at her back at you shes been lucky but rickers mouth was tight as he reached for one of the glasses of amber liquid that came through the serving slot luck eventually breaks roarkes hand shot out as if he caught himself at the last moment he drew it back glancing out toward the guard who had moved closer whose own hand had drifted under his coat what do you want in trade for a guarantee of her safety ah pleased ricker sat back again thats a reasonable question but why i wonder should you think id offer a reasonable answer to it ill make it worth your while roarke said quickly too quickly for pride or business sense that will take some doing thrilled already desperate to push he leaned forward you see i find i enjoy hurting your wife listen no youll listen youll shut that arrogant mouth of yours as i should have shut it for you years ago and youll listen do you understand the man must have a death wish roarke heard feeneys voice clearly enough appreciated the truth of his observation he fisted both hands on the table let his breath in and out audibly yes i understand just give me some terms damn it were businessmen tell me what you want please christ you miserable prick roarke thought carefully he cleared his throat picked up his whiskey drank please tell me what you want better much better a number of years ago you rashly severed our association and did so in a manner that cost me one point two million in cash and merchandise and twice that in reputation and goodwill so to start ill take ten million in us dollars and what precisely will that ten million buy me precisely roarke your wifes life transfer that amount to an account ill give you by midnight tonight or i will initiate the contract on her that i have pending you need to give me a little time to midnight or i terminate her even you should hesitate before contracting on a cop and such a highprofile one i owe you a great deal more than one cop your choice keep the money lose the woman he ran the saber points of his nails over the side of the glass in a nasty shrieking sound its not negotiable thats enough right there eve murmured its enough to put him away hell get more feeney shifted in his seat hes just warming up shes worth ten million to me but roarke lifted his glass sipped slowly now as if calculating i believe we forge a truer trust in this matter by adding to the arrangement im interested in more than a single deal i have some funds id prefer to invest in a manner that doesnt require government scrutiny tired of being an upstanding citizen in a word yes he shrugged glanced around and let his gaze linger just a moment too long on the dancer grinding out her routine on the other side of the dome and in doing so he felt rickers amusement im considering changing my home base doing some traveling im looking for some new business ventures something with some juice and youre coming to me you would dare to come to me as if were equals youll have to crawl before i throw you a scrap then this conversation is pointless roarke shrugged again but made it jerky drained his glass you used to be so cocky so cold now look at you shes sucked you dry gone soft havent you forgotten what its like to give orders that change lives that end them i could end yours now with a snap of my finger rickers eyes gleamed as he leaned close whispered maybe i will for old times sake it was brutally hard not to smash that leering face with his fist and take out the guard with his hand under his coat then you wont get your ten million or anything else from me maybe you have a right to be angry with the way i backed out on you before backed out backed out he pounded his fist on the table shouting so that at the control station feeneys ears rang you betrayed me stole from me you threw my generosity back in my face i should have killed you for it perhaps i still will you want payback ricker for what i did or didnt do im willing to pay im willing i know what youre capable of i respect that for effect roarke added a slight tremor to his hand as he ordered a second round ive still got sources and resources we can be an asset to each other my connection to the nypsd is valuable in itself ricker let out a short laugh his chest was hurting from the pounding of his heart he didnt want another whiskey he wanted his beautiful pink drink but he would finish first finish roarke first i dont need your cop you pathetic fool ive got a whole damn squad in my pocket not like her roarke edged forward eager to deal i want her out but until i convince her she can be useful very useful to you shes barely useful to you rumor is you and she are having some marital difficulties just some bumps theyll pass the ten million will help that roarke said as he took the second round of drinks it takes the pressure off and ill get her to resign before much longer im working on it why as you said a police connections useful i want a wife not a bloody cop i prefer having my woman available at my convenience not running around all hours of the day and night investigating cases scowling now he drank deeply a mans entitled to that isnt he if i want a cop ill buy one i dont have to marry one it was better ricker calculated even better than hed expected hed have roarkes money his humiliation and his obligation and he could hold all of them until he killed him i can arrange it for you arrange what her resignation ill have her out in a months time in return for this place i want it back and theres a little matter of a shipment im expecting the client i anticipated for it hasnt proved financially solvent take it off my hands for well say another ten million turn the deed to this club over to one of my subsidiaries and well have a deal whats the merchandise pharmaceuticals you know i dont have the contacts to deal in illegals dont tell me what you do or dont have rickers voice spiked all but cracked who do you think you are to turn your nose up at me he lunged over the table grabbed roarke by the collar i want what i want hes unstable we need to move in she was already striding out of the room when feeney called out hold on let it play out i cant stay up here im not turning up my nose roarke said quickly nervously i havent developed the sources for illegals distribution thats your problem your problem youll do what i say all that i say or get nothing take the deal or the consequences let me think for gods sake pull your men back lets not have any trouble in here fine thats fine no trouble well hes mad roarke thought stark and raving the rumors of rickers instability hadnt touched on the reality twenty millions a lot of money but im willing to risk it to get what i want and to pay the debt i owe you but i need to know how youd work her out of the department without it coming back on me it was rickers breathing that was audible now but he didnt hear it he picked up his whiskey and his hand trembled but he didnt see it all he saw was the fulfillment of a longcherished wish i can ruin her career inside of a week yes in no time at all strings to be pulled the case shes working on now she annoys me she insulted me laughed at me shell apologize roarke all but crooned it ill see to it yes shell have to do that have to apologize i wont tolerate anyone laughing at me especially a woman he had to be pushed roarke thought gently and quickly she will you have the controls you have the power thats right of course i do if i let her live as a favor to you ill take a fee for moving her off the case and out of the department misinformation skewed data in the right computer it works roarke rubbed the back of his hand over his mouth the cops whove been killed for christs sake ricker youre behind that and therell be more before its done it amuses me i dont want any part in cop killing theyll bury you dont be ridiculous theyll never touch me i didnt kill anyone i simply put the idea in the right head the weapon in the most vulnerable hand just a game you remember how fond i am of games and how i enjoy winning them yes i remember no one did it better how did you pull this off arrangements roarke i enjoy arrangements and watching how the pieces fall into place i sleep with a woman in the department and i cant get that close roarkes voice filled with admiration i underestimated you it must have taken years to set up months only a few months its simply a matter of selecting the right target a young cop too stiffnecked to play the game eliminating him is simple enough but the beauty is how it can be connected how it can be expanded upon by planting the seeds in the heart of the grieving father then i simply sit back and watch a oncededicated cop kill again and again and it costs me nothing brilliant roarke murmured yes and satisfying best i can do it again any time i like murder by proxy no ones safe certainly not you transfer the money and until the wind changes ill protect you and your wife that was twenty million for the moment a bargain roarke said quietly brought the hand hed slipped under the table under his jacket back into view and the gun with it but i find the idea of doing business with you turns my stomach oh tell your man to hold or itll give me great pleasure to use this recognize it ricker its one of the banned weapons you trafficked in years back i have quite a collection of twentiethcentury handguns and a collectors license they leave a horrible nasty hole in a man this ones a ninemillimeter glock and will blow your face right off the skull the shock of having a weapon aimed at him robbed ricker of speech it had been years a lifetime since anyone had dared youve lost your mind no indeed mines sound enough he slapped a hand on rickers wrist twisted viciously until the laser scalpel fit into his own palm you always had a weakness for sharp things youll die painfully for this painfully do you think youll walk out of this place breathing certainly ah theres my wife now lovely isnt she and by the sound of things through the scanner your inferior sweepers missed it appears your team of fools is even now being rounded up and moved along he waited while ricker focused beyond him through the dome and saw for himself one of us has lost his touch ricker and it appears to be you i set you up and it was childs play for a cop eyes wild ricker leaped to his feet you rolled on me for a cop id have done it for a mongrel dog given half the chance ah please try for it roarke murmured and make my life worth living enough roarke back off eve opened the door to the booth slid her police issue into rickers ribs youre dead youre both dead he whirled backhanded eve as he leaped she took the blow and dropped him tell me you had it on full hes stunned thats all she wiped the blood from her mouth with her sleeve and ignored the scramble of people who rushed away from the trouble onstage the strippers continued to dance roarke handed her a handkerchief then reached down lifting rickers head off the floor by his throat dont keep back he snapped as eve crouched to hold him off youll bloody well keep back till ive finished this if you kill him its been for nothing he stared at her face and all the strength the purpose all the danger he hadnt shown to ricker leaped out of them it would be for everything but i dont mean to kill him to prove it he handed her the glock but he kept the scalpel and holding its keen point to the pulse in rickers throat imagined you can hear me cant you ricker you can hear me well enough im the one who took you down and youll remember it while youre pacing the box theyll put you in youll think of it every day with whats left of your mind kill you ricker choked out but he couldnt so much as lift his hand well you havent managed that as yet have you but youre welcome to try again listen to me now and carefully touch her put your hand on whats mine again and ill follow you to hell and peel the skin from your bones ill feed you your own eyes i take an oath on it remember what i was and youll know ill do it and worse he straightened again his body rigid get someone to drag him out of here this is my place chapter twentythree she didnt sleep long but she slept deeply knowing ricker was in a cage hed screamed for his lawyer quite literally once the effects of the stun had worn off since shed whipped right around and dumped canarde in a cage as well rickers lawyer was going to be a very busy boy for awhile shed made two copies of every record disc of the operation in purgatory she sealed all of them and secured one copy in her home office there would be no lost evidence no missing data no damaged files this time around and they had him cold she told herself it was enough would have to be enough then had tumbled into bed she switched off like a frayed circuit then came awake with a jolt when roarke put a hand on her shoulder and said her name what instinctively she reached down where her weapon would have been had she not been naked easy lieutenant im unarmed and so are you i was whoa she shook her head to clear it out i noticed im sorry to wake you why are you up why are you dressed what time is it a bit past seven i had some early calls to take and while i was at it one came in from the hospital webster she whispered she hadnt checked on him the night before after the operation was complete and now too late she thought hes awake roarke continued and it seems hed like to see you awake alive and awake apparently both he improved last night hes still in serious condition but stable theyre cautiously hopeful ill take you you dont need to do that id like to besides if he thinks im guarding my territory he lifted her hand nipped the knuckle it might cheer him up territory my ass your ass is ill point out my exclusive territory she tossed the cover aside and gave him a good view of that territory as she dashed toward the shower ill be ready in ten minutes take your time i dont believe hes going anywhere she took twenty because he bribed her with coffee and she indulged in a second cup as he got behind the wheel do we take him flowers or something i think not if you did that the shock would likely put him back in a coma youre such a funny guy and so early in the morning too she sipped her coffee bided her time that urn phrase feed you your own eyes is that some kind of irish curse not that im aware of so you just made it up on the spot last night ive said it before and ill say it again youre scary id have killed him for striking you if you hadnt been in the way i know it so shed made certain shed stayed in the way you had no business bringing that handgun carrying a banned weapon into a public place you know how much dancing im going to have to do on that one who says it was loaded was it of course but whos to say relax lieutenant you brought him down no i didnt you did compromise he decided which weve neglected to do just lately we brought him down ill take that one more thing all that business about a man having this right and that right and wanting your woman when you want her that was just show right are you going to share that coffee she moved it just a little farther out of reach no it was just show right well now let me think it might be nice to have the little woman puttering about the house and meeting me at the door of an evening after a hard days business with a smile and a drink thats a lovely image isnt it he turned to see her snarling at him and laughed how long before wed be bored brainless with it do you figure its a good thing you said that before i wasted this very nice coffee by pouring it into your lap but im still not sharing it when they turned into hospital parking she shifted on her seat to face him its going to take several days to close this ricker business and hand it over to the pa his psych evaluation is going to be one big mess seeing as hes loon crazy hell end up in a mental defective prison unit oh yeah and believe me theyre no picnic anyway weve got a lot of people to interview and i cant calculate how many of his businesses and properties to search and seize im letting martinez take the bulk of it but im still going to be tied up for awhile if you can put off the trip you need to take to olympus id like to go with you he pulled into a slot stopped the car youd voluntarily take off several days not only that but go off planet without me having to drug you i said id like to go with you if youre going to make a big deal out of it we can just quiet down he leaned over kissed her sulky mouth ill put it off until we can go together okay good she climbed out of the car stretched look theres some whattayacallems daffodils he said and caught her hand in his daffodils eve its spring finally feels like it too she kept her hand in his as they walked into the hospital and all the way to websters tiny room his face wasnt gray as it had been the last time shed been there but it wasnt pink with health either instead it was as white as the bandages stretched across his chest she felt a trip of alarm cut into her cheerful mood as he lay silent and still i thought they said he was awake even as she said it in a sickroom whisper websters eyes fluttered open they stayed dazed for a moment with the baffled vulnerable look of the very ill then as they focused the faintest glint of humor shot into them hey she had to step closer his voice was pitifully thin you didnt have to bring the guard dog im too weak to make a halfdecent pass at you you never worried me in that area webster i know damn it thanks for coming its okay its not much out of my way he started to laugh lost his breath then just lay there concentrating on finding it again you stupid bastard she said it with enough passion to bring that baffled look back on his face huh you think i cant handle myself that i need some idiot iab moron halfass to knock me down and stick out his chest for a knife no the humor was coming back i dont know what got into me if youd stuck with the streets instead of getting fat and happy behind a stupid desk you wouldnt be lying here and when youre on your feet im going to put you right back in the hospital thatll be fun give me something to look forward to did you get him they wont tell me a damn thing in here no no i didnt get him shit he closed his eyes again thats on me oh shut up she stalked to the tiny window fisted her hands on her hips while she tried to calm down in her place roarke moved to the side of the bed thank you youre welcome and that was all they needed to say on the subject we got ricker eve continued as her anger abated took him down last night what how webster tried to sit up couldnt even lift his head and swore with as much energy as he could muster its a long story ill fill you in some other time but we got him solid and have his lawyer on the hot seat for good measure and a dozen of his men she turned back walked to the bed hes going to stay in md status by the looks of things and were going to take his organization apart piece by piece i can help do some of the data searches run scans let me in on this ill go crazy in here with nothing to do stop youre breaking my heart then she shrugged ill think about it come on you know youll cave on it you feel sorry for me he managed a grin and i should tell you both of you so theres no baggage im pretty much on the way to getting over you that really adds to my peace of mind webster it does a lot for mine only took getting sliced in half more or less nothing like a good coma to give a guy the opportunity to put things in perspective his eyes drooped nearly shut before he fought them open again man the meds just knock you out so get some sleep word gets out youre coming around youll have plenty of company youll need all the rest you can manage yeah but wait he was losing it struggling to hold out another minute i gotta ask you a question did you come in before before what come on dallas before now did you come in and talk to me maybe i dropped in to see what an idiot looked like why cause i had this dream maybe a dream you were standing over me i was just floating and you were standing there ragging my ass ever tell you how sexy you look when youre ragging ass jesus sorry a little re residual lust dya say youd spit on my grave yeah i will too if you try to cash out again he gave a weak chuckle whos the idiot not gonna have a grave you gotta be rich or religious these days for that recycle and cremation thatsa way to go return and burn sure nice to hear your voice though made me think id probly get bored floating gotta go tired yeah you go on and because he was asleep and roarke would understand she gave his hand a little pat hell be okay yes hell be okay i think he was glad you came along she pushed a hand through her hair return and burn what a jerk but i guess hes right graves are out of style mostly except oh no she whirled to roarke i am such an idiot rich or religious i know where hell go where hell go to end it you drive she was already out of the room running down the hall his sons grave yeah

out as they hit the elevator call your backup no no backup not yet i have to find him first to be sure sons name was thad thadeus clooney ive got it three plots sunlight memorial new rochelle near the

want you to get a squad car have it and an officer ready to transport you im following a lead on clooney if it pans out ill contact you i want you to move fast where where are you going back to the dead eve said push this thing she added as roarke headed out of the lot he could have heard about ricker by now strap in roarke advised and he punched the accelerator o o the dead rested in sunlight and dappled shade in gentle green hills with markers of soft white soft gray the rows of them the crosses and curves made eve wonder how the living could find comfort there faced with the unassailable proof of their own mortality but some must for even in these days when few chose to go into the ground or could afford the real estate many of the graves were splashed with flowers that symbol of life given to the dead which way roarke had a diagram of the cemetery on his pocket screen to the left over that rise they walked around the markers together the first time i spoke to you she remembered we were in a graveyard kind of creepy i guess apt he laid a hand on her shoulder there he is your instincts are excellent she paused taking a moment to study the man sitting on the tended grass beside a flowerstrewn grave and the marker was indeed a cross pure and white i need you to hang back no saying nothing she crouched pulled out her clinch piece im trusting you not to use this unless you have no choice she handed it to him trust me to do my job i need to try to talk him in im asking you to let me give him that chance compromise all right thanks call peabody tell her where to come i need her here alone she walked down the gentle slope and through the graves he knew she was coming he was cop enough to hold his ground to bide his time but she saw from the slightest shift in his body he knew better that way she thought she preferred not to surprise him sergeant lieutenant he still didnt look at her didnt take his attention from the name carved in that perfect white cross i want you to know im carrying i dont want to harm you i appreciate that you should know im carrying and i dont want to harm you either i need to talk to you sergeant can i sit down here he looked at her then his eyes were dry but she could see hed been weeping there were still tracks of the tears on his cheeks and she saw too that his weapon the same make and model as her own was in the hand resting in his lap youve come to take me in i dont intend to go can i sit down sure sit its a good spot for it thats why we picked it but i always thought that thad would be the one to sit here to sit and talk to me and his mother not that i would be the one to sit he was the light of my life i read his service record she sat on the opposite side of the grave he was a good cop yeah he was oh i was proud of him the way he carried himself the way he took to the job like he was born to it maybe he was i was always proud of him though from the first instant they put him in my arms and he was squalling and wriggling all that life in one little package with his free hand he brushed at the grass that grew over his son you dont have children as yet do you lieutenant no ill tell you that whatever you feel for anyone however much loves inside you theres more of it when you have a child you cant understand it until youve experienced it and it doesnt change as they grow into men into women it just grows with them it should be me in there and not my boy not my thad we took ricker she said it quickly because shed seen his hand tighten on his weapon i know it and relax again i heard it onscreen in the little room where ive been staying my hideyhole we all need our hideyholes dont we hes going down for your son sergeant she used his rank and would use it again and again to remind him what he was i want you to know that conspiracy to commit murder the murder of a police officer and hell go down for the others the same way with everything else well nail on hell never get out of a cage hell die there its some comfort i never thought you were part of it not in my gut i cant say ive been clear in my mind for the last bit of time after taj sergeant i took that boys life a life as innocent as my sons made a widow of his sweet wife and took away a good father from those babies ill carry that regret that shame that horror to my own grave dont she said it quietly urgently as he lifted his weapon and placed it to the pulse at his throat it would be lethal there and on maximum setting would end it instantly wait is that the way you honor your son by taking another life on his grave is that what thad would want is that what hed expect from his father he was so tired it showed in his face now in his voice what else is there im asking you to listen to me if youre set on this i cant stop you but you owe me some time maybe i do the boy who was with you when you came to my door when i knew you knew i panicked panicked he said again like an oath i dont even know who he was his names webster lieutenant don webster hes alive sergeant hes going to be okay im glad of that one less stone to carry sergeant she fumbled for the words im a murder cop she began you ever work homicide she knew he hadnt she knew it all no not as such but you deal with it wherever you are if youre a cop and you deal with it too much if youve been one as long as me i work for the dead i cant count the number of them ive stood over i dont think i could stand to try but i dream of them all those lost faces those stolen lives its hard she was surprised she was telling him this surprised it seemed the way sometimes its so hard to see those faces in your sleep you wake up hurting but i cant do anything else ive wanted to be a cop as long as i can remember it was my one clear vision and its all i can do are you a good cop the tears were overflowing again in sympathy or despair she couldnt tell eve your names eve isnt it are you a good cop eve yeah im a damn good cop now he wept and she felt her eyes tear up in concert thad he wanted the same as you the one clear vision i like that yeah his one clear vision they let him bleed to death they let him die and for what for what money it rips my heart theyve paid sergeant i cant tell you what you did was right or what the judgment on you will be in the end of things but theyve paid for what they did to your boy for what they did to their badge rickers going to pay too i swear it to you here on the grave of this good cop hell pay for playing them all like puppets he played you too played on your love for your son your grief your pride will you let him keep pulling your strings will you dishonor yourself and your son by letting him win what can i do tears streamed down his cheeks ive lost im lost you can do what thad would expect of you you can face it im shamed he whispered i thought when it was over id be glad id be free but im shamed you can make up for it best you can you can erase some of the shame you can come with me sergeant you can be a cop now and come with me prison or death he looked at her again those are hard choices yes very hard harder to live sergeant and balance the scales let the system make its judgment on you thats what we believe in people like us what we work for when we pick up the badge im asking you to do that sergeant im asking you not to be one of the faces i see in my sleep he bowed his head rocked so his tears fell on the flowers hed laid on the grass he reached out a hand across the grave clasped eves clung she sat like that while he sobbed then he leaned forward pressed his lips to the white cross i miss him every day with a sigh he held out his weapon to eve youll want this thank you she got to her feet waiting for him to get laboriously to his he wiped his face with his sleeve drew in a breath id like to call my wife shell be glad to hear from you i dont want to put restraints on you sergeant clooney id like you to give me your word youll go with my aide and walk into central of your own volition you have my word on it eve its a good name im glad it was you who came today i wont forget it was you its spring he said as they walked up the rise i hope youll take time to enjoy it winter comes too soon and always lasts too long he paused at the top where peabody waited with roarke those faces in your dreams have you thought they might be coming to thank you no i guess i never thought of that officer peabody will accompany you in the black and white sergeant ill follow you in officer sergeant clooney is turning himself in yes sir will you come with me sergeant as they moved off eve slipped clooneys weapon into her pocket i thought i was going to lose him no you had him the minute you sat down maybe she blew out a breath its a hell of a lot easier just to put a boot to their throats he got to me yes and you to him he crouched down and to her amusement tugged up her trouser leg and slipped her weapon back into the ankle harness our own variation on cinderella the laugh went a long way to easing the rawness around her heart well prince charming id ask for a lift to the ball but how about giving me one in to work my pleasure they linked hands skirted around a young tree with leaves unfurling tender green and walked away from the dead
