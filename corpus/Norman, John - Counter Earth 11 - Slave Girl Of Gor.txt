 the collar i lay in the warm grass i could feel it the warm individual green blades separate gentle on my left cheek i could feel them on my body my stomach and thighs i stretched my body my toes i was sleepy i did not wish to awaken the sun was warm on my back even hot almost uncomfortable i snuggled deeper into the grass my left hand was extended my fingers touched the warm dirt between the grass blades my eyes were closed i resisted the coming of consciousness i did not wish to emerge from bed consciousness seemed to come slowly dimly i did not wish to emerge from bed i wished to prolong the warmth the pleasantness i moved my head slightly my neck seemed to wear a weight i heard the soft clink a tiny stirring of heavy links of metal i did not understand this i moved my head again sleepily eyes closed to its original position again i felt the weight circular heavy on my neck again i heard the small sound the stirring simple and matter of fact of heavy metal links i opened my eyes part way keeping them half shut against the light i saw the grass green and close each blade seeming wide blurred in its nearness my fingers dug into the warm earth i closed my eyes i began to sweat i must emerge from bed i must snatch breakfast hurry to class it must be late i must hurry i remembered the cloth slipped over my mouth and nose the fumes the strength of the man who had held me i had squirmed but had been held in his grip helpless i was terrified i had tried not to breathe i had struggled but futilely i was terrified i had not known a man could be so strong he was patient unhurried waiting for me to breathe i tried not to breathe then lungs gasping helpless had at last inhaled deeply desperately taking the sharp strangling fumes deep into my body in an instant choking in the horrid obdurate fumes unable to expel them unable to evade them sickened i had lost consciousness i lay in the warm grass i could feel it on my body i must emerge from bed i must snatch breakfast and hurry to class surely it must be late i must hurry i opened my eyes seeing the grass blades not inches from my face wide blurred i opened my mouth delicately and felt the grass brush my lips i bit into a blade and felt the juice of the grass on my tongue i closed my eyes i must awaken i remembered the clothe the strength of the man the fumes my fingers dug deep into the dirt i clawed at it i felt the dirt beneath my fingernails i lifted my head and rolled screaming awakening tangled in the chain in the grass i sat upright in an instant i realized i was nude my neck wore its encircling weight the heavy chain attached to the collar dropped between my breasts and over my left thigh no no i cried no i leaped to my feet screaming the chains weight depended from the collar heavily gracefully i felt the collar pulled down against my collarbone the chain passed now between my legs behind the left calf then lifting i jerked wildly at it i tried to thrust the collar up over my head i turned it again tried to thrust it up over my head i scraped my throat hurting it my chin was forced up i saw the bright sky blue with its startlingly white clouds but i could not slip the collar it fitted me closely only my small finger could i thrust between its weight and my neck i moaned the collar could not be slipped it had not been made to be slipped irrationally madly nothing in my consciousness but my fear and the chain i turned to flee and fell hurting my legs tangled in the chain i on my knees seized the chain pulled at it weeping i tried to back away on my knees my head was pulled cruelly forward i held the chain it was some ten feet long it extended to a heavy ring and plate fastened in a great granite rock irregular but some twelve feet in width and depth some ten feet in height the plate with its ring was attached near the center of the rock low about a foot above the grass the rock had apparently been drilled and the plate fastened with four linear bolts they may have passed through the entire width of the rock and been clinched on the other side i did not know on my knees i pulled at the chain i wept i cried out i pulled again at the chain i hurt my hands it moved not a quarter of an inch i was fastened to the rock i rose moaning to my feet my hands on the chain i looked about myself the rock was prominent there was none like it in view i stood on a rolling plain grassy and gentle widely sweeping trackless i saw nothing but the grass it moving in the soft unhurried wind the distant horizon the unusually white clouds and blue sky i was alone the sun was warm behind me was the rock i felt the wind on my body but not directly as the plate in the stone was on the sheltered side of the rock i wondered if the wind was a prevailing one i wondered if the plate and chain were so situated in order that the chains prisoner such as i found myself to be be protected from the wind i shuddered i stood alone i was nude i small white was chained by the neck to that great rock on the seemingly endless plain i breathed deeply never in my life had i breathed such air though my head was chained i threw it back i closed my eyes i drank the atmosphere into my lungs those who have never breathed such air cannot know the sensations which i then felt in so simple a thing as the air i breathed i rejoiced it was clean and clear it was fresh almost alive almost sparkling with the exhilaration of swift abundant pristine oxygen it was like the air of a new world one yet innocent of the toxins of mans majority the unquestioned gifts ambiguous poisoned of civilization and technology my body became vital and alive so simply did a proper oxygenation of my system work its almost immediate effect in my feeling and awareness those who have never breathed the air of a clean world cannot understand my words and perhaps those who have breathed only such an atmosphere may too tragically fail to comprehend until one has breathed such air can one know the glory of being alive but i was lonely and frightened it was a strange world on which i stood wide and unfamiliar open bright and clean i looked out upon the vast fields of grass i had never smelled grass before it was so fresh so beautiful my senses were alive in this atmosphere my blood charged with oxygen i found that i could detect odors which had eluded me before it was as though an entire new dimension of experience had suddenly opened to me yet i suppose it was only that here in this place my body did not have reason to fight its world shutting it out forcing it from consciousness in order not to be distracted or sickened here there was an atmosphere which was unsoiled undefiled one in which the human could be a part of nature not a rampart raised against her not a defensive sojourner treading at night stepping softly scarcely daring to breathe through the country of enemies my vision too in this pure air was keener i could see farther and with greater detail than had been possible before in the clouded contaminated atmosphere in which i had been raised how far away seemed the familiar pollutions of the gray world i remembered on certain days there i had thought the air clean and had delighted in its freshness how little i had known how foolish i had been it had been only less murky less dismal only a sign of what a world might be my hearing too seemed acute the wind brushed the grass moving in it stirring the gleaming leaves colors too seemed richer deeper more vivid the grass was richly green alive vast the sky was blue deeply blue far deeper than i had known a sky could be the clouds were sharp and white protean and billowing transforming themselves in the pressures of their heights and the winds which sped them they moved at different heights at different speeds they were like great white birds stately and majestic turning floating in the rivers of wind i felt the breezes of the field on my exposed body i trembled every bit of me seemed alive i was frightened i looked at the sun i looked away down then across the fields i was aware now as i had not been before or so clearly of the difference in the feel of my body and its movements there seemed a subtle difference in my body weight my movements i thrust this comprehension from my mind i could not admit it i literally forced it from consciousness but it returned persistent it could not be denied no i cried but i knew it was true i tried to thrust from my mind what must be what had to be the explanation of this unusual phenomenon no i cried it cannot be no no numbly i lifted the chain which hung from the collar fastened on my neck i looked at it disbelievingly the links were closeset heavy of some primitive simple black iron it did not seem an attractive chain or an expensive one but i was held by it i felt the collar with my fingers i could not see it but it seemed formed too of heavy iron it seemed simple practical not ostentatious it gripped my throat rather closely i supposed it was black in color matching the chain it had a heavy hinge on one side and the chain by a link opened and closed was fastened to a loop on the side of the collar the loop was fastened about a staple which it seemed was a part of the collar itself the hinge was under my right ear the chain hung from its loop and staple under my chin with my finger on the other side under my left ear i felt a large lock with its opening for the insertion of a heavy key the collar then fastened with a lock it had not been hammered about my neck i wondered who held the key to that collar i turned about and looked at the great rock the granite streaked with feldspar i must try to awaken i told myself i must awaken i laughed bitterly i must be dreaming i told myself again the difference in the feeling of my body its weight its movements intruded itself into my consciousness no i cried then i went to the granite and looked at the heavy plate and ring bolted into the stone a link of my chain had been opened and then closed about that ring the chain was some ten feet in length i idly coiled it at the foot of the ring no i cried i must awaken i told myself surely it must be nearly time to arouse myself to hurry to breakfast to hurry to class there is no other explanation i told myself i am dreaming then i feared i might be insane no i told myself i am dreaming it is such a strange dream so real but it is a dream it must be it must be it is a dream all a dream then to my misery i remembered the man being seized from behind not able even to see him my struggles being held so helplessly the cloth over my mouth and nose his waiting for me to breathe at last my gasping helplessly for breath the terrible fumes nothing else to breathe nothing else which could not be tolerated by consciousness nothing else to breathe and then my loss of consciousness that i knew had been no dream i struck my fists until they bled on the granite rock streaked with feldspar then i turned and walked from the rock some five feet and looked out over the vast grassy fields oh no i wept the full consciousness of my waking state and my awareness of truth welled up within me it flooded my consciousness overwhelmingly irrefutably i knew then what must be the explanation for the difference in the feelings in my body the explanation for the sense of subtle kinesthetic difference in my movements i stood not on earth the gravity was not that of earth it was on another world i stood an unknown world it was a bright beautiful world but it was not earth it was not the world i knew it was not my home i had been brought here no one had consulted my will i had been brought here my will had been nothing i stood alone there naked defenseless before the great rock looking over the fields i was lonely and frightened and i wore a chain on my neck suddenly i cried out with misery and put my face in my hands then it seemed the earth spun beneath me and darkness swept about me rushing in upon me and i lost consciousness the retinue i felt myself being rolled roughly on my back veck kajira said a voice harshly veck kajira it was not a patient voice i looked up startled frightened i cried out with pain a metal point jabbed into my body at the juncture between my left hip and lower abdomen the point lifted and the shaft of the spear turned he struck me on the right thigh hard with the butt of the spear my hand went before my mouth his foot in a high strapped sandal heavy almost an open boot kicked my hand away he was bearded i lay between his legs i looked up at him in terror he was not alone there was another man a bit behind him both wore tunics red each at his left hip had slung a blade and scabbard each at his belt carried an ornamented knife the man behind him who stood over me had slung over his back a shield of layers of leather and brass and carried a spear beneath the blade of which was slung a helmet with a plume of dark swirling hair he wore a cord of teeth from some carnivore about his neck the man who stood over me had put his helmet and shield to one side the helmets of both would cover the entire head and most of the face the helmets were cut and opened in such a way as to suggest a y the hair of both men was long the hair of the man behind was tied back with a narrow piece of folded cloth i slipped from between the feet of the man who loomed above me moving back i had never seen such men i felt so vulnerable they were mighty and like animals i crouched backing away the chain hung from my collar heavy i stopped i turned and tried to hide myself as i could with my hands i dared not even speak one of the men barked a command at me he moved his hand angrily i removed my hands from my body i turned still crouching i understood that they would look upon me the bearded man approached me i dared not meet his eyes i could not understand such men my world had not prepared me to believe that such men could exist he stood closer to me than would have a man of my world each in my world it seemed carried about with him a bubble of space a perimeter a wall an invisible shield an unconsciously acculturated socially sanctioned remoteness a barrier decreed by convention and conditioning behind this invisible wall within this personal privately owned space we lived it separated us from others it kept us persons in my particular earth culture this circle of inviolate privately owned space had a radius of some two to three feet closer than this we did not commonly in my culture approach one another but this man stood close to me he stood within my space suddenly i realized that my space did not exist on this world i began to tremble with terror so small a thing it seems perhaps that this convention should on this world not be acknowledged or respected indeed that at least in my case it did not exist but it is not truly a small thing no to me the crumbling of this artifice this protective device this convention was catastrophic it is difficult to convey my sense of loss of helplessness on this world my space did not exist i saw the black leather strap wide shiny across his body from which depended the blade slung at his left hip behind it i saw the coarsely woven thick red fibers at his tunic i knew that were he to seize me in his arms and crush me to his chest with what strength must be his that the mark of the strap the coarse fibers would be imprinted on my breasts i felt the point of his dagger beneath my chin it hurt it thrust up i cried out rising almost to my toes i then stood straight before them i stood straighter than i had ever stood in my life the man then stepped back and he and the other inspected me completely walking about me they discussed me candidly i could not understand their speech my chin was very high as the point of the dagger had left it i trembled i heard the small movement of the chain in the collar loop i wondered what could be the status of women on this world on a world where there were such men it took the men some minutes to complete their examination they did not hurry the two men now stood before me one a bit behind the other looking at me i felt the collar weighted by the chain pull down against my collarbone the chain hung between my breasts i felt its heavy links on my body i stood very still please i whispered not moving my position the bearded man approached me suddenly he struck me with his right hand a swift savage openhanded slap i was hurled stumbling spinning to the end of the chain which caught me cruelly at the neck jerking me to the ground my lip and the side of my mouth were cut my head seemed to explode i tasted blood the man barked a command in panic and misery in a movement of collar and chain i fled again to my place and again stood before them so straight my chin again high precisely as i had been before i wondered what could be the status of women on this world on a world where there were such men he did not strike me again i had placated him by my obedience he spoke to me again i looked into his eyes for a moment our eyes met i knelt the other man thrust my body down on my heels so that i knelt back on my heels he took my hands and placed them on my thighs i looked up at them i am a brunet with very dark brown hair my eyes too are dark brown i am lightly complexioned i am some five feet five inches in height and weigh about one hundred and twenty pounds i am thought to be not amply but excitingly figured the men looked down upon me at that time my hair was cut short i felt the side of the point of the bearded mans spear under my chin and i lifted my chin so that my head was high my name was judy thornton i was an english major and poetess i knelt before barbarians nude and chained i was terribly frightened i knelt exactly as they had placed me scarcely daring to breathe i feared to move in the slightest i did not wish to be again struck or to irritate or offend them in the least i did not know what they might do these mighty and terrible men so unpredictable so uncompromising and primitive so different from the men of earth if they were not completely and fully and absolutely pleased with me i determined to give them no cause for anger i determined that they would have my absolute obedience thus i knelt not moving before them i felt the wind move the hair on the back of my neck the men continued to regard me this frightened me i did not move at all i remained of course as they had placed me i looked straight ahead not even daring to meet their eyes i was terrified lest inadvertently i had done something to displease them i moved no muscle i knelt back on my heels my back straight my hands on my thighs my chin up my knees were pressed closely defensively together the man said something i could not understand then with the butt of his spear roughly to my horror he thrust apart my knees i was judy thornton i was an english major and poetess i could not help but moan the position was so elegant and helpless i knelt before them in what i would later learn was the position of the gorean pleasure slave satisfied then the beasts turned from me i did not move they busied themselves in the vicinity of the rock it seemed they searched for something once the bearded fellow returned to stand near me he said something it was a question he repeated it i stared ahead terrified my eyes filled with tears i do not know i whispered i do not understand i do not know what you want he turned away and again gave himself to his search after a time angry he returned to regard me his fellow too was with him bina he said very clearly bina kajira var bina kajira i do not know what you want i whispered i do not understand you i gathered they must be asking after whatever it was they sought they had covered the area thoroughly even turning aside long grass with the blades of their spears they had not found it var bina kajira repeated the bearded man i knelt as they had placed me the chain hanging heavy from my collar i do not know i whispered suddenly savagely he struck me across the mouth with the back of his right hand i flew to the left to the grass the blow was vicious it hurt me more than had the first i could not believe its force its ruthlessness its swiftness i could scarcely see i fought blackness and pain and seething light i was on my hands and knees in the grass my head down i tasted blood the collar hurt my neck i spit blood into the grass he had struck me did he not know i was a woman he jerked me by the collar and chain to his knees he thrust both hands into my hair var bina kajira he cried var bina i do not understand you i cried oh i screamed with misery with both hands he shook my head viciously i could not believe the pain my small hands were helpless on his wrists var bina he demanded please please i wept he threw me down with a rattle of chain to his feet i lay there on my side terrified he unlooped the shoulder belt from him and cast it with the scabbard and blade to one side then he swiftly loosened the belt at his waist he slipped it free from the sheath and dagger and doubled it he struck it once in the palm of his hand i could not see him i lay before him turned away from him on the grass then i heard it whistle through the air i cried out with pain again and again viciously he struck me once he stopped var bina kajira he asked please dont hurt me i begged again he struck and again and again i writhed before him lashed squirming on my belly in the grass weeping clutching at the grass in the pain i could scarcely comprehend it i was being beaten did he not know i was a girl please dont hit me i cried please i covered my head with my hands i lay with my head down i shuddered with each blow i would do anything if he would stop but i did not know what he wanted then he stopped angrily i did not even lift my head but lay weeping my hands still over my head the chain running between my legs and under my body to the collar i heard him replace the sheath and dagger on his belt and put on the belt i heard him lift the shoulder belt and regard himself with the blade i did not look up but lay weeping chained trembling i would do anything he wanted anything one of the men spoke to me and prodded me with the butt of his spear i rose to my hands and knees i felt the chain on my collar again i was prodded with the butt of his spear redeyed my cheeks and body stained with tears in pain my back and sides and legs stinging i adjusted the chain and knelt again as i had originally there was blood at my mouth little had changed i knelt precisely as i had before little had changed save that i had been struck and beaten the two men conferred then to my horror the bearded one approached me he crouched before me he took from his dagger sheath the steel blade narrow about seven inches long doubleedged evenly sharpened he held this up before my face he did not speak the other man crouched down behind me with his left hand fastened in my hair he drew my head back with his right hand he thrust up high on my neck under my chin the heavy iron collar i wore it hurt my jugular vein was held as i was prominent and beneath the clasping circular iron prominent and exposed no i begged no i gathered that i was of no use to these men i felt the delicate razorsharp edge of the dagger on my throat var bina kajira queried the man var bina please i wept whispering please i would have done anything i would have done anything i would have told them anything done anything but i knew nothing i could not give them what information they desired dont kill me i begged i will do anything you want keep me keep me for yourselves keep me as your captive your prisoner keep me as anything you want am i not beautiful could i not serve you could i not please you then suddenly from deep within me welling up from somewhere so deep within me that i did not know i contained such depths flooding from me startling me horrifying me with my own wickedness i cried out do not kill me i am willing even to be your slave yes yes i am willing even to be your slave your slave do not kill me i will be your slave let me be your slave i beg to be your slave i shook with the horror the scandal the wickedness of what i had said but then boldly desperately determinedly resolutely repudiating nothing i whispered clearly and firmly my head back held back his hand in my hair do not kill me please yes i will be even your slave yes i judy thornton will be your slave i judy thornton beg to be your slave please please let me be a slave i tried to smile make me your slave i whispered masters how startled i was that i had called them masters and yet how natural it seemed for i was a girl suitable prey for such as they a natural quarry and prey for such as they and they as i sensed were the natural masters by the dark laws of biology of such as i please masters i whispered var bina kajira queried the man i moaned with misery i did not know but they rich and powerful masters had access to many women as beautiful or more beautiful than i on earth i had been noted as a beauty an unusual even ravishingly beautiful girl but on gor as i would come to understand i and others like me could be acquired and disposed of for a handful of copper tarsks there was little special about us in many houses we would be kept with the kettles as scullery and kitchen girls i had been the most beautiful girl in the junior class at my elite girls college in all the school there had been only one more lovely than i or so some said the lovely elicia nevina who was in anthropology in the senior class how i had hated her what rivals we had been i felt the edge of the dagger anchor itself in the outer layer of skin on my throat preparing for its slash i felt the mans hand and arm through the steel of the dagger flex for the movement of his arm my throat was to be cut but the blade paused it withdrew from my throat the bearded man was looking outward away from me over the field then i too heard it it was a man singing boldly a melodic repetitious song angrily the bearded man stood up sheathed the dagger took up his shield his spear his fellow the other man already accoutered even to the helmet watched the man approach he balanced his spear in his right hand the bearded man did not yet don his helmet but stood near it i went to my hands and knees in the grass i could scarcely move i threw up in the grass i pulled at the collar and chain futilely if only i could have run or crawled away but i was fastened in place numbly i lifted my head the other fellow was approaching at an even unhurried pace he seemed goodhumored he sang in a rich voice a simple song as though to content himself in long treks his hair was black and shaggy he too was clad in scarlet as were the other two men he was similarly accoutered with short sword slung at the left hip with a shoulder belt a belt at his waist with a sheathed knife heavy sandals almost boots he carried a spear over his left shoulder balanced by his left hand from the spear depended a shield behind the left shoulder and a helmet about his right shoulder was slung a pouch which i gathered must have contained supplies a bota of liquid water i assumed was fastened at his belt on the left behind the point at which the scabbard depended from the shoulder belt he strode singing smiling through the tall grass he seemed similarly garbed to the other men wearing a similar tunic but they reacted to him in a way that indicated they were not pleased that he had now appeared his tunic was cut slightly differently from theirs there was a mark at the left shoulder which theirs did not bear these differences were subtle to me but to those who could read them perhaps acutely significant i pulled at the chain no one paid me attention had i been free i might have slipped away i moaned to myself i must wait the approaching man stopped singing about twenty yards from us and stood grinning in the grass he held the spear with its dependent articles in his left hand now and raised his right in a cheerful fashion palm inward facing the body tal rarii said he calling out grinning tal rarius said the bearded man the newcomer slipped the bota from his belt and discarded too the pouch he carried the bearded man waved his arm angrily and spoke harshly he was ordering the newcomer away he pointed to his fellow and himself they were two the newcomer grinned and slipped the spear to the ground loosening the helmet and shield the bearded man placed his helmet over his head it muchly concealing his features carrying the shield on his left arm carrying the spear lightly in his right hand the helmet hanging too by its straps from his right hand the newcomer approached casually again the bearded man waved him away again he spoke harshly the newcomer grinned they spoke together the three of them i could understand nothing the newcomer spoke evenly once he slapped his thigh in laughter the two other men spoke more angrily one he who was not bearded shook his spear the newcomer did not pay him attention he looked beyond the men to me i then became aware as i had not before in my fear of a strange emotional and physiological response of which i had been the victim moments before when i had begged mighty men to enslave me my feelings had been flooded not only with terror but mixed with them with the feelings of terror had been a strange almost hysterical release of tension of bottledup emotion i had said things which i had never dreamed could come from me and they could not now be unsaid i realized i had begged to be a slave of course i had been terrified but i felt in my deepest heart that i had not said what i had said merely to try and save my life of course i had been desperate to save my life of course i would have said anything but it was the way i had felt when i had said it that now so shook me so profoundly to the quick mingled with the terror there had been a release of suppressed instincts a joy in confession a rapture of openness of authenticity and honesty that i had been terrified and desperate to buy my life at any cost had been the occasion and an adequate justification of my utterance but this terror could not explain the wild uncontrollable acknowledgement the shattering of inhibitions which i had felt the torrential rapture the abandonment the capitulation to myself and my instincts which had though blurred and mixed with the terror so shaken and thrilled me the terror was unimportant it had been nothing more than an occasion not even necessary what was important had been the way i had felt when i had begged those mighty men to be my masters it was as though in asking for chains of iron i had cast off thousands of invisible chains which had held me from myself chains of iron i thought might hold me to my own truths not permitting me to strive for what in the heart of me i did not wish for what i was not i wondered then what was the nature of women i knew then that before in the emotions that had flooded me i had not been only terrified i had felt liberty and release and joy oddly too in those moments besides my terror i had been aroused never before in my life had i been so erotically charged so aroused as when i had begged those mighty men to enslave me i now looked at the newcomer who was regarding me i shuddered i nude and chained felt my body suddenly soaked with the heat of desire perhaps he had read the bodies of many women he grinned at me beneath the bold appraisal of my bared beauty i reddened angrily i put down my head i was furious what did he think i was a chained slave girl whose beauty might belong to him who was the most strong or most powerful to him with the swiftest sword or to the highest bidder he pointed to me he spoke the bearded man again spoke harshly waving his arm ordering the newcomer away the newcomer laughed the bearded man said something gesturing to me the tone of his voice was disparaging i felt angry the newcomer looked more closely at me he spoke to me calling across the grass the word he spoke i had heard before the other man had said it to me after i had been beaten when he had prodded me with the spear before i had again knelt though then struck and beaten before the men shortly before the dagger had been put to my throat tossing my head i knelt the chain dangling from my collar before my body to the grass i knelt back on my heels my back very straight my hands on my thighs my head high looking straight ahead i thrust my shoulders back my breasts forward i did not neglect the placement of my knees i opened them as widely as i could as i knew the men wanted i knelt before them again in that most elegant and helpless position in which men may place a woman that position i was later to learn was that of the gorean pleasure slave the newcomer now spoke decisively the bearded man and the other retorted angrily the newcomer as i saw out of the corner of my eye was pointing to me he was grinning i trembled and shuddered he was demanding me he was telling them to give me to him the bold beast how i hated him and how pleased i was the men laughed i was frightened they were two and he one he should flee he should run for his life i knelt chained kajira canjellne said the newcomer though he indicated me peremptorily with his spear it was at the two other men that he looked he did not now take his eyes from them the bearded man looked angry kajira canjellne he acknowledged kajira canjellne said the other man too soberly the newcomer then moved back a few paces he crouched down he picked up a stalk of grass and began to chew on it the bearded man approached me from within his tunic he drew forth two lengths of slender braided black leather each about eighteen inches long he crouched behind me he jerked my wrists behind my back crossed them and bound them tightly he then crossed my ankles and too bound them tightly as well i could feel the braided leather deep in my wrists and ankles i winced helpless then holding me by the hair with his left hand from behind i felt a heavy key which he must have removed from his tunic thrust deeply into the large collar lock below my left ear the heavy collar with its lock pushed into the left side of my neck the key turned i heard the bolt click back it made a heavy sound it must have been a thick heavy bolt he dropped the key to the grass and with both hands jerking it opened the collar he dropped it with the depending chain to the grass i was freed of the collar i looked at the collar it was the first time i had seen it as i had surmised it matched the chain it was heavy circular of black iron hinged efficient practical frightening it bore a staple and stout loop one link of the chain was fastened about the loop the loop was circular and about two and one half inches in width i was free of the collar but i was bound helplessly i pulled futilely at my bonds the bearded man lifted me lightly in his arms my weight was as if nothing to him he faced the stranger who still crouched a few yards away kajira canjellne asked the bearded man it was as though he were giving the stranger an opportunity to withdraw perhaps a mistake had been made perhaps there had been a misunderstanding the stranger crouching in the grass his shield beside him the butt of the spear in the grass the weapon upright its point against the sky nodded there had been no mistake kajira canjellne he said simply the other man angrily went to a place in the grass to one side there angrily with the blade of his spear he traced and dug a circle in the earth it was some ten feet in diameter the bearded man then threw me over his shoulder and carried me to the circle i was hurled to its center i lay on my side bound the men spoke together as though clarifying arrangements they did not speak long i struggled to my knees i knelt in the circle the stranger now stood he donned his helmet he slipped his shield on his arm adjusting straps he slid the short blade at his left hip some inches from the sheath and slipped it back in lifting and dropping it in the sheath it was loose he took his spear in his right hand it had a long heavy shaft some two inches in width some seven feet in length the head of the weapon including its socket and penetrating rivets was some twenty inches in length the killing edges of the blade began about two inches from the bottom of the socket which reinforced the blade tapering with the blade doubleedged to within eight inches of its point the blade was bronze it was broad at the bottom tapering to its point given the stoutness of the weapon the lesser gravity of this world and the strength of the man who wielded it i suspected it would have considerable penetrating power i doubted that the shields they carried though stout could turn its full stroke if taken frontally i had little doubt such a weapon might thrust a quarter of its length through the body of a man and perhaps half its length or more through the slighter softer body of a mere girl i looked upon the spear it was so mighty i feared it the two men who were my captors conferred briefly among themselves he who was not the bearded man then stepped forward his shield on his arm his spear in hand he stood separated from the stranger by some forty feet i observed them they stood not moving each clad in scarlet each helmeted each similarly armed they stood in the grass neither looked at me i was forgotten i knelt in the circle i tried to free myself i could not i knelt in the circle the wind moved the grass the clouds shifted in the blue sky for a long thee neither man moved then suddenly the stranger laughing lifted his spear and struck its butt into the ground kajira canjellne he laughed i could not believe it he seemed elated he was pleased with the prospect of war how terrible he was how proud how magnificent he seemed i thought i knew then with horror the nature of men kajira canjellne said the other man warily they began to circle one another i waited kneeling frightened nude and bound in the circle i watched the men warily circling one another i pulled at my bonds i was helpless suddenly as though by common accord each crying out each uttering a savage cry they hurled themselves at one another it was the ritual of the spear casting the spear of him who was one of my captors seemed to leap upward and away caroming from the oblique lifted surface of the strangers shield the spear caroming from the shield flew more than a hundred feet away dropping in the grass where it stood fixed remote and useless the butt of its shaft pointing to the sky the strangers spear had penetrated the shield of he who was one of my captors and the stranger bracing the shaft between his arm and body had lifted his opponents shield and turned throwing it and his opponent who had not the time to slip from the shield straps to the ground at his feet the strangers blade now loosed from its sheath under the opponents helmet lay at his throat but the stranger did not strike he severed the shield straps of the opponents shield freeing his arm from them he stepped back he cast his own shield aside into the grass he stood waiting blade drawn the other man got his legs under him and leaped to his feet he was enraged the blade in his sheath leaped forth he charged the other the stranger and swiftly did the two engage i knelt terrified i shuddered with horror they were not human as i understood human beings they were warriors and beasts i cried out with fear i had always had a fear of steel blades even knives now i knelt bound and nude helpless utterly exposed and vulnerable in the vicinity of fierce men skilled and strong who with intent and menace with edged bared steel addressed themselves to the savageries of war they fought i watched wideeyed bound furious sharp was the precision of their combat they were not feet from me i moaned backward and forward swiftly did they move in their grim contest i wondered at what manner of men they might be surely like none i had hitherto known why did they not flee in terror from such blades why did they not flee but they met one another and did battle how i feared and still fear such men how could a woman but kneel trembling before such a man one man wheeled back grunting turning and fell to his knees in the grass and then fell turning to his side lying upon his shoulder doubled hunched in pain bleeding his hands at his belly his blade lost in the grass the stranger stepped back from him his blade bloody he stood regarding the other man the bearded man the bearded man lifted his shield and raised his spear kajira canjellne he said kajira canjellne said the stranger he went to extricate his spear from the penetrated shield of the man with whom but moments before he had shared the sport of war the fallen foe lay doubled in the grass his lower lip was bloody he tore it with his teeth holding it that in his pain he might make no sound his hands were clutched in the scarlet of his wet tunic bunching it at the hallsevered belt the grass was bloody about him the stranger bent to lift the penetrated shield that he might remove from it his bronzeheaded weapon in that instant the bearded man crying out savagely rushed upon him his spear raised before i could respond in horror or my body move the stranger had reacted rolling to the side and in an instant regaining his feet assuming an onguard position as my cry of misery escaped my lips the thrust of the bearded mans spear had passed to the left of the strangers helmet the stranger had not remained at the vicinity of the shield with its penetrating spear but had abandoned it for the first time now the stranger did not seem pleased the bearded mans spear had thrust into the grass its head and a foot of its shaft had been driven into the turf he faced the stranger now sword drawn the instant he had missed the thrust he had left the weapon spinning and unsheathing his sword the bearded man was whitefaced but the stranger had not rushed upon him he waited in the onguard position he gestured with his blade indicating that now they might do battle with a cry of rage the bearded man rushed upon him thrusting with his shield his sword flat and low the stranger was not there twice more the bearded man charged and each time the stranger seemed not to be at the point of intended impact the fourth time the stranger was behind him and on his left the strangers sword was at his left armpit the bearded man stood very still whitefaced the strangers sword moved the stranger stepped back the bearded mans shield slipped from his arm the straps which had held the shield to his upper arm had been severed the shield fell on its edge to the grass and then tipped and rocked then was still large rounded concave inner surface tilted facing the sky i could see the severed straps the two men faced one another then did they engage i then realized as i had not before the skill of the stranger earlier he had matched himself for a time evenly with the first opponent in a swift though measured fashion he had exercised himself sharply and well respecting his foe not permitting the foe to understand his full power with the blade the devastating and subtle skill which now seemed to lend terrible flight to the rapid steel i saw the wounded man now on an elbow watching with horror he had not even been slain lying in the bloodied grass he realized he had been permitted to live it was with humiliating skill that the stranger toyed with the stumbling whitefaced bearded man he who had minutes before been preparing to cut my throat bound kneeling in the circle it was with sudden frightening elation that i realized the stranger was the master of the other two four times was he within the others guard his blade at breast or throat and did not finish him he moved the bearded man into a position where his fallen discarded shield lay behind him with a cry he forced back the bearded man who fell stumbling in the shield backward and then lay on the grass before the stranger the strangers blade at his throat the stranger in contempt then stepped back the bearded man scrambled to his feet the stranger stood back in the onguard position the bearded man took his blade and hurled it into the grass it sank to the hilt he stood regarding the stranger the stranger slipped his own blade back in the sheath the bearded man loosened his dagger belt dropping the belt and weapon to the grass then he walked slowly to his fellow and similarly removed his dagger belt the man held his bloodied tunic to his wound to stanch the flow of blood the bearded man lifted the other man to his feet and together the bearded man supporting the other they left the field the stranger stood watching them go he watched them until they disappeared in the distance he removed his spear from the shield which it had penetrated he thrust it upright butt down in the turf it was like a standard he sat his shield by it then he turned to face me i knelt within the wide circle torn by the blade of a spear in the turf i was naked i was bound helplessly it was an alien world he began to approach me slowly i was terrified then he stood before me never had i been so frightened we were alone absolutely he looked at me i thrust my head to the grass at his feet he stood there not moving i was terribly conscious helpless of his presence i waited for him to speak to say something to me he must understand my terror was it not visible in my bound body my complete vulnerability i waited for him to speak some gentle word something kindly something to reassure me a thoughtful soft word to allay my fears i trembled he said nothing i did not dare raise my head why did he not speak to me any gentleman surely by now speaking reassuring soothing words averting his eyes from my beauty would have hastened to release me from my predicament he removed his helmet he put it to one side in the grass i felt his hand in my hair not cruelly but casually and firmly as one might fasten ones hand in the mane of a horse then i felt my head drawn up and back and back until his right hand on my knee his left hand in my hair i knelt bent backward my head on the ground my back bent painfully my eyes looking up frightened at the sky he then examined the bow of my beauty i am quite vain of my beauty then he threw me on my side and stretched me out to examine its linear aspect i lay on my right side he walked about me and looked at me he kicked my toes straight that the line of my body would be more extended he crouched beside me then i felt his hand on my neck he rubbed his thumb in a scrape the collar had made on my throat when i had foolishly struggled earlier it smarted but the scrape was not deep he felt my upper arm and forearm and my fingers moving them he moved his hands on my body firmly following its curvatures he put one hand on my back and another on my side and for a few moments holding me thus felt my breathing he felt my thigh and flexed my legs noting the change in the curve of the calf it did not seem what a gentleman would do never before had a man handled and touched me as he did no man on earth i felt sure would have so dared to touch a woman i felt examined as an animal at one point turning my head thrusting two fingers of his left hand and two fingers of his right hand into my mouth he pulled my mouth widely examining my teeth i have excellent teeth white and small and straight i had had two cavities which had been filled he paid them little attention he had seen as i later learned women from earth before such tiny things can be used to determine earth origin goreans seldom have cavities i am not certain what the reasons for this are in part it is doubtless a matter of a plainer simpler diet containing less sugar in part i suspect the culture too may have a role to play as it is a culture in which undue chemical stress through guilt and worry is not placed on the system either in the prepubertal or pubertal years gorean youth like the youth of earth encounter their difficulties in growing up but the culture or cultures have not seen fit to implicitly condition them into regarding the inevitable effects of maturation as either suspect deplorable or insidious he then threw me to my other side and subjected my helpless beauty on its right to a similar examination i was horrified at the boldness the frankness with which he handled me did he think i was an animal did he think i was only property then he threw me on my stomach at his feet and i lay there my wrists were crossed and bound behind me in slender braided leather my ankles too were crossed and bound in that simple secure fastening i felt the grass under my body i felt it brush my left side as the wind moved it i kept my toes pointed he regarded me for some time how beautiful i must look to him i thought and i had sensed his incredible maleness the animal maleness of him so different from the thwarted crippled sexuality so commended and tragically endemic among the males of earth for the first time in my life i felt i understood what might be the meaning of the expression male and as i lay before him too dimly it frightening me what might be the meaning of the expression female how beautiful i thought i must look to him lying bound totally vulnerable helpless at his feet how such a sight must stir the splendor of his manhood to see the female his caught helpless at his feet his to do with in lust and pleasure and joy as he pleased helpless to escape him free for him to work his will upon her i felt him turn me i must resist him he is a beast i was sitting now my face turned to one side trying to push back but his left arm behind my back held me i found it futile to struggle with his right hand he turned my face to face him he regarded the delicate lineaments of my face his thumb was at the right side of my jaw his fingers at the left i could not move my head he was darkly complexioned his face in a broad coarse way was brutally handsome his eyes were very dark his hair dark shaggy long he said something to me i felt his breath on my face i trembled i stammered please please i said i do not speak your language please untie me he said something again i cannot understand you i said please untie me he stood and lifted me by the arms to my feet he looked down into my eyes my head came only to his chest the width of my body seemed but half the width of that mighty scarletclad chest his hands were very tight on my arms my ankles fastened crossed and bound i would have fallen had he released me i could not stand by myself he said something again a question i cannot understand you i said he gave me a sudden shake i felt my head would leave my body he repeated his question i cannot understand you i wept he shook me again angrily but not cruelly then he released me bound as i was i could do nothing but fall before him on my knees i looked up never had i felt such strength he crouched down before me he looked at me intently once more he spoke to me i shook my head miserably i looked up at him i will learn any language you want i blurted weeping but i cannot now speak your tongue he seemed satisfied or resigned after this outburst that there was little to be gained in attempting to communicate with me we could not speak to one another he rose to his feet and looked about himself he was not pleased he was not looking at me i shrugged a bit angrily he could not see me it was not my fault i could not speak to him but then as he looked about the field and the rock i in that large rude circle torn in the turf put my head down alone miserable i was small in the grass alone i knelt helpless an ignorant barbarian girl naked and bound who could not even speak to her captor on a strange world in time after scouting the terrain of the rock perhaps searching for clues to my meaning or identity the tall man in scarlet returned to face me it was late afternoon i looked up at him and trembled he took me by the hair and threw me to my belly in the grass at his feet i lay there helpless i heard the sword slip free from his sheath dont kill me i wept please do not kill me i lay there terrified i felt the sword with an easy movement as though meeting no resistance sever the binding on my ankles he then left me he fetched the pouch and bota which he had carried and slung them both this time at his belt he picked up his helmet he went to the spear thrust in the turf upright blade to the sky and the concave shield at its foot he slung the shield and helmet over the butt of the spear suspending them behind his left shoulder his left arm over and resting on the shaft of the spear steadying it in place then without looking at me he left the field i watched him go i struggled to my feet my hands still bound tightly behind me i looked about at the field at the signs of battle the discarded shields one deeply punctured and cut the scattered weapons i looked at the great rock to which by the neck i had been fastened with a heavy chain i stood in the circle torn in the turf the wind blew the grass my hair the sky was darker now i gasped low on the horizon i saw rising three moons the man was distant now dont leave me i cried dont leave me here alone i fled from the circle torn in the turf running after him please stop i cried wait please wait gasping for breath i fled after him stumbling sometimes falling please wait i cried once he turned to see me running after him i stopped panting i stood in the grass some two hundred yards from him then he turned again and continued on his way miserable stumbling i began running again he turned again when i was some twenty yards from him again i stopped under his gaze for no reason i clearly understood i put my head down he again continued on his way and i again followed him in a moment or two i had caught up with him and lagged behind some ten feet he stopped and turned i stopped and put my head down he continued on his way again and again i followed then again after a few minutes he stopped i stopped too my head down this time he approached me and stood about a yard from me i stood extremely straight with my head down i was terribly conscious of his nearness my nudity his eyes upon me though i was female of earth i had some dim inkling of the tumult of joy and pleasure which the sight of a female body could wreak m a man and i knew that i was very beautiful he put his fingers and thumb under my chin and lifted my head i saw his eyes and looked quickly away not daring to meet them to my horror i wanted him to find me pleasingand as a female he regarded me for a minute or two and then from his shoulder unslung the shield and helmet from his spear from his belt he took the pouch and bota he slung them about my neck then adjusting the straps he fastened the shield at my back i staggered under its weight then carrying the helmet by its straps in his left hand and the spear lightly in his right he turned and began to stride again through the grass staggering under the weight of the shield the pouch and bota about my neck i followed him once he turned and with the spear indicated the position and distance at which i should follow these things vary i learned from city to city and depend also on such matters as context and conditions in a market in the crowding and jostling for instance a girl may follow so closely she pressed against the back of his left shoulder girls seldom follow behind and on the right if she is thusly placed it is commonly a sign she is in disfavor if more than one girl is involved she who follows most closely on the left is generally taken to be in highest favor girls compete for this position in an open area such as the fields in which we trekked the girl is placed usually some five or ten feet behind and on the left if he must move suddenly she will not thusly constitute an impediment to his action he again took up his march carrying his shield the pouch and bota some eight or nine feet behind him on his left i followed him i suppose i should have minded i knew i was heeling him how strange it seemed i understood so little of what had occurred i had awakened stripped and chained on a strange world men had come to the rock where i had been fastened they had had the key to the collar doubtless they had come there to fetch me but who had left me there for them and what had they wanted of me they had questioned me beaten me the word bina had often occurred in their demands var bina they had demanded i of course had not understood then angry they had prepared to cut my throat i had been rescued by a chance male armed and skillful who had happened in the fields at the time he had been judging from the reactions of my original captors completely unexpected and not welcome by his own reactions i had gathered he knew nothing of the men he had met there and had behaved as he might have with any others similarly of his scarletclad helmeted armed sort i had been part of a plan a design i suspected which i did not understand which had been by a chance encounter disrupted but what did the word bina mean there must have been something i was supposed to have or be with me which was not the plan perhaps had been disrupted or had failed prior even to the arrival of the two men at the rock i did not know i understood nothing but perhaps the plan had not been disrupted perhaps even now i carried some secret with me which had been unknown to the two men perhaps they had not understood the way in which i was to have been useful perhaps their information had been incomplete or incorrect i suspected i was intended to be instrumental in something i did not understand i could neither explain nor understand my nature or purpose if any on this world had i been brought here merely as a naked woman it seemed pointless to have placed me as i had been placed in the wilderness too it would have been pointless to have questioned me so closely too why if i had been brought to this world for an obvious purpose of men say for my beauty had the men prepared in their anger to end my life surely it must have been obvious to them that i was eager to do anything they wanted that i was eager to please them had i been brought here merely for my beauty surely they would not have behaved as they had i shuddered recalling the feel of the knife at my throat then the stranger had arrived kajira canjellne he had said i had been released of the chain and collar a circle had been drawn in the turf bound i had been thrown to it kneeling i had watched men fight i now naked and bound carrying his shield followed him who had been victorious i remembered his might his insolence his skill his power i admired the width of his shoulders as he walked before me i remembered the simplicity and audacity with which after his victory he had examined me i now carried his shield i walked behind him and to the left i suppose i should have minded i knew of course that i was heeling him i thought about it whereas it would have seemed unthinkable on earth that a man could be so strong so mighty that a woman would walk at his heel here on this world it seemed not so impossible or strange at all there were men here strong enough to put women at their heel i felt briefly profoundly stirred erotically and perhaps strangely marvelously pleased to be a woman i had never met such men as these the former two and he whom i now followed mightiest among them who would simply unthinkingly put a woman at their heel i had never known such men i had not dreamed such men could exist i had never felt so feminine so stirred so alive and real as in their presence for the first time in my life i was pleased to be a woman then i castigated myself for my terrible thoughts men and women i knew as i had been taught were identical biology and a nature the product of harsh exacting thousands of generations of evolution of time and breeding and animal history was unimportant it must be ignored and dismissed it did not suggest the correct political conclusions i looked up at the three moons i did not know what to believe or how to live but as i followed the man trekking through the glorious grass under the bright marvelous moons carrying his shield literally heeling him as might have an animal his captive nude and bound i felt paradoxically a fantastic sense of freedom of psychological liberation i wanted to run to him and put my head against his shoulder for hours we trekked the grass sometimes i fell he did not stop far me i would struggle to my feet staggering under the weight of the shield and flee to catch up with him but then i could go no further my body was not readied for such treks i was only a girl of earth i fell my breath was short my legs weak i lay in the grass i could not move my body i lay on my side the weight of the shield upon my shoulder after a time i sensed him standing near me looking down i looked up at him i tried to smile i can go no further i said surely he could see my exhaustion my helplessness i could not even move i saw him loosen his belt i struggled to my feet he did not look pleased he would have beaten me he refastened his belt he turned away again i followed him toward morning we crossed more than one tiny stream the water was very cold on my ankles and calves bordering these streams was brush and some trees the fields were broken now with occasional trees many of them flattopped in what i conjecture would have been an hour or so before dawn he stopped in a thicket of trees near a small stream he removed the pouch and bota from my neck the shield from my back i fell to the grass between the trees i moved my wrists a bit and lost consciousness in what must have been a moment or two i was shaken awake a handful of dried meat cut in small pieces was thrust in my mouth lying on my side i chewed and swallowed it i had not realized how hungry i was in a moment he lifted me to a sitting position and his left hand behind my back supporting me thrust the spike of the bota in my mouth eagerly then did i drink he much watered me i lay then again on my side he lifted me in his arms so lightly that it startled me and carried me to a tree as he tethered my right ankle to the tree i bound as i was overcome with exhaustion fell asleep it seemed to me that i was in my own bed i stretched in the pleasant warmth then i awakened suddenly i was in a thicket on a strange world it was warm and the sun high filtered through the branches of the trees i looked at my wrists they were now unbound each wrist deeply wore the circular marks of the leather constraints which earlier had confined them i rubbed my wrists i looked about myself my right ankle by a short length of black leather was tied to a small whitebarked tree i rose to my hands and knees my back to the tree i was still naked i then sat with my back against the tree my legs drawn up my chin on my knees my hands about my knees i watched the man who was sitting crosslegged a few feet away he was putting a thin coating of oil on the blade of his sword he did not look up at me he seemed totally absorbed in his work he must have sensed my awakening my movements but he did not look at me i felt angry i was not used to being ignored particularly by a male they had always been eager to be pleasing to me to do anything i wanted i did not realize that on this world it was such as we who must be pleasing to them who must comply eagerly with whatever their whim might decree i watched him he was a not unattractive man i wondered if it would be possible to work out a meaningful relationship with him he must learn of course to respect me as a woman he finished with the oil and blade he wiped the blade with a cloth leaving on it only a fine evenly spread coating of oil he replaced the cloth and the oil which was in a small vial in his pouch he wiped his hands on the grass and his tunic he resheathed the sword he then looked up at me i smiled at him i wanted to make friends with him he slapped his right ankle and pointed to it and then beckoned me to approach him i bent to untie the dark leather which fastened me to the white tree i first bent to remove the leather from my ankle but a sharp word from him and a gesture indicated to me that i must first remove the tether from about the trunk of the small tree doubtless he thought me stupid did not any girl know that the last bond to be removed is that on her own body but i was of earth and knew nothing of such matters i struggled with my small weak fingers with the knots i worked hard frightened sweating that i might be taking too long but he was patient he knew the knots he had tied could not be easily undone by one such as i then i approached him and with my left hand handed him the supple tether he replaced it in his pouch and indicated that i should position myself before him and to his right i knelt there and smiled at him he spoke sharply harshly immediately i knelt in the position i had learned yesterday which had been clearly and exactly taught to me back on heels back straight hands on thighs head up knees widely opened he then looked at me satisfied how could i make friends with him kneeling so how could i get him to respect me as a person so desirably and beautifully positioned before him how could i so kneeling so beautiful and small so exposed and vulnerable so helpless so much his get him to accept me as his equal i bent forward and took the piece of meat between my teeth from his hand he did not allow me to touch it with my hands how miserable i felt on this world i had not yet even been allowed to feed myself when i had eaten some meat he then gave me to drink again from the bota he must learn i am an equal and a person i resolved i will show him this i broke the position to which he had commanded me i sat upon the grass before him my knees drawn up i smiled sir said i to him i know you cannot understand my language nor i yours but still perhaps from my voice or its tone you may gather something of my feelings you saved my life yesterday you rescued me when i was in great danger i am very grateful for this i thought my head would fly from my neck with such swift savageness was i struck the blow was openhanded taking me on the left side of the face but it must have been clearly audible for a hundred and fifty yards about i rolled stinging crawling for more than twenty feet i threw up in the grass i couldnt see blackness violent velvet plunging deep lights stars seemed to leap and contract and expand and explode in my head again i shook my head again i threw up in the grass then i sank to the side on my stomach i heard a word of command i recognized it i had heard it before swiftly then did i reassume the position which i had dared to break and again i knelt though this time in an agony of terror before the strange mighty man legs spread arms crossed who stood before me blood ran from my mouth other blood i swallowed my vision cleared i could not believe the pounding of my heart i had been cuffed i knelt terrified at that time i did not realize how light had been my discipline considering the gravity of my offense i had both spoken without permission and broken position without permission most simply i had been displeasing to a free man had i known the world on which i knelt how i would have rejoiced that i had not been lashed as i later realized allowances were being made for me which had i been more familiar with the world on which i found myself would not have been made later such allowances would not be and were not made i knelt before the man he stood before me legs spread arms crossed looking down at me gone from me in that moment with the blood that ran from my mouth were my illusions no longer did i deceive myself that i might be his equal the farcicality of that illusion was now transparent to me the pitifulness of that pretense vanished before the simple incontrovertible biological reality which had been impressed upon me in the light of his uncompromising masculine dominance which he in health and power chose to exercise over me a female how beautiful to men must be women i thought who are at their feet i wondered frightened if it were at the feet of men or at least at the feet of such men as this that women belonged if that might be the unperverted order of nature the thought of dominance and submission pervasive in the animal kingdom universal among primates ran through my head never before had i so clearly and profoundly understood the meaning of those words i looked up at him i was frightened my world i knew had chosen to deny and subvert biology this world i gathered had not before him i knelt terrified his to my relief he turned from me yet i remained immobile absolutely fearing to move as though frozen in that elegant and helpless position so vulnerable and exposed which later i learned was the position of the gorean pleasure slave he looked up at the sun it was late afternoon he lay down to sleep i did not break position i had not been given permission perhaps he kept me in position to discipline me i did not know i was afraid to break position i told myself of course that this was rational that he might wake and discover me out of position or that perhaps at times he was not truly asleep but was through halfclosed eyes watching me to see if i in the slightest moved but in my heart i knew i had not broken position because he had not given me permission to do so because he had not released me from his command i was terribly afraid of him i was afraid to break position i was obeying him for more than two hours i think i knelt in position he awakened he looked at me but he did not release me from position i remained as i was in that position so symbolic of female subjugation it was now in the early evening he gathered up the pouch and bota and slung them at his belt he slung his sword in its scabbard over his shoulder he donned his helmet he lifted his shield and spear i looked at him was i not to bear his burdens was i not to carry the pouch and bota was i not to bear his shield with a snap of his fingers and a movement of his hand he released me from position gratefully i moved my body i stretched i saw him watching me stretch catlike reddening i stopped at a sharp word from him i continued to stretch luxuriously brazenly and fully relished doing so he watched me as i moved my body and rubbed my legs that their full circulation might be restored they were stiff and cramped as was the rest of my body after the fixed position in which i had been kept as that discipline sequent upon my cuffing i was aware though would scarcely admit it to myself that my movements as i stretched and moved my hands upon my legs were performed rather differently than they would have been had i been alone i realized though scarce would admit it to myself that i was displaying myself as a female before him he laughed i blushed and lay back angry on the grass the body kept overlong in any position of course even the most natural becomes stiff and cramped a girl incidentally in the position of the gorean pleasure slave but who is not being kept in the position as a discipline in which case she remains rigid is allowed much subtle latitude which she exploits without breaking the position sometimes as she becomes animated she rises a bit from her heels sometimes her hands move on her thighs her shoulders and belly move her head moves her eyes are live and vital she speaks and laughs and radiantly every inch every bit of her alive converses lyrically and delightedly any girl knows that an interesting body is a moving body even within the apparent restraint of the position of the pleasure slave a girls body can be a subtle provocative melody of motion the interplay between the restraint of the position and her animation gives the position incredible power and beauty yes power more than one master i suspect has been enslaved by the beauty who kneels before him it is one of the excruciating delights of the mastery to expose oneself fully to and yet skirt the dangers of the girls beauty to keep oneself strong to draw the absolute fullness of pleasure from her and yet to resist her wiles to get everything from her and yet to keep her on her knees completely i lay back on the grass some girls fight one another with whips to obtain such a master i looked up at the sky it was darker now through the trees the man in whose company i was and in whose power i was had left the thicket i did not fear that he would not return he had not been angry with me too i had seen him look at me and had heard him laugh on earth i had found boys of little interest except for the admiration which they had accorded me i had held myself though frequently dating rather aloof i did not much care to have boys put their mouths on me i would brush them back or thrust them away appear offended say no firmly to them they would apologize stammer redden perhaps i was angry they were sorry truly sorry perhaps i was angry would i forgive them could i even consider going out with them again perhaps but what sort of girl did they think i was i lay in the grass and smiled to myself i wondered at what sort of girl i was there had begun to stir in me feelings which i had never felt before dimly i had begun to sense how it could be that a woman could give herself totally to a man i thought of the stranger i laughed to myself he was no boy with boys i had always felt in command but with the strange mighty man in whose power i now was i knew i was not in command he was in command completely at his slightest word i would leap to serve him how furious how jealous would the boys have been had they seen how perfectly the haughty beautiful girl they could not even interest or impress now responded swiftly eagerly even to the snapping of fingers of another of a true man how they would have hated and feared him how they would have envied him his casual sovereignty over the beauty how perfectly he controlled her as they could not they could not even please her she feared only she could not please him i lay nude on the grass of that strange world in which i found myself in the power of a man other than i dreamed men could be i had been aloof haughty smug too good for men now i feared only i might insufficiently please one man him in whose power i was feelings stirred in me which i had not felt before dimly i had begun to understand how it could be that a woman could give herself fully to a male but i wondered if i would have the opportunity to give myself i might not be accorded this honor on this world it seemed men took what they wanted i might not on this world i knew be extended the courtesy of delicately proffering my virginity as i saw fit in accord with my will i smiled i would not be i suspected on this world permitted to choose upon whom i would bestow it perhaps rather i supposed it would be i who would be chosen and regardless of my will it would simply be taken from me i sensed the return of the man i rolled to my elbow quickly he was standing nearby i looked up at him but he did not command me to my back upon the turf he did not kick apart my legs rather he gestured that i should rise i did so i stood straight before him as i knew he wished me to do on earth never had i stood so straight on this world i knew it was expected of me on this world i did not know what i was but i did know that on this world whatever it was that i was i was expected to stand beautifully i did so it was part of my obedience he did not move but stood leaning on his spear he did not pay me much attention i was merely there subject to him should he speak or gesture after a time he moved about the small clearing and with his foot erased the slight signs of our camp the few small signs of our sojourn in this tiny forest glade he had made no fires then again he stood near me leaning on his spear again he did not pay me much attention i stood to one side i stood straight i did not of course dare to speak or in any way to intrude myself on his attention i did not wish to be again cuffed or disciplined i stood there i stood to one side unimportant i watched him it was dark now my mind raced rapidly contrary to yesterday he had not this day traveled in the light but had spent the day in this tiny glade only a few feet wide concealed by trees about and overhead by their interlacing branches he had made no fires he had now with the coming of darkness taken up his weapons and erased the small signs of our brief camp that he had erased the signs of the camp that he had taken these precautions suggested to me that we stood now in a region within which there might be those who would be hostile to him that at our peril we trespassed now in what might be a country of enemies i shuddered i looked about myself with apprehension at the shadows of the trees and branches did they contain enemies with steel approaching even now might we be set upon ambushed or attacked there was a rustle in a thicket of brush at which the man had been directing his attention i almost cried out with fear i sank miserably to my knees i tried to take his left leg in my hands to hold him but with the butt of his spear he thrust me back and away i flew painfully back to the grass the jabbing blow had not been gentle i crawled back i was terrified i crouched closely behind him hiding myself behind him one knee in the grass i tried to peer about his body if i had had a weapon a civilized weapon even so slight as a small pistol which i might have grasped steadying it with both hands i might have feared less but i had nothing absolutely nothing i had nothing and was totally vulnerable i did not even have a stitch of clothing a thread with which to protect my body my single and only defense was the steel and prowess of the man who stood between me and what some yards away rustled in the dark brush i depended upon him completely i needed him without him i would have been helpless utterly i moaned thinking of how defenseless women must be on this world i supposed they might carry perhaps a slim blade manageable to their small strength and weight a poniard or dagger but what if an assailant such as the man in whose power i was was simply to take it from them i did not know it at the time but girls such as i was to be were not permitted to carry even so slight a weapon as a womans dagger girls such as i was to be were completely dependent upon the protection of men and whether they chose to extend it my hand went before my mouth i saw it in the darkness emerging from the brush i thought at first because of its sinuous movement that it was a great snake but it was not i thought seeing it holding itself closely to the ground but yet free of the ground that it might be a longbodied lizard then as moonlight fell through the tree branches in a pattern across its snout and neck i saw not scales but rippled fur long and thick its eyes caught the light and flashed like burning copper it snarled i gasped it had six legs it was perhaps twenty feet in length perhaps eleven hundred pounds in weight it approached sinuously hissing the man spoke soothingly to the beast his spear faced it it circled us and the man turned always spear ready facing it i kept behind the man then the beast disappeared in the shadows i collapsed at the mans feet shuddering he did not admonish me i was not punished he had not acted as though he particularly feared the beast it was not simply that he was brave and had hunted such animals but as i later understood that he was familiar with the habits of such beasts the beast had not been hunting us commonly such a beast scouts prey surreptitiously and then unless suspecting a trap as with a tethered victim perhaps a stakedout girl used as a lure makes its swift unexpected strike its kill charge the beast had been on another scent probably that of tabuk a small singlehorned antelopelike creature its common game and on its trail we had constituted only a distraction such a beast is a tireless and singleminded hunter domesticated it is often used as a tracker once it sets out upon a scent it commonly pursues it unwaveringly evolution in its case has among other things apparently selected for tenacity this is a useful feature of course in tracking fortunately ours had not been the first scent that night which the beast upon emerging from its lair had taken had it been there would have been grim dealings it is called a sleen i had not known such animals could exist i knelt at the mans feet the right side of my head to his ankle how perilous suddenly i realized was the world in which i found myself i was completely defenseless helpless in a world such as this without a man such as he to protect me i might be simply hunted down and torn to pieces by wild beasts i needed a man such as he to protect me i looked up at him he must protect met i needed his protection i would pay any price necessary for his protection in his eyes i saw that he would exact what price he pleased i put my head down how i feared a world on which there were such men and beasts the name of this world is gor he gestured me to my feet and i stood again straight frightened he regarding me he had already erased the signs of our small camp this i had taken as evidence that he was ready to soon make his departure from this place i did not meet his eyes i did not dare to meet them in his presence aside from my fear and vulnerability i felt for the first time in my life certain deep and overwhelming and indescribable sensations these sensations i knew had something to do with sexuality his maleness so strong so dominant and my femaleness so small so weak so much at his mercy i was confused astonished troubled i wanted to please him yes could it be possible can that be imagined in such a situation that i an earth girl the helpless captive of a brutally handsome mighty barbarian wished to please him and as a woman yes it is true it is simply true hold me in contempt if you must i do not object i am not ashamed i wanted to please the dominant beast further i wanted to please him not simply from fear but also incredibly perhaps to your mind out of an inexplicable gratitude for his dominance which for no reason i understood and in spite of my earth conditioning i found glorious i found myself grateful for his strength and proud for it though i knew i was the helpless object upon which it would be exercised i found these sensations deeply disturbing and profoundly thrilling i stood straight i though a girl of earth virginal well trained and conditioned intelligent and of good family wanted to throw myself naked in the grass at the feet of such a man his he lifted his head and looked away from me out through the trees i was eager to carry his shield to have its heavy weight placed across my small back that i might serve him again as i had before as his lovely beast of burden heeling him but he did not again stagger me beneath that ponderous weight he stood now i knew in a country of enemies he retained the shield as he did the spear the sword i wanted to beg him on my knees to rape me he turned and left the tiny glade swiftly i followed him we did not walk far as i walked behind him i castigated myself for my weakness in the glade how i hated myself how i must improve and strive to be strong so narrowly had i evaded the loss of my personhood my selfrespect in the glade in the darkness among the trees so much his i had almost compromised my identity and integrity i a girl of earth had wanted to yield to him a harsh barbarian was i not a free individual a person had i no pride how furious i was with myself i knew that in the glade had he so much as put his hand forth to touch my shoulder i would have sunk trembling eager moaning helpless to the grass at his feet i would have writhed before him for his slightest touch how relieved i was that i had escaped this degradation how angry i was why had he not taken me in the glade had he no regard for my feelings had i not been sufficiently pleasing to him he turned about and with a gesture cautioned me to immobility and silence we stood at the edge of the trees approaching in the darkness we saw some twenty torches i was frightened i did not know what manner of men these might be there were some seventy or eighty individuals in the retinue which was strung out the length of their line of march was perhaps some forty or fifty yards its width some ten yards ten men armed on each side flanked the march these carried the torches some five men armed preceded the march some three followed some ten or twelve other armed men here and there occupied positions in the march in the march too there occurred two platforms and following toward the rear one wagon the platforms were white and carried on the shoulders of ten men apiece the wagon was brown and was drawn by two large brown widehorned shaggy oxlike shambling creatures conducted by two men the men who carried the platforms and those who conducted the shambling oxlike creatures were dressed not dissimilarly from the others those flanking the march and those in and about the march the march approached the man in whose power i was slipped back more deeply among the trees i of course drew back with him he did not seem disturbed or surprised at the line of march i sensed that he had expected it that he had perhaps been waiting for it that he had scouted it the line of march would take its way rather closely to us we were concealed in brush silent the line of march approached the trees i could see that on the first carried platform there were some five figures those of women on the second there were several chests and boxes some covered with sheens of glistening material in the wagon under a loose canvas were other boxes but simpler and grosser in appearance and poles and tenting materials and arms and casks of fluid we withdrew a bit further into the brush the line of march would approach us rather closely my captor had put aside his shield and spear he now stood behind me and slightly to my left his hands were on my upper arms we in the light of the torches watched the approaching retinue i was thrilled it was so barbaric what different humans these were on this unhurried stately barbaric world so different from that which i knew i wondered how i had come here and what i might be doing here the vanguard of the torched procession neared us i could see the weapons of the men the tunics scarlet the helmets and shields were not cut and formed and decorated as were those of the brute who held me by the upper arms he did not seem to wish his presence detected suddenly i wanted to cry out my body had perhaps moved m the slightest tremor i froze the blade of his knife was across my throat his left hand large and heavy was firmly fixed across my mouth i could utter no sound with the blade at my throat i did not so much as squirm i remained absolutely still perhaps these men toward whom he conducted himself as an intruder and enemy might rescue me surely they could be no worse than the brute who held me he was not a gentleman perhaps they were he had fought with savage steel to possess me he had candidly upon his victory to my horror appraised my flesh he had kept me bound for hours he had made me carry his shield and heel him like an animal he had cuffed me and put me under discipline he had not treated me as the free and rightful person i was i had wanted to cry out to attract the attention of the other men perhaps they might rescue me perhaps they might return me somehow to earth or put me in touch with those with whom i might negotiate arrangements for my return to my native world i saw the women on the white platform being carried how beautifully garbed they were obviously these men held women in proper respect regarding them with rightful reverence not treating them like animals i had decided swiftly boldly to cry out that i might by my resolute action procure my rescue perhaps the slightest anticipatory tremor of my decision had coursed through my body there was a knife at my throat i did not cry out almost instantaneously his hand had closed over my mouth heavy and firm and efficient i was pulled back against his tunic and leather i could make no sound i did not even squirm i could still feel the knife at my throat the vanguard of the torched procession passed us over the mans large hand closing my mouth making me helpless i watched the palanquin carrying the women past on it were five women girls four of these were barearmed but garbed in flowing classic white oddly enough considering the beauty of their raiment they were barefooted they did not wear veils they were darkhaired and to my eye startlingly beautiful they wore what appeared to be golden circlets about their neck and a golden bracelet on the left wrist they knelt or sat or reclined about the foot of a white ornate curule chair set on the platform in this chair in graceful lassitude weary sat another girl though one whose features as she wore sheaths of pinned veils i could not well remark i was startled discerning the volume and splendor of her robes they were multicolored and brilliant in their sheens and chromatic textures and so draped and worn that particularly at the hem the diverse borders of these various garments seemed to compete with one another to win the observers accolade as the finest the most resplendent of all about the robes and over the hood and veils of the garmenting were slung medallions and necklaces of wrought gold pendant with gems on her hands were white gloves fastened with hooks of gold beneath the final hem of the innermost robe i saw the toes of golden slippers jeweled and scarletthreaded sparkling in the torchlight only in a barbarian world i thought could raiment dare be so lavish so gorgeous so rich then the palanquin had passed and more torches and men the second palanquin was preciously freighted with chests and boxes colorful and bound with brass and chains some of these were covered over with rich cloths that sparkled under the torchlight i supposed that the procession was a wedding procession and that the second palanquin carried rich gifts perhaps the brides dowry or rich gifts to accompany her perhaps to be delivered to the groom or his parents the wagon which followed late in the procession that drawn by the conducted shambling oxlike creatures carried i conjectured the supplies of the retinue the journey i gathered was long the bride and her maids as i assumed them to be doubtless had far to travel then the men the torches disappeared in the distance through the trees they were gone the hand left my mouth he released me the knife no longer lay at my throat my knees felt weak i almost fell he resheathed the knife and turned me by the arms to face him he pushed up my chin that i must look at him i met his eyes briefly and put down my head he knew that i had intended to cry out to reveal our position but i had been unable to do so i shook with terror for i feared then he might slay me i fell to my knees before him and though i was an earth girl i put down my head and delicately holding his booted sandals fearfully pressed my lips to his feet he turned about and left the forested area and i hurried to accompany him he had not slain me he had not tied me to a tree for sleen to devour he had not even lashed me to within an inch of my life i followed him i thought to myself now i know how to deal with this man i need only salve his vanity i need only perform placatory gestures i thought myself then clever and he a fool to be so manipulated by a girl i did not understand at that time the incredible lenience with which i had been treated or that the patience of such a man is not inexhaustible i would be taught these truths shortly i was an ignorant and foolish girl i would learn that ignorance and foolishness are not long tolerated in a girl such as i was to be on gor the camp angrily i tended the brazier on my knees fanning the coals sparks flew from the ironbanded fire stinging my body eta strode past me i hated her she was darkhaired incredibly beautiful her dark hair swirled behind her to her waist she had been given clothing i had not i envied her the sleeveless body scrap of brown rag short high on her thighs which briefly concealed her it was fastened with two hooks which might be swiftly broken and torn away a man sat drinking to one side a strong brew called paga spears were stacked to one side and shields lay about against the sheltering inclosing cliffs we were in a wooded canyon one of many in the area a small stream also one of several in the area ran through the camp roughly as we were situated some two thirds of the camp was closed in by projecting sides of the canyon roughly then about a third of its perimeter was closed by a thick wall of recessed cut thorn brush some eight feet high and ten feet thick a defense against animals within the camp itself and about it were several trees some of them rather large the camp would not be much visible from the air similarly it would not be visible from the ground unless one should almost stumble upon it following this small canyon rather than various others in the vicinity my captor and i had arrived at this camp after some four days of trekking during this time he had not spoken to me and i had followed him at the position and distance which he had indicated how relieved i had been that he had not forced his attentions upon me and used me as a female and how sullenly and angrily i had followed him more so each day was i not pleasing to him i knew i had been very fortunate i had been in his power completely and he had not pressed his advantage he had not exploited his opportunity how pleased i was and how furious how i had begun to hate him he had not permitted me to feed except when kneeling and from his hand he watered me similarly except that when a stream was encountered he would sometimes order me to my belly on the pebbles i would then his hand in my hair not using my hands drink from the water was i not his was i not physically attractive to him why had he not forced me to serve him as a woman he kept me under his dominance strictly and then when i obviously ached for his touch he would turn away he would not so much as glance at me i hated him i hated him the last two days of the trek we had traveled much in daylight and he had permitted me to carry his shield we had come then i had gathered out of overtly hostile territory that this camp was sheltered and set as it was i took to be a matter of common camp practice among such men as he and those who served him men such as he in small parties even in their own countries seldom made open camps why had he not used me i hated him with a piece of stiff leather i fanned the coals in the brazier an iron protruded from the coals eta passed me again a haunch of meat upon her shoulder grease from it in her hair she was vital barefoot and tanned her body was beautiful in the brief rag she wore her only jewelry was a sturdy steel band looped closely quite attractively rather snugly about her throat she was a longlegged sensuous hoteyed slut she was the sort of woman i supposed whom the men of earth in fear would not even dare to let enter their dreams yet she seemed to fit in well at the feet of the mighty men of gor who without thought would handle her well and get much and all from her how disgusting she was i hated her i had been in the camp now for better than two days we had arrived in the late afternoon of the day before yesterday in the vicinity of the camp upon our approach to it my captor had taken his shield from me which i had been bearing for him one does not approach a camp even ones own unarmed one does not know what may have transpired in ones absence he had left me alone kneeling while he had scouted the camp shortly thereafter he had returned and gestured for me to rise and follow him he approached the camp singing and striking his spear blade on his shield call words were exchanged royally was he greeted by the men of the camp who rushed forth to welcome him men among whom i gathered he was chieftain they shouted and clasped him striking him upon the back and laughing i stood back frightened of such men then a longlegged dream of a girl eta had stood timidly near the entrance to the camp where thorn brush had been wedged aside during the daylight hours she had stood there not daring to approach then my captor had indicated that she might enter his presence radiantly joyously she fled to him and knelt before him putting her head to his feet his shield and spear and helmet he handed to another at a word from him then she leapt to her feet and he took her in his arms as though he might own her and she kissed him too as though she might be owned never had i seen human beings kiss like that it seemed a deeply sensuous complementarity that shook me to the core it was the kiss of lovers but more than the kiss of lovers it was the kiss of a lover who is owned and of one who owns his lover then he laughed and thrust her to one side then all turned to regard me how i wished that he had held me and kissed me as he did her how jealous i was then suddenly realizing the eyes of all upon me i was frightened the men and the girl stood about me i stood straight they moved about me i reddened assessed comments were exchanged i sensed myself being discussed with open frankness as might have been an animal some of the comments i sensed were less than completely flattering some i sensed were clearly disparaging most cruelly i resented the laughter at that time i had not been brought by strict diet and enforced exercise to optimum measurement perhaps too at that time i was not standing as well as i might have i was standing straight but perhaps too stiffly too immobilely not subtly in movement in my breathing the movements of my shoulders the tiny movements of my head almost imperceptible but contributing to the impression of a profoundly alive body one richly latent with the promise of incredible responsiveness but mostly i suspect i was found wanting in subtle psychological dimensions available to the acute observer as a consequence of almost subliminal cues these matters are conveyed by subtleties of facial expression and physical demeanor i was a girl raised in a culture predicated on the denial of primate biological realities a girl from a world in which hypothetically cogent animals denied denounced and hysterically strove to suppress their own animality a world in whose social insanity even sexuality had now come to be politically suspect most simply as a normal girl of my world i had been negatively conditioned with respect to men and sex in the last few years an accretion to this form of conditioning i had been taught that men were my equals and that men and women were the same if this were so why then did i feel so small and slight among the gorean men and tremble when they put their hands upon me among the men of earth thoughtful and cute and kind i had not felt small and slight nor did i tremble when they put their hands upon me i had felt only irritation and would push them away i did not dare to push away a gorean man i might have been put under discipline further i found myself longing though i did not admit this to myself at the time to lie lovingly in their arms theirs i think the major reason i so failed to impress the men at the camp of my captor was because at that time i had not yet been taught to come alive as a woman i did not yet know what men were like or what they could do to me i did not then know how they in their power could wrench out my insides and bring me to my knees before them i had not learned their manhood accordingly i had not yet learned my womanhood sexually i was like most girls of earth negativistic and inert only on gor in the presence of my captor had i at times begun to suspect that there was an incredible glorious world of experience not forbidden on this planet to which my nature as a female fully entitled me could i but dare to be myself but my fear was groundless i needed not dare i needed not decide to become myself gorean men do not tolerate pretense and hypocrisy in a girl such as i was to be against my will i would be forced to be what i was much did my captors men jest with him on the deficiencies of his prize laughing did he strike and kick at them and the girl taking his arm smiling kissing at him pulled him away from me they turned the entire party and went into the camp leaving me outside i stood aside alone i was furious i had in effect been spurned rejected nothing in my experience had prepared me for this treatment i felt the gravel of the canyon under my feet the sunlight reflected from the walls my fists were clenched who did these barbarians think they were i was the most beautiful girl in the junior class at an elite girls college on earth perhaps in the college as a whole the only exception might perhaps have been the beautiful senior in anthropology elicia nevins we had been great rivals but she had only been an anthropology major whereas i was an english major and a poetess but then i recalled the beautiful intelligentseeming hoteyed slut in the brown rag in a world where there might be such women i realized gasping judy thorntons beauty and even that of an elicia nevins would not be particularly outstanding as i would later learn the value placed on girls such as we were a judy thornton or an elicia nevins girls of our quality would commonly be a tiny sack of copper corns a few more a few less i went inside the brush wall and knelt down i wanted to be protected and fed i would do what they wished to pay for my lodging behind me the thorn brush so thick and high by means of hooked poles was pulled into place closing me in the camp with the men and the girl i had now been in the camp for two days angrily i tended the brazier on my knees fanning the coals sparks scattered about my body was stung by them i used a squarish piece of stiff leather to fan the coals from the brazier protruding was the handle of an iron many were the menial tasks which i was forced to perform in and about the camp i was not pleased i had been forced to build fires and help cook the food i had been forced to help serve the food and to pour wine and paga for the men as though i might be a servant i had been forced to help put food away afterwards and clean goblets and utensils and clear away the litter and debris of the feeding i had been forced to sew rent garments and once not satisfied with a seam eta had had me rip out the thread and perform the entire task again doing it well to my humiliation too i was taught to wash clothing on rocks pounding and rinsing on my knees at the edge of the tiny stream which moved through the camp outside the camp i was set to picking berries and gathering armloads of wood outside the camp i would be accompanied by one of my captors men on earth i had enjoyed a rather elevated socioeconomic status in my home we had always had as long as i could remember both a maid and a cook from the age of fifteen i had enjoyed giving them orders as an equal but not quite i was not the sort of girl who was accustomed to perform menial tasks or be of service to others that was for women of a rather different class one beneath mine but here in this camp i was helping eta to cook and clean and sew and performing even more degrading tasks such as serving men at their meals that might be all right for eta i did not know her class judging by her garment it was low but it was not all right for judy thornton i was a brilliant girl and i wrote poetry sometimes when no men were about i would refuse to help eta she would then not speaking not protesting but sullenly perform the task herself when men were about i would do what tasks she set me i was afraid of the men there were sixteen men in the camp including my captor though seldom during the day were there more than four or five within its confines my captor himself had set me the work of tending the coals in the brazier where the iron was heating i did not dare disobey him i was not surprised that there were coals for the brazier as on my first full day in the camp moving about it i had discovered that it was well stocked with supplies it was in the nature of a cache camp which might be returned to now and again in a cave in the adjoining cliff there were several boxes several were locked but others were open there were flasks of wine there and bottles of the brew called paga stores of salt grains dried meats and vegetables tunics cloths and blankets too there were tools and utensils and threads and needles i found some perfumes and jewelries i did not dare to bedeck myself with them though i was curious to do so they were quite barbaric the girl eta i noted wore as her only jewelry a sturdy band on her neck this suggested to me that one were not simply free to help oneself to such finery doubtless if the men wished me to wear such jewelries they would throw them to my feet and order me to don them or perhaps more frighteningly they would with their large hands put them on my body themselves i found a chest containing medicines and bandages too there were some rolls of furs a box of leather goods too i found which contained strips of leather pieces of leather and straps of various sorts i found two whips but i did not understand their function as the men seemed to have no animals on which to use them also though heavy enough they seemed rather shortbladed for the ponderous beasts i had earlier seen in the retinue those shambling oxlike beasts drawing the wagon their soft leather blades were not more than a yard long indeed the blades of one were scarcely wider than a girls back there was also a box of chains there i did not look at them closely i did not understand their purpose to one side had lain the sacks of coals and some irons i tended the brazier it was now late afternoon a few yards away eta was roasting the haunch of meat on a spit i could smell the roasting meat i was hungry in the confines of the camp my captor had continued to restrict my feeding to his degrading handouts which he would place in my mouth or make me reach for kneeling not using my hands how i hated him how he kept me on my knees to him how i hated him and yet he was the most magnificently attractive man i had ever seen i hoped he would let me have a scrap of the roast meat how relieved i had been on the trek that he had not abused me not used me for his pleasure as would have been so easy i his helpless naked captive and yet too how angry i had grown so amorous so weak so frustrated had i not been his was i not physically attractive to him i knew now i was no eta but surely i was better than nothing why had he not taken me if only throwing me to the grass briefly brutally he had kept me under his dominance strictly and then when i had obviously ached for his touch he would turn away not so much as glancing at me one night when i had laid near him bound hand and foot i had literally whimpered in my need trying to put my head against him he had put wadding in my mouth and lashed it in with binding gagging me then pushed me from his side that he might sleep i slept little that night rolling and squirming with misery two days later after we had stopped to camp my need so much upon me i knelt before him and tears in my eyes began kissing at his feet and legs i lifted my eyes to him filled with team rape me i begged rape me but he had turned away that night in my bonds for hours i had wept and squirmed i was then a virgin i did not even know fully then what a man could do to me yet even then had i been told how it is that girls of a certain sort of a sort which i was soon to find myself to be could sometimes in their need scream and writhe in the grass could sometimes dance wildly beneath the moons clawing at them could sometimes tear their fingernails bloody scratching at the cement of their kennels could sometimes bruise their bodies hurling them against the bars of their cells or tear their flesh pulling against their shackles to touch a guard i would have dimly understood how cruel men are sometimes not to satisfy such a woman but i resolved to resist my captor all of the men had by now filtered back into the camp two men were playing to one side a board game with tall pieces there were one hundred squares on the board some four or five men crouched about watching the play other men sat about most talked two drank wine together one man worked on the scabbard of his sword with a small fine tool another man was slowly and smoothly sharpening the blade of his spear my captor with two lieutenants sat over a map drawn with a stick in the earth they discussed some project the nature of which i of course ignorant of the language could not understand once one of the lieutenants glanced up toward me looking at me then he returned his attention to the map my captor rose to his feet and approached the brazier i knelt back on my heels with a heavy glove picked up from the grass he pulled forth the iron and examined it it was whitish hot i withdrew from it leaning back so intense was its heat he thrust the iron back in the brazier deeply and indicated i should continue my labors with which directive of course i complied he returned to his lieutenants they continued their conversation their discussion or planning eta hummed and sang as she tended the roasting meat heavy and hot dripping fat hissing into the fire on its greenwood spit sometimes she glanced over to me i was not too pleased with the way she smiled at me she seemed in an unusually good humor especially considering that i had refused to help her several times this afternoon the last time she had wanted my help in polishing leather of course i had refused such work might be appropriate for a girl such as eta but not for the likes of judy thornton i was no cook no maid no polisher of a mans leather i was judy thornton i was not a servant no i was the sort of girl who had servants who gave them their orders who managed them and supervised them in their duties i was too good to be a servant i did not understand the purpose for which the iron was being heated it was clearly a marking or branding iron yet there was no animal in the camp to be marked i had expected one to be brought in perhaps one which had been somewhere acquired but none was brought in i then conjectured that one of the men perhaps my captor since it was be who had had me tend the brazier wished to mark something which he owned imprinting in it an identificatory design perhaps a harness or belt or the leather of a brasshooped shield it seemed to me a sensible idea i had seen the design at the tip of the iron it was a small flower stylized it was circular about an inch and a half in diameter it was not unlike a small rose it was incredibly lovely and delicate i thought the design was very beautiful i certainly would not have minded marking something i owned with it the only reservation i had pertaining to the design was that i thought it might be a bit too delicate and lovely like a lovely rose to appropriately mark goods of a gross masculine nature such as say harnesses or shields it seemed it might considering its resemblance to a rose much more appropriately mark something feminine the sun was down now and the supper would soon be ready the coals in the brazier glowed there was a whitebarked fallen tree close at hand within the camp enclosure it was broken off some four feet from the ground and the fallen trunk from that height inclined downward i looked about the camp at the men and at eta they were rough strong men who played cruel games yesterday evening i had been forced to aid eta in serving the men carrying meat to them in my teeth later i had moved among them as they had summoned me pouring them wine and paga i must take the goblet fill it kiss it delicately and proffer it to the male after the supper eta was taken and belled i shrank back they wound thongs more than a yard in length closely set with small bells about her tanned ankles more bells they tied about her wrists they then took strings of bells and threw them looped about her neck five men stood in a line some yards from her who were to be the contestants he who was to act as referee then tore away from eta the brief rag she wore the men cried out with pleasure smiting their left shoulders with the palms of their right hands eta regarded them the bells upon her body and about her neck and breasts proudly arrogantly there was a mark on her left thigh but i could not well see it in the darkness then her hands were taken behind her and tied opaque cloths were brought and bets were placed eta continued to regard the men haughtily then about her belly the referee fastened a tight thong on this thong at her left hip was fastened a single bell larger than the others and of a different note it would serve in particular to guide the men then as she stood proudly a cloth was thrown over her head and tied under her chin she was hooded the girl is hooded in order that she not be able to influence the outcome of the sport too i suspect the men enjoy having her hooded that she in the darkness of the hood in her helplessness will not know who it is who seizes her gorean men the beasts find such things amusing the five men were then similarly hooded the opaque cloths thrown over their heads and tied under their chins eta in her hood stood absolutely still not causing the rustle of a bell the five men then to the amusement of the observers were led about the camp and turned muchly about that they be completely disoriented the referee then taking up a switch went to the vicinity of eta i watched from the shadows i was indignant and horrified of course too i was consumed with pity for my unfortunate sister too i was curious to see who it would be who would first seize her of the five contestants i knew well whom i would have first chosen had i had a choice in such matters to get his hands on me a blond shaggy haired young giant with freckled wrists whose hair clung about his shoulders to me he was the most attractive man in the camp after my captor my captor did not join in the game he was chieftain and leader it was sport for the lower ranks something to relieve the tedium of the camp but my captor watched with interest and pleasure he lifted paga to his lips i think too he had wagered on the outcome the game of girl catch is played variously upon gor it can be played as informally and simply as it was in the camp of my captor for the pleasure of his men or it can be a fairly serious business closely supervised and regulated in a sophisticated manner as it is by merchant administrators in the rings outside the perimeters of the sardar fairs where the young men of various cities compete in one form there a hundred young men and a hundred young women of one city the women selected for their beauty enter the ring in competition with a hundred young men and a hundred young women of another city similarly selected in this form no hoods are worn the object of the male is to protect his own women and secure those of the enemy a girl is caught stripped bound hand and foot and carried to the girl pit of the capturing city into which she is thrown if she cannot free herself she is counted as a catch her own men may not enter the girl pit of the capturing city to free her sometimes this game is played with the winning side determined by its catches within a time limit sometimes in more brutal versions by the first city which secures the hundred women of its enemy a male is disqualified from further participation in the contest if he is forced from the ring women from the victorious city who may have been captured are of course upon the victory of their city freed women from the conquered city on the other hand are not they are kept they are turned over to the young males of the capturing city in the game in which the first hundred captures decides victory this means there is a girl for each participating young man usually one he himself brought bound to the girl pit accordingly particularly in the early phases of the game the young males often devote their acquisitive attentions to those young women of the enemy city who are the most attractive to them personally to those they would most enjoy taking home with them at the end of the day this sport of girl catch interestingly when matters of honor are not thought to be involved has been used upon occasion by cities to settle boundary disputes and avert wars in the camp of my captor however the rules were simple the referee lifted his switch he cried out a word which i would later learn meant quarry it is the signal that the game has begun that the girl is now available that she is now at large for capture at the same time that he had cried out this word he had swung the switch and struck eta a swift stinging blow below the small of the back making her cry out identifying her original position and with a jangle of bells starting her into motion the men wheeled toward the sound eta stopped frozen she was crouched over her hands tied behind her back whether the slender supple disciplinary device would be used often in the game depends much on the skill of the girl player she must following the rules move at least once in every five ihn which is a little less than five seconds if she does not move within five inn perhaps being frightened or having miscounted the referee with the switch swiftly and exactly identifies her position for the contestants an instant before the five ihn were up eta jangling with bells darted off changing her position some of the men cried out angrily for she had darted unknowingly between two of them the referee cautioned the men sharply the male contestants must not identify themselves such an identification in that it might affect the girls behavior she perhaps desiring capture by a particular male might unfairly influence the outcome of the game needless to say the girl is expected to be an excellent quarry if she is a poor quarry and puts up a disappointing run and is too soon captured her wrists are tied over her head and she is lashed it is seldom necessary to do this of course girls pride themselves on their evasive skills in girl catch they strive with every fiber in their small bodies to be cunning elusive quarry not to be easily caught with delight do they struggle to elude the predator with relish do they know belled their capture and seizure is inevitable eta was skilled in the game but so too were the men often i suspected had she been thusly hunted and the men of the camp her hunters twice did the referee with his switch incite the beauty to motion at last it seemed she knew not which way to turn the men silent were about her blindly hooded she fledinto the arms of the young blond giant with a cry of pleasure he seized her and flung her to the grass pinned beneath him she was caught the referee called out a word which i would later learn was capture and slapped the man on the shoulder the other men stepped back then to my horror i saw eta still hooded and bound in her bells ravished in the grass when the young man had finished with her he stood up and unknotted the hood from his head casting it aside men lifted cups to him and shouted and pounded him upon the back he was grinning he had won he returned to his place moneys were exchanged eta lay on her side in the grass she seemed small lying there hooded and bound in her bells by all but me she was forgotten i felt terribly sorry for my poor sister and i envied her her ravishment in a few moments the referee had returned to her and by the arms thrown her again to her feet she stood unsteadily trembling the motion of her body agitating the bells he again called the word i was later to learn was quarry and again he put her into motion with the switch again the men stalked her second place was at stake she did not run as well this time but perhaps because this time there were only four pursuers performed on the whole commendably in some two or three minutes she was again taken and to my horror was with pleasure and ruthlessness again subjected to the indignity of the caught female her second captor handling her with an audacity and simple physical proprietorship scarcely inferior to that of the first how sorry i felt for her and how secretly i envied her i watched while third place and fourth place were won the fifth man when he had removed his hood was the butt of much goodhumored laughing and pushing he losing out had not won the right to ravish the belied beauty the referee removed the hood from eta who threw back her head shaking her hair drinking in the night air her face was flushed and broken out it was suffused with pleasure oddly she seemed shy her hands were freed she sat on the grass removing the bells from her body she removing bells from her right ankle looked over at me i looked at her angrily she smiled she removed the last of the bells then she laughed and came over and kissed me i did not even look at her then she went to pick up the brown rag which the referee had removed from her before the start of the sport she did not try to put the rag on but carried it in her hand loosely and went to lie at the feet of my captor i remembered how she had looked at me it was the look of a woman who knows herself incredibly desired and beautiful who was at the mercy of men and who because they had wished it had been put muchly to their pleasure i was angry with her too i envied her too she had looked upon me as though i might be a naive girl it was dark now the whitebarked tree fallen within the camp enclosure broken off some four feet from the ground the trunk then inclining to the ground was near i saw that eta had finished with the meat two men had by the spit lifted the hot impaled roast and put it on the grass for cutting i was pleased that supper was near i tended the brazier it glowed in the darkness two men came and stood over me i looked up startled they pulled me up by the arms and took me to the whitebarked tree they threw me on my back my head down on the tree i looked at them wildly my hands were tied together before my body and then pulled up and over my head they were fastened behind my head out of my vision to the tree my body was stretched out one leg on each side of the trunk what are you doing i cried i felt my body being tightly roped to the tree i squirmed my head down my legs up stop i cried ropes were placed on my neck and belly and on each leg above the knees and at the ankles and lashed tightly stop i begged please stop i could barely move the men stepped back i was fastened to the tree let me go i cried please i whimpered what are you going to do i asked they looked at me i was helpless what are you going to do i whimpered oh no i cried no no no no my captor had gone to the brazier and with the leather glove and another too with two hands withdrawn the whitehot iron i felt the heat of it even feet away no i screamed no two men large men strong held my left thigh immobile i looked into the eyes of my captor please no i wept please no then head down helpless held i was branded a gorean slave girl the marking i suppose took only a few seconds that is doubtless true objectively i grant you the truth of that yet a girl who has been marked finds this obvious truth difficult to accept psychologically perhaps i may be granted that those seconds those few seconds seem very long seconds for an hour it seemed i felt the iron it touched me firmly kissing me then claiming me i screamed and screamed i was alone with the pain the agony the degradation the relentless hissing object so hurting me the men mercifully they let me scream it is common to let a girl scream a gorean kindness while she is being marked with a whitehot iron afterwards however once the iron is pulled out of her body and she is fully marked gorean males are less likely to accord her such consideration for her feelings they are less likely then to be so indulgent with her this makes sense afterwards she is only a branded girl it begins swiftly almost before you can feel it i felt the iron touch me and almost instantaneously crackling flash through my outer skin and then firmly to my horror enter and lodge itself fixedly in my thigh it was literally in my body inflexibly burning the pain then began to register on my consciousness i began screaming i could not believe what was being done to me or how much it hurt not only could i feel the iron but i could hear it hissing and searing in the precise beautiful wound it was relentlessly burning in my thigh there was an odor of burning flesh mine i smelled burning as of a kind of meat it was my own body being marked i could not move my thigh i threw back my head and screamed i felt the iron tight in my body then to my horror pressing in even more deeply the marking surface of the iron then lay hissing literally submerged in my flesh i could not move my thigh in the least i threw my head from side to side screaming the marking surface of the iron is some quarter of an inch in depth it was within my flesh it was lodged there submerged hissing and burning taking its time not hurrying it marked me cleanly and deeply then swiftly cleanly it withdrew i smelled burned meat my own the men released my thigh i began to choke and sob men regarded the mark my captor was commended on his work i gathered i had been well marked the men then left me and i continued to lie head down roped and helpless on the broken inclined trunk of the whitebarked tree i was overwhelmed psychologically with what had happened to me the pain was now less my thigh still stung and cruelly but the pain seemed relatively unimportant now compared to the enormity of the comprehension that shook me to the core i had been branded i shuddered in the bonds i moaned i wept my thigh would be sore for days but that was unimportant even trivial what would remain was the mark they had placed in my flesh that unlike the pain would not vanish i would continue to wear that mark it would from now on identify me as something which i had not been or had not explicitly been before but now was clearly for the eyes of all i lay there i knew i now was because of the brand deeply and profoundly different than i had been before what could a brand mean i shuddered i scarcely dared conjecture the nature of a girl who wore such a mark on her body she could be only one thing i forced the thought from my mind i tried to move my wrists my head and body my legs and ankles i could move them very little they were helpless in their constraints only animals wore brands i lay there helpless miserable i was judy thornton i was an excellent student at an elite girls college on earth i was the most beautiful girl in the junior class perhaps in the whole school unless for my rival the lovely senior in anthropology elicia nevins i was an english major and a poetess how was it then that i lay bound on a strange world and bore in my flesh a fresh brand how elicia nevins would have laughed with delight could she have seen me her lovely saucy rival brought so low even to a brand i considered elicia we had been catty haughty and smug to one another competing in our beauty our honors and popularity how she would laugh to see me now i could not even now have looked her in the face the brand had made me different she did not have a brand i did had she faced me then and i been unbound i would have lowered my eyes and head and in shame knelt before her had a simple mark on my thigh made me so different i suspected that it had i shuddered i thought of the boys with whom i had gone out on earth those immature young men many of them rich and wellplaced socially whom i had accepted as escorts and dates often for no better reason than to display my unusual popularity before the other girls in the school what if they should see me now some i supposed would have fled in terror had i a branded girl been thrown to their feet others perhaps stricken and confused would have blubbered and stammered looking away covering me with their coats speaking tumbled incoherent soothing words solicitous and hypocritical how many of them i wondered would do what they truly wanted as i had little doubt gorean men would do how many of them i wondered would simply look down and see me at their feet as what i was a branded girl i wondered how many would look down upon me laugh with pleasure and say i have always wanted you judy thornton now i am going to have you and then take me by the arm and throw me to their sheets few i suspected yet now branded for the first time i was acutely aware of the fantastic strength and size of even such boys not even men not even gorean men compared to my own diminutive strength and stature such matters had not seemed important before now they seemed extremely important before i had been able to put off boys with a glance a gesture a sharp word but what if now they should see me as i now was wearing a brand would they simply laugh now at my silly glance my gesture my protest would they simply laugh and do what they wanted with me or perhaps like gorean men would they first discipline me and then perform upon me what actions they chose with the brand i knew i was somehow deeply and profoundly different i lay on the whitebarked tree trunk head down weeping the brand was on gor legal institutional status that which it marks it makes an object its victim has no rights or appeal within the law yet the most profound consequences of the brand seem to be less social than intensely individual personal and psychological the brand almost instantaneously transforms the deepest consciousness of a girl i resolved to fight these feelings to keep my personhood even wearing a brand i lay confined in bonds i could scarcely move but i suspected and truly that the mightiest bond i wore was not the strict confining loops on my wrists or belly but the newly incised brand on my body later i suspected even if coils of rope and heavy chains might be heaped upon me or i should be confined in cells or kennels the most complete and inescapable shackle placed upon me would nonetheless be always that delicate feminine design that small lovely flower resembling a rose burned into the flesh of my upper left thigh i heard the sounds of the camp about me the men were near the fire the roasted meat was being cut there was conversation eta longlegged and beautiful was serving the men i look up at the rich gorean night beautiful with bright stars turning my head i could see the three moons i felt the smooth brittle bark of the whitebarked tree beneath my back on the interior of my thighs tied as i was i could smell the roast meat the vegetation about i heard insects i tried to move my ankles and wrists i could move them very little i had cried a great deal my cheeks tearstained felt tight under the salty rivulets which had dried upon them i wondered what could be my status on this world now that i had been marked what could be the nature on a world such as this of a girl who wore such a mark on her body men from about the fire including my captor and eta too approached me my captor took my head in his hands and held it so that i must look up at him i looked to him for pity in his eyes there was no pity i branded shuddered in his grasp kajira said he to me clearly and simply kajira then he released my head i continued to regard him kajira he said i understood that i was to repeat this phrase kajira i said i had heard this word several times before on this world the men who had first come to the rock and chain in the wilderness had used it to me and too there had been the cry of kajira canjellne which had seemed to play some ritualistic role in the fierce contests which had brought me helpless into his uncompromising power la kajira said eta indicating herself she drew up the brief garment she wore turning to me exposing her left thigh it too bore a brand she too was truly branded i now realized that i had seen the mark before in torchlight and half darkness yesterday evening when she had been stripped hooded and belled and set as lovely quarry to run for the amusement of the men i had not even understood it at that time not well seeing it as a brand it had never even entered my mind that it might have been a brand it had been only a puzzling mark of some sort i would not have believed yesterday night that a woman could have been branded but now after my recent experience with the iron i was prepared to believe the evidence of my senses women on this world could be branded eta and i were in a profound sense i realized now the same we were both branded women no longer was i her superior a mark had been put upon me by a hot iron at the pleasure of men i was now exactly the same as eta whatever she was i too i knew was now that exactly that and only that her brand however was not precisely the same as mine it was more slender more vertical more like a stem with floral cursive loops about an inch and a half in height and a half inch in width it was i would later learn the initial letter in cursive script of the gorean expression kajira my own brand was the dina the dina is a small lovely multiply petaled flower shortstemmed and blooming in a turf of green leaves usually on the slopes of hills in the northern temperate zones of gor in its budding though in few other ways it resembles a rose it is an exotic alien flower it is also spoken of in the north where it grows most frequently as the slave flower it was burned into my flesh in the south below the gorean equator where the flower is much more rare it is prized more highly some years ago it was not even uncommon for lowercaste families in the south to give the name dina to their daughters that practice has now largely vanished with the opening and expansion of greater trade and cultural exchange between such cities as koroba and ar and the giant of the southern hemisphere turia in the fall of the city of turia some years ago thousands of its citizens had fled many of them merchants or of merchant families with the preservation of the city and the restoration of the ubarate of phanias turmus many of these families returned new contacts had been made new products discovered even of those turians who did not return to their native city many of them remaining in their new homes became agents for the distribution of turian goods and for the leathers and goods of the wagon peoples channeled through tuna that in the north the lovely dina was spoken of as the slave flower did not escape the notice of the expatriated turians in time in spite of the fact that dina is a lovely name and the dina a delicate beautiful flower it would no longer be used in the southern hemisphere no more than in the northern as a name for free women those free women who bore the name commonly had it changed by law removed from the lists of their cities and replaced by something less degrading and more suitable dina in the north for many years had been used almost entirely as a slave name the reason in the north that the dina is called the slave flower has been lost in antiquity one story is that an ancient ubar of ar capturing the daughter of a fleeing defeated enemy in a field of dinas there enslaved her stripping her by the sword ravishing her and putting chains upon her as he chained her collar to his stirrup he is said to have looked about the field and then named her dina but perhaps the dina is spoken of as the slave flower merely because in the north it is though delicate and beautiful a reasonably common unimportant flower it is also easily plucked being defenseless and can be easily crushed overwhelmed and if one wishes discarded the brand eta wore was not the dina it was as i would later learn the initial letter in cursive script of the gorean expression kajira it too however was in its delicacy and floral nature an incredibly beautiful and feminine brand i recalled that i had thought that the brand i had heated might be too feminine to mark a mans properties such as a saddle or shield but that it would be perfect to mark something feminine in nature now i realized that it marked me both the brand that i wore and that which eta wore were incredibly feminine our femininity whether we wished it or not had been deeply and incontrovertibly stamped upon us it was natural given the fact that the dina is the slave flower that eventually enterprising slavers warriors and merchants those with an interest in the buying and selling of women should develop a brand based on the flower beyond this there exists on gor a variety of brands for women though the kajira brand which eta wore is by far the most common some merchants invent brands as the dina was invented in order to freshen the nature of their merchandise and stimulate sales collectors for example those who are rich sometimes collect exotic brands much as collectors on earth might collect stamps or coins populating their pleasure gardens not only with girls who are beautiful but diversely marked a girl of course wants to be bought by a strong master who wants her for herself muchly desiring and lusting for her not for her brand when a girl is bought of course it is commonly because the man wants her she the female and is willing to put down his hardearned money for her and her alone for she is alone all she brings from the block is herself she is a slave she cannot bring wealth power or family connections she comes naked and sold it is she alone he buys there are of course men who buy for brands to meet this market various brands are developed and utilized the slave flower brand was a natural development unfortunately for these entrepreneurs their greed and lack of control over the metal shops resulted in the widespread proliferation of the dina brand as it became more popular it was becoming simultaneously of course a fairly common brand girls branded as i was were already spoken of on gor rather disparagingly as dinas collectors now seldom sought for dinas this development though perhaps a disappointment to certain merchants and slavers was not unwelcome to the girls who bore the brand though few cared for their feelings the girl who is bid upon and sold from the block wants to be bought because men have found her desirable so desirable that they are willing to part with their very gold to buy her how miserable she would be to learn that it is only for her brand that she is valued there were other brands in my captors camp yet i had been made a dina he had not done this for economic reasons he had sized me up my nature and my body he had decided the dina brand would be for me exquisitely right accordingly he had burned it into my flesh now in my body deeply i wore the slave flower eta bent over me smiling she indicated the steel band she wore on her throat it had writing on it incised in the steel in a script i could not recognize she turned the steel band not too easily on her throat it fitted her closely as though it might have been measured to her i gasped it was literally locked on her throat i understood then to my horror she could not remove it eta wore a steel collar eta then faced my captor la kajira she said submissively inclining her head to him had i been a man i might have been driven wild i supposed by the way in which this had been said then eta turned to me laughing pointing to my mouth i did not understand she pointed to her own mouth again faced my captor and again said la kajira again performing an obeisance before him then smiling eta pointed to my mouth bound i looked upward into the eyes of my captor la kajira i said to him then weeping i closed my eyes and turned my head to the side bound as i was i could not well incline my head to him but instinctively i had turned my head to the side exposing my throat vulnerably to him this had occurred so naturally that i was shaken by it then his large hand lay on my throat i knew he could have crushed it easily i turned my head under his hand and again looked up at him tears welled hot in my eyes la kajira i whispered and again turned my head to the side his hand left my throat and he and the others saying nothing more returned to the fire to continue their meal again i lay alone on the inclined trunk of the whitebarked tree what could be my status on this world only animals were branded i wore a brand only now for the first time now that i was branded did they show any interest in teaching me their language before they had not even taught me the words for run and fetch i suspected that i must now now that i had been branded address myself with great diligence to the acquisition of their language i did not think they would now be patient with me i had been branded i would have to learn swiftly and well the first words i had been taught were kajira which my captor had addressed to me and la kajira which expressions i understood from etas example i must utter to my captor i knew then that i was a kajira and too i gathered that this status whatever it might be was one i shared with eta she had said la kajira to him in a fashion which clearly suggested that she was acknowledging herself a kajira before him both eta and i wore brands eta wore even a collar i wore no collar but i knew that if they wished to place one upon me they unhesitantly would do so though i wore no collar i knew i was should anyone wish subject to the collar i knew now i was a kajira i knew that i had too following etas example acknowledged myself as such to my captor i had proclaimed myself a kajira whatever it might be before him what could a kajira be i forced from my mind the only possible answer refusing to admit it to consciousness then overwhelmingly irresistibly like a cry of anguish it welled up within me i could no longer ignore suppress or repudiate it no longer could i like a foolish girl of earth deny and flee my reality the comprehension insistent and explosive overpoweringly erupted within me i was naked and bound i was subject to the collar i had been branded i had said kajira i had said la kajira these were the first words i had been taught i knew i was a kajira i did not even know if any longer i had a name i supposed i had not i supposed now i was only a nameless animal in the power of men i had been too good to be a servant now i was a kajira my thigh stung i moaned with anguish i wept a kajira i knew was not even a servant a kajira was a slave girl and the meaning of la kajira which i had uttered to my captor was i am a slave girl i cried out a long anguished cry then knowing myself a slave girl kajira and la kajira are often the first words a girl of earth carried to gor must learn the women of earth to the mighty men of gor are good for little but slaves when i had cried out with anguish bound on the inclined trunk of the whitebarked tree two men rose from near the fire and as though they had been waiting for some such cry on my part evidence that i now to my horror understood truly what i was that i had now in my own heart and to my own misery incontrovertibly acknowledged my new nature came to the tree and swiftly casually unbound me they then carried me by the arms and put me to my knees before my captor who sat crosslegged by the fire i knelt my head to the grass a slave girl trembling before him in the camp hitherto my captor had confined me to degrading handouts which he would place in my mouth or make me reach for kneeling not using my hands eta now came forward she held two copper bowls of gruel next to me she knelt before my captor she put one bowl down before me then holding the other bowl she handed it to my captor one of the men pulled my head up by the hair so i could see clearly what was being done my captor took the bowl of gruel from eta and then saying nothing handed it back to her now he and his men and eta looked at me i then understood what i must do i picked up the bowl of gruel with both hands and kneeling handed it to my captor he took the bowl then he handed it back to me i might now eat i knelt shaken the bowl of gruel in my hands the symbolism of the act was not lost upon me it was from him he symbolically that i received my food it was he who fed me it was he upon whom i depended that i would eat did he not choose to feed me i understood i would not eat my head down following etas example i ate the gruel we were given no spoons with our fingers and like cats with our tongues we finished the gruel it was plain it was not sugared or salted it was slave gruel some days it was all that would be given to me a girl does not always of course take food in this fashion usually she prepares the food and then serves it after which if permitted she eats many men permit a girl for most practical purposes to eat simultaneously with him provided he begins first and it does not interfere with her service to him thus he gets his girl fed more swiftly to the furs much depends on the man the will of the girl counts for nothing in some dwellings a girl must before the evening meal hand her plate to the man he will then normally return it to her if she has not been completely pleasing to him on the other hand she may not be fed that night control of a girls food not only permits the intelligent regulation of her caloric intake but provides an excellent instrument for keeping her in line control the food control the girl food control for the man also has unexpected rewards few things so impress a mans dominance on her or her dependence upon him than the control of her food so simple a thing thrills her to the core it makes her eager to please him as a slave girl i finished the slave gruel it was not tasty but i was grateful for even so simple a provender i was hungry i felt starved perhaps the brand had made me hungry furtively i looked at the man over the edge of the copper bowl he seemed so strong so mighty the ceremonial taking of food from the hand of the man as it had been done this evening in the camp would prove to be somewhat unusual though it would be reasonably common to be handfed when it amused him or thrown scraps of food among many men it might be mentioned however the monthly anniversary of a girls acquisition as a slave would be marked by this and similar ceremonies a slave girl is a delight to a man she is extremely prized and precious that the day of her acquisition should be celebrated each month with special ceremonies and rites is not surprising these numerous anniversaries are deliciously celebrated as they may be with a girl who is only a slave and seldom forgotten should such an anniversary be forgotten should it be such that it is commonly celebrated the girl redoubles her efforts to please fearing she is to be soon sold i put down the bowl of gruel a switch was put in the hands of eta she stood over me i put down my head she did not strike me i looked up at her i realized then that she was first girl in the camp and that i must obey her that she had been empowered to set me tasks and duties suddenly i feared her before i had looked down upon her now i trembled it was she who held the switch over me before i had generally obeyed her only when men were present i had preferred to leave her the work now i realized i must without question take slave instructions from her and discharge swiftly and well whatever menial duties she might place upon me i met her eyes though i was a delicate girl of earth beautiful and sensitive even one who wrote poetry i had little doubt she would use the switch and richly upon me did i not work well i put down my head i determined to work well in this camp i though of earth was inferior to her she could command me she held the switch i would obey she was first girl eta took me to one side and together we cleaned the copper bowls in the stream wiping them dry we tidied the camp men called eta hurried to bring them wine and paga i helped her carry the beverages and goblets back to the fire she began to serve them i stood back how beautiful she seemed those lovely legs in the brief rag the beauty of her the firelight on her face and hair serving the men how perfect it seemed to me then so perfect and natural that she so beautiful served as she did how grotesque it would have been had the men served her or had they all she too served themselves it was the order of nature unperverted which i observed as she moved about among those mighty men kajira called a man i trembled with horror he had summoned me i fled to him and knelt before him roughly he turned me about and with a slender strap tied my hands together behind my back he then pointed to the meat and gave me a shove i fell on my belly then turned on my side wildly to look at him he pointed to the meat laughing how could i bound serve him my captor beckoned to me i regained my feet with difficulty with an awkwardness that made the men laugh and went to my captor kneeling before him he cut a small piece of meat and put it between my teeth it was roast tabuk he gestured back to the other man with the knife i went to the other man and knelt before him the bit of meat clenched between my teeth the man sitting crosslegged by the fire indicated i should approach him and put the meat in his mouth reddening with shame i did so i extended my head to him delicately and he with his mouth took the meat from between my teeth the men struck their left shoulders with pleasure man after man i so served i had carried meat before in my mouth not permitted to touch it but then i had not been bound then i had not knelt then they had not taken it from me in their mouths i was now serving them and it was their intention to their amusement as only a slave girl would serve men i was being taught as they laughed and spoke of me what i was the only man i did not so serve was he who cut the meat for me to carry my captor he did not cut me a piece of meat to convey in that humble manner to his own mouth he of all i most wished to so serve i wanted to dare to touch my lips my mouth to his when he took his meat but he did not have me serve him in this fashion i wanted to throw my small naked bound body into his arms he frowned i shrank back he indicated i should lie upon my belly before him i did so he cut small pieces of meat and threw them to me lying on my belly hands tied behind me i fed tears fell into the grass as i caught at the meat i had little doubt i was a slave the men began to talk one of the men at a word from my captor untied me and i crept to eta outside the circle of firelight and hid in her arms later the men began to tell stories and then to sing they called for more wine and paga and eta and i too now hastened to serve them we two moved among them i too now served them in the firelight i would pour the paga which i carried into a goblet kiss it as was expected and give it to the man paga called my captor i almost fainted i went to him and shaking poured paga into his goblet i was terrified that i might spill it it was not only that i feared should i spill the beverage that i might be beaten for my clumsiness it was even more than i wished to appear graceful and beautiful before him but i shook and was awkward the paga sloshed in the goblet but as my heart almost stood still it did not spill he looked at me i was a clumsy girl and a poor slave i felt so small and unworthy before him i was not only a girl small and weak before these mighty men i was not even a good slave trembling i extended the goblet to him he did not take it i shrank back confused i did not know what to do i realized then that i had in my confusion and distress forgotten to place my lips upon the goblet in subservience i quickly pressed my lips to the goblet kissing it then suddenly as i was to hand it to him i boldly again lifted the goblets side to my lips holding it in both hands i kissed it again lovingly delicately fully lingeringly my eyes closed i had never kissed a boy on earth with the helplessness and passion that i bestowed upon the mere goblet of my gorean captor i belonged to him i was his i loved him i felt the metal of the cup beneath my full pressing lips i opened my eyes i proffered tears in my eyes the cup of paga to my captor it was as though with the cup i was giving myself to him yet i knew i needed not give myself to him for i was his and a slave girl he could take me whenever he wished me he took the cup from my hands and dismissed me late that night the men went to their furs and tentings eta and i put away the extra food we cleaned the goblets and cleared the side of the fire of litter and debris she gave me a thin blanket of coarse cloth it was repcloth i might huddle in it at night eta called a man she went to him she slipped within his bit of tenting onto his furs i saw her pull away the rag she wore and i saw him in the moonlight enclose her in his arms i was suddenly frightened the bit of blanket about my shoulders i went to the cliff wall and looked upward at the sheer cliff above me it shone in the moonlight i scratched it with my fingernails i went to the wall of thorn brush a small forlorn white figure in the night clutching the bit of repcloth blanket about me the thornbrush wall was some eight feet high some ten feet thick i extended my hand miserably i drew it back bloody i went back to where eta had given me the repcloth blanket and lay down on the hard ground i shuddered knowing that as she had been summoned to the tenting of one of the men so i too might be as helplessly summoned the major duty of a slave girl i suspected was not to cook or sew or launder but to give men lengthy profound and exquisite pleasures such as only a beautiful female could give a man to be to him whatever he might wish and to give to him all that he might command and to the extent of her beauty ingenuity and imagination a thousand times more i began to sweat i was frightened of the totality and completeness of being a slave girl i am a girl of earth i cried to myself i am not a slave i do not want to be a slave i am a girl of earth kajira i heard terrified clutching the bit of repcloth blanket about my shoulders i rose to my knees then to a crouch my captor stood before his tenting i could see the furs within too within a small lamp burned i did not wish him to have to speak twice for fear i might be beaten holding the blanket about me i went to him he proffered me a cup and i with one hand holding the blanket about me with the other drank its contents it was a foul brew but i downed it i did not know at the time but it was slave wine men seldom breed upon their slave girls female slaves when bred are commonly hooded and crossed with a male slave similarly hooded the breeding conducted under the supervision of their respective owners a girl is seldom bred with a slave from her own house personal relationships between male and female slaves are usually frowned upon sometimes however as a discipline even a high female slave is sometimes thrown to a chain of work slaves for their pleasure the effect of the slave wine endures several cycles or moons it may be counteracted by another drink a smooth sweet beverage which frees the girls body for the act of the male slave or in unusual cases should she be freed to the act of the lover slave girls incidentally are almost never freed on gor they are too delicious and desirable to free only a fool it is commonly said would free one my captor took the cup from me when i had downed its contents he threw it aside into the grass he had not taken his eyes from me i felt his hands at my shoulders he parted the blanket and then lifting it from me dropped it to my ankles he looked at me i stood but inches from him then he took me by the left arm and thrust me within the low opening to his tenting one could not stand upright within the tenting for its ceiling was low i half knelt half crouched on the furs within there was little comparison between their depth and luxury and my pitiful repcloth blanket the tenting was striped on the inside the small lamp was ornate on the outside interestingly the tenting was a dull brown among brush and trees it would be easy not to notice it even if it were pitched but a few yards away he slipped within the tenting and crouched beside me he unslung his gear his sword belt with weapon and scabbard and the dagger belt and wrapping them in soft leather put them to one side he looked at me i looked down i felt very small with him he held the lamp that i might turning examine the brand on my thigh he held my leg with one hand the thigh turning it so that i might more clearly see the mark his hand on my thigh frightened me it was so strong i looked at the brand it was very meticulous and clean and deep and lovely and delicate it was incredibly feminine it was as though my femininity had been literally stamped upon my body it was as though i had been certified a certain sort of thing which thereafter no matter what i wished or what i might be told i could never deny never had i felt so soft so feminine i wore burned in my flesh one of the most beautiful of brands i wore incised in my thigh resembling a small beautiful rose the dina the slave flower i looked into the eyes of my captor never had i felt so weak so vulnerable so soft so helpless so feminine there were tears in my eyes i knew i belonged to the brute as a slave girl i saw him put the lamp to one side i lifted my lips to his i felt his arms close about me with a moan of rapture eyes closed i was pressed back into the furs i felt my legs being thrust apart i love you i whispered helpless in his arms master la kajira i awakened at his feet in the gorean dawn i put my hands on his calves and ankles as though holding them yet so softly that he would not know himself held i delicately put my lips to his calves feeling the hair beneath my lips and kissed him i kissed his ankles and feet softly so that he would not know himself kissed gently that he might not be awakened that he might not be angered by the boldness of the slave girl at his feet then i lay beside him joyously happy i saw the long horizontal peak of the striped tenting above me extending on either side from the leather cord that served as its roof tree the striped sides of the tenting moved slightly in the early morning shiftings of the breeze the dawn was a soft gray outside the tenting i could see dew glistening on the grass i heard birds calling to one another i lay deep in the furs i rolled to my stomach my breasts pendant to look upon the man who owned me much in the night had he overwhelmed me on the interior of my left thigh reddish brown dried now lay a streak of blood my virgin blood which never again would i be able to shed he as m a primitive rite i being only a slave had forced me to taste it he had taken it on his finger and thrust it roughly in my mouth smearing it across my lips and tongue and teeth making me take into my own body the consequences of his victory my ravishing my deflowering and then as he held my head in his hands forcing me to look into his eyes swallow i would never forget the taste nor the calm way he looked upon me as a master then though my body was still sore from his first assault upon me again he pleasured himself like a lion in my vulnerable raw softness i was shown no consideration for i was a slave i clutched him loving him much service did he get from his girl that night how excited and obedient i had been even sore knowing full well that i would be swiftly and cruelly punished were i not completely pleasing to him how happy i was so subservient to him so much at his mercy a girl who has not been owned perhaps cannot grasp the feelings of one who is owned truly owned but perhaps such a girl even if only dimly can sense the joy of the slave girl i would not have believed it had i not experienced it gently i lowered my head to the brute and kissed him softly that i might not awaken my master i lay back in the furs near him at his feet in the gorean dawn once during the night had he laughed softly richly holding me helplessly cruelly to him looking down into my eyes deeply pleased with his ownership of me how grateful and elated held i had been my master was pleased with his girl i listened to the birds outside in the glistening velvet of the soft dawn how far from earth with its pollutions its crowdings its hypocrisy seemed this world i lightly with my fingertips touched my brand i winced i would not much touch it for a few days for i wished its delicacy to heal perfectly i wanted the brand to be perfect no girl is so without vanity that she does not want her brand to be perfect even lipstick and eye shadow which a girl may wash off and reapply a girl wishes to be perfect how much more so then the brand which is always worn the girl wishes a brand of which she can be proud a good brand adds to a girls sense of confidence of comfort and security often a girls raiment is limited to brand and collar accordingly the brand is of considerable importance to her also it is no secret on gor that a small and beautiful brand wellplaced considerably enhances a girls beauty i tried to resent the brand but i could not do so it was too beautiful and now too it was too much a part of me i kissed my fingertips and gently pressed them to the petals of the slave flower which my master yesterday evening with a hot iron against my will had caused to blossom upon my thigh i lay there in the fresh dawn on earth it then seemed to me that i had been a true slave and that on this world though i wore a brand i was for the first time in my life truly free on earth invisible chains had kept me cruelly apart from myself and my feelings conditionings and derisions had put walls between me and my heart and emotions i had been tight the miserable victim of bonds of my own acceptance now for the first time in my life though i might wear chains in my heart my feelings and emotions i was truly free truly liberated i lay there happy i was suddenly frightened i felt his hand groping for me i crawled beside him and moved my head to where he might touch it by his thigh he was asleep i felt his hands reach into my hair and fasten themselves in it he pulled me to his waist i was a slave girl yes master i whispered i felt etas switch poking me kajira she whispered kajira i awakened it was still very early though lighter now my master was still asleep none but eta was up about the camp the dew of dawn was not yet burned off the grass i crawled from the tenting eta would set me my duties i a slave girl would now be worked i looked about at the sleeping men recumbent and somnolent in their tentings and furs they were the masters we women slave girls would now ready the camp there was much to be done water must be fetched wood must be brought from the piles the morning fires must be made breakfast must be prepared when the masters chose to arise their girls must have all ready for them i hummed softly to myself as i worked eta too seemed pleased once she kissed me the men were late to arise and eta sent me to the stream with tunics to wash upon the rocks i was once startled by the movements of a small amphibian near me it splashed into the water the water was clear i worked swiftly the air was fresh and beautiful soon i smelled the frying of vulo eggs in a large flat pan and the unmistakable odor of coffee or as the goreans express it black wine the beans grow largely on the slopes of the thentis mountains the original beans i suppose had been brought like certain other gorean products from earth it is not impossible of course that the opposite is the case that black wine is native to gor and that the origin of earths coffee beans is gorean i regard this as unlikely however because black wine is far more common on earth than on gor where it is except for the city of thentis a city famed for her tarn flocks and her surrounding villages a somewhat rare and unusual luxury had i known more of gor i would have speculated that my masters might have sworn their swords to the defense of thentis that they were of that city but as i was later to learn they were of another city one called ar when the first man yawning sleepy and blearyeyed the lazy beast stumbled to the cooking fire we were ready for him eta and i knelt before him and put our heads to the dirt at his feet we were his girls eta piled several of the hot tiny eggs earlier kept fresh in cool sand within the cave on a plate with heated yellow bread for him i grasping the pot with a rag and both hands poured him a handled metal tankard of the steaming black brew coffee or black wine following etas example to my pleasure we prepared ourselves plates and cups we then while waiting for the men ate as long as a male had taken the first bite the first drink at the meal apparently there was little objection to our also partaking we did so with gusto gorean amenities are more carefully observed usually at the evening meal which is more of a gathering and an occasion than the other two or three meals of the day at an evening meal eta and i would under threat of discipline wait before eating until the master and each of his men had begun we did not commonly however provided it did not interfere with our service wait until the men had completed their meal before commencing ours we thus finished nearly with them or a bit before thus after we had cleared goblets and bowls and dishes if they were used we were soon ready unimpeded to devote our attentions to the serving of wine and paga or our bodies for their pleasure were they desired to indicate the greater significance of the evening meal as compared to the other gorean meals no slave girl may touch it without first having been given permission assuming that a free man or woman even a child is present you may feed slave girl is a common way in which this permission is given if the permission is not given the girl may not eat should the master or mistress or child forget to give this permission it is merely the misfortune of the slave girl as the men came to breakfast we extended them obeisance and served them when my master came to the cooking fire it was with eagerness such eagerness that the men laughed that i knelt before him and put my hair in the dirt between his sandals i remembered the night well had he taught me the meaning of my brand i so loved him he gestured me to my feet i sprang up i stood straight before him proud in the pleasure i had given him from the looks of the men i understood that now i stood much differently than i had when i had come to the camp that the girl who now stood slave within the wall of thorn brush was far more valuable than she who had so recently miserably stood captive beyond its perimeter the looks of the men told me that i was now more desirable more beautiful i know i should have objected to this that i should have resented it intensely yet how fantastically weak and joyous and alive and happy it made me feel my master crouching down examined the slave flower on my thigh i did not dare touch him i trembled he straightened up he seemed satisfied and this much relieved me i wished him to be pleased not only with his slave but with her brand eta examined the brand too and smiled and hugged and kissed me i gathered that the brand was an excellent one i hugged and kissed her too weeping she permitted me to serve the master and i did so delightedly i watched him like a hawk that i might anticipate his slightest desire one of the men obviously as his looks and gesture indicated asked him about me my master responded chewing they looked at me i was the object of their discussion i did not speak gorean but i reddened and put my head down gorean masters commonly speak frankly and openly of the qualities of their girls even before the girls themselves my features figure and performances were being candidly discussed and appraised the sexuality qualities and capacities and skills of a slave girl not a free woman are discussed on gor with the same openness that men on earth might bring to the discussion of paintings and music and that englishmen of the nineteenth century might have brought to the discussion of dogs and horses i gathered that i in many ways left much to be desired i felt small and helpless my master extended to me his metal tankard gratefully i filled it again with the steaming black wine he was kind he was permitting me to serve him i looked at him were there to be no secrets between us were my defects my helplessness and the completeness of my surrender to him to be broadcast so publicly in his eyes i read that my questions were out of place in his eyes i read that i was slave i lowered my eyes and withdrew the tankard filled a slave girl it was with joy later in the morning that i felt thrown against my body by my master a bit of brown cloth it was a sleeveless body scrap a shred of slave rag it was a few threads fit for a bond girl yet i welcomed it as i might have a gown with gloves and pearls from paris now i might not be so revealed to the men it was the first clothing i had been given on gor radiant was my gratitude to him and abundant were the kisses which in joy i placed about his legs and feet joyfully i drew on the garment slipping it over my head and fastened it more tightly about me by the two tiny hooks on the left the slit made the garment a rather snug one easier to slip into the two hooks when fastened naturally increased the snugness of the garment drawing it quite closely about the breasts and hips deliciously then from the point of view of a man the girls figure is betrayed and accentuated also the two hooks do not close the slit on the left completely but permit men to gaze upon the sweet slave flesh pent held captive within such a garment of course when a man grows weary of having his vision obscured is easily torn away i turned before my master proud in my new riches he indicated to eta where the garment must be taken in the hooks placed subtly differently as it was the garment was too large for me eta was a larger woman it was one of her castoffs the garment would be altered that i would be as well revealed by it as eta was by hers the attire of gorean slave girls is of great importance to their masters they concern themselves with its tiniest details the clothing you see as well as the girl belongs to the master it is natural for him thus to take an interest in it both in their diverse ways can be reflections upon him his taste his judgment his discrimination that a male of earth may not even know what clothing his wife owns or what she buys would be unthinkable to most goreans even those who stand in free companionship to the master it would simply be preposterous what his girl wears if she is to wear anything is of great interest to him after all she is not a wife she is much more important she is a prized possession the clothing she wears any cosmetics or jewelry or perfume must be absolutely perfect he is in so to speak on everything should she tie her hair with as little as a new ribbon it must pass his strict inspection if it is not right for her she will not be permitted to wear it that a wife might wear a new dress and her husband not even notice it would be incredible if not incomprehensible to any gorean whether a proprietor or a companion in short gorean masters concern themselves closely with their girls clothing like other matters is quite important it must be perfect for its purpose its purpose may be to humiliate or brazenly and publicly display the girl to discipline her to keep her humble to remind her she is nothing only a wench in bondage it may be to reveal her beauty of which he is proud for the eyes of all or for his own pleasure and that of his peers it may be to reveal his wealth the value in girl and raiment which he owns it may be to augment his prestige or to incite envy in others it may be to stimulate her with beautiful things it may be to excite her sexually and so on these purposes of course are not all incompatible clothing too it might be mentioned like food is a useful instrument in controlling the girl few girls for example enjoy being sent nude to the market to do shopping my master drew out his knife i shuddered but dared not run i closed my eyes i felt him cutting at the garments hem he made it scandalously short it had been a garment of etas measured high but to her own longer legs now i scarcely dared move in it at a gesture from my master i knelt i did so in the manner m which i had been taught back on my heels back straight hands on thighs head high chin up i did not neglect a further detail i spread my knees widely it was the position of course as i would later learn of the gorean pleasure slave i had seen eta naturally unconsciously assume it when she knelt such a girl in kneeling does not close her knees before a free man any slave girl incidentally addresses any free man as master any free woman as mistress though only one of course at a given time is likely to be her true master or mistress it gave me pleasure to assume this posture before my master who had full body rights to me it gave me less pleasure in the beginning to assume it before free men generally yet eventually i did it naturally and pleasurably it is a position that not only makes the girl more attractive to the man but too subtly psychologically by its effect on the girl by intensifying her sense of openness vulnerability and exposure it makes men much more attractive to her she thus kneeling and opened before them the girl who finds many men attractive is likely to find the master attractive the girl who finds few men attractive is to that extent the less likely to find the master attractive the pleasure slave so submissively and vulnerably positioned so helpless and opened before men cannot help herself but become curious and excited and heated about them in becoming excited and heated by men in general she naturally becomes excited and heated about the master in particular after all it is to him that she actually belongs he is the one who is her master in a pleasure slave passion is not an accident inhibitions are simply not permitted beyond this instincts are triggered and intelligently released and then allowed untrammeled to take their natural course biologys dominance submission equation is genetic the most perfect satisfaction of that equation for complex acculturated psychophysical organisms is the institutionalized bondage relation this exists on gor where girls may be the legal slaves of strong men capable of mastering them i was such a slave i had no doubt the man who owned me was capable of mastering me he had already done so i was his slave how attractive i found men how i loved and feared my master i wanted to give myself to him constantly he gave instructions to eta with respect to me then he with his fellows left the camp eta and i were alone she went and brought pins tiny scissors a needle and thread the alteration of my slave rag was apparently the first order of the days business it must match and betray my slave body perfectly after that we could attend to our less important tasks i stood and knelt and stood and moved as eta instructed me once i removed the garment and she sewed the hem where the knife had ripped it in making the hem of course though eta took it up as little as possible the garment was further shortened i reddened i wondered if there was much to choose from between such a garment and being nude i supposed the garment gave the men something to tear away then i put it back on eta repositioned the hooks i gasped as she fastened them then eta deftly here and there sometimes cutting and pinning and sewing fitted the rag to me with candid perfection this was done on my body that the fit be flawlessly snug eta was a superb seamstress only twice even under these conditions and given our objectives did i feel the needle then eta stood back and then walked about me she went and fetched a mirror from the cave it was a large one and permitted me to see myself i gasped at the slave girl betrayed in the mirror i looked at eta in horror i had not seen myself before as a slave i was shocked and startled i had not known i could appear such i could not believe it was me no it could not be me i looked back at the mirror how beautiful she was that lovely slave could it be i i looked at eta she nodded and smiled i looked again at the mirror i had not known i could be so beautiful then i was afraid for i suspected what such beauty might mean on the world on which i found myself what man would not simply put a chain on it or collar it i stood before the mirror stunned looking at the slave girl eta then to my surprise with the point of her scissors ripped the tiny garment a bit under my right breast that a bit of skin might show and again at my left hip a larger rip these were done in such a way as to make them appear natural inadvertent rents in the garment she then with the point of the scissors at two points ripped the hem she had earlier sewn out a bit that in these two places it might appear the threads had broken the hem then in these two places was irregular on my legs she then at another place cut into the hem ripping it and unraveled and tore it a bit as though it had naturally frayed some stray threads hung upon my thigh these were the touches which to my horror and delight made the garment of the slave rag exquisitely perfect i looked at the lovely slave in the mirror i wondered if the men knew or suspected the female cunning that went into the making of a slave rag she was arming me with beauty with what else might a slave girl be armed eta kissed me and i kissed her the ingenuity and care lavished upon the slave rag seemingly such a pathetic accident of a garment is a careful secret well kept among slave girls if the master does not know why the smallest movement of his girl clad in what he thought was a mere discipline rag almost drives him out of his wits with pleasure that is all right the masters as we girls sometimes tell one another do not have to know everything i looked at the girl in the mirror i approached more closely i lifted the hem of the garment at the left thigh i almost fainted with the delicate perfection of the brand it was still red rough raw deep unhealed but the form was clearly imprinted unmistakably deeply and beautifully imprinted on my thigh i wore one of the most beautiful brands the dina the slave flower i tore the garment there at the left hip that as i moved the brand might be glimpsed then i knelt before the mirror boldly i assumed slave position i threw my knees apart i rested my hands on my thighs i regarded myself in the mirror i saw a kneeling slave girl there there was no doubt about it she was a slave girl how incredibly beautiful was that poor lovely slave she wore a brand she wore a slave rag she lacked only a steel collar that lack i supposed could be simply supplied it is nothing to put a collar on a girls neck i lifted my hair up i lifted my chin watching in the mirror i conjectured what a steel collar would look like fastened on my neck i did not think i would mind one it might be rather attractive etas was terribly so i hoped of course that i might be able to choose whose collar i would wear but shuddering i realized that a girl does not choose whose collar she will wear rather it is the man who chooses it is he and he alone who places the collar suddenly i sensed the misery of being a slave i might belong to any man i might belong to any man who might carry me off or pay my price i might be abducted or bought or bestowed or lost in gambling i was only an article of property helpless and beautiful without control over no more than a dog or pig into whose hands i might come tears sprang to my eyes surely my master would not sell me every bit of me would constantly try to please him i did not want to be sold what a miserable beautiful girl i saw in the mirror the poor slave how sorry i felt for that beauty but what man would be so foolish as to sell such a beauty or even to share her with another surely such a man would keep such a beauty for himself alone not sharing her with others i wiped the tears from my eyes i studied the girl in the mirror how beautiful in her bondage she was i brushed my hair back and lifting my chin turned my head i had seen earrings in the jewelry in the cave exotic loops twists of wire and golden pendants i imagined them upon me hanging at my cheeks adornments suitable for me a barbarian slave girl my ears had not been pierced but i had little doubt that this operation if my master wished would be promptly accomplished upon me i considered cosmetics and perfumes such as i had encountered in the cave and behold in my imagination the girl in the mirror was so bedecked i had seen bracelets anklets chains and necklaces intricately wrought and beautiful in the cave i extended my arms and wrists and one of my legs considering how they might appear ponderous with such barbaric glory but the girl in the mirror wore only a slave rag i then considered how i might appear so made up so perfumed so adorned but now in a snatch of brief silk yellow or scarlet clinging diaphanous fit for a mans pleasure girl eta called to me once again i saw only the plain girl in the mirror the beauty in a slave rag no adornments were hers only some threads of cloth tight on her beauty she was not an ornamented high slave she wore only a slave rag she was a low slave i sprang to my feet and hurried to eta she was kneeling down and i knelt across from her la kajira said eta pointing to herself tu kajira she said pointing to me la kajira i said pointing to myself tu kajira i said pointing to eta i am a slave girl you are a slave girl eta smiled she pointed to her brand kanlara she said she pointed to my brand kanlara dina she said i repeated these words kolar she said indicating her collar it is the same word in english i cried she did not understand my outburst gorean as i would learn is rich in words borrowed from earth languages how rich it is i am not a skilled enough philologist to conjecture it may well be that almost all gorean expressions may be traced to one or another earth language yet the language is fluid rich and expressive borrowed expressions as in linguistic borrowing generally take on the coloration of the borrowing language in time the borrowings become naturalized so to speak being fully incorporated into the borrowing language at this point they are for all practical purposes words within the borrowing language how many in english for example think of expressions such as automobile corral and lariat as being foreign words collar i said eta frowned kolar she repeated again indicating the neck band of steel fashioned on her throat kolar i said carefully following her pronunciation eta accepted this eta pulled at the bit of rag she wore tateera she said i looked down at the scrap of rag outrageously brief so scandalous so shameful fit only for a slave girl which i wore i smiled i had been placed in a tateera tateera i said i wore the tateera var kolar asked eta i pointed to the collar on her throat var tateera asked eta smiling i pointed to the brief rag which i wore eta seemed pleased she had laid out a number of articles my lessons in gorean had begun suddenly stammering i said etavarvar bina eta looked at me surprised i recalled the two men who had come to the chain and rock var bina var bina kajira they had demanded i had not been able to understand or satisfy them they had beaten me still i had been unable to satisfy them i could not even understand them then they had prepared to cut my throat the man in the scarlet tunic from over the fields had arrived kajira canjellne he had said he had fought for me and won me he had brought me to his camp where he had branded me i was now his slave var bina eta i asked eta lightly lifted herself to her feet and went to the cave in a few moments she emerged she carried in her hands several strings of beads simple necklaces with small wooden colored beads they were not valuable she held the necklaces up for me to see then with her finger moving them on their string she indicated the tiny colored wooden beads da bina she said smiling then she lifted a necklace looking at it bina she said i then understood that bina was the expression for beads or for a necklace of beads the necklaces and beads which eta produced for me were delights of color and appeal yet they were simple and surely of little value i went to the cave eta following i lifted one of the chests covers i took from the chest a string of pearls then one of pieces of gold then one of rubies bina i asked each time eta laughed bana she said ki bina bana then from another box eta produced another necklace one with cheap glass beads and another with simple small wooden beads she indicated the latter two necklaces bina she said pointing to them bina i then understood were lesser beads cheap beads beads of little value save for their aesthetic charm indeed i would later learn that bina were sometimes spoken of derisively as kajira bana the most exact translation of bina would probably be slave beads they were valueless save for being a cheap adornment sometimes permitted imbonded wenches eta and i returned to the outside to continue our lessons i still could not understand what had happened at the chain and rock var bina var bina kajira they had demanded the bina or slave beads had meant more to them than my life it was not i who had been important to them there but the beads when they had clearly understood that i was unable to help them in their quest they viewing me then as useless had prepared to be done with me i shuddered remembering the knife at my throat i had been narrowly saved by the swordsman whose slave i now was i had thought before i was clearly apprised of the nature of bina cheap slave beads that perhaps the men had supposed that i was to be chained at the rock adorned with some rare and valuable necklace worth perhaps a fortune perhaps it had been that which they had wanted perhaps then either i had not been placed so adorned at the rock contrary to their expectation or if i had been that someone had in my helpless unconsciousness arrived earlier and simply removed the necklace stealing it from my chained body i might have been left at the rock either because i was chained and could not be easily removed or perhaps was not wanted but it seemed unlikely that if i should have worn such a necklace it had not been placed on me and unlikely too that someone in such a wilderness would come upon me while i there lay chained and remove the necklace i was thrown into the greatest consternation by my new comprehension of the valuelessness of slave beads it now made no sense to me whatsoever that the two men so angrily and fiercely should have sought for so trivial an object of what importance could be a string of slave beads why might they have been put on me in the first place and where if they had been put on me had they gone who would want them and why should men come through a wilderness to obtain them what could be their importance what could be their secret i understood nothing eta lifted up a stout whip with long handle which might be wielded with two hands and five dangling soft wide lashing surfaces each about a yard long kurt she said i shrank back kurt i repeated she lifted up some loops of chain there were linked ankle rings and linked wrist rings and a lock collar all connected by a length of gleaming chain running from the collar it was rather lovely it was too small for a man i knew however it would fit me perfectly sirik said eta sirik i repeated upon command i had slipped from the tateera i stood among the men the warrior indicated that i should suck in my gut i did so holding my stomach in tightly i felt the strap black narrow loop my belly it was pulled tight very tight and cinched i wore the bell at my left hip i looked at my master reproachfully in anguish the bells rows strung about my neck and loosely too depending about my breasts jangled the sound was horrifying sensuous with anger with misery i regarded him the warrior took my hands behind my back and there with a bit of black leather fastened them together the rows of bells on my wrists jangled as my hands were pulled behind my back and fastened there wrist to wrist lashed how could he permit this did it mean nothing to him that he had the preceding night taken my virginity from me did it mean nothing to him that he had for long hours pleasured himself with my body did it mean nothing to him that he had won me that i had yielded to him that i had surrendered myself totally to him that vulnerably i had been fully his i tried to take a step toward him the bells on my body and those tied about my ankles jangled i could not move toward him for the warriors hand on my arm held me i looked at my master with anguish he was sitting crosslegged some feet away with others he had a goblet of paga which eta had served to him did my master not love me as i loved him he narrowlidded looked at me over the rim of the goblet of paga do not do this to me i cried to him helplessly in english i love you surely though he spoke no english he could not have mistaken the anguish the feelings the deep intent of the helpless girl so shamefully belled and bound before him i love you i cried i saw in his eyes that he as a gorean master had no concern for my anguish my intent and feelings i shuddered i was a bond girl he gave a sign one of the men nearby readied a large opaque cloth soft black folding it in four pieces so that folded it would be about a yard square he looked back at me i love you i said the cloth was thrown over my head and with some loops of leather cord four times encircling my neck tied under my chin i could not see i was hooded i threw back my head in anguish within the hood but i love you i cried i stood there belled and bound forlorn and hooded i loved him but i had seen in his eyes in the instant that the cloth had been thrown over my head that to him my master i was nothing only a meaningless slave i stood there head down miserable frightened i heard the men laughing five would do contest i hated the bells so many so tiny hung about my body which i could not remove which would draw them to me the sound was tiny rich and sensuous they were slave bells they would draw men to my body i moved slightly i felt them stir on my body and on the loops that held them so slight a movement made them sound i miserable was caught in their lewd delicious rustle i suppose the sound of the bells objectively considered is rather lovely yet theirs was a music of bondage one which in its tiny delicious sounds rustling whispered kajira kajira they said you are nothing girl you are a belled kajira you are nothing girl you exist for the pleasure of men please them well lovely kajira i shook my body trying to throw the bells from me i could not do so in their jangling sound helpless i was held betrayed i could scarcely breathe without stirring the bells i began to sweat and fear it was suddenly like finding oneself caught imprisoned hooded in a net no move i made was not betrayed by the bells most i hated the larger bell of different note fastened tightly at my left hip it was a guide bell i tried to free my hands they had been tied by a warrior i was helpless i shuddered and even so slight a movement was betrayed by the bells indicating the exact position of she who wore them the slave girl on whose body they were fastened the men were ready please master i cried bound closed in the hood belled protect me i love you i love you keep me for yourself master i heard men laughing talking bets being made the contestants by now would have too been hooded but they were not belled they were not bound my cheeks inside the hood were stained with tears the interior of the hood was wet i was judy thornton a junior at an elite girls college an english major a poetess delicate and sensitive a man near me called out a word delightedly a word i would later learn was quarry at the same instant i felt the flash of a switch on my body and i weeping fled from its sting i was a nameless slave girl on an alien world at the mercy of primitive warriors in a barbarian camp an object for their sport a lovely twolegged plaything a mere prize in their cruel games the prize stopped in a jangle of bells gasping throwing her head about as though she might see she was trapped in the folds of the hood i heard a man near me i did not know if it were the referee or one of the contestants i felt the switch touch my body i shuddered with a jangle of bells but in had been done gently it was the referee aiding me indicating his presence i breathed deeply the bells rustled i heard another man approaching doubtless groping and another to my left i was terrified suddenly i heard the hiss of the switch behind me and almost at the same time felt the supple disciplinary device to the amusement of the men strike me swiftly and hotly below the small of the back i fled wildly jangling bells i was outraged and humiliated my eyes were hot with tears it stung terribly the switch is often used on a girl when she is guilty of minor indiscretions or tiny misdemeanors it is thought a fitting instrument for encouraging a beauty to be more careful or zealous in her service i had delayed in the game for more than five ihn it was for that reason that the referee had administered his admonitory stripe it was the second time in my life i had felt a switch i did not care to feel one again particularly when clothed only in slave bells and a hood the laughter of the men made me angry but then i cried anger in a slave girl was only meaningless pretense it was not as though she were a free woman whose anger might have significance might even issue in actions or words free from the reprisals of discipline men are the masters of slave girls the masters anger in a slave girl is futile meaningless though sometimes masters encourage it in their girls to see them flush and assume an interesting demeanor but it is in the end always insignificant for in the end as both the girl and master know it is the master and not the girl who holds the whip thus it is not that slave girls do not become angry they do it is only that their anger as both girl and master know is meaningless i cried the physical effect of the switch on a girl is not negligible but i think its psychological effect should the blows be placed on a certain portion of her body thus cruelly humiliating her may be even more bitter crying i fled through the camp stumbling i heard men falling stumbling getting up pursuing me i could not free my wrists once i fell into the arms of a man and shrieked with misery he threw me from him there was much laughter he had not even been a contestant another time the referee caught me and then thrust me back against stone that i might know where i was he had kept me from striking into the cliff wall behind the camp i fled again into the camp my running was erratic terribly so i was confused and miserable i was terrified of being caught i too did not wish to be again struck with the switch another man not a contestant caught me and prevented me from plunging into the thick wall of thorn brush in which i might have been half torn to pieces there was much laughter more than once i heard a contestant yards away curse then i would hear one not a yard or more from me and i would wheel and run from him once i struck one and tripped and fell rolling in a wild jangle of bells i heard him leap for me i felt his hand for an instant at my right hip i felt the hand of another touch my left calf i rolled and crawled free and darted away once i found myself it seemed surrounded by stone wherever i turned there seemed a cliff before me i spun disoriented terrified then i fled back and found myself again somewhere in the center of the camp barely had i avoided being cornered against the cliffs i then began to play more cleverly more warily twice more in the game was i stung with the switch then once on the left arm above the elbow and once more cruelly on the right calf when i wishing to make no sound not thinking the referee near me lingered too long in one position then i fled again directly into the arms of a man i waited for him to free me to throw me back to the others but his arms did not free me oh no i wept his arms tightened about me i was thrown screaming and squirming to his shoulder and carried about there was laughing i heard the man who held me from the ground being slapped on his back by the referee i heard the word which later i would learn was capture it is a helpless feeling being held on the shoulder of a man your feet unable to touch the ground you are unable to obtain the slightest leverage you are simply his prisoner i heard shouting and the pounding of hands on my captors back then he in his pleasure one hand on my right ankle and one closed about my left forearm lifted me bodily above his head bending my body displaying me i heard applause the pounding of hands on the left shoulder i heard too in the sounds eta cry out with pleasure much delighted was she not my sister in bondage could she not understand my misery my captor whoever he was impatient then to have me hurled me as though i were nothing to the dirt at his feet i felt his hands at my ankles i turned my head to one side moaning i lay bound in the dirt when he had finished with me he was then unhooded and led away in his triumph to drink the paga of victory i lay weeping and miserable in the dirt when i moved i heard the rustle of the bells which were slave bells in a few moments i felt the hands of the referee close on my arms he lifted me and threw me upright to my feet again i heard the word which later i would learn was quarry again i felt the sudden sting of the switch inciting me to motion again i ran four times i ran as quarry in the cruel games of that evening four times was i caught and on my back in the dirt of that barbarian camp rudely ravished by whom i knew not when later i had been unbound and unhooded by eta i had wanted her to take me in her arms to comfort me but she had not she had kissed me happily and one by one removed the loops and ties of bells lastly removing that which i had worn at my left hip she then indicated that i should help her with the serving i looked at her aghast how could i now serve did she not understand what had been done to me i was not a gorean girl i was an earth girl was it nothing that i had been regardless of my will ravished four times put brutally against my will to the pleasure of strong men i saw the answer in etas eyes which smiled at me yes it was unimportant did i not know i was a slave girl had i expected anything else had it not pleased me i looked sullenly into the dirt i was an earth girl but too i was a slave girl it was unimportant i realized then it had been truly nothing no more than the serving of wine or the sewing of a garment i realized then what might truly be the import of being a slave girl why had my master permitted it was i not his slave did i mean so little to him he had taken my virginity he had taken much pleasure in me he had won me forcing from me my total surrender as a slave girl to his power then he had permitted his men to amuse themselves with me did he not love me i remembered his eyes on me before the hood had been thrown over my head in preparation for my service in the cruel game i recalled his eyes in his eyes i had seen that i was nothing only a meaningless slave to him i poured wine from the flask i bore into the cup i holding it of one of the men i froze i saw dirt upon his tunic our eyes met he was i knew one of those who had had me i was now serving him he regarded me i extended to him the cup he did not accept it our eyes met i took the cup and pressed my lips to it again i extended the cup to him still he regarded me i had not been permitted following the cruel game to slip the tateera my slave rag again upon my body my master had said a curt word i must then remain nude it is customary following the game that the prize remain nude that the value of her captured beauty remain discernible to all to the winners for their pleasure to the loser for his chagrin to the onlookers for their admiration and too perhaps to incite them in another contest at some future date to vie for its possession his eyes were upon me angrily with helpless anger the futile meaningless anger of a slave girl i again pressed my lips to the cup this time fully and lingeringly again i extended to him the cup this time he took it he then without looking at me further turned to his cup companion on his left i hated him he had ravished me and now i must serve him and as a naked slave girl i served others too commonly this night like eta remaining back of the circle of the fire behind the sitting men with a flask of wine we remained in the shadows when one of the men would lift his cup i or eta whichever might be closer would serve him usually we served from more closely among the men often even kneeling among them but not this night they spoke together earnestly matters of importance i gathered were being discussed at such a time men did not wish to be distracted by the bodies of slave girls we remained in the shadows i watched angrily my master with a rock drew maps in the dirt by the fire some of the maps i had seen before he had drawn them the preceding night for his lieutenants when they had spoken alone he spoke swiftly and decisively sometimes indicating a portion of the terrain by jabbing at it with the rock sometimes he pointed to the largest of the three moons above in a few days it would be full i stood there naked recently ravished sweat and dirt on my body and in my hair holding the large flask of wine on my left hip watching i wondered at what might be the nature of the camp in which i found myself it did not seem to be a hunting camp though hunting was done from it too i did not think it was a camp of bandits for the men in the camp did not seem of the bandit sort not only did the cut and differing insignia on their tunics suggest a uniform of sorts but the clearcut subordination the obvious organization and discipline which characterized them and their relationships did not suggest outlawry too the men seemed handsome strong cleancut responsible reliable disciplined trained and efficient there was none of the laxness and disorder of either men or environment i would have expected in a camp of bandits i inferred then that i found myself slave in a camp of soldiers of some city or country the camp however situated as it was did not seen an outpost or guard camp it did not command terrain it was not fortified it was too small for a training camp or a wintering camp too because of its size so small it did not seem a likely war camp sixteen men quartered here with two girls as slaves here there were no armies no divisions or regiments there was nothing here with which to consummate war to repel or launch invasions or meet in widespread combat on great fields what then i asked myself was the nature of this camp one of the men lifted his cup and i hurried to him i took the cup and i filled it his tunic too i noted was stained with the dust of the camp i looked at him angrily over the brim of the cup then i pressed my lips to his cup as i must as a slave girl and handed it to him he took it scarcely noticing me and returned his attention to the map in the dirt which was of importance i wondered if he had had me first or second or third or fourth i wondered which had been he each had been different yet in the arms of each i had been only and fully a slave i looked at him he did not know i looked at him i wondered how many hundreds of slave girls he had had i looked carefully as carefully as i could in the light at the large blond shaggyhaired fellow whom i found after my master the most attractive male in the camp it had been he who had first taken eta when the night before i was branded i had watched her perform bound belied and hooded in the same cruel sport in which i this evening had been so humiliatingly victimized treated as though i might be only a slave i looked at him there was not a stain of dust on his tunic i was just as pleased had he run and i known it i might have endeavored to throw myself into his arms i looked at him who knows i thought i might even have responded to him this thought scandalized me an earth girl but then i smiled to myself and tossed my head it did not matter i was an earth girl true but now i was only a slave girl a slave girl is not only permitted to be responsive to men but it is obligatory for her it is a duty which further should she shirk will be enforced upon her it is not uncommon for a girl who is even trivially displeasing to be whipped i looked at the large handsome fellow i had no honor to protect no pride to uphold for i was slave he was indeed attractive too i certainly would not wish to be whipped i laughed to myself for the first time in my life i a slave felt free to be a woman i then loved my sex a man lifted his cup and i hastened to him to serve him i then returned to the shadows i noted that eta served wine to the tall handsome blondhaired fellow i did not mind i liked eta though she was first girl and over me i had worked well under her and she had not switched me i watched my master with the rock he jabbed down at the map men asked questions he replied they hung upon his words i looked about the circle of the fire what fantastic males these were so strong so handsome so mighty i felt small and slight and helpless before them and how proud i felt of my master first among them he the mightiest and finest of all eta remained in the vicinity of the blond shaggyhaired warrior i moved more closely to my master i wished to pour him wine and kiss his cup should he give his girl the opportunity to do so i did not understand their conversation or the nature of the project which they were apparently planning it was i gathered military in nature moreover waiting was involved in it more than once had a man gazed at the largest moon in the sky in some days it would be full my master flung the rock down at a certain place in the map it lay there solid half buried in the dirt it was there that something i gathered would take place the men grunted in agreement there was a stream there or a confluence of two streams and apparently a woods the men nodded my master looked about himself none asked a further question they seemed satisfied their eyes shone as they looked upon him how proud i was of my master how thrilled i was secretly in my heart to be owned by him the men rose from the side of the fire and some talking among themselves went to their furs and tenting my master looked at me he lifted his cup i hastened to him took the cup and filled it i pressed my lips long to its side then humbly proffered it to the magnificent beast whose girl i was i knelt before him and in my eyes doubtless he could read my need but he turned away before he had turned away again i had read in his eyes as i had before earlier in the evening that i was only a meaningless slave to him was i such poor slave stuff naked in need at his feet that i was to be despised and rejected then kneeling in the dirt all the fury the humiliation and frustration of a scorned earth girl scorned by a barbarian welled up within me i began to choke with rage i rose to my feet i thrustthe flask of wine i carried into the hands of eta who came to comfort me go away i cried eta took the flask i would not permit her to kiss me she said something softly go away i screamed at her some of the men turned to look at me eta took the flask of wine and frightened hurried away i stood near the fire which now had muchly subsided my fists were clenched tears ran down my cheeks i hate you all i cried i ran stumbling to the thin blanket which i had been given the night before i tore it from the ground and covered myself with it holding it about my shoulders i shuddered head down clutching the blanket about me shaking with sobs near where the blanket had lain i had been taken against my will from earth i had been brought to a strange world i had been branded i was being kept as a slave i lifted my head wildly looking about the camp up at the moons at the cliffs and thorn brush i looked at the men some watching me i am better than you all i cried though you abuse me i am of earth you are barbarians i am civilized you are not it is you who should bend to me not i to you it is i who should command not you eta ran to me to urge me to silence none in the camp save i myself understood my words but clearly they were uttered in wildness in hysteria in rage they were words clearly of protest perhaps even of hysterical rebellion eta was clearly frightened had i known more of gor i too might then have been terrified i knew little then of the world on which i found myself or of the meaning of the brand on my thigh my shield then as before was simply my ignorance the ignorance of a foolish girl i shouted and cried out at them raging weeping then i saw before me my master he loomed in the darkness i looked up at him in rage my fists clutched the blanket about me it was he who had won me in the grim contest with steel in the fields it was he who had brought me naked to his camp he who had branded me he by whom my virginity had been ripped from me he who had in his tenting again and again at length reduced me to a panting surrendered object of his pleasure a vanquished loving slave girl i hate you i cried to him in rage i clutched the blanket about me how hard it is for a girl stripped to stand before and conduct herself with dignity before as an equal a man who is fully clothed i clutched the blanket with my fists i held it tightly about me it gave me courage he had made me love him i loved him and yet he cared nothing for me dont you understand i cried i love you i love you and yet you treat me as nothing i hate you i shook with rage i hate you i hate you i cried after making me love him he had permitted his men to amuse themselves with me he had given me to them for their sport you gave me to others i wept i hate you i looked at him wildly you do not know who i am i said i am judy thornton i am of earth i am not one of your barbarian girls a slut for your pleasure i am a refined civilized young woman i am better than you are i am better than you all i saw in the moonlight the hand it was extended toward me open you cannot treat me badly i said you must treat me well i looked at him boldly i have rights i said i am a free woman his hand extended still toward me open i did not know the extent of his patience i handed him the blanket i stood then small and naked before him the moonlight streamed down on the branded slave girl before her master he held the blanket looking down at it then he looked at me i trembled i knew a girl was to be punished he lifted the blanket in that instant i felt suffused with joy for i felt then that he would in his kindness cover me protecting me from the eyes of his men perhaps too he had been moved by my plight perhaps he was now sorry for how cruelly he had treated me perhaps now he would try to make amends perhaps now i had stirred pity and compassion in his harsh breast perhaps too he was moved now by my love for him and overwhelmed with gratitude and tenderness at the value and immensity of this gift might be moved to regard me too with affection with love in turn i looked at him with loving eyes then he placed the blanket over my head and with a length of cord looping it several times about my throat tied it tightly under my chin so that again as in the cruel game i was hooded then he threw me to his men i lay in the blanket clutching it about me i was cold sullen i could no longer cry the men my masters were asleep i lay huddled my knees drawn up i did not know what time it was the moons were still in the sky i crawled to my knees holding the blanket about me i looked about the still camp my body ached i moved the blanket looking down shifting it that my leg be exposed i examined my thigh i looked at the brand which i bore on my body it was a flower lovely and delicate yet i could not pluck it i could not remove it it was imprinted in my flesh it had been placed there burned into my thigh by a hot iron as i had screamed under the metals searing print i regarded it that graceful floral badge of bondage it was now a part of my body i had no doubt that i was more beautiful branded than i had been before the brand i could see considerably enhanced my beauty it is one of the attractive features of a slave girl but more beautiful though i might be on its account it marked me incontrovertibly as a slave i wished to escape i looked at the thorn brush yet i wore a brand could there be a true escape on a world such as this for a branded girl would that mark not continue to say to anyone and all softly persistently each instant each moment every hour of the day and night when anyone might care to glance upon it here is a slave could there be an escape on a world such as this for a girl who wore such a mark if it should be so much as glimpsed would not such a girl be instantly placed in chain and a collar perhaps i might steal clothing but the brand would still be on my body marking me suppose men suspicious would turn me over to free women that my body might be without compromise to my dignity lest i be free examined by them when they discovered the mark worn by a girl masquerading as one of their own lofty station a woman free would they not in fury with whips drive me stripped begging for mercy weeping to the waiting shackles of the men what escape what freedom could there be for a girl who wore a brand i looked at the brand well and deeply it marked me as what i now had no doubt i was what tonight i had been well taught i was what i in truth incontrovertibly now was a slave girl the earth girl a slave on a barbarian planet clutched the blanket about her i looked up on the cliff above me i could see crouching the guard he was not watching me i looked at the cliffs at the thorn brush i sat on the ground the blanket about me i knew i was a slave girl legally irrefutably the brand told me that but i wondered on a deeper question one beyond legalities and institutions i wondered if i were truly in my heart a female slave this question troubled me deeply i had since my branding experienced profoundly ambiguous feelings on this matter it was as though i were trying to understand myself my deepest emotions and needs at times i had been on the brink of surrendering myself to myself acknowledging to my horrified conscious mind forbidden truths longdenied realities speaking of a venerable longsuppressed antique nature one antedating huts of straw and limestone caves i did not know what dispositions slept latent in my genetic structures dispositions inapt and out of place in the artificial world within the strictures of which i had been conditioned a nature like the growth of a tree the shape of a bush may be clipped and thwarted the seed poisoned does not grow the flower immersed in acid does not bloom i wondered what might be the nature of men and what might be the nature of women i know of no test in these matters unless it be honesty and what leads to joy perhaps i would not have considered these matters save that i was unable to drive from my mind the recollection of an event which had occurred late in the sordid abuse to which i had been so brutally subjected i had been thrown to my masters men one after another had raped and beaten me and thrown me to the next i was handed about as an object fierce was the discipline to which they subjected me though i wept for mercy and cried out none gave ear no consideration nor lenience was shown to the piteous slave girl in their power then strangely late in this abuse the event occurred which even now troubled me i lay on my back weeping my head bound in the blanket thrashing and squirming struck held unable to withdraw from helpless to withstand the plunging discipline of the brute to whom i had been last thrown and it had occurred i suddenly felt an indescribable sensation first it seemed to me incredibly that this was fitting what was being done to me i had been proud and vain before men what did i truly expect men such men men on a world such as this to do about that as his force struck me i felt strangely be disciplined woman i was half choked in the hood then to my amazement i welcomed the abuse i felt there was beyond its sense of fittingness seeing that i a woman had displeased strong males and must thus be punished a sense of profound complementarity the abuse if he chose was simply his to give and mine to bear he was a man i was a woman he was dominant i was not it was his to rule mine to submit i experienced then degraded and abused though i was with a flood of elation primitive organic animal primate complementarity the complementarity of man and woman the complementarity beyond mythology and rhetoric the complementarity of he who takes and she who is taken of he who has and owns and of she whom he has whom he owns and makes his with a cry of joy and misery then from the depths of the hood rearing from the dirt as i could i clutched him i felt my body locked to his then i felt my body as though of its own will suddenly spasmodically grasp him i could not begin to control the reflexes which he had triggered in me they jolted and exploded in my body i clutched him helplessly i was his men laughed kajira said one then i was thrown to another i sat in the silent camp wrapped in the thin blanket thinking kajira had said one of the men i was angry i could not forgive myself for having yielded to one of the men i tried to tell myself it had not happened it could not have happened thus it had not happened yet i knew in truth it had happened i had yielded to one of the men in his arms i who was or had been judy thornton had yielded to one of the men an abused slave girl had wept and bucked in the arms of a master it had been i how ashamed i was i asked myself what could it mean could the feelings which had overwhelmed me be denied could the sensate truth the splendor of biological submission so different from the truth of a man which is that of domination in whose glory i had been wrapped be denied i resolved that i must not permit myself the weakness which would make a mockery of my personhood i must not again yield to a male i thought of elicia nevins how she would have laughed had she seen judy thornton her lovely rival on her back in the dirt a branded slave girl squirming in the throes of submission to a male so shamefully helpless in his arms uncontrollably not the mistress of herself yielding to his manhood i knew then i must escape it would be difficult for i was branded i looked up at the guard he was not watching i crept to the cliff wall i examined it in the moonlight at no point could i crawl more than a yard up its surface i scratched my fingernails on the granite i turned to the wall of thorn brush i feared it it was high and thick the guard was not watching the camp was not his concern his concern was elsewhere with possible approaches to the camp the fields beyond the valleys i cried out with misery i screamed frightened the brush sank beneath me it would not support my weight my right leg was deep in it my right arm i turned my head to the side keeping my eyes closed i felt the thorns they seemed to tear at me i was half immersed in the brush i was caught i dared not move i began to weep and scream my master was first to my side he was not much pleased i immediately fell silent another man came bearing a torch lit from the stirred ashes of the fire some other men arose but then seeing it was only a slave girl returned to their furs and tenting eta hurried over to me but a curt word from my master hurried her back to her rest with dispatch im caught master i whimpered only too obviously had i been trying to escape in the torchlight he pulled my head back by the hair to clear it of the thorns he did not want me blinded i managed suffering long scratches to extricate my right arm he looked at me i was afraid he was going to leave me as i was i could not pull my right leg back because of its position in the brush i had no leverage as i stood to lift my leg out please help me master i begged i had no wish to remain caught in the thorn brush until morning it was embarrassing and i was helpless and it was painful please master i begged help me he lifted me up in his arms in this action freeing my leg though it was cut and scratched in the instant i relished being in his arms held by him my weight was nothing to him i loved the feel of his strong hands on my body holding me up lightly from the earth which i thus carried could not touch unless he permitted it i naked boldly put my head against the shoulder of his tunic then he had placed me on my feet i did not meet his eyes i felt small before him it had been obvious i had been trying to escape i did not know at that time what might be the penalty for a girl who attempts escape and is so unfortunate as as is nearly always the case to be recaptured slave girls almost never escape the major reason for this is the steel collar which obdurately encircling her neck read promptly identifies her master and his city almost no one of course would think of removing a collar from a girl unless it would be to replace it with one of his own this is because she is a slave girls may also be hunted down by trained sleen tireless hunters if a girl should elude one master she will customarily soon fall to another a successful escape infrequent event that it is seldom amounts from the girls point of view to more than an exchange of collar and chains almost any man on gor will hasten to put his collar on a loose beautiful female where is she to run what is she to do all in all escape is not a reality for female slaves they are slaves they will remain slaves too they are branded which further makes escape for almost all practical purposes an impossibility for them interestingly ear piercing too can make it difficult for an escaped girl to elude detection ear piercing interestingly from an earth point of view is regarded by most gorean women slave and free as more degrading than the brand slave girls native to gor dread it terribly perhaps because it is so visible the piercing of their flesh being so flagrantly erotic what man would even think of freeing them if they had pierced ears they beg their masters not to pierce their ears their pleas those of slave girls are commonly ignored their ears are pierced afterwards it might be mentioned they are usually pleased with the piercing of their ears and grow quite proud of this erotic dimension added to their beauty not displeased are they either with the lovely adornments which their master may now order them to fix upon their body free women it is no secret in many respects envy their enslaved sisters their beauty their joy their attractiveness to men this may explain why free women are often quite cruel to slave girls most imbonded girls fear greatly that they might be purchased by one of the dreaded free women i have wondered sometimes if free women on gor might not be happier if their culture permitted them to be somewhat more like the slave girls they so heartily despise it seems a small enough thing that a free woman might be culturally permitted to have her ears pierced and thus be permitted earrings would it make so much difference but the bonds of culture are strong on earth a free woman would not think of having herself branded though it might improve her beauty similarly on gor a free woman would not consider having her ears pierced among slave girls however ear piercing inflicted upon them by the will of their masters is becoming widespread on gor one might say it is gaining considerable popularity among masters which accounts of course for its growing frequency in the female slave population of the planet it is a custom which derives i am told from the city of turia which lies in gors southern hemisphere an important manufacturing and trading center a girl with pierced ears is of course either a slave or a former slave if she is a former slave her papers of manumission had best be in perfect order more than one freed woman because of pierced ears has found herself again on the block again reduced by strong men to the helpless state of bondage such a woman is usually by intent sold away from her city delivered for a pittance to a foreign buyer my ears were not pierced so i needed not fear that the piercing of my ears would betray me to the casual glance of a gorean male as a slave girl i was however branded gorean free women no more than the free women of earth do not wear brands only slave girls on earth or gor are branded on earth where slavery is practiced commonly only troublesome girls are branded on gor on the other hand all slave girls are branded i did not think i could well escape with my brand it marked me too well as a slave i did not speak to my master he was i supposed considering my punishment for having attempted to escape i did not know at that time what was commonly done to a girl who has attempted to escape and has been recaptured it is just as well much depends on the master but commonly the first time she is recaptured she is treated with great lenience as being only a foolish girl commonly she is only tied and lashed should she attempt escape a second time and be recaptured she is commonly hamstrung the tendons behind the knees being severed almost no girls attempt escape a second time i did not know at the time but even the thought of escape was a foolish one many girls even should they be so fortunate as to reach the walls of their own city may not be admitted through its gates their slavery even though no fault of their own has deprived them of all their rights and cancelled their citizenship flee or be chained slave is often said to them they turn and run weeping from the gates some girls attempt to flee to the greenwood forests of the north in such forests in certain territories there roam bands of free women the lithe ferocious panther girls of gor but these despise and hate women not of their own fierce ilk in particular do they revile and hold in contempt girls beauties who have been slaves to men should such a girl fleeing enter the cool vastness of their green domain she is commonly hunted down like a tabuk doe and cruelly captured the forests are not for such as she she is tethered and bound and often lashed then driven by switches helplessly to the shores of thassa or the banks of the laurius and then sold back to men usually for weapons or candy my master with a spear and a loop of rope under the torchlight the torch held by one of his men opened a passage in the thorn bush it was some eighteen inches wide he pointed to the passage the way to flight was open i need only run i looked at my master in the moonlight my knees felt that they might give way i began to tremble the way to flight was open i looked with dread down the narrow corridor forced between the walls of fierce thorn brush into the darkness beyond i needed only run the naked slave girl shook with terror before her master then i knelt before him and pressed my lips to his feet trembling keep me master i begged keep me i looked up at him clutching his knees tears in my eyes please master i wept let me stay i remained kneeling shuddering as he turned from me and reclosed with the spear and rope the corridor in the thorn brush then again he stood before me looking down at me he motioned me to my feet that i should follow him humbly his girl i followed him through the camp the other man too he holding the torch followed we stopped before the rolled furs of one of the warriors he blinked in the torchlight and rose to one elbow looking at us my master spoke to him briefly no more than four or five words i looked at the man i knew him well from the camp i had usually shrunk away from him he was the least attractive man in the camp why had my master brought me here my master said something to me briefly and indicated the recumbent warrior i could not understand the precise meaning of the words addressed to me but their import as my heart sank was clear i was to please this man and as a slave girl yesterday night my master had taken my virginity much pleasured himself with me and forced my total surrender to him the surrender of a completely vanquished bond girl but should i then have inferred that i was a favored girl that there was something special about me no it had been only first rights with me naturally taken by him the leader it had meant nothing i was only a girl what had meant so much to me what had been so momentous to me had been meaningless to him it had been only first rights doubtless he had taken first rights with countless girls many of them more beautiful than i i was truly for the use of all as much or more than the lovely eta there was nothing special about judy thornton she was only a slave girl in the camp i had not understood that i had been confused scandalized outraged miserable when i had been put up as quarry and prize in the cruel game of the evening i had at last afterwards even cried out my rebellion my foolish protest i had been vain and proud i had thought myself better than what i was i an earth girl had presumed to scold gorean men then i had been hooded and thrown naked to them for their pleasure in the course of the savage discipline inflicted upon me late in its measures i had it both thrilling and horrifying me sensed the ancient primate complementarity of male and female that in the ancient biological sovereignties of nature on this world reasserted i a female was simply subordinate to the male this truth much fought and feared long denied accepted burst upon me with a blaze of freedom with hurricane force it blasted away the brittle webs and bars of falsehood i though helpless hooded in the arms of the beasts who ravished me had experienced exhilarated an incredible sense of freedom of liberation it was not the freedom of convention i then felt but the freedom of nature not the freedom to be what i was not which had been prescribed to me but the freedom rather to be what i was which for complex social and historical reasons had been long denied to me it was not the freedom of political prescription but the freedom of nature the freedom of a rock to fall of a plant to grow of a flower to bloom the ecstatic freedom to be what one was and i had cried out and seized the man i hooded knew nothing of him but his maleness i cried out and yielded to him kajira had said someone how shamed i had been that i had done this how sullenly i had lain in the camp afterwards i had resolved to attempt escape in the camp as i had lain there i had known i was nothing special that i was only a slave girl that i must obey the men and that they would do with me what they wished i attempted to escape but in a moment foolishly painfully i was enmeshed in the thorn brush helpless and caught in its cruel compass my master had then extricated me from my cruel prison and with spear and rope opened a path in the brush through which i might did i choose take flight i had wavered and then terrified and crushed had knelt to him keep me master i had begged i now stood beside him the man with the torch standing to one side i looked down at the man in the furs looking up at us to me he was the least attractive man in the camp my master had said something to me its import was clear i looked at him his eyes were hard i choked back sobs i knelt beside the man in the furs who threw back the furs my master stood behind me the other man held the torch i then with hands and mouth fell to kissing and touching the warrior i pleased him as well as i could being an ignorant girl following his directions at last he took me and threw me to the furs beneath him i looked up at my masters face i could see the side of it in the torchlight the torchlight illuminated me then suddenly i turned my head to one side closing my eyes crying out i could no longer resist the man i then shamed under the very eyes of my master yielded to the man when he had done with me to his satisfaction he thrust me from him my master then ordered me to my feet and he conducted me to where my blanket had been discarded there bending over me he crossed my wrists and with a narrow strap tied them together behind my back he then similarly fastened my ankles i lay on my side he threw the thin blanket over me and left me eta crept to my side i looked at her dryeyed she did not attempt to untie me the master had decreed bonds for me this night i would remain bound i turned away from eta lying on my side she remained near me tonight i had run belled both quarry and prize in a cruel game of barbarian men insolent i had been thrown to masters who had impressed their dominance upon me no longer had i doubt of their dominance or of my complete subordination to their will my master had later permitted me to run if i chose to take flight rather i had knelt before him naked and begged to be kept i would be kept as he made clear to me only upon his terms those of my absolute subjection my abject slavery the slave girl had been permitted to run if she chose not so choosing she remained in the camp as clearly what she was total slave i wondered why my master had opened the corridor in the thorn brush did i really mean nothing to him was it nothing to him whether i remained in the camp or lied into the darkness to starve or be devoured by beasts or to fall into the hands of others i suspected that truly it did mean little to him yet as i lay there naked bound under the blanket i reddened it had been for my benefit not his that he had opened the corridor in the brush he had understood the slave girl better than she had understood herself he had doubtless had experience with many girls perhaps he had even owned earth girls before it did not seem likely to me that i would have been the only wench of earth brought to the chains of this world there had perhaps been many as i lay there i realized that he had cognized me well as a master a girl the corridor had been opened for my benefit not his he with his skill and experience in such matters had simply and easily read my emotions my feelings my nature they had lain as open to him as my flesh i had been unable to conceal aught from his discerning eye he was a master of female psychology nothing in me had been secret from him i had been with ease sized up and understood i shuddered thinking how easy this would make me to control how simple to manipulate and defeat i was both gratified and frightened that this man understood me i was gratified because i wanted deeply to be understood and i was frightened too because i sensed the power this understanding would give him over me i had little doubt too that he was the sort of man who would exploit this power he would use it as naturally as innocently as savagely as effectively as a boar its tusks or a lion its claws he understood me and owned me how could i have been more helplessly his i clenched the fists of my bound hands he had opened the corridor in the brush he had known i would not run i had not known i would not run but he had known he knew the girl better than she knew herself he knew she would when the choice must he made kneel to him and beg to be kept it was not he but she who had not known that she would beg to be kept that was the point of his small demonstration that she not he learn that she would not run that she would beg to remain in the camp that she would sue on her knees to be kept and what was the lesson to be gathered from that i asked myself angrily i squirmed in the bonds furious the lesson seemed a reasonably obvious one though perhaps one unpleasant for an earth girl to accept what did he know about me that i did not know about myself what did this discerning brute so much the master of the lovely judy thornton know about her which she herself did not yet know or admit to herself no i wept i felt etas hand gentle on my head comforting me no i moaned no but i knew that i had made a choice he had then closed the thornbrush corridor he had led me to a man him whom i had found the least attractive in the camp it had then been designated to me that i would please him here there had been no bonds no hooding it had been i who must initiate action i who must perform i had choked back sobs my will had bent helplessly beneath that of my master i had knelt and with hands and mouth kissing and touching attempted to please the free man i tried to respond to the mans directions i had done so poorly i was an ignorant clumsy frightened girl raw uncooked collar meat as it is said but in time he had thrown me beneath him and i think with pleasure conducted me through the throes of intimate service i had resolved to attempt to resist him my master observed i wished to retain my personhood before my master that he respect me but in less than a quarter of an hour i had felt sensations overwhelming me which i could not resist there had been tears in my eyes then though my master observed i had turned my head to one side closed my eyes and cried out and unable to help myself yielded to the man judy thorntons lovely belly and haunches jolting in helpless slave orgasm i now lay bound naked under a thin blanket eta sat near me to comfort me no longer did the opportunity to run present itself the wall of thorn brush had been closed leather confined my body i was tied hand and foot i could not even rise to my feet i smiled ruefully to myself the slave girl was well secured but i was puzzled why i had been bound surely it had not been to prevent my escape the wall of thorn brush and the sheer cliffs would be more than ample to prevent that why then had i been bound i supposed perhaps it was for purposes of discipline binding is excellent discipline it is often used on this world for that purpose restraints their psychological indignity and physical discomfort particularly after a time placed upon a girl by the will of a master are among the simplest and most effective instruments of female instruction they rank with food and the whip a girl under disciplinary binding once released is invariably eager to please she does not wish to be rebound the thongs have well apprised her of her place which is at her masters feet but i did not think i was being disciplined my master had not seemed dissatisfied with me my performance had not been superb but surely i had tried hard under his will to be pleasing as a slave girl to the man he had designated my master had not seemed angry or irritated i did not think i was being disciplined why then had i been bound i had labored diligently and without inhibitions as well as i could as a poor beautiful commanded slave i had done the best i could why then had i been bound i had tried to resist the man for several minutes and had managed to do so i had held myself tight and rigid and had tried to hold in all feeling i had not wanted my master to see me squirm as a slave i was still deeply ashamed that i had yielded to the man then as i lay there bound with eta nearby i asked myself why i should be ashamed was it wrong for a woman to yield helplessly to a man was it wrong for the heart to beat to breathe to feel if the nature of the man were conquest and victory what might then be the nature of the woman could it be complementary might it not be defeat and delicious surrender and pleasure i began to sweat in the bonds eta smiled at me perhaps an equal must resist a man but i was not an equal i was a slave girl i belonged to men i could be a biological woman as perhaps a free woman could not i could be a primitive female an owned woman as they could not i could be a woman as they could not slavery made me free to be a woman i reared up sitting my hands tied behind me i could not free myself eta held my shoulders gently my eyes were wild i had no choice i was slave i was forced to be a woman i cried out with pleasure eta cautioned me to silence i had resisted the man for several minutes i had fought not to feel how foolish i had been what pleasure i had lost i imagined myself then superbly yielding and kissing and melting in the arms of a master from almost his first touch the lengthy delicious pleasure that i could give him his slave a pleasure too which would make me want to scream with the joy of my womanhood untie me eta i begged untie me she did not understand me i turned my back to her thrusting my bound hands piteously to her untie me i begged eta shook her head gently and held me i had been tied by the master i must remain bound i shook my head with misery i wanted to crawl to the men to tell them i understood to beg them to have me to let me give them pleasure i wanted to please them as a slave girl theirs my eyes were vulnerable with the helpless lust of a bound girl who would crawl to a man to serve him i had not dreamed such an emotion could exist it was not merely that i was eager to piteously and submissively display my beauty to them that they might be moved to take it in their arms and vanquish it but beyond this i was overwhelmed by an entire dimension of emotion which might be spoken of though inadequately as the desire to yield service and love i wanted to give unstintingly with no thought of return always i had been concerned with what i might obtain now for the first time in my life in my joy and selfacceptance as a female slave i wanted to give i wanted to give all of myself wholeheartedly to deliver and bestow myself unto them as their girl who loved them and would do all for them asking nothing i wished to be nothing and to give all i wanted to be their slave i shook with the selfless ecstasy of the slave girl i wanted to crawl to them to tell them that i now understood and that i was theirs i wanted to cry out to them to weep to kneel to them to kiss and lick submissively at their bodies in my joy untie me eta i wept she shook her head i knew i had not been as successful as i might have been in pleasing the man to whom my master had earlier commanded me i looked at eta i looked to the sleeping men i looked at eta again teach me eta i begged in a desperate whisper teach me tomorrow to be pleasing to men teach me to be pleasing to men eta could not understand my words but she could read my eyes my looks the movements of my body my piteous needs she smiled nodding she understood what was occurring in my body i knew eta would help me she knew i was a slave she would help me to be a better slave soon i knew when i learned more of the language and could clearly or more clearly express myself eta would train me as she could in the giving of pleasures to masters i kissed her i struggled with the bonds please untie me eta i begged again indicating the bonds she smiled and shook her head i squirmed in the leather i now knew why i had been bound it was to prevent me from crawling to the men as a slave i was not to interrupt their rest i cried out in anger and misery confined by the bonds eta cautioned me to silence the men must not be disturbed she then took me by the shoulders to press me back softly to the ground the thin blanket was about my thighs before she pressed me back i resisting looked at her la kajira i said eta nodded tu kajira she said then she indicated herself la kajira she said then she pointed to me tu kajira she smiled then she gently pressed me back to the ground and as i lay on my right shoulder looking up covered me with the thin blanket i saw the moonlight on her steel collar i envied her the collar i too wanted to wear a steel collar it had writing on it it doubtless identified her master i too wished to wear a collar which might bear too the name of my master eta kissed me and rose to her feet and left i lay under the blanket naked bound i rolled to my back i moved a bit to find a place where i might lie comfortably i did not move too much for i did not wish to dislodge the blanket it would be difficult to replace should it come off in the night i looked up at the night the stars the moons i saw the cliff i saw the guard on the height of the cliff i then rolled to my right shoulder moving the blanket as little as possible i regarded the closed wall of thorn brush i moved somewhat and looked at the furs and in some places the tenting of the men i turned my head and looked up at the moons how wild and white and beautiful they seemed judy thornton or she who had once on a remote and artificial world been judy thornton looked up at the moons i remembered the lovely slave in the tateera which i had seen in the mirror she surely had not been judy thornton i was gloriously pleased to be that slave i slept out of doors in a camp of barbaric men above me were the bright stars in a black sky and three moons i lay under a thin blanket i was naked there was a brand on my thigh i was a bound slave girl i was not unhappy i looked up at the moons la kajira i said i am a slave girl the raid what is your duty asked my master absolute obedience i replied in gorean he held the whip to my lips i pressed my lips to it and kissed it absolute obedience i said eta from behind me pinned the first of five veils about my face it was light and shimmering of white silk almost transparent then one after the other she added the freedom veil or veil of the citizeness the pride veil the house veil and street veil each of these is heavier and more opaque than the one which lies within the street veil worn publicly is extremely bulky quite heavy and completely opaque not even the lineaments of the nose and cheeks are discernible when it is worn the house veil is worn indoors when there are those present who are not of the household as in conversing with or entertaining associates of ones companion veils are worn in various numbers and combinations by gorean free women this tending to vary by preference and caste many lowclass gorean women own only a single veil which must do for all purposes not all highcaste women wear a large number of veils a free woman publicly will commonly wear one or two veils a frequent combination is the light veil or last veil and the house or street veil rich vain women of high caste may wear ostentatiously as many as nine or ten veils in certain cities in connection with the free companionship the betrothed or pledged beauty may wear eight veils several of which are ritualistically removed during various phases of the ceremony of companionship the final veils and robes of course are removed in private by the male who following their removal arms interlocked with the girl drinks with her the wine of the companionship after which he completes the ceremony this sort of thing however varies considerably from city to city in some cities the girl is unveiled though not disrobed of course during the public ceremony the friends of the male may then express their pleasure and joy in her beauty and their celebration of the good fortune of their friend the veil it might be noted is not legally imperative for a free woman it is rather a matter of modesty and custom some lowclass uncompanioned free girls do not wear veils similarly certain bold free women neglect the veil neglect of the veil is not a crime in gorean cities though in some it is deemed a brazen and scandalous omission slave girls may or may not be veiled this depending on the will of their master most slave girls are not permitted to veil themselves indeed not only are they refused the dignity of the veil but commonly they are placed in brief exciting slave livery and may not even bind their hair such girls healthy and vital their hair unbound their considerable charms well revealed by the brevity of their costume are thought by men to constitute one of the more pleasurable aspects of the scenery of a city are the slaves of ar for example more beautiful than those of say koroba or tharna men the beasts heatedly discuss such questions in some cities and among some groups and tribes it might be mentioned though this is not common veils may be for most practical purposes unknown even among free women the cities of gor are numerous and pluralistic each has its own history customs and traditions on the whole however gorean culture prescribes the veil for free women eta fastened the fourth of five veils upon me the house veil though eta wore only the shameful scandalous tateera she pinned the veils expertly she now only a delicious halfnaked slave girl had once been free she did her work beautifully i felt the street veil fastened upon me i was veiled as might have been a rich gorean free woman of high caste perhaps bound for the song dramas of enkara how beautiful said eta she standing back observed me my masters eyes appraised me i stood straight i knew how beautiful i looked for once before some days ago in the camp i had been so beclothed i had seen myself then in the mirror the robes carefully draped primarily white in their richness and sheen were resplendent over the veils my eyes would appear very dark gloves had been placed upon my hands on my feet were scarlet slippers i knew that i was richly and beautifully bedecked i knew too that i was small and might be easily thrown to the shoulder of a man my master looked at me he put his hands on my shoulders do you dare place your hands on the body of a free woman i asked him deferentially adding master he stepped back he regarded me thoughtfully insolent said he to himself as though thinking that a mere slave should be placed in such garments yes master i said have i ever lashed you he asked i swallowed hard no master i said i should do so sometime he said yes master i said it would scarcely do to run her in the tateera said one of his men standing nearby doubtless not said my master looking at his owned girl how incredibly and yet rationally and justifiably i felt at his mercy he was my master he owned me he could do whatever he wanted with me he could trade me or sell me or even slay me upon a whim should he wish i was absolutely his his girl she is beautiful said eta she will have to do said my master they are camped not two pasangs from here said one of the men a black cloak was brought it was wrapped about me come slave girl said my master yes master i said he turned about and with his weapons strode from the camp i followed him at his heel where a slave girl belongs eta remained behind the other men the warriors single file fell into line behind us following be silent said my master i did not speak together the men behind us we observed the camp there were more wagons in the retinue now when first i had seen the retinue several days ago there had been only one which had carried supplies the largest of the three moons was now full the camp lay nestled in a clearing in woods a stream ran by one perimeter of the camp this was joined by another stream some two hundred yards beyond the camp guards had been posted quiet is the night called one to the other he was similarly answered i knew by now a smattering of gorean i could understand them eta had worked diligently with me i could now respond swiftly to many commands i knew the names of many articles i had acquired some grammar i was able to formulate simple sentences by myself my masters could now command me the barbarian girl with relative satisfactoriness in their own tongue and i to some extent the lovely barbarian slave from earth could respond to them in the tongue of my masters theirs i now artlessly unable to help myself found myself thinking naturally of gorean as the language of masters it is a beautiful melodious expressive language it is also in the mouths of men a strong powerful uncompromising language when a girl is commanded in gorean she obeys i watched the guards through the trees make their rounds there were several tents in the camp in the center of the camp was a striped tent almost a pavillion supported on ten poles i saw one of the girls with bare arms robed in classic white unveiled emerge from the central tent and with a gourd dipper go to the stream where she filled the dipper and thence returned to the tent there was a golden circlet on her throat and another on her left wrist one of the men had looked at her as she had walked past him there was a fire in the tent and smoke from this fire emerged from a hole at the tents apex within as they passed between the wall of the tent and the fire i could see the shadows of one or two other girls near the central tent almost as large was a brown turreted tent with a pennon flying from a central pole it was i supposed the tent of the camps leader there were some seventy or eighty men i had conjectured several days ago in the retinue i could now see several sitting around openair fires others were i supposed within the tents perhaps sleeping the two palanquins which had been carried by ten men apiece were within the camp turned upside down to protect them i supposed from dew or rain beneath the one were several boxes and chests those containing the riches which it had borne added to the one wagon which had been drawn by the shaggy oxlike creatures were now four other wagons these wagons too apparently were each drawn by a pair of the oxlike creatures called bosk the wagons were now unhitched several animals those called bosk ten or more hobbled browsed among the trees on the other side of the camp eta though perhaps it was not proper had much listened to the converse of the men and as my gorean improved conveyed certain pieces of information to me the retinue was the betrothal and dowry retinue of the lady sabina of the small merchant polis of fortress of saphronicus bound overland for ti of the four cities of saleria of the salerian confederation ti lies on the olni a tributary of the vosk north of tharna tharna sometimes called the city of silver is well known for the richness of her silver mines she is ruled by lara a tatrix this seems paradoxical for in tharna of the hundreds of known gorean cities the position of women is surely among the lowest the sign of a man of tharna is two yellow cords carried at the belt suitable for the binding of the hands and feet of a female at one time apparently women were dominant in tharna but this situation in a revolution of the males was overturned few women in tharna even now years later are permitted out of the collar i looked at the four new wagons which had been added to the retinue the wagon which i had seen earlier the supply wagon was now almost empty the food supplies perhaps being diminished as the peregrination neared its end and the poles and tenting of course being used in the sheltering for the camp the other four wagons however were fully loaded largely it seemed with produce and coarse goods the lady sabina i learned from eta was pledged by her father kleomenes a pretentious but powerful upstart merchant of fortress of saphronicus to thandar of ti of the warriors youngest of the five sons of ebullius gaius cassius of the warriors administrator of ti this done in a companion contract arranged by both ebullius gaius cassius and kleomenes to which had now been set the seals of both ti and fortress of saphronicus the pledged companions the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus and thandar of ti of the four cities of saleria of the salerian confederation had as yet according to eta never laid eyes on one another the matter of their match having been arranged between their respective fathers as is not uncommon in gorean custom the match had been initiated at the behest of kleomenes who was interested in negotiating a commercial and political alliance with the salerian confederation these alliances of interest to the expanding salerian confederation were not unwelcome such alliances naturally might presage the entrance of fortress of saphronicus into the confederation which was becoming a growing power in the north it seemed not unlikely that the match would ultimately prove profitable and politically expedient for both fortress of saphronicus and the salerian confederation in the match there was much to gain by both parties the companion contract thus had been duly negotiated with the attention of scribes of the law from both fortress of saphronicus and the confederation of saleria the companion journey then when the auspices had been favorable as they promptly were these determined by the inspection of the condition and nature of the liver of a sacrificial verr examined by members of the caste of initiates had begun the journey itself overland and afoot from fortress of saphronicus to ti would take several days but it was ceremonially prolonged in order that the four tributary villages of fortress of saphronicus might be visited it is not unusual for a gorean city to have several villages in its vicinity these customarily supplying it with meat and produce these villages may or may not be tributary to the city it is common of course for a city to protect those villages whether they are tributary to the city or not which make use of its market if a village markets in a given city that city by gorean custom stands as its shield a relationship which of course works to the advantage of both the villages and city the city receiving produce in its markets the villages receiving the protection of the citys soldiers the policy of fortress of saphronicus extending its hegemony politically over its nearby villages even to the extent of exacting tribute in kind is not unprecedented on gor but on the other hand is not the general rule most villages are free villages the gorean peasant is a resolute strong fellow upright and stubborn who prides himself on his land and his sovereignty also he is usually the master of the gorean longbow in the wake of which liberty is often to be found he who can bend the longbow a peasant saying has it cannot be slave women of course it might be noted lack the strength to bend this bow i suppose if they could bend the bow the saying would not exist or would be altered that is the way men are goreans enjoy making women slaves the women on the whole interestingly save some verbally do not seem to much mind interestingly the longbow is outlawed in the tributary villages of fortress of saphronicus the betrothal or companion journey ceremonially included the circuit of the four villages in each of which a feast was held and from each of which a wagon of produce was procured to be added to the dowry riches to be presented to ebullius gains cassius father of thandar of ti to be included in the treasury of ti i had seen four wagons of produce in the camp and knew independently from eta that the four tributary villages had now been visited the wagons of produce were not of great value but stood as token of the relation of the villages to fortress of saphronicus also of course visiting the villages presented die opportunity for publicizing the match and doubtless unobtrusively in the feasting and celebration for gathering the reaction and general feelings of the villages are they content is trouble brewing must a leader be deposed or imprisoned must a daughter be taken hostage to the city accurate information on the oppressed is essential to the maintenance of the power of the oppressor from the striped tent in the center of the camp another girl emerged clad like the other in the sleeveless gown a circlet on her throat and left wrist and made her way toward the supplies wagon she left the pavillionlike tent sedately but as soon as she was no longer visible through the opening in the tent she threw back her head shaking her hair and then her gait transformed sauntered like a shesleen to the side of the wagon i gasped the walk could only have been that of a slave girl i then realized that the girls in attendance on the veiled woman who had been seated in the curule chair on the palanquin were slaves the circlets on their throats were doubtless collars and the wristlet each wore was doubtless naught but matching slave jewelry but they were obviously high slaves judging by the fineness of their raiment they were the slave maids of the lady sabina doubtless belonging to her i wondered how long it had been since one of them had had the hands of a man on her body quiet is the night called one of the guards quiet is the night was echoed by other guards about the camp i looked up at the largest of the three gorean moons it was now full tomorrow the retinue would continue on toward ti to be met two days from now outside the city by a welcoming procession or thus it was planned i felt my masters hand on my arm it was not tight but firm i was in his power i did not understand my role in the events which were transpiring i was not clear why my master and his men and myself scouted this camp and now remained in its vicinity one lunar month from this date by the phases of the largest moon after days of preparation the ceremony of the companionship was scheduled to be consummated in ti binding together as companions thandar of ti son of ebullius gaius cassius administrator of ti and the lady sabina daughter of kleomenes high merchant in fortress of saphronicus i hoped naturally that they would be happy i was only a slave but i did not think myself much less free than the lady sabina whose beauty was being bartered for commercial and political power i might have to be half naked in a bond girls tateera but she i expected despite the wealth of her robes and jewels was in her way as slave as i yet i did not feel sorry for her for i had heard from eta that she was a pretentious haughty girl one bold in speech and cruel to her slave maids many of the daughters of merchants are proud sorts for the merchants themselves by virtue of their power tend to vanity and pride and agitate justifiably or not for the inclusion of their caste among the high castes of gor their pampered daughters protected from work and responsibility ostentatiously garbed and elaborately educated in caste trivia tend to be spoiled and soft yet i did not wish the lady sabina unhappiness i hoped that she would have a splendid companionship with thander of ti too allaying my commiserations for the girl for she had had no say in her companionship arrangements was my understanding conveyed by eta that she looked forward to the match and was much pleased by it in taking companionship with one of the warriors she would raise caste for the warriors on gor are among the high castes of which there are five the initiates scribes physicians builders and warriors in many cities only members of the high castes may belong to the citys high council most gorean cities are governed by an executive the administrator in conjunction with the high council some cities are governed by a ubar who is in effect a military sovereign sometimes a tyrant whose word is law the ubars power is limited institutionally only by his capacity to inspire and control those whose steel keeps him upon the throne sword loyalty is a bond of fidelity sworn to the ubar gorean warriors seldom break this bond it is not sworn lightly it is sworn only to those who are thought fit to be ubar when the ubar is thought to be unfit it is thought too he has dishonored the pledge of sword loyalty it is not then uncommon for him to die beneath the steel of his outraged men only a ubar it is said may sit upon the throne of a ubar only when a true ubar sits upon the throne is it said the pledge of sword loyalty is binding it was my hope that the lady sabina would be happy it was said she was muck pleased to raise caste and would become by this match one of the high ladies of the salerian confederation which was becoming powerful in the north i did not think much of thandar of ti perhaps because he was a man i supposed he was not too pleased at being matched with a girl who was not of the five high castes but surely he could appreciate the commercial and political significance of the match and would be pleased to serve his city by doing his part from the point of view of his father the bargain was a good one for thandar was the youngest and least important of five sons it was not as if his first or second son had been matched with a merchants daughter besides the match was politically and commercially expedient who knew how ambitious might be the aspirations of ti and the salerian confederation too from thandars point of view if the match turned out to be a misery he being a gorean male of high caste could content himself with bought women who would fight one another and beg on their bellies to serve one such as he the gowned female slave the circlet on her throat and wrist reached into the supply wagon into a sack to find a larma i watched her in the half darkness i did not think she saw that behind her from the pavillionlike tent the veiled lady sabina had emerged and followed her with two of the other slave maids behind her one with a switch the girl at the wagon reached forward extending her hand into a sack one of the warriors of the camp was close behind her i think she must have been aware of his presence but she gave no sign of this awareness he put his hands on either side of her body resting them on the wagon box she turned easily not surprised between his arms to face him she lifted the larma fruit and her head up looking at him bit into it she regarded him in the half darkness she chewed at the fruit he leaned over her i saw the glint of gold at her throat suddenly her arms were about him and he was kissing her she a slave in his arms in the half darkness i saw her hand behind his back the larma fruit bitten into still in her hand so shameless slave cried the lady sabina who had followed the girl perhaps suspicious of her the two who had been touching leapt apart the girl crying out with misery and throwing herself to her knees at the foot of her mistress the man backed away angrily startled shameless slave slut cried the lady sabina have pity mistress wept the caught slave girl her head to her mistress sandals what is going on here demanded a man emerging from the central dark tent which i took to be that of the headquarters of the camp he carried a sword slung over his shoulder loosely he wore otherwise only a tunic and the heavy sandals almost boots of a soldier behold cried the lady sabina indicating the kneeling girl a lascivious slave girl the soldier the leader of the camp i gathered was not pleased at having his work or rest interrupted but was concerned to be deferential i followed her said the lady sabina and found her here shameless in the arms of a soldier touching kissing pity mistress wept the girl have i not lehna inquired the lady sabina sternly taught you proper deportment have i not instructed you in dignity is this how you betray my trust forgive me mistress wept the girl you are not a paga slut said the lady sabina you are the slave maid of a free woman yes mistress said the girl have i not set you always a model of elegance an example of nobility and selfrespect asked the lady sabina yes mistress said the girl when you were twelve my father bought you from the pens in ar and gave you to me yes mistress she said you were treated with great kindness you were not put in the kitchens you were not given to tharlarion drivers you were taken into our own apartments you were permitted to sleep in my own chamber at the foot of my couch you were trained diligently as a ladys maid yes mistress said the girl is that not a great honor for a slave slut yes mistress said the girl and yet said the lady sabina sadly how have i been repaid the girl dared not answer but kept her head down trembling i have been repaid with ingratitude said the lady sabina oh no cried the girl lehna is grateful lehna is grateful to mistress have i not been kind to you demanded the lady sabina oh yes mistress said the girl and yet i find you like a coppertarsk rent slave in the arms of a retainer forgive your girl mistress begged the cringing slave have i often whipped you demanded the lady sabina no cried the girl no do you think me weak inquired the lady sabina no mistress said the girl kind but not weak beg said the lady sabina i beg to be whipped said the girl the camps leader he with the sword slung over his shoulder who had come forth from his tent looked at the soldier in whose arms the girl had been discovered he indicated the slave girl with his head strip her and tie her he said angrily the man tore away the girls gown and with a bit of binding fiber tied her on her knees her wrists crossed and bound behind one of the spokes on the supply wagon you are worthless said the lady sabina to the bound slave you should carry paga in a paga tavern the slave cried out with misery to be so demeaned a number of men had gathered about to witness the scene the captain was clearly irritated i shall speak to you later he said to the soldier dismissing him the soldier turned and left the lady sabina extended her hand to one of the two slave girls who were with her in her gloved hand was placed the switch the girl had carried for her she then approached the bound slave who trembled have i not always set you an example of nobility dignity and selfrespect asked the lady sabina yes mistress said the girl naughty naughty salacious slave cried the lady sabina striking her the girl cried out with the misery of her switching i was startled at the fury with which the lady sabina struck the bound collared girl richly did she lay the disciplinary device to the back and body of the imbonded wench well punishing her for her lascivious indiscretion then wearied furious the lady sabina cast aside the switch turned and went back to her tent she was followed by the two girls who had accompanied her one of whom retrieved the switch the whipped beauty knelt against the wagon wheel bound there shuddering i saw the gold of her collar beneath her dark hair when the lady sabina had finished her work and returned to her tent followed by the two gowned slave girls the leader of the camp or captain angrily returned too to his tent and the men who had gathered around returned to their duties their rest or recreations the girl was left tied at the wheel whipped my master looked upward at the moons from through the trees on the other side of the camp came what i took to be the sound of a bird the hookbilled nightcrying fleer which preys on nocturnal forest urts the cry was repeated three times quiet is the night called one of the camp guards and this call was echoed by the others again three times i heard the cry of the fleer my master slipped behind me he held me with his left hand i felt from the side his knife slip beneath the veils at my face and throat then the knifes edge i feeling it thin obdurate pressed at my jugular what is the duty of a slave girl he asked absolute obedience master i whispered frightened absolute obedience i scarcely dared to whisper for fear of moving my throat beneath the knife i felt the knife leave my throat i felt the black cloak in which i had been wrapped concealing the largely white rich shimmering raiment in which i had been robed slipped away run said my master indicating a path through the trees past the far end of the camp and do not let yourself be captured he thrust me from him and i miserable confused began to run i had gone no more than a dozen steps when i heard one of the guards at the camp cry out halt stand name city stand i did not stop but pressed on who is it cried a man a free woman i heard is it the lady sabina i heard cry stop her i heard after her i ran madly the men as i now think of it must have been as confused as i was i knew only that i feared them and had been commanded to run too my master had told me to avoid capture ignorant wild terrified i ran i stumbled and fell and scrambled to my feet and ran again i heard men crying out and then more frighteningly i heard several leaving the camp splashing across the stream crashing through brush behind me i was now among the trees out of sight of the camp but i was being pursued by how many men i did not know they were gorean men i fled in terror lady sabina i heard stop stop as i ran i realized that the probabilities of there being a free woman robed in the vicinity of the camp who was not the lady sabina were extremely low perhaps she had fled from the camp perhaps for some reason she wished to flee the match with thandar of ti whom i understood she had never seen there must have been men in the camp who almost immediately would have verified that the lady sabina was still within the camp but many having only moments to act would be unable to make that verification if the running woman was the lady sabina she must be caught for her loss would mean the failure of the alliances pending between the salerian confederation and fortress of saphronicus too she must be caught swiftly for the forests at night were dangerous sleen might take her or perhaps prowling outlaws too in the camp were no hunting sleen accordingly the sooner she could be retaken the better it was night and even in the morning her trail would be less fresh less obvious and if the woman were not the lady sabina she should anyway be brought in surely a free woman in the midst of the night forest constitutes a mystery which must be solved who is she from whom is she running is she alone i had no time to think i was only running too i believe the men of the camp had little time to ponder their courses of action it was natural that many of them should have leapt to my pursuit i fled through the thickets i heard men crashing through the brush behind me i did not know how many followed i suspect that of the seventy or eighty men in the camp twenty or more had immediately plunged after me perhaps even more surely too attention was drawn to that end of the camp near which i had been first seen it was there that men would have peered into the darkness there that they would have been marshaled into more organized defensive groups or more organized search parties stop i heard stand stand i ran stumbling striking branches and brush away from me my robes were torn the crashing in the brush behind me grew louder no more swiftly could i run it was not merely that i was encumbered by the robes i knew that i could not in any case outrun the men they were stronger and swifter than i i was only a girl nature whatever might be her reasons had not fitted me to outrun males i was frightened suddenly that it had not been her intention that women escape men then i realized how foolish this was to so personalize nature to ascribe to the cruel blind processes of the world deliberate intentions rather it had been the selections of nature which had determined this women who had escaped men would have been lost to the gene pool caught women would have been led back to the caves to suffer the indignities of impregnation by their captors being forced to reproduce their kind similar considerations may have a bearing on the smaller size and strength of women yet matters are far more complicated than these considerations suggest for in the intricacies and interplay of both natural and sexual selection not merely a swiftness a size and strength would have been selected for in women but an entire set of genetic dispositions it seems inconsistent to suppose that evolution would select only for the outside of an animal and not for its inside as well that only matters such as external configuration would have a bearing on its survival or desirability and not its dispositions to respond in certain ways surely the same evolution which has selected for the fangs of the lion and the speed of the gazelle has selected as well for the disposition to hunt and the disposition to flight that has selected for the strength of the male and the weakness of the female has selected as well for the disposition to conquer and the disposition to surrender we are to a large extent one supposes the products of environments but it is well to remember that the maximum shaping environments in which our nature was stabilized and forged are ancient ones the sense in which environment determines endowment is the sense in which it determines which endowments are to be perpetuated with misery i suddenly realized my genetic heritage was that of a type which could be caught by men the hands of a man seized me hold lady said he i gasped and shook held in his arms why have you fled lady sabina asked he it is dangerous then he called out i have her i tried to escape but i was held fast in a moment several more men were about me he who had held me then released me i stood captured in their midst i did not speak i averted my head is it the lady sabina asked a voice face me said a voice i did not face him but kept my head averted i felt hands put on my shoulders firmly i was turned to face the speaker lift your head he said to the moonlight i kept my head down but he with his hand lifted my head up that the moonlight might fall upon my veiled face i saw that it was the captain or camps leader suddenly i realized he should not have pursued me he should have remained in the camp he studied what he could see of my eyes in the uncertain moonlight shattered through the branches of the forest he backed away and studied the robes i wore then he said who are you i did not speak if i had spoken he would instantly have detected my accent my faltering gorean and would have marked me as a barbarian girl you are not the lady sabina he said who are you i kept silent do you flee an unwanted companionship he asked was your retinue ambushed do you flee outlaws again i did not respond do you flee slavers he asked we are honest men he said we are not slavers he regarded me you are safe with us he said moonlight filtered through the branches who are you he said i again did not respond this time he seemed angry do you choose to be facestripped before men he asked i shook my head negatively his hands were at the first veil the street veil well he asked i did not answer i felt the veil lifted away from my face remove your gloves he said i slipped the gloves from my hands he took them and threw them to my feet my hands felt the night air speak he said when i did not respond to him he pulled away the house veil the men crowded more closely about the flesh of my face was now concealed from the direct vision of the strong males by only three veils the pride veil the veil of the citizeness and the sheer fifth or last veil already in stripping me of the house veil outrage had been done to me it was as though the privacy and intimacy of my house had been violated it was as though they had invaded my house and taken my dress from me forcing me to stand before them in my slip who are you asked the man again how could i tell him who i was my master had not even given me a name the pride veil will be next if you do not speak said the man i wondered what these men would do with me if they discovered i was not even a free woman i forced the thought from my mind free men do not take it lightly that a kajira would dare to don the garments of a free woman this is regarded as an extremely serious offense fit to be followed by terrible punishments it can be worth the life of one to do so i began to tremble the pride veil was ripped from me it was as though my slip had been torn away by the invaders in my house the lineaments of my face could now be detected beneath the veil of the citizeness the last veil in its sheerness and transparency is little more than a token perhaps now dear lady said the captain you will choose to speak choose to reveal your name and city and your business in this vicinity so late in the night i dared not speak i turned my head to the side with a wild sob as the veil of the citizeness was torn away i wore now only the last veil it was as though in my own home an almost final shield of modesty had been taken from me leaving me only a bit of widestrung netting inviting the ripping hand of a master the hand of the man reached to the last veil his hand hesitated perhaps she is free asked one of the men perhaps said the captain he lowered his hand she is quite pretty to be free observed one of the men some assent was given to this let us hope for your sake my dear said the captain that you are free i lowered my head consider yourself my prisoner lady said the man he felt my forearms detecting that i was right handed i felt a loop of leather put about my right wrist and drawn tight it was a double loop drawn through itself and tightened the other end of the closed loop about a foot from my hand was taken in the grasp of a soldier my captor then turned about and began to return to the camp he was followed by his men i was led wristthonged with them i had been captured in a few minutes we approached the camp i was carried across the stream into the camp area many were the torches much was the confusion we encountered there the soldier who carried me put me on my feet i was then again the prisoner of the wrist thong in his grasp a man ran toward us holding up a torch the lady sabina he cried she is gone she has been taken with a cry of rage the leader or captain ran toward the tents his men racing behind him i struggling and gasping jerked and dragged by the thong which held me straight to the pavillion of the lady sabina sped the captain i on the tether accompanying the soldier who controlled me hurried too to that pavillion i was pulled within on the thong a man within turned whitefaced to the captain they came he said they took her to one side lay two soldiers wounded the maids of the lady sabina who had been with her in the tent stood terrified to one side one held her shoulder where there was a large bruise they were here said the soldier pointing to the shuddering slaves what happened demanded the captain one of the girls she with the bruise spoke the back of the tent was slashed in force they came she said many of them we tried to defend the mistress we were buffeted aside they were men warriors we were helpless she pointed to the back of the tent they entered there and withdrew similarly the mistress in their power the application of numbers and power is an element of strategy the men of my master had been outnumbered surely by the many soldiers of the camp but at the point of attack their numbers were superior overwhelming twenty men may breech a wall held by a hundred men if the twenty men but attack where the wall is defended by only two in the confusion as the attention of men had been directed elsewhere the forces of my master though not impressive numerically had been sharply and irresistibly applied his stroke in the context had not been difficult i swallowed hard i realized i had been only a diversion a pawn i felt bitter and terrified of what city were they demanded the captain of one of his wounded men i do not know said the man i had seen the men of my master removing insignia from their garments before the attack we know their direction of flight said one of the soldiers if we act swiftly we may mount satisfactory pursuit let us act with dispatch urged another that we may swiftly overtake them the captain struck at the heavy pole of the tent with the side of his fist the pole though it was deeply anchored shook in the dirt arm the men said he issue bows light rations all men assembly in ten ehn yes captain said a man men left the tent the two wounded men were carried away the captain then turned to face me i shrank back some four men besides the captain remained in the tent one of them he who held my wrist thong the captains hand fixed itself in the sheen of the last veil the fifth veil beneath it my features frightened could be seen it was only a token but when it was torn away even the token would be gone i would stand before men facestripped it is interesting to me how i thought of this at the time doubtless much depends upon context and is relative to the culture on earth few women veil their face and yet many will veil their bodies on earth body veiling tends to be cultural and not face veiling on gor for free women both body veiling and face veiling are cultural and tend to be widely practiced i suppose objectively there is something more to be said for face veiling than body veiling bodies though differing remarkably one to the other tend perhaps to be somewhat more similar than faces accordingly if one should be concerned to protect ones privacy and ones feelings and such it seems that the face might preferably be veiled in the face surely it is easier to read emotion and individuality than in a body should not the face then if one is concerned with concealment and privacy be veiled is the face not more personal and revealing than the body does it not make sense then to consider it a proper object of concealment in a free person is one not entitled so to speak to privacy in the matter of ones thoughts and feelings sometimes so manifest in ones facial expressions however this may be there are congruences and dispositions which seem appropriate in given contexts veils seem correct and right with the robes of concealment too seeing the lust of men to discern your features and understanding what face veiling and unveiling means to them tends to influence ones views of these matters i was terrified that such men see my face i did not want my face to be seen by them in many gorean cities only a slave girl goes unveiled i felt his hand tighten in the veil then he jerked it away i was facestripped completely i closed my eyes with shame i reddened it was as though the last bit of netting mockery of modesty though it might be had been ripped away my face my feelings my emotions now lay bare to them my face though i wore robes of concealment was as naked as that of a slave girl i wonder if you are free my beauty said the captain my mouth now that he had torn away the veil was fully exposed to his nothing now separated his mouth his tongue his teeth from mine from his point of view i then though i might be free might as well have been a slave girl i looked at him release her wrist thong said he to the soldier who held the thong he dropped the thong and it dangled loosely from my wrist a wrist thong scarcely comports with the dignity of a free woman said the captain to me he walked about me as a man walks about a woman i had the feeling he saw me naked beneath the robes are you free my beauty he asked he drew his sword i shuddered are you free he asked he put the sword at my left ankle and curiously lifted the robes of concealment a bit i hope for your sake said he that you are free if you are not i will not be much pleased i felt the blade on my leg lifting up the robes further step from your slippers he said i did so trembling i felt the steel on my leg lifting the robes yet higher they were above my knee now the three slave girls in the tent gowned watched with apprehension the robes were lifted higher some inches above my knee if you are free said the captain you are rather pretty to be free captain said a voice from outside the tent the men are ready i shall join you momentarily he said yes captain said the man the captain then again turned his attention toward me he was angry he spoke softly but menacingly you have made a fool of all of us he said thus i hope that you are free the blade moved a bit higher on the leg i trembled yet said he the leg is not bad it is a leg which is pretty enough to be the leg of a slave girl i wonder if it is the leg of a slave girl he lifted the robes to my hip i felt the steel against my hip the men in the tent cried out with anger the slave girls gasped and shrank back it is as i thought said the captain he stepped back but he did not sheath his sword i will give you twenty ihn said he to remove the clothing of a free woman and to fall naked on your belly before me weeping i tore away the robes frenziedly and stripped threw myself on my belly naked before him he a gorean male he a master i a slave girl standard binding position he said i was prone when a girl is prone the standard binding position is to cross the wrists behind the back and to cross the ankles i took this position instantaneously that i did this did not cause him any pleasure no one in the room thought anything of it i was simply a prone slave girl who had been commanded to standard binding position no one in the room including myself would have expected me to do other than comply lack of compliance by a slave girl to a command in the gorean world is unthinkable she obeys the captain spoke swiftly with two of the men in the room then he spoke too to one of the slave girls who addressed knelt before him she left the tent i could hear the men outside there was some rattle of weaponry the girl who earlier had been beaten and tied at the wagon wheel was brought into the tent she looked at me and went and lay miserable in a corner of the tent the other girl too reentered the tent the captain made ready to depart from the tent to take command of his men i lay there unbound but in binding position i had not moved i did not wish to be slain the captain looked down at me and then as though in response to an afterthought said to one of his men tie her the captains helmet was brought to him i felt my wrists and ankles being tied my wrists were tied with the loop of thong which had bound my right wrist previously when i had been brought to the tent the captain turned me over with his foot then he knelt on one knee beside me i felt the point of his sword in my belly i will see you later said he pretty little kajira i felt the point of the sword push in i winced speak said he yes master i wept a barbarian said one of the men yes said the captain getting up but a pretty one said one of the men the captain regarded me bound at his feet yes he said then he donned the helmet turned and left the tent the other slave girls in the tent save she who had been beaten who lay miserably in a corner of the tent looked angrily at me one rubbed the bruise on her shoulder kajira she hissed i turned to my side in the dirt i wept i lay a captured slave girl in the tent of enemies gone then was the romance of slavery i moaned with misery i had been used to create a diversion had been employed as a mere pawn i had been exposed to danger as though i might have been a mere slave did my master not love me did he not care for me did he not reciprocate the feelings which i had for him i wept an insignificant slave i heard the men leaving the camp then the camp was empty save for the wounded and the slave girls of which i was one dina said the girl with the bruise to me she had called me that because of my brand the dina or slave flower girls who wear the brand are sometimes spoken of as dinas as she had said dina it had been a term of abuse the dina brand is one of the more frequently found of the specialized brands on gor dinas such as i was were relatively common girls the camp was now quiet the bruised girl came over to me dina she said and kicked me then she returned to the other girls our poor mistress cried the girl who had kicked me pity her i heard the sounds of the night outside the tent the insects the cries of fleers surreptitiously for i did not wish to be struck or again kicked i tried to move my wrists and ankles it was useless thongs had been used not rope the knots simple and efficient had been made by a warrior with a minimum of means i was held with absolute perfection a gorean warrior had bound me i heard again from outside the cries of the hookbilled fleer i reared up the slave girls cried out then were silent swords lay at their throats my master was in the tent following his men through the rent silken wall one of the men carried a looped coffle chain with wrist rings master i cried out with elation i struggled to sit up he crouched beside me and with his unsheathed blade slashed apart the leather which bound me i flung myself to his feet pressing my lips to his sandals master i wept with joy he had come back he had not left me but he pulled away from my hands and lips at his sandals and issued orders to his men the four slave maids crouched terrified under swords in the center of the tent including she who had been beaten some men left the tent kneel to be coffled said one of the men the girls knelt closely one behind the other there were six wrist rings on the chain he carried he placed the girl who had been whipped by the lady sabina first in the coffle line left wrist coffle he said they lifted their left wrists frightened interestingly the man snapping the wrist rings on the girls left wrists did not put the first girl in the first ring but the second when the four maids were coffled there was thus an empty wrist ring both at the head and the rear of the line stand slaves said the man lower chain the girls stood then ordered they lowered their wrists they were then in line standing coffled outside i heard bosk being hitched to wagons other bosk i heard being freed and driven into the woods i wondered if the camp would be fired i supposed not for the glow of the burning silk and canvas in the night sky might too soon apprise the camps soldiers of what had occurred an obvious trail had been left for the soldiers to begin to follow then the men of my master had circled about to return to the camp the trail would become difficult to detect then perhaps disappear the men of the camp had not had trained sleen while the pursuing soldiers followed a false scent my masters men returned to their camp from which later in a new direction they might make their departure my master prepared to leave the tent i wanted to run beside him but he would not permit it he pushed me back i must remain within he left the tent the man who had coffled the girls now stood back looking at them may i speak begged the first in the line she who had been earlier whipped yes he said i hate my mistress she said i am ready to love you master do you not enjoy being owned by a woman he asked i want to love a man she wept shameless slave cried the last girl in the line she who had lamented the fate of her mistress and who had called me dina and kicked me i am a woman and a slave cried the first i want a man i need a man do not fear slave grinned the man who had locked her in her wrist ring you will not be neglected when wench service is wished thank you master she said and stood very straight very proudly brazen slave scolded the last girl in the line comb the hair of the spoiled brat of a merchant if you wish said the first i will dance naked before a man slave cried the last girl in the line horrified yes slave said the first angrily proudly i heard a wagon being driven from the camp in it i suspected lay the dowry riches of the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus the location of the lady herself i did not know but i had little doubt she was in a safe place probably blindfolded gagged and chained to a tree somewhere i wondered if she had been permitted to retain her clothing do you have pretty legs asked the man of the second girl in the line yes master she said smiling you are aware he queried of the penalties for lying to a free man examine them master she said smiling boldly it will not be necessary to beat me the last girl in the line cried out with indignation the man with his knife cut away much of the long flowing white gown the girl wore considerably shortening it until it was provocatively high ragged and exciting on her thighs it will not be necessary to beat you he acknowledged thank you master she said the last girl in the line snorted angrily tossing her head in the air do you have pretty legs asked the man of the second gowned girl in the coffle i do not know master she whispered i am only a girls maid let us see said the man and as he had with the first transformed the flowing classic sleeveless garment into a sweet scrap of lovely slave livery may i speak asked the second gowned girl yes he said are my legspretty she asked yes he said a girl is pleased she said she too like the others stood straight how shameless you are all of you scolded she who was the third of the gowned girls in the line the last in the line and you inquired the man i am a womans slave she said proudly i am above such things she did not look at him i have dignity she said but a slave girl is not permitted dignity he said then he said we will see your legs he then with his knife shortened her gown as he had those of the others until its shreds too ragged and exciting were high on her thighs she stood before him her legs though those of a girls maid bared to his eyes excellent legs he said she shuddered but i did not think that she was entirely displeased with his appraisal all women wish to be attractive to men ii want to be a womans slave she said i thought a bit uncertainly do you fear men so he asked she did not speak what you want he pointed out to her is not important he regarded her is it he asked no master she said he touched her about the throat and chin have you never been curious about the touch of a man he asked come to me said the first girl i will love you like you have never been loved before he is touching me cried the last girl wanton slave laughed the first the man then went to the first girl and took her in his arms she cried out with pleasure and pressed herself to him melting and yielding to his tunic and leather he subjected her mouth and lips to a kiss which could have been only the prelude to fierce slave rape i can kiss too cried the last girl master please master no moaned the first girl she is nothing stay with me i am sensuous you do not know what it is to have had a slave girl until you have had me i heard a second wagon being driven from the camp i thought it might be one of the produce wagons but as it later turned out the treasure freight of the dowry wagon had been divided between two wagons the produce in one discarded to lighten the load and make driving swifter my master then reentered the tent rape her later he said to the soldier who held the first girl in the coffle in his arms reluctantly the soldier put the moaning girl from him yes captain grinned the soldier when we are to be raped and must serve you as slaves begged the first girl she who had been in his arms let me be the first to be raped the first to serve you as a slave you will not be forgotten my beautiful little slut he promised her thank you master she whispered do not forget donna either said the second girl nor chanda said the third nor marla said the fourth lehna is first said the first girl the soldier regarded the fourth girl under his eyes she stood very straight in the coffle the wrist ring was closed on her left wrist inflexibly fastening her with the other girls nor marla he asked nor marla she said are you not a womans slave he asked save me a place at your feet master she said i am a mans slave my master walked about the coffled girls then he returned to his original place of stand four beauties said he a good catch we shall have much pleasure with them and then should we choose to sell them we will get a good price how right it struck me that he had said this of the beauties and yet in its way how horrifying to me an earth girl why did these men not hide their dominance why did they not pretend it did not exist why did they not suppress it why did they not thwart and repudiate the birthright of their nature why did they not make themselves miserable why did they not torture themselves and diligently cultivate weakness like the men of earth shortening their lives and praising themselves for the constriction and mutilation of their instincts were they not powerful enough to be manipulated strong enough to be weak coffle her said my master looking at me i stiffened surely the coffle was not for me i was his girl i was not a new slave i had served him well the soldier whistled as though lie might have been summoning a pet sleen and lifted an open wrist ring the last ring on the chain i ran angrily to the chain we must make haste said my master i felt my wrist taken and the metal of the wrist ring snap shut upon it i was coffled how angry i was to be chained with the new girls i felt the chain hanging from my wrist dangling from the wrist ring of the girl coffled before me i was furious i was well fastened i could not escape my master looked down at me i lowered my eyes i wore his chain he turned away from the coffle and moving the slashed silk of the rear wall of the tent with his hand brushing it to the right not looking back disappeared into the darkness marla was not kind to a poor slave when she was helpless said marla the girl before me maria is terribly sorry please forgive maria what i said marla is sorry mistress she said please forgive marla the girl was clearly frightened it seemed strange to me that she had addressed me as mistress and her fear then i realized the legitimacy of her fear that of a slave girl she was the one who had called me dina and who when i had been bound had kicked me now she was owned by my master and she was a newer girl than i she did not yet know the nature of the relationships in which she was now helplessly implicated relationships which could be every bit as perilous and significant as the physical bond of steel on her wrist was i first girl was i over her did i have switch rights upon her body as eta had upon mine would i be cruel to her would i make her suffer would she have to please the masters incredibly and constantly attend them that they might perhaps be moved to shield her to some tiny extent from my vengeance too she was coffled before me and this put her much at my mercy chained as she was i might if i chose make the march a misery of unexpected blows and torments for her her fears in the light of these considerations were understandable i forgive you i told her immediately the girl straightened herself insolently and dismissed me from her awareness she had she assumed then nothing to fear from me and i might be contemptuously ignored this irritated me doubtless she considered herself and quite possibly correctly my superior in beauty and thus planned to soon stand higher in the relationships of bondage than i a lesser girl having nothing to fear from me she would freely and opportunistically insinuate herself among the men slave girls compete for the attentions of masters each strives to be more pleasing to them than the other the quality of a slave girls life is commonly a direct function of her pleasingness to her master whether she is a treasured love slave or an ignored potandfloor wench depends much upon her gorean men unlike the men of earth do not bother much with girls that are not pleasing to them yet even such may find their utility and indirectly serve masters perhaps sweating in the public kitchens of the high cylinders or laboring necklocked at the looms in the cloth mills or digging chained with others in the sul fields it is a rare girl who having tasted the mills or sul fields does not beg her proprietor to be sold again on the open market that she may attempt anew and perhaps more successfully this time to be pleasing to a man i was furious with the posture so proud and sensual of the girl before me i wondered why i had forgiven her it had seemed the natural thing to do i had done it unthinkingly it was not irrational of course for example she was beautiful and any dominance which i might have over her might be temporary and then our relationship might be reversed what if she much pleased my master one night and he gave her switch rights over me also on another march it might be i who would be coffled before her and at her mercy yet i was angry she now ignored me her victory had been cheaply won suddenly angrily i kicked her she cried out startled i stood straight as though i had done nothing the soldier with the coffle who was gathering jewelry into a scarf from various coffers in the tent pretended that he had not noticed my action masters do not much interfere in the squabbles of slaves let them impose their own internal order among themselves on the other hand they would not approve if one slave injured or marked or reduced in value another that would be serious and not to be tolerated the girl before me now no longer stood proudly and sensually she was now only a frightened chained girl at my mercy she was coffled before me on the other hand i said to her i may not forgive you either marla begs forgiveness mistress she whispered i may forgive you and i may not i said yes mistress said the girl she trembled the chain shook on her wrist i was pleased too if she feared me perhaps i could for a time frighten her away from my master she was a lovely female marla and i had little doubt she would be incredibly delicious in the arms of a man i suppose that i was jealous of her the soldier in charge of the coffle slung the scarf loaded with jewelry from the coffers in the tent over his shoulder he grinned at me i looked down and smiled we must make haste slaves said he we readied ourselves i looked at him he was not regarding me he was gorean and a man it was not that he had dared to be a man it was rather that he simply was a man attend me coffle said he for bondage march he held his hand the visible signal of preparation poised over his thigh we tensed but strangely though of earth i did not object to a world in which men like larls were healthy i wanted them that way rich and glorious in their power i sensed perhaps my complementarity to them only in a world where there were true men could there be true women i felt the steel on my wrist with its chain he struck his right thigh with his open hand suddenly sharply we moved out slave girls on the left foot that the pace of the march be uniform we were owned as i passed the soldier who stood behind to follow the coffle to guard it i felt weak i tried to brush my left shoulder against him but he with his hand roughly thrust me to the side he did not then desire my touch i and the others must wait to see if he would permit us to touch him later tears sprang to my eyes i had wanted to touch him and had not been permitted to do so it was his will the will of the man which determined matters harta said he faster lehna who was first girl on the chain hastened suddenly i was terrified my will literally meant nothing anything might be done to me the guard had not permitted me to do so much as brush against him if i could not even placate a man sexually i was completely without power even my attempt to please a man was dependent upon his permission that i should attempt to do so i shuddered i hurrying looked up into the black starlit gorean night i trembled i though a girl of earth was chained in coffle under three barbaric moons harta said the soldier again lehna hastened in moments we were leaving the camp wading the stream i felt the cold water about my ankles and then calves then i felt it over my knees then i felt it swirling at my thighs we lifted the chain to hold it out of the water harta said the soldier he in whose charge we were again we hurried one does not daily under the command of a gorean master i felt the pebbles and stones of the bank beneath my feet the chain pulled forward on my wrist i looked up at the wild moons i was a slave girl harta i heard harta the chain pulled forward again i hurrying stumbled behind the others i did not know into what bondage i was being led i knew only that it would be absolute tabuks ford my master extended his cup to me and i kneeling filled it with sul paga i pressed my lips to the cup and handed it to him my eyes smarted i almost felt drunk from the fumes i withdrew sul paga is when distilled though the sul itself is yellow as clear as water the sul is a tuberous root of the sul plant it is a gorean staple the still with its tanks and pipes lay within the village that of tabuks ford in which thurnus our host was caste leader excellent said my master sipping the sul paga he could have been commenting only on the potency of the drink for sul paga is almost tasteless one does not guzzle sul paga last night one of the men had held my head back and forced me to swallow a mouthful in moments things had gone black and i had fallen unconscious i had awakened only this morning ill miserable with a splitting headache chained with the other girls wine slave girl said maria holding her cup to me angrily i put down the sul paga and fetched the flask of the kalana of ar and filled her cup she did not look at me nor thank me for i was a slave was she not too a slave i saw her in the shreds of her white gown cuddling with her wine in my masters arms she had risen swiftly in favor among the masters displacing even eta as favorite girl i had feared even from the beginning that she would become excessively popular my master was apparently much taken with her i hated her eta too did not regard her with unusual affection marla looked at me and smiled you are a pretty slave she said thank you mistress i said restraining myself since she had become first girl in the camp we were all constrained to serve her and address her as mistress even though she was given no jewelry or fine raiment she was high slave in the camp it had been five weeks since the strike on the camp of the lady sabina much of this time we had been engaged in a long overland journey give me of drink said thurnus to me yes master i said i took the flask of kalana to him thurnus was a shaggy haired fellow with yellow hair big broadshouldered largehanded clearly in his bones and body of the peasants he was caste leader in tabuks ford tabuks ford was a large village containing some forty families it was ringed with a palisade and stood like a hub in the midst of its fields long narrow widening strips which radiated from it like the spokes in a wheel thurnus tilled four of these strips tabuks ford receives its name from the fact that field tabuk were once accustomed in their annual migrations to ford the verl tributary of the vosk in its vicinity the verl flows northwestward into the vosk we had crossed the vosk on barges two weeks ago the field tabuk now make their crossing some twenty pasangs northwest of tabuks ford but the village founded in the area of the original crossing keeps the first name of the locale tabnks ford is a rich village but it is best known not for its agricultural bounty a function of its dark fertile fields in the southern basin of the verl but for its sleen breeding thurnus of the peasants of tabuks ford was one of the best known of the sleen breeders of gor thurnus looked at me and grinned i said give me of drink small beauty he said he emphasized the word drink forgive me master i said and swiftly turned to put back the kalana and fetch the potent sul paga as i turned hurrying suddenly frightening me i realized the tateera had scarcely concealed me this frightened me for i had become much aware in the last few weeks of the capacity of my beauty to excite men eta had told me that i was becoming more beautiful i did not see how this could be yet apparently for no reason i clearly understood i was becoming more provocative and stimulating to men i suspect this had to do with the gradual loss of layers of constriction and inhibition in my movements and attitudes and expressions the sluffing off of modes of impersonality and rigidity in which i had been conditioned since girlhood on earth i now related to men in a much more spontaneous and intensely personal way than once i would have dreamed possible i now saw them as unique exciting masters each different and incredibly individual who might for a word or gesture have me how could i not regard them differently from a free woman and too doubtless they saw me in a similarly immediate and intensely personal fashion not as an object shielded by prejudice and law and fear and pride from them even to touch whom could be a crime but rather as a slave girl vulnerable exposed at their mercy unique in her exact helplessness and individuality the same in some respects as all other bond girls and yet interestingly and profoundly different too from all the others i shared the condition of slavery with other bond wenches but each of us of course as masters know in the depths and complexity of us is a surprisingly and uniquely different individual a latent prize for the chain an astonishment fascinating to learn and subdue i suspect the changes in me at least in part had to do with two things the gradual stripping from me of negativistic earth conditionings and on the positive side the gorean acculturations to which i a bond girl was being exposed i was learning my slavery oddly enough in learning my slavery i was experiencing an incredible sense of psychological freedom and liberation i was liberated from political and economic roles of male impersonation and freed to be myself a woman the major difference in me perhaps however was not behavioral social or cultural but biological the cultural arrangements as such arrangements should or may liberated rather suppressed constricted or thwarted my inner nature my inner nature thus was permitted to open its petals to the rain and sunlight of a clean honest glorious world i was becoming true to myself i think that is it in becoming true to myself too i was becoming happy and as eta once told me it is hard for a woman to be happy and not to be beautiful i approached thurnus with the sul paga and knelt before him but there is danger too in the slave girls beauty as any delight who wears the brand knows as i had naturally inadvertently almost in spite of myself become more desirable and beautiful the sexual aggressions of men against me which i as slave might not resist had become more frequent and powerful sometimes i was merely taken by the hair and thrown to the grass and raped or seized by an ankle and thrown over a log that i might be used for their pleasure or kicked to my knees before them that i might intimately please them i was much at their mercy they found me desirable it is dangerous for a girl to be beautiful on gor particularly if she is a slave the more beautiful and vulnerable she is the more likely it is that her beauty will be seized and dominated and ruthlessly exploited by masters consequently though i loved my apparently increasing beauty and desirability and was incredibly thrilled with it and my new attractiveness i was not unaware that it was attended with risks it was one thing to be raped by my masters men and quite another to know that the same passions which i aroused in them i would similarly inspire in the breasts of complete strangers i was not eager to be slaveraped by strangers which eta assured me was a not uncommon experience for a pretty slave on the other hand i feared slave rape less than abduction i did not want to be carried away it was one thing for a man to hastily use me and discard me it was another to bind me and carry me away to be his own slave i did not wish to leave my master whom i loved thurnus held out his cup i prepared to put sul paga in the cup then he held the cup closer to him i must needs approach more closely exciting men is a price a girl pays for her beauty i was more than willing to pay that price i was joyful to pay that price yet i knew that beauty on a world such as gor was not without its risks i suddenly wished i wore a name collar like eta that would make it clear to whom i belonged my master had not even bothered to put a collar on me i was a collarless slave come closer little beauty said thurnus i crept a bit closer to him on my knees with the paga i wore the scandalously brief torn hooked sleeveless tateera which so displayed a girls charms i feared thurnus i had seen his eyes on me often i poured sul paga into his goblet my head bending quite near to him my hair was longer now than when i had come to gor it was still shorter than that of most slave girls most slave girls wear their hair long and loose though sometimes it is held back with a headband or tied behind the head with a string or ribbon in a ponytail my hair fell before my shoulders over the tateera my master with his lieutenants sat crosslegged in the large thatched hut of thurnus it was high and conical and floored with rough planks set some six or seven feet on poles above the ground that it might be drier and protected from common insects and vermin the entrance was reached by a flight of rough narrow steps the entrances to many of the huts in the village similarly constructed were reached by ladders thurnus was caste leader in the center of the hut was a large flat circular piece of metal on which on legs might sit braziers or the small flattish cooking stoves using pressed hardened wood common in the villages north and west of ar about the walls were the belongings of the house in coffers and bales elsewhere about the village were storage huts and animal pens mats covered the rough planks from the walls hung vessels and leathers a smoke hole in the top of the hut permitted the escape of fumes the hut probably because of its construction was not smoky also though it was windowless and had but one door it was not at this time of day dark through the straw of its roof and sides there was a considerable delicate filtering of sunlight the hut in the summer is light and airy the frame of such a hut is constructed of kalana and tem wood the roof is rethatched and the walls rewoven every third or fourth year in the winters which are not harsh at this latitude such huts are covered on the outside with painted canvas or among the richer peasants with ornamented painted bosk hides protected and glossed with oil the village of tabuks ford lay some four hundred pasangs generally north and slightly west the vosk road was the road used many years ago by the horde of pakur in its approach to the city of ar we had traveled the vosk road after crossing the vosk on barges it is wide and built like a great wall sunk in the earth it is marked with pasang stones it is i suppose given its nature a military road leading to the north broad enough to accommodate war tharlarion treading abreast and the passage two or three side by side of thousands of supply wagons and siege engines without unduly for more than several pasangs extending and exposing the lines of the march such roads permit the swift movement of thousands of men useful either in the defense of borders the meeting of armies or in the expansions of imperialism the conquests of the weak thurnus looked at me you may kiss my cup slave said he i pressed my lips to his cup which he held in his hand i was weak i was a girl i was at the mercy of men on the wall of the hut behind thurnus hung the great bow of supple kalana it was tipped with notched bosk horn it was now unstrung but the string of hemp whipped with silk lay ready looped loose upon the broad curved yellow wood near the bow hung a mighty quiver in which nestled flight and sheaf arrows and many of each thereof such a weapon i could not even bend it required too not simply the strength of a man but of a man who was unusually strong most men no more than a woman could use such a fearsome device it was a common weapon among peasants it is often called the peasant bow the other common peasant weapon is the great staff some six feet in length some two inches in width two such staffs rested to one side inclining upright against the wall between a yellow box about a foot high and a roll of coarsely woven repcloth and do not remove your lips from the cup said thurnus until given permission i kept my lips pressed to the cup my head bent to the side a gorean slave girl dares not disobey thurnus said his free companion a large heavy woman in a repcloth veil kneeling to one side she was squat and heavy she was not much pleased there was a kennel nearby where thurnus kept his girls he did not tend his fields alone be quiet said thurnus to her woman to one side against the wall of the hut there rested on a small table a piece of plain irregularly shaped rock which thurnus years earlier when first he had founded the farm later to be the community of tabuks ford had taken from his own fields he had one morning years ago bow upon his back and staff in hand seed at his thigh after months of wandering come to a place which had pleased him it lay in the basin of the verl he had been driven from his fathers village for his attendance upon a young free woman of the village her brothers arms and legs had he broken the woman had followed him she had become his companion with him too had come two young men and two other women who saw in him the young rawboned giant the makings of a caste leader months had they wandered then following tabuk in the basin of the verl he had come to a place which had pleased him there the animals had forded the river he had not followed them further he had driven the yellow stake of claimancy into the dark soil near the verl and had stood there his weapons at hand beside the stake until the sun had reached the zenith and then slowly set it was then he had reached to his feet and picked up the stone from his own fields it now rested in his hut it was the home stone of thurnus thurnus said his companion he paid her no attention it had been many years ago that she had followed him from the village of her father it had all been many years ago in the fashion of the peasants he kept her she had grown slack and fat she could no longer in honor return to the village of her brother i kept my lips pressed to thurnuss cup he drew the cup more closely to him i must needs follow i knew he had girls he kept in a kennel thurnus was a strong man of the sort who must either have many women or incredibly much from one woman his companion i supposed was tio longer attractive to him or perhaps in the prides of her freedom was too remote to be much in his attention it is easiest for a man to see a woman who is at his feet begging to be seen you are a pretty little slave said thurnus to me i could not speak for my lips were pressed to his cup what is her name asked thurnus of my master she does not have a name he responded oh said thurnus then he said she is a pretty little thing i felt his hand on my leg angrily melina who was the free companion of thurnus of tabuks ford rose to her feet and left the hut i shuddered under the intimate touch of thurnus i could not withdraw from his caress for my lips must needs remain pressed to his cup perhaps we should give her a name suggested marla perhaps said one of the lieutenants looking at me what do you think of stupid girl asked marla the men laughed or clumsy girl she urged better said one of the lieutenants how angry i was at marla and how jealous of her she was a saucy slave had i so spoken so freshly and without permission i might have been whipped she was high slave you are right said my master she is both stupid and clumsy but she is growing in intelligence and in beauty and grace i flushed with pleasure to hear him say this let us give her a name more suitable to a slave girl who one day will perhaps be capable of pleasing men my lips remained pressed to thurnuss cup i could not withdraw from his caress i began to become aroused i was a slave i could not help myself thurnus laughed he then with his peasants humor suggested two names both descriptive both embarrassing my thighs moved how furious i was i was a slave i could not help myself i was furious too at the laughter which greeted thurnuss proposals yet i knew that if i were given either of those intimate obscene names i would have to wear it they would simply be my name let us think further chuckled my master he was clitus vitellius of the caste of warriors of the city of ar i began to move helplessly under the touch of thurnus i could not help myself i was slave my master watched me there is something to be said of course said he for the suggestions of thurnus i moaned with misery but i think said he smiling we may look further i tried to restrain myself to keep from responding to the touch of thurnus i could not do so i thought of elicia nevins who had been my lovely beauty rival in the college on earth how amused the haughty elicia would have been to see me now a half naked slave girl clad in the scandalous tateera her lips pressed to a cup responding so helplessly to a mans touch how humiliated and embarrassed i was to even think of the proud serene contemptuous elicia in my present predicament how pleased i was that she could not see her old rival now thurnus moved the cup a bit closer to him maneuvering me into a yet more helpless position my hands were clenched on the wrist that held the cup i felt the cup with my teeth marla is a pretty name said my master he looked at marla in his arms do you not think marla is a good name for a slave oh yes master she whispered marla is a superb name for a slave she began to kiss him about the throat and chin perhaps i should call her marla said he i knew that in an instant my name might be marla i shuddered but we already have one marla among our girls smiled my master looking down into the beautiful uplifted dark eyes of the lovely marla yes master she whispered i did not know what name i would wear if the nameless slave interests you in the least said my master to thurnus indicating me with his head you may of course do what you wish with her i shuddered a slave girl on gor but said thurnus laughing you have come to examine sleen my master shrugged that is true he admitted let us then waste no more time sporting with slave girls said thurnus but turn our attention to more serious business thurnus looked at me you may remove your lips from the cup girl he said i withdrew my lips from the cup he removed his hand from my body and stood up i knelt on the floor my eyes were wide my teeth were gritted i wanted to scratch at the mats on the floor with my fingernails my master rose to his feet and his lieutenants with him marla angrily pouting put her legs beneath her and knelt we were only girls the men had business there were more important things for them to attend to than us i wanted to roll on the floor and scream i looked at the home stone in the hut in this hut for it was here that his home stone resided thurnus was sovereign in this hut even had he been a lowly man or beggar he because of the presence in it of his home stone was ubar a palace without a home stone is but a hovel a hovel which contains a home stone is a palace in this house this hut this palace thurnuss was the supremacy here he might do as he pleased his rights in this house his supremacy in this place was acknowledged by all guests they shared the hospitality of his home stone had thurnus requested me my master in such a situation would have granted me to him immediately not to have done so would have been inexcusably rude a betrayal a boorish breech of hospitality and good manners yet thurnus though i had little doubt he found me of more than casual interest had not asked for me i wondered if he had in his openness with me been testing my master to learn him better thurnus impressed me as a shrewd man my master had well respected the house of thurnus and his sovereignty within it satisfied then with the acknowledgement of this power which was rightfully his in this house thurnus neither put me to his purposes nor requested of my master his permission to do so a permission which would have assuredly been promptly and willingly tendered having thus certified my masters recognition of his rights he chose magnanimously and nobly as is often done not to exercise them i was after all my masters property in this simple manner these two strong men had shown one another in the gorean mode respect but gorean males i knew in such situations not only respected one another but were often generous with one another in the feast to come tonight eta had warned me there would be a general exchange of slave girls the bond girls of the village being made available to my masters men and his own girls among whom i was one being made available to the young lads of the community we would be run between the huts within the palisade the men prepared to leave the hut my master snapped his fingers and maria sprang to her feet and went out the door of the hut his lieutenants followed her i was on my hands and knees there were tears in my eyes i lifted my hand to my master i am afraid i have aroused your slave said thurnus looking back at me please master i whispered it doesnt matter he said then he turned and went down the stairs let us look at sleen he said thurnus looked at me you are a pretty little slave he said then he too turned and descending the steps left the vicinity of the hut in the hut alone i struck the mats with my fists in a short time one of the men of my master entered the hut he tied my hands behind my back simmer and cook until the feast little pudding he said you will then be well ready clitus vitellius do not run me master wept slave beads i was once a free woman to the line said my master slave beads stumbled to the long line scratched in the in the village of tabuks ford she wore the shreds of what had once been the last undergarment beneath her robes of concealment its sleeves had been torn away it had been rent at the side it had been cut short and later torn even shorter until it hung high upon her thighs exposing even the left hip at the throat it had been ripped open down down to the belly two inches below the navel she was barefoot as is common among slave girls where will we run wailed slave beads to me there is nowhere to run i told her the village was surrounded by a palisade the gate of which was barred i do not want to be run as a slave girl wept slave beads she covered her eyes with her hands stop blubbering said lehna yes mistress said slave beads she was frightened of lehna one of the first things that had been done with her after her branding was to be put in a sirik and given over to lehna for a disciplinary switching my master with his men in a bold coup had several weeks ago stolen the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus from among her retainers on her journey to be joined in companionship to thandar of ti of ti of the four cities of saleria those comprising the salerian confederation the motivation for this abduction as well as the motivation for the companionship originally was apparently political the companionship was to weld commercial and political relationships between fortress of saphronicus and the salerian confederation which was an aggressive and expanding league of cities northeast of the vosk the growing power of the salerian confederation was not viewed with favor by the city of ar which lying in gors northern hemisphere is the major power between the vosk and the cartius and between the voltai range and thassa the sea the ubar of ar whose name is marlenus is said to be an ambitious and brilliant man proud and courageous and imperialistic he might view the salerian confederation as eventually being capable if it continued to expand of posing a threat to ar either to its security or to its ambitions as geopolitical matters now stood a plurality of disunited cities most of them rather small lay scattered in the territories north of the vosk this created for a strong state such as ar defensively a reasonably stable secure border and with respect to her possible ambitions an attractive exploitable power vacuum the growth of the salerian confederation on the other hand might conceivably alter this situation to the detriment of ar if the cities of saleria should multiply and grow strong their power might balance or exceed that of great ar itself armies and tarn cavalries might then move south already only some years ago ar had tasted the bitterness of enemies within her walls when in the political confusion following the temporary loss of her home stone and the deposition of her ubar marlenus there had been a revolt of tributary cities organized and led by pakur master of the caste of assassins the horde of pakur as it is spoken of had set siege to glorious ar initiates inept and cowardly then holding power in ar had surrendered the city an act which to this day in ar has tended to damage the prestige of that caste on the day of ars surrender itself was she saved by the uprising of her very citizens violent in the streets abetted by the forces of certain cities of the north notably koroba and thentis this is told of in the songs one of the heroes in the songs is called tarl of bristol marlenus too is a hero in such songs he later retook the throne of ar following upon the forcible civil overthrew of cernus of ar declared a false ubar he sits now upon the throne of ar he is sometimes spoken of as the ubar of ubars donna and chanda and marla too came to the line in the dirt slave beads stifled a sob marlenus who has seen his city threatened by a league of cities in the time of pakur doubtless views with disfavor the rise of the salerian confederation to be sure at this time it is relatively weak a ubar however must think ahead on the other hand it is commonly suspected the major threat of the salerian confederation is not to ars security but to her ambitions in the person of marlenus the great margin of desolation which once flanked ar on the north just south of the vosk has not been maintained it was a long wall of wilderness an empty unpopulated desertlike area without water and beneficient vegetation a thousand pasangs deep wells were poisoned and fields burned and salted to prevent the approach of armies from the north now however in the last years it has become green new wells have been dug peasants have moved into it this said to be a plan to bring more arable land under cultivation is generally viewed as being an opening of this territory to largescale military passage it is even being stocked with game and wild bosk it retains now of its old character only its name the margin of desolation we had had no difficulty in traversing it on the great road leading south to ar as the margin of desolation no longer an artificially maintained cruel wilderness has flowered it has been said the eyes of ar have been turning north indeed some claim the salerian confederation has grown as well as it has because the cities of the north fear the possible imperialism of ar whatever be the truth of these intricate geopolitical matters it seems clear that marlenus for whatever reason does not see fit to encourage the growth of the salerian confederation eta joined us at the line i looked at slave beads her cheeks were tearstained like the rest of us she was barefoot there was dirt about her ankles clitus vitellius my master was a captain of ar it had been his charge i supposed doubtless placed upon him by marlenus of ar ubar of that city to prevent or disrupt the imminent alliance forming between fortress of saphronicus and the confederation of saleria an alliance to be confirmed and sealed in the companionship of thandar of ti youngest of the five sons of ebullius gaius cassius of the warriors administrator of ti of the salerian confederation and the lady sabina the daughter of kleomenes high merchant of fortress of saphronicus in a bold coup had my master carried off the merchants daughter in a diversion in which i had figured he had struck the camp seized the girl and apparently took flight leaving the beginnings of a trail in short order the warriors of the retinue had set forth upon this trail whilst it was still hot and fresh they safely removed by their own action from the environs of their camp my master had then returned to the camp to seize as well the dowry and beauteous maids of the lady sabina lehna donna chanda and marla we had been coffled by the left wrist and hurried into the night on the track of the two wagons in which the lady sabinas dowry divided had been placed less than a pasang from the camp we had come to a small tree the lady sabina in her robes of concealment stood with her belly to this tree her wrists fastened about it locked in the steel of slave bracelets her veils lay about her shoulders her head was concealed in a slave hood buckled under her chin the construction of this hood was such that it served not only as blindfold but gag as well the wadding being sewn to the inside of the hood and it being held in place by laces emerging through eyelets tying behind the back of the neck such hoods are often used in the abduction of women either slave or free their efficiency and convenience mandates their use regardless of the legal or social status of the girl on whom they are placed i had noted that her gloves had been pulled down over her fingers that the steel of the slave bracelets close on the wrist itself experienced captors for greater security seldom place bonds over clothing hose would be removed or pulled down for example before a girls ankles would be tied a guard was with the lady sabina to protect her in the event of the arrival of prowling sleen her retinue was even now hurrying down a false trail in the opposite direction an open wrist ring stood at the head of our coffle chain the place in the line before lehna my master had unbuckled and unlaced and pulled away the stiffing degrading hood beneath it of course the lady sabina had been facestripped she turned her face away that we be unable to look upon it my master to my pleasure simply took her by the hair and turned her face brazenly to all of us exposing and baring it to all of us for our full gaze she twisted but hurt could not turn her face away he held it before us letting us savor it for a full ehn then after an ehn he released her hair she sobbed she regarded us angrily but no longer did she try to hide her face it was pointless now to do so my master had not seen fit to tolerate her game of modesty she had been facestripped publicly my master stepped to where she might more clearly see him in the moonlight who are you she said he did not respond to her i am the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus she said beware the veils by a man behind her were lifted from about her shoulders and dropped to the ground return my veils she said the veils lay fallen gently upon the ground i am the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus she said my master did not speak to her who are you she demanded you wear no insignia on your tunics who are you she pulled at the slave bracelets the chain scraped at the bark beware my wrath she said my master gave a sign and a man from behind lifting her feet one by one slipped her sandals from her she then stood barefoot her small feet in the crushed leaves and twigs at the foot of the tree she shuddered she was a rich spoiled girl i supposed she had never been barefoot out of doors before who are you she whispered no longer was she arrogant she was now afraid commonly slaves go barefoot your captor said my master speaking to her for the first time i will bring a high ransom she said he put his thumb under her chin and pushed up her head she was the veils gone a delicately featured beautiful girl her head was up painfully high his thumb under her chin she had a lovely throat he was perhaps considering in what sort of collar it might look best her hair was dark i could not tell its color in the light the lady sabina i supposed was more beautiful than i but i did not think she was more beautiful than her maids as a slave she would be less than they on most blocks keep me for ransom warrior she said frightened i think she knew her face and throat were being assessed as might have been those of a slave he removed his thumb from under her chin it would be irrational not to keep me for ransom she said my ransom will be far higher than any price you could realize on me in a market this was surely true though it was true too she was quite beautiful surely said she you did not attack my retinue merely to carry off a girl to wear your collar no said my master there is of course the matter of the treasure dowry of course she said she now breathed more easily you are common bandits she said then she said you have done well stout fellows your loot is valuable the dowry is immense and rich and i too in ransom will bring you much more even than the dowry you have so boldly taken but return to me now my veils and my sandals too for my ransom surely will be less if it understood my modesty has been so grievously compromised your boldness for the honor of my name and the security of your skim may remain our secret the lady sabina is generous said my master i ask only said the lady sabina that you not let me fall into the hands of those of ar ah lady said my master there you see lies your true value what do you mean she inquired apprehensively we have a long trek ahead of us said my master we must move through brush and woods and over fields you must be attired for such a journey in a more practical fashion what are you going to do she cried he slipped her gloves from her fingers what are you going to do she cried we have a long journey ahead of us he said he then with his knife to her horror cut away her cumbersome robes of concealment until she was clad only in the last of her undergarments he then ripped the sleeves from the undergarment and they hung about her wrists loose kept from falling by her wrists and the slave bracelets confining her at the tree sleen she cried sleen he then too with his knife and ripping in a ragged circle about her legs above the knees shortened the undergarment her calves might now be seen they were pretty sleen she cried he then upon this outburst casually ripped away a large piece of the garment stripping her to the thighs and on the left side when he discarded the piece of material to the hip her outburst had earned her only more exposure she was now as leg stripped or more than donna chanda and marla lehna who had been stripped for her switching at her mistresss hands in the camp and i who had been stripped by the captain at the camp were nude the lady sabina i noted had lovely legs she seethed at the tree she pulled at the bracelets tearing at the bark of the tree i think now said my master standing back regarding the girl and his work that that constitutes a far more practical traveling costume than the robes of concealment for a long overland journey afoot do you not agree lady sabina my clothing she said return it to me she tried to be stern he upon this remark casually from an inch or so below her left armpit ripped the garment open to an inch or so above her left hip the line of her left breast seen from the side and the sway of her left hip were lovely insolent sleen she cried then she shrank back in terror no she said my masters hands were at the collar of the garment no she begged he ripped it open to two inches below her navel she regarded him with horror do you have any further objections to your traveling costume he inquired his hands were now at the shoulders of the garment whence it might be simply torn from her no captor she said he turned to us and motioned us forward the five girls in the coffle we approached you will note lady sabina said my master that the first wrist ring of the coffle is empty it has been reserved for you he lifted the open wrist ring on its chain my ransom will be high she whispered one of the men laughed the girl regarded him frightened i ask only she said that i not be permitted to fall into the hands of those of ar may i introduce myself lady sabina inquired my master yes she said he thrust the slave bracelet on her left wrist up he placed the opened wrist ring about her left wrist below the left slave bracelet i am clitus vitellius he said no she cried i gathered from the way in which she had cried out that my masters name was not unknown upon this world not the captain of ar she moaned there are many captains in ar lady sabina smiled my master she put her cheek against the bark of the tree few such as clitus vitellius she said i felt proud of my master how marvelous to be the girl of such a man my master snapped shut the wrist ring about the left wrist of the lady sabina we were now chained to her and she to us she was now of the coffle as were we what are you going to do with me she asked i am going to take you to my secret camp and there under the iron brand you a slave girl you will then be taken to the city of ar and from an unimportant block in a cheap market sold to the highest bidder the girl pressed her cheek against the rough bark of the tree and moaned and wept staining the bark with her tears at a sign from my master the man who had been her guard freed her of the slave bracelets she now led the coffle am i not to be ransomed she said you are too politically valuable to be ransomed he said i recalled that the lady sabina was valuable indeed her companionship with thandar of ti of the city of ti of the salerian confederation was to result in an alliance between fortress of saphronicus and the confederation the companionship of course was political the lady sabina and thandar of ti according to eta had never seen one another the companionship being arranged by their parents and the councils of their respective cities in such a companionship the lady sabina would have raised caste and become one of the high ladies of ti and of the confederation she had been looking forward it was well known with enthusiasm to her attaining this high station accordingly said my master it is expedient in the affairs of states that you be rendered politically valueless the lady sabina at the head of the coffle moaned as a slave she would indeed be politically valueless she could be exchanged or bought and sold for whatever masters might wish the slave is not a person before gorean law but a rightless animal do not enslave me captain she said keep me and sell me to the confederation free returned to them i will be worth immense riches to you you and your men if you return me to the confederation will become rich beyond your wildest dreams do you ask me lady inquired my master to betray ar she suddenly sank to her knees in terror before him would she be instantly slain no captain she whispered considering your future status said my master you may begin now to address free men by the title of master the experience and the practice will do you good yes she said master behind you lady sabina said my master you will note a slave girl lehna yes master she said earlier this evening said my master you much and richly switched her yes master said the lady sabina give lehna a switch said my master to one of his men lehna beamed she was given a switch lehna said my master should the lady sabina daily or in any way attempt to delay the coffle it will be your charge to hasten her yes master said lehna i did not envy the lady sabina i am sorry i switched you lehna said the lady sabina lehna struck her savagely across the back with the switch and the lady sabina whose thin undergarment shielded her from the blow scarcely at all cried out with misery she could not believe the sting of the stripe it was i conjectured the first time in her life she had ever been struck lehna she cried address the girls as mistress ordered my master standing over the kneeling free girl yes master she said lehna again savagely struck the kneeling girl please do not strike me mistress wept the lady sabina my master turned away to speak to his men in a few moments he not looking back strode away through the trees followed by the majority of his men in single file one man remained behind to follow the coffle some yards to the rear on your feet lady sabina cried lehna the lady sabina leapt to her feet with a rustle of chain you will take your first step with your deft foot said lehan upon my signal later you will learn to walk gracefully and beautifully in chains that is too much to expect now from an ignorant girl yes mistress said the lady sabina are you ready noble lofty lady sabina inquired lehna i am sorry i switched you mistress said the lady sabina do not fret my dear said lehna i will see that you are well repaid please mistress cried the lady sabina were you given permission to speak in coffle asked lehna no mistress moaned the lady sabina lehna then struck her twice cruelly with the switch do you think me weak lady sabina inquired lehna no no wept the lady sabina lehna then struck her again you are right she said i am not weak the lady sabina wept stand straight said lehna straighter she poked the lady sabina with the switch the lady sabina then choking back her tears stood straight in the coffle the posture accentuating the lovely lines of her chained beauty i smiled she stood as straight as desirably as beautifully as a slave girl on the left foot on my signal said lehna yes mistress said the lady sabina now said lehna crying out striking her with a cry of misery the lady sabina moving first on her left foot stumbled forward faster said lehna hitting her again yes mistress cried the lady sabina we hurried on then swiftly through the mixed shadows and moonlit trees following the men our masters i do not want to be run for the pleasure of boys wept slave beads be silent slave girl snapped lehna yes mistress said slave beads the girls of clitus vitellius i among them stood at the line scratched in the dirt within the peasant village of tabuks ford some four hundred pasangs to the north and slightly to the west of ar some twenty pasangs off the vosk road to the west the young lads of the peasantry eyed us with pleasure we were all vital lithe beauties and most excitingly slaves it was not everyday that such girls the girls of a warrior would be run for their pleasure our bondage meant that we must once captured be marvels for them there was discussion of the rules of the hunt too bets were being taken some of the young men came to the line to look us over at closer hand oh said slave beads one of the lads had put his hand on her leg good stock said one of the boys yes agreed another another young lad strapping put his hands on me i tried to pull away a bit but i did not much resist i was a slave and did not wish to be whipped on the other side of donna marla stood her head in the air seeming not to notice the hands of the boys upon her i looked over at slave beads she was crying her head was in her hands two peasant lads one standing one crouching were by hand and eye appraising her flesh they did this with the same attention and innocence that they would have brought to the examination of any other domestic animal the two boys then moved on to me i closed my eyes they were not gentle i was examined with less respect being a slave than would have been accorded to a bosk heifer i wanted to tear at their eyes with my fingernails but i did not wish to be whipped or slain it is not surprising that the gorean slave girl is obedient those who are not obedient are often destroyed i was terribly afraid then that i had even felt a momentary impulse to rebellion i shook with terror did i think i was still on earth did i not know i was now on gor i shuddered rebellion is not permitted to the gorean slave girl the boys continued to examine me tears formed in my eyes there is a mock rebellion which is sometimes permitted a slave girl or even commanded of her for the masters amusement i felt a tear on my cheek show rebellion is a command which a girl must as any other obey yet it is a terribly cruel command kneel is the command which commonly puts an end to her rebellion when a girl has been permitted defiance it is then all the sweeter i gather to bring her again to her knees before you suffice it to say the girl belongs to her master completely i opened my eyes the young men moved on to donna you are crying said slave beads to me i shook my head and hair it is nothing i said i stood on the line how far i had come from earth i thought i was sensitive and a poetess now i stood on a dirt line in a peasant village on an alien world no longer the free judy thornton but rather now only a nameless halfnaked slave girl waiting to be run for the pleasure of boys i understood little of what had happened to me i did not know how it was that i had come to this world i did not know in a sense who i was or what i was supposed to do i smiled to myself i did know i belonged to clitus vitellius a captain of ar in the belly of me though i would scarcely admit this to myself i did not object he was such a man from the line i glanced back to the open fires where he sat with men of the village thurnus caste leaders peasant and sleen master among them i shook with pleasure as i stood on the line and looked at clitus vitellius within the tateera my thighs even looking at him were hot and damp he did not notice me and was talking to thurnus he was the sort of man who would set his terms for a woman even a free woman no woman even one who was free would be permitted to relate to him save on his terms and on his terms alone he would not argue nor would he discuss nor persuade nor negotiate to the free womans horror she would understand that she must as he saw fit submit herself as hopelessly and willlessly as a slave girl for his consideration he would enter into no relationship except on his own terms his terms were simple that the woman be yielded to him totally that she be as much his and as helplessly though by her own free will as any slave girl on whom he might choose to fix his collar he would be even in a companionship to the scandal of ar master no woman who failed to meet these understood publicized and wellknown terms would be acceptable i looked at my master sitting crosslegged by the fire talking with thurnus yet hundreds of the highborn free women of ar many rich had avidly sought companionship with clitus vitellius i did not blame them had i been a free woman of ar i too would have sought such companionship to have such a man as clitus vitellius i would have accepted his terms so too i think would have any true woman surely it is better to have a true man on any terms than to have half a man or no man at all men are masters if the man be strong the woman must submit given the opportunity to relate to a true man few women will settle for less indeed true women in the belly of them desire to submit to true men it is an ancient instinct bred into the bellies of beautiful feminine women remove your clothing would my master say to a highborn free woman suing to be considered by him in companionship she would do so and be assessed if he was not pleased he would send her weeping from his presence clutching the rag of a slave to don it and return to her dwelling if he was not displeased he would gesture to the tiles before him where there waited a goblet of slave wine which she kneeling before him would eagerly drink she would serve him that night as a slave in the morning she nude would prepare and serve to him his breakfast after which he would make fresh use of her he would then send her from his presence first pressing into her hand a coin usually a copper tarsk or a silver tarsk commensurate with the quality of her service such women went from his quarters proudly clad in the full regalia of the free woman they were not discontent they had been touched by clitus vitellius some women claimed that they had earned from clitus vitellius a tarn disk of gold such a coin would buy several girls such as myself sometimes a girl rather than be sent from his presence would beg to be kept as a collared slave she would then sign a document of enslavement which after her signature was affixed she would be powerless to alter or break for she would then be only a slave clitus vitellius would commonly keep such a girl for a few days and then discard her usually giving her to a friend or selling her i wondered if such a girl braceleted and pulled away from him on her leash regretted her choice she was then in bondage subject to chains and the whip and the will of men what had she then to look forward to but the degradation of the sales block being exposed to men as a slave and being vended in a public market being owned by a succession of hard masters accustomed to the management of girls such as she onerous work and strict discipline and the continuous exploitation of her body and service perhaps for a woman the thrill of being owned and commanded of being at the absolute mercy of a powerful man knowing that she must obey him and experiencing if she be fortunate incredible helpless incomparable love of the sort which can be felt only by a completely rightless woman fully and absolutely owned by a man in his total bondage but such thoughts would not be likely to be prominent in the mind of a leashed girl helplessly braceleted being dragged to her first sale i looked at my master how magnificent he was his collar i had heard was one of the most sought collars in ar when he strode through the streets free women sometimes threw themselves before him tearing away their veils and robes begging for his collar he was such a man ones freedom is small enough price to pay whisper some highborn women of ar among themselves for even ten days in the collar of clitus vitellius the boredoms of freedom are small enough price to pay surely for even a brief sojourn in the arms of such a man they conjecture but such women i told myself must be natural slaves even though they be legally free as i was not if they are natural slaves i asked myself should they not be made slaves why should one who is a natural slave not be a slave can it be wrong to enslave a natural slave is it not right that natural slaves be enslaved is it not what they want i looked at my master what woman i asked would not be the natural slave of such a man he was a natural master any woman i suspected to such a man would be a natural slave almost any woman i suspected looking on such a man would sense herself his natural slave that would explain why the women of ar would twist on their couches like bitches in heat thinking of clitus vitellius in the darkness remembering him his stride his glance and limbs they would have intuited him as their master prepare to run slaves called a peasant i looked at my master the heat in my thighs made me want to run to him but i dared not leave the line earlier in the afternoon casually thurnus had aroused me and no one had satisfied me i had spent the afternoon in a slave girls misery i wanted to run to my master i dared not leave the line i looked at my master i wondered if i though a girl of earth were a natural slave how i wanted him to have me clitus vitellius in spite of the desires of the women of ar had never taken a companion i did not think he ever would he was clitus vitellius he would have slave girls instead he would always keep his girls in collars i loved him when the torch is lowered called a peasant lifting up a torch lit from the fire you will run yes master we said to him the torch will then be placed in the earth he said when it is fixed in the soil you will have two hundred beats of a slave girls heart he pointed to a peasants slave who stood nearby she was a girl of peasant stock who had been two years ago stolen by slavers from a village hundreds of pasangs to the west thurnus had purchased her in ar and brought her on a rope behind his wagon to tabuks ford she was thickankled and blondhaired a goodlooking widehipped blueeyed strapping girl one of my masters men stood behind her his left hand on her left arm his right hand about her body was thrust through her brief woolen tunic he would count the beats of her heart she was barefoot about her throat looped twice knotted was a length of coarse rope i looked at the rope it was snug on her throat it was thus that thurnus marked his girls i conjectured that the heart of such a girl would be slow and strong you will then be sought said the peasant counting the time it would take to fix the torch in the earth and for her heart to beat two hundred times i conjectured that we would have a lead on our pursuers of some three minutes i looked at the girl her lips were slightly parted this angered me she was excited by the hand of my masters man on her flesh she backed slightly against him her heart would now be beating more rapidly she was after all a girl in bondage like us why did they not take a hundred beats of the heart of a standing bosk her sexual excitement at the proximity of my masters man might i now noted considerably diminish our lead i decided to count now on a lead of little more than two minutes moreover she was to be his for the night once he had counted upon her body using her beating heart as the clock of the evenings sport it was no wonder that she was excited this did not seem to me to be fair but i did not complain the men decide what is fair or unfair and will in any case do precisely as they please it is the girls part to abide by their decision the men decide the girl submits one must be master one slave eta was to my far right on the line then came maria and donna i stood on the dirt line between donna and to my left slave beads to her left was chanda and on the far left was lehna i do not want to be run for peasant boys said slave beads i was once free i too was once free i told her you are slave now said slave beads so too are you i snapped does slave beads wish to be switched again called lehna no mistress said slave beads hastily slave beads feared lehna for most practical purposes she had been put in the charge of lehna almost from the first moments of her capture she was commonly chained before lehna in the coffle and it was under lehnas supervision that she commonly performed her tasks after the capture of the lady sabina we had returned to the secret cache camp to which my master had originally brought me his barbarian girl at the cache camp the first night of our arrival the lady sabina had been stripped and thrown on her back head down on the inclining whitebarked tree trunk to which she had then been as i had been before her helplessly roped when the iron had been pulled from her burned marked flesh she had been rendered as was the intention of my master and those in ar politically valueless she was then only a slave she was unroped and thrown a bond girl to the feet of my master we must name you he said sabinasabina said he as though musing on the thought ah had he then said it seems that you in your former name carried already an excellent slave name oh no no master she wept your former name said he was clever it appears to be the name of a free woman and yet within it in disguise which we now penetrate it concealed secretly your true name very clever slave but now you are discovered and you will openly wear your true name that which will perfectly fit you and which i now in the decree of the master make yours please master she wept you are bina said he she put her head in her hands and wept the expression bina in gorean means slave beads put slave beads in a sirik said my master swiftly my masters new girl was locked in the light gleaming sirik the collar clasped her throat a chain dangled from the collar her small wrists were locked in the slave bracelets fixed on the dangling chain and the dangling chain itself looped down to a short chain and pair of ankle rings to which it was gracefully fastened at a sliding ring the ankle rings were then closed about the lovely ankles of slave beads and locked she was helpless in sirik the confinement became her she was beautiful i had never worn sirik she knelt before my master naked in sirik she looked up at him her thigh freshly branded bore the common slave mark of gor the initial letter in cursive script of the gorean expression kajira which means slave girl she trembled she was now no different from thousands of other girls who shared her condition that of total bondage greetings slave beads said my master greetings master she said responding to her name as she must my master looked down at her and smiled she looked up at him trembling he was her master perhaps you remember slave beads said my master that on an evening some days ago a free woman harshly and at length punished a slave girl you know she asked we observed in scouting the camp said he he looked down at the kneeling girl locked in the sirik the beating was well done said he thank you master she whispered the crime of the slave girl as i recall said my master was to desire the touch of a man lehna stood to one side she stood straight as an exciting slave girl yes master said slave beads the free woman said my master was doubtless well within her rights to beat the girl yes master said slave beads but that free woman said my master has since that time herself fallen slave indeed she is now in this camp yes master said slave beads the slave girl whom she beat is too in this camp said my master yes master said slave beads she trembled in the sirik do you yourself desire the touch of a man asked my master oh no no master cried slave beads ah said my master it seems that in this camp we have a slave girl too who is guilty of a crime who master asked slave beads you said he not i she cried you said he what is my crime she asked not to desire the touch of a man said he she looked at him aghast you see said he in this camp it is a crime for a girl not to desire a mans touch my master turned to one of his men bring lehna a switch he said he turned again to slave beads you will be well punished for your crime slave girl said he i am ready master said lehna do not forget this beating said my master you are to desire men further it will be well for you to learn what it is to be a beaten slave girl what you did to lehna she will now do to you perhaps you will then have a richer understanding of what it was truly that you did to her perhaps you will regret that you were not a kinder mistress she will regret it master promised lehna licking her lips i will now leave you to the tender mercies of lehna said my master let us hope that in the future your masters and mistresses will be kinder to you than was the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus to her slaves do not leave me with her master cried slave beads she will kill me she will kill me it is not impossible said my master he turned to leave then turned again to face the kneeling terrified slave beads it is my hope too said he that this beating will prove a useful initiation for you given your antecedents and nature into the condition of slavery he looked at her sternly yes master she said looking up at him after your beating he said you will be asked again if you desire the touch of men i trust then your answer will be affirmative if it is not you will be again beaten and again throughout the night my answer will be affirmative master whispered slave beads my master then turned away from her and so too did we all leaving her with lehna later my master took slave beads by the hair do you now desire the touch of men he asked yes yes yes yes yes master she wept she was then released from the sirik go to the men said my master yes master she said she crawled to the men on her hands and knees she extended her hand to one of them and looked up at him with tears in her eyes please touch slave beads master she begged he took her by the hair and pulled her into the darkness we did not retire that night until slave beads on her knees had begged the touch of each of my masters men he himself was the last to grant her plea when he had finished with her he put her again in the sirik and threw her to the wall of the cliff eta went to her and putting a repcloth blanket about her held her and comforted her poor slave said eta i and the other girls went to sleep run cried the man lowering the torch i and the other girls sped scattering from the dirt line some fifty yards from the line in the darkness between the straw huts on their pilings i stopped and wild gasping in the tateera looked back already the torch had been fixed in the ground the slave girl who wore the rope of thurnus on her throat as a collar leaned back against the man of my master her head was back on his shoulder her eyes were closed his hand was tight on her body counting the beats of her heart he was calling the count but i could not hear him i looked wildly about and then ran further through the huts down the long corridor between them then my hands were pressed against the smooth logs of the palisade surrounding the village i pressed my body and cheek against the wood i stepped back and hands on the wood looked up the pointed tops of the palings were eight feet over my head i turned about my back to the logs and looked back down the narrow dirt street i could see the fire in the villages clearing its light on the faces of the men about it i saw the boys getting to their feet eagerly there is no place to hide wept slave beads who was near me we are slaves i snapped at her we are meant to be caught i saw some of the boys spitting on their hands and wiping them on their thighs this would improve their grip the flesh of a girl would be less likely to slip from their hands more than one of them i knew wanted me bets had been taken on who would bring me as his slave for the night to the ring drawn about the torch as they had too on the other girls a big redhaired fellow and a smaller darkhaired fellow had bet on which of them would take slave beads i saw chanda creeping into a hut slave beads turned away from me and fled about the interior perimeter of the palisade i followed her and then darted among the huts i almost died of fear when suddenly i heard not feet from me a bedlam of vicious snarling i cried out my hand before my mouth dozens of vicious eyes blazed at me from behind the stout bars of a sleen pen one of several in the village snouts and teeth pressed at the bars i stumbled back i ran again i did not see marla or eta nor lehna slave beads too had fled elsewhere i did see a white ankle not covered by a piece of canvas it was donna you had best cover this ankle or you will be soon found slave girl i said angrily jerking the canvas over it donna shrank even smaller covered by the canvas she trembled beneath it her head down under her hands she was slender smallbreasted and lovelylegged she had dark eyes dark hair the name donna is an earth name but the girl as i had determined was gorean many gorean names as words in the gorean language apparently have an earth origin her original name had been tais she had been a slave since the age of eight but it had not been until she was seventeen that she had been judged fit for men and then branded donna in the beginning had been a block name girls are usually sold under a name it being easier then for the auctioneer to refer to them too for some reason the intensity of the bidding often increases when a named girl is being vended it makes i suppose the buying and selling much more exciting and personal see generous buyers the flesh of donna is donna not beautiful stand straight donna what am i bid noble buyers for donna the original donna had perhaps been a girl brought in a chain and collar from earth her name finding favor with masters considering it a lovely slave name would then have been given from time to time to other girls perhaps some gorean perhaps some like herself of earth origin tais was too fine a name for a slave accordingly the lovely seventeenyearold gorean girl had been sold in koroba under the block name of donna a slave name calculated to excite gorean buyers many earthgirl names incidentally on gor are regarded as slave names gorean males commonly regard the women of earth as fit only to be their slaves but donna though she had been adjudged fit for men and branded was sold from the block in koroba to a visiting merchant kleomenes of fortress of saphronicus who took her with him and gave her to his spoiled daughter the lady sabina as a womans slave donna had been a virgin until she was raped in the coffle on the first night of the march by two of my masters men she had been had from time to time since then but marla eta and surprisingly i had been the most consistently abused of the girls of clitus vitellius the more beautiful i had become the more often i had been raped and the more i had been raped the more beautiful i had become i think that i understood the problem of donna she feared men the slave girl must surely if she is rational fear men but too she must regard them as potentially constituting for her sources of incredible pleasure donnas timidity and lingering uncertainty with men i think was largely a function of her fear that she might not be capable of giving them pleasure it is one thing to be thrown down and raped it is quite another to hear the indolent command please me the responsibility for pleasure is often placed on the slender lovely shoulders of the slave girl it is she then who must labor in her bondage to be pleasing as soon as i had understood that the quality of my life on gor given my brand would depend on my ability to please men i had begged eta to give me instruction she had been extremely helpful teaching me many things i might never have discovered myself she had actually received some weeks of slave training in the pens of ar a tutelage to which clitus vitellius in disgust at her ineptness had remanded her she had attended diligently to her lessons when she returned to his quarters it had been clear by morning that it would not be necessary to sell her off she had made an acceptable beginning in learning the arts of the slave girl these arts it might be mentioned are intricate and diverse and are complex and rich in many modes and dimensions most obviously they are domestic sexual and psychological too they are culinary kinetic cosmetic and artistic like the painter and the musician the slave girl need never stop growing in her art which is the creation of beauty and joy for herself and her master i had swiftly sought slave instruction donna had not perhaps i was more practical than she perhaps rather i was simply a slave and she was not i was of earth the men of gor regard the women of earth as natural slaves perhaps i was a natural slave that might be the difference between donna and myself yet i suspected that if i were a natural slave so too were all women donna i was sure would learn her slavery she was beautiful she would come around it requires only the right master to bring out the slave in any woman i heard a shout from the center of the camp the hunters were now in pursuit do not be afraid donna i said to her you will not be beaten or much beaten you will not truly have to serve these are only peasant boys and will not know one end of a slave girl from the other then i fled from her side through the spaces between the dark huts i hoped that what i had said to donna was true i was sure that the peasant boys indeed would not know much of the handling of slave girls doubtless they would lack the patience and skill to get all from a girl i did not think for example that they would know how to force me into the slave girls humiliating submission ecstasy on the other hand i regarded them with genuine fear they could well hurt me i remembered their roughness and the way they had with brutal exactness appraised my flesh i was so much smaller and weaker than they and their lust would be on them they could well be terribly brutal with me i was to them after all only an animal they might hurt me they might throw me about among them they might beat me with ropes if i were not pleasing to them i heard a young man running by i shrank back in the shadows crouching among the pilings of a hut i did not want them to catch me i was locked within the palisade there was no place to hide i heard a girl scream far to my right they had taken one of us i did not know whom i did not want a rope put on my throat i did not want to be dragged to the circle of the torch a caught girl two young men came by with torches i hid back among the pilings shortly after they had passed the sleen in a pen some fifty yards off began to squeal and hiss they ran toward the pen something had disturbed the sleen perhaps it was a girl two more young men were approaching one holding aloft a torch again i shrank back among the pilings holding my breath they passed i saw them stop beside a hut several yards away the one lifted the torch it illuminated what appeared to be a pile of canvas they stood there one on each side of the pile it almost at their feet cruelly they stood there not moving donna would know that their footsteps had approached they had not departed she must surely fearfully suspect that her position was known yet she did not know for certain how miserable she must have felt huddling beneath the canvas how tense and terrified how apprehensive cruelly they stood as they were not moving for almost a minute she could hear the crackle of the torch did they know where she was were they playing with the beauty tormenting her longer yet did they stand there and then exchanging glances one of them with a sudden loud cry pounced on the pile of canvas shrieking with misery donna was lifted by one ankle and an arm high into the air over the head of the boy who had seized her he held her over his head she struggled held from the ground high helpless her lovely limbs without leverage capture cried the boy capture cried another lad coming from the direction of the sleen pen where the sleen shortly before had hissed and squealed revealing their agitation he held lehna before him his left hand on her left arm his right hand on her right wrist forcing her right arm high painfully behind her back he pushed her before him so held her gown had been pulled down about her hips she grimaced with pain her head back please master she wept lehna was a larger woman than i she was strong among us girls slave beads lived in terror of her but in the arms of a male even a lusty boy she was slight and helpless small to them only another pretty slave girl in their power i bit my lip men were our masters with the boy who had captured lehna came four others two with torches the boy who had captured donna had now thrown her belly down across his left shoulder her head hung down behind his back his left arm heavy brawny locked her in place let us see your catch said one of the newly arrived boys tie her ankles said the lad who held donna over his shoulder one of the other boys who carried a tenfoot length of rope with one end of the rope crossed and tied together donnas ankles while she was still held on the shoulder of her captor who is your master of the night inquired lehnas captor of lehna he thrust her right wrist higher behind her back you you master she cried you are my master of the night ankle leash her said the lad who held lehna another lad tied a tether on her left ankle the ankle leash is cruel it provides effective control of a girl there is much that can be done with such a leash particularly in the control of a skillful master most obviously in an instant the girl may be thrown to his feet in a variety of positions over which he exercises choice the lad who had captured donna now that her ankles were tied heaved her with a laugh over his shoulder she landed in the dirt behind him she broke her fall as best she could with her hands the long end of the rope which bound her ankles trailed her over his shoulder her captor took the end of the rope from the lad who had bound her and holding it about a foot from her fastened ankles pulled her feet some six inches into the air she was lying on her stomach there is my catch he said then he said to donna roll over she rolled onto her back her tied feet now held about a foot off the ground by the rope there my friends beamed her captor is my catch a beauty said one of the boys yes a beauty said her captor he was proud of donna i did not blame him she was indeed beautiful donna was a marvelous catch i want her said one of the lads first capture rights are mine said the lad who had caught donna but i am generous and will share my prize with all of you there was hearty acclaim among the lads upon the receipt of his welcome intelligence donna squirmed but was helpless on her back her feet bound held in the air by the captors tether what of my prize demanded another lad he who had caught lehna by the sleen pen he now held her ankle leash and stepped back bowing and displaying the halfstripped lehna with an expansive gesture she too i was forced to admit was a superb prize such boys did not have such girls everyday she was a warriors belonging how can we tell if she is pretty asked one of the boys thusly said one tearing away the bit of gown about lehnas hips there was laughter she was very beautiful but she is standing protested the first lad belly or back asked lehnas captor both cried more than one lad expertly with the ankle leash the lad displayed lehnas beauty in the luscious modes of horizontality some goreans say that a womans beauty can only be fairly judged when she lies at a mans feet more than one of the lads cried out with pleasure and slapped his thigh donna then screamed as the boys turned to her her gown too was torn off her ankles were still tied to the circle of the torch cried a lad on your feet wench said the lad who had captured lehna she scrambled to her feet covered with dirt three have yet to be caught said a lad i knew one girl had been caught early i had heard a scream some time ago i did not know who she was now i knew that lehna and donna were in the power of the pursuers if only three remained to be caught then one other girl somewhere had also been captured i did not know who she was either let us take these to the circle of the torch said one of the lads and bind them securely then hunt the others the captors hesitated you can put your marks on these in charcoal said one of the boys indicating donna and lehna all right said one of the captors agreed said the other lehna was led away on her ankle leash fastened on her left ankle and by her right wrist too it held in the hand of one of the boys donnas captor to her misery dragged her behind him through the dirt on the tether which fastened her ankles together i saw the group pursuers and fair captives helpless in their charge disappear down the street i shuddered in the darkness among the pilings i did not want to be captured a bold plan leaped into my mind i began to move through the darkness i kept in the shadows i moved furtively sometimes i crawled as much as i could i kept under the huts among the pilings twice boys with torches passed quite near to me i shrank back in the shadows then i threw myself to my belly not more than ten yards away i saw chanda wild running she was fleeing down a nearby street there was a rope on one of her wrists it was a wrist tether rope knotted about her right wrist with a handle loop about a foot long by which she might be led i remained still behind her in a few moments carrying a torch came two boys i was first to see her in the hut said one i was first to put her to the floor and get my rope on her said the other the first lad lifted his torch peering about let us not dispute the matter further he said let us continue the hunt very well said the other warriors i thought would not have lost a girl in such a fashion girls do not escape warriors i hoped that chanda would escape i continued my journey i continued to keep largely under huts too i often crawled now i had no wish to leave the prints of a slave girls small feet once i almost cried out with misery for the path to my desired destination lay across a dark street down which a hundred yards or so away i could see the center of the village where about the village fire were seated several men villagers and my master and his men on my belly i inched across this street and then gratefully slipped again into the shadows among and beneath the huts for the moment i was again safe i did not much fear being trailed for though slave girls would be barefoot as i there would also be in the village the numerous prints of village bond girls not simply mine and those of my sisters in bondage it would be next to impossible in this populous and much trekked village particularly in the night by torchlight to follow a girls trail without the use of sleen which might not happily for the pursued females be used in the hunt if the boys could not find us by themselves they simply could not have us that night for their sport we would have won our freedom from their aggressions i determined to escape at last stealthily crawling in the darkness i reached that position in the village which i had anxiously sought that portion of the village where my master and his men had made their camp i crawled among the furs there in the darkness tentings had not been erected i heard a girl weeping and stumbling hurry along female i heard yes master i heard i dared not move i scarcely dared breathe i lay as small as tiny as silent as still as i could some figures three of them were passing me some yards on my right perhaps if they had looked they might have seen me when they had passed i lifted my head ever so slightly they had circled our camp area between it and the edge of the palisade and were now returning to the center of the village i looked chandas hands were now bound tightly behind her back the wrist tethers handle loop having been used for this purpose she was bent over she was stumbling her gown had been pulled down about her hips she was weeping one of the boys hands was in her hair she was being hurried along they were not patient with her she was being half dragged not merely perfectly controlled by the cruel grip i did not envy her she had irritated them by her earlier escape doubtless they would make her pay well for her temerity men do not care to be displeased by slave girls i hoped that she would not be excessively beaten i saw them take her to the circle of the torch there they bound her hand and foot they also marked on her body with some burnt wood from the fire probably putting their ownership marks on her marking her as theirs for the night i crept into my masters furs for the first time i now breathed more easily i heard two boys calling to one another how many of the shetarsks are still at large asked one two he was answered i did not know who the other uncaptured beauty might be i snuggled down in my masters furs covering my head i did not think they would find me there who would think a girl bold enough to hide in her masters furs too i did not think the peasant boys would dare to look into the furs of a warrior surely they valued their lives i felt secure it was probably the only place in the village where i might be safe i was well pleased with myself i loved the smell of my masters body which was in the furs surrounding me with its excitement the aura of his ownership enveloped me i felt warm and protected and stimulated as a slave girl warm in my masters furs i wished that he too were in the furs that i might perform delicious servile duties for him fitting for one who was only a lowly bond girl i loved him was i his slave because i loved him or did i love him because i was his slave i smiled i was his slave totally and completely whether i loved him or not that was legal institutional on this world i was his to do with as he pleased completely i was without rights his will determined all he was everything i was nothing he was master i was slave i decided that i was both his slave and that i loved him but i did not think i could have loved him so much had he not been so powerful and had i not been his slave so helplessly i heard a shout outside and i lay very still i heard the boys crying out with triumph and pleasure in a few moments when i dared i looked out from the furs they had taken another girl did they think she would escape it was slave beads she was being carried to the circle of the torch she was carried on the shoulder of a brawny peasant lad she was roped hand and foot at the ankles at the thighs above the knees her wrists behind her back and about her upper arms and body in addition one lad walked in front with a rope which was tied on her neck and another walked behind with a rope tied about her left ankle there were several boys in the group several apparently had flushed her out and together run her down like a startled confused tabuk hind i now alone of all the girls had escaped them i was proud of my ingenuity and cunning for more than an ahn i lay quiet in the furs sometimes the young hunters came near but they did not molest our camp nor much penetrate its perimeters one did walk within two or three yards of me carrying a torch but i lay very still he did not throw aside the furs of my master nor those of the other men i lay warm in the furs happy i had escaped from them there was a possibility i supposed that my master would not be pleased that i had hidden in his furs if this were so i supposed that i would be tied and lashed yet i did not think he would object to my boldness and ingenuity i knew that my master could see through me his slave girl as simply as through glass but i felt that i too in the past weeks strangely had become much more aware of him and much more capable of reading his moods and conjecturing his reactions perhaps this was only a slave girls alertness to the master an alertness natural enough in a girl who is owned by a man whose wellbeing and very life may depend on how well she pleases him i do not know that is an alertness which any rational girl strives to cultivate but i wondered if it might not be more something more in the nature of a deep intuitive rapport with another person i felt that i was coming to know my master two days ago i had sensed watching him that he desired wine rather than paga i had gone and fetched wine and knelt before him may a girl offer you wine master i had asked him he had seemed startled momentarily then he had said yes slave and taken the wine at times i sensed his eyes on me once in the early morning when i had lain chained with the other girls i awakened but gave no sign that i had awakened through half closed eyes i had seen that he stood near me yesterday night he had touched my hair almost tenderly then as though angry with himself he slapped me hard and sent me to eta to be put to work i was not displeased two days ago i had dared to follow him outside the palisade i found him sitting alone on a rock surveying a grassy field come here slave he said to me yes master i said i went and knelt near him later i leaned my head against him which he permitted the grass and sky are beautiful are they not slave he asked yes master i had replied he looked down at me you too he said are beautiful slave a girl is gratified if she pleases her master i said why is it he asked looking down that the women of earth are fit to be slaves perhaps i said looking up at him because the men of gor are fit to be masters he then again turned his attention to the contemplation of the grass and sky he sat still for a long time then he stood up as though shaking his mood from him as though now he was again separate from nature alien in its midst conscious a man and i was at his feet a woman then it was we two alone by the rock in the grass he standing i kneeling he looked down at me the woman of earth i said to him is ready to serve her gorean master laughing he leaped upon me seizing me by the shoulders and throwing me back forcibly as a slave to the grass the tateera was torn from me well then to her joy did he use the earth woman his slave i felt the furs thrown back i knew that i would find you here he said i hope that master is not displeased with his girl i said yesterday night he had touched my hair almost tenderly then as though angry with himself he had slapped me hard and sent me to eta to be put to work i had not been displeased though my mouth was bloodied this morning i had knelt before him i beg rape i had said he had looked at me angrily rape her he had said to a passing soldier he had then turned angrily away in the arms of the soldier i had smiled i think i had disturbed my master i think he was fighting his feelings for me his desire for me then i had cried out with unwilling pleasure and helplessly caught at the soldier with my nails and the thought of my master had been against my will forced from my consciousness as the soldier brought me twisting and crying out to obliterating overwhelming slave orgasm perhaps i should have you lashed said my master my master will do with me what he pleases i said he had not been too pleased with the way i had yielded to the soldier but i had not been able to help myself slave had said my master later standing over me yes master i had said looking up at him shamed i am a slave he had then turned away again angrily he called marla to him to serve his pleasure she hurried to him objectively she was more beautiful than i with her large dark eyes her face her lovely figure too she had superb slave reflexes but she did not i thought succeed in making my master forget me she did of course frighten me for she was a formidable rival i resented and hated her too she did not seem to regard me with affection and delight she had wanted me named stupid girl or clumsy girl i did not yet have a name but in spite of the fact that my master currently seemed to be much taken with maria and that she was clearly the preferred bond girl in our camp i did not feel that she had managed to negate the moments or the tacit understanding which i felt i shared with the man who owned me i recalled his anger at my helpless yielding to the soldier i was only a slave i had not been able to help myself yet he had been angry too he himself had commanded the man to address himself to the work of my rape yet he had been angry too his concern with marla seemed to me rather sudden and excessive he seemed to be too obviously unconcerned with me i smiled to myself i think he had been jealous and i think he was using marla certainly a delightful diversion to try and force me from his mind she was surely more beautiful than i but in such matters there are rightnesses which are reciprocal and subtle it is rather like the matching together of pieces in a puzzle the startling unexpected fitting together of components yielding a whole which is in its wholeness more precious than the individual pieces or parts could be in isolation as beautiful and marvelous as marla was she was not i it was that simple i believe she was not i i not she i believe was the one i had little doubt he was my natural perfect master i think he had begun to fear that i might be his natural perfect slave surely he did not want to think of me as more than just another of his girls yet i had little doubt that i was becoming to him in spite of his desires something more than just another lovely wench whose wrist was fastened on his chain he stood beside the furs and slipped aside his tunic remove the tateera he said to me i sat up unhooked it and slipped it over my head putting it to the side he joined me in the furs throwing them over us both i could hear cries it seemed from far off from the circle of the torch where the peasant boys sported cruelly with their captured beauties then i was in my masters arms i moaned with pleasure i felt my masters eyes upon me will you turn me over to the peasant boys i asked apprehensive in the darkness i did not want to be roped and dragged a captured slave to the circle of the torch they would be furious that i had eluded them i did not know what they would do to me no said he in the darkness then said i breathing more easily i have escaped them but you have not escaped me he said no master i said snuggling more closely to him i have not escaped you you ran well he said and you are bold it took boldness indeed to hide unbidden in the furs of your very master for such boldness a slave girl might be much beaten yes master i said but i do not disparage boldness in a slave girl said he a girl who is bold is likely to think of marvels of pleasure for her master which a more timid girl would not dare to even contemplate yes master i said frightened too said he the nature of your flight and your selection of a refuge indicates high intelligence thank you master i said i felt his hands on the side of my head you are extremely intelligent he said adding for a woman and a slave thank you master i said what a beast he was and yet i sensed that my intelligence was indeed far less than his and that of most of the gorean men i had met gorean males are unusual in their strength energy and intelligence sometimes this angered me sometimes it pleased me i did not feel inferior to most gorean women i had met either slave or free their intelligence it seemed to me compared much more closely statistically to that of earth females of my masters girls i felt that only eta was my superior i like high intelligence in a slave girl said my master thank you master i said then i cried out and held to him my lips parted for he had touched me you leap like a shetarsk he said i bit my lip that is because you are intelligent he said i suppose you did not know that he said for you are of earth i gasped and could not speak for the sensation which he was inducing in me intelligent bodies he said are far more responsive your very intelligence makes you the more helplessly a slave i clutched him it pleases me to own intelligent girls such as you he said intelligent girls make excellent slaves he observed please master i said i cannot resist you be silent he said yes master i wept it is more pleasurable to control and dominate them than stupid girls he said they are more stimulating to own they are greater prizes yes master i said yes master too said he one profits more from their ownership than from that of a duller girl they are brighter more skillful more imaginative more inventive an intelligent girl can do many more things and do them better than a duller girl she follows commands easily she learns swiftly her performances in their variety intricacy and depth can approach brilliance she learns well and continues to learn in her intelligence and sexuality how to please a man too in her depths of emotion feeling and sensation these associated with her intelligence she is easier to manipulate and exploit please master i begged take me remain immobile he said do not move so much as a muscle i gritted my teeth yes master i whispered every bit of me wanted to cry out and explode i held myself absolutely rigid i wanted to explode i was not permitted to move too said he an intelligent girl a highly intelligent one such as yourself is capable of truly understanding her slavery a dull girl has no true insight into the bondage relation she knows she is a slave she recognizes the institution and is cognizant of its legalities she is familiar with chains and has worn them she sees the whip and has felt it but does she truly understand her slavery forgive me master i said barely able to speak but any woman who is a slave truly understands her slavery is this true he asked in the belly of her i said any woman who is slave knows her slavery it has naught to do with intelligence but only with being a slave and a woman it is an indescribable helpless feeling in the belly of us being owned one need not be intelligent to have this emotion nor to respond nor to feel perhaps he said i wanted to scream please master i said do not move said he yes master i said obeying i held myself rigid could the peasant boys have been more cruel you do not think he asked that the dull woman confuses slavery with the chains and the whip no master i said i moaned in helplessness i am not now chained i said i am not now being whipped but i could not be more a slave than now if i were chained to a whipping post and the lash being laid upon me i am owned i am completely in your power i dare not even move i must obey this could be understood by any woman in my place but perhaps said he musing your understanding of your slavery in virtue of your intelligence your sensitivity is much more intense much deeper and richer than would be that of a duller woman perhaps master i said i do not know do you wish to be permitted to move he asked yes i wept yes yes but you are not yet permitted to move he said yes master i sobbed it is pleasant to own a beautiful earth woman such as you he said yes master i said to whom do you belong he asked to you to you master i said but you are of earth he said how can you belong to a man i belong to you to you master i said in the past weeks he said you have begun to disturb me master i asked do not move he said no master i sobbed i do not understand it he said it is very strange today i grew angry with you and you had merely behaved as a slave he referred to my yielding to the soldier in the morning i am a slave master i said i could not help myself i know he said why then should i be angry i do not know master i said he then touched me and i cried out do not move he said have mercy on your girl master i begged with his touch he had again brought my sensations to the point at which i wanted to shatter and writhe and scream and yet i must remain at his side immobile absolutely motionless you are not important he said no master i said you are a worthless slave girl he said yes master i said you can be bought or sold in any market he said for a handful of copper tarsks yes master i said why then he asked do i concern myself with you i do not know master i said you may move slave girl he said with a wanton cry i pressed myself against him you see he said the women of earth are natural slaves yes master i wept you are obviously only a common girl he said yes master i cried softly i began to lick at him beneath the chin and kiss him i clutched at him i wept and laughed and writhed holding him only a common girl he said only a common slave i put my tearstained cheek against the hardness of his chest holding him i could feel the hair on his chest between his body and the softness of my cheek yes master i whispered you do not even have a name he said no master i said of what importance is a nameless animal he asked none master i said how can you be of interest he asked i do not know master i said and yet you are a pretty little animal he said thank you master i said i shall conquer you he said you have conquered me long ago i said i shall conquer you anew he said every time you look upon me or touch me i said i am conquered anew i felt his chest beneath my cheek i held him in the darkness i am your conquest fully and completely master i said i am your slave perhaps my slave should have a name he said as master wills i said he took me by the shoulders and lifted and turned me he put me beneath him i felt the furs and the ground beneath my back i felt his arms about me i moaned as my body received and clasped him do not move he said yes master i said i wanted to yield i shall name you he said i lay in the darkness helpless imprisoned in the strength of his arms waiting to learn whom i would be the name he said for you are a common girl and worthless should be an unimportant name one plain and simple one fitting for a valueless girl an ignorant branded sheslave such as you yes master i said you are even a barbarian he said yes master i said some men he said enjoy putting a barbarian girl through her paces put me through my paces i beg of you master i wept do not move he cautioned yes master i wept i so wanted to yield to him i was on the brink of yielding but he would not let me move it was as though i wanted to burst i myself he smiled enjoy putting any girl civilized or barbarian through her paces yes master i said did you know he asked that in the throes of slave orgasm there is no difference between a civilized and barbarian girl no master i said it is interesting he said in slave orgasm they are spasmodically identical we are all women only women i said in the arms of our masters doubtless that is it he mused permit me to yield i begged do not move he said yes master i said through gritted teeth i was so much his why would he not have me you speak gorean with an accent he said yes master i said forgive me master i begged do not change he said the accent becomes you it marks you as different and makes you more interesting perhaps that is what master finds interesting about his girl i said perhaps he said but i have owned barbarian girls before other girls from the planet earth i whispered of course he said do not move no master i said suddenly i resented and hated those other girls from the bottom of my heart how angry and jealous i was the little slave is angry he said do not move no master i said i lay in the darkness in his arms trying not to move what became of the earth girls whom you owned before me master i asked was a slave given permission to speak he asked forgive me master i said may a slave speak yes he said you owned other earth girls i said where are they i do not know he said what did you do with them i asked i have had five such women not including yourself my dear he said i gave two away and sold off three are you going to sell me or give me away i asked perhaps he said i moaned he could do what he wished of course did they love you i asked i do not know he said perhaps perhaps not did they protest their love to you i asked of course he said that sort of thing is common among slave girls and yet you gave them away or sold them yes how could you do that master i asked they were only slaves he said in explanation i uttered a cry of anguish i could be discarded as easily you were cruel i said master how can one be cruel to a slave he asked yes i said how can one be cruel to a slave youre crying he said forgive me master i said we lay together in the darkness i not permitted to move i heard the peasant boys finishing with my sisters in bondage afterwards they would be put in slave hobbles what was your barbarian name he asked judy thornton i said master how came you into my possession he asked you won me in challenge master i said then you made me your slave ah yes he said what a beast he was me so naked so helpless in his arms barbarians have such complicated names he said it is two names master i said my first name was judy my second name was thornton barbarous he said yes master i said i do not like those names he said therefore they will not be yours yes master i said i supposed such names did sound unfamiliar and barbarous to a gorean ear what was the name of your barbarian master he asked i do not understand master i stammered the barbarian who owned you on earth he said perhaps we can use his name but i was not owned on earth master i said i was a free woman women such as you are permitted to be free on earth he asked yes master i said of what sort are the men of earth he asked of a sort other than gorean master i said i see he said are the men happy he asked no i told him are the women happy he asked no i told him i see he said do the men of earth not find you beautiful and desirable he asked they have been weakened i told him i did not know what it was to be desired until i came to this world i clutched him it is only in the arms of true men such as you master i said that i have learned what it is to be a woman you may move he said with a cry i began to respond spasmodically to him stop he said master i cried do not move he said i wept with misery how cruel could he be yes master i wept he had raised me to the point at which another instants movement would have precipitated that most incredible and fantastic of sexual experiences to which a human female can attain that in which she knows herself cognitively and physiologically submitted fully and completely absolutely to a master the psychological and somatic raptures of submission spasm the slave orgasm i must drive you from my mind he said i moaned what is your brand he asked the slave flower the dina i cried the name he had said for you are a common girl and worthless should be an unimportant name one plain and simple one fitting for a valueless girl an ignorant branded sheslave such as you the dina i cried he had begun to have me permit me to yield permit me to yield master i cried no he said i cried out with misery i tried to hold myself immobile you are going to be named he said i could not even speak i was the only dina among his girls it was a common brand often girls who wore it were called dina for a low common girl one not to be distinguished from others it was a suitable name it was unimportant it was simple it was plain i was common and of little value the name too was common and of little value it was thus not unfitting for a girl such as i not unfitting for an ignorant branded sheslave such as myself you will not forget your name he said no master i said i knew how he would impress my name upon me he had told me that i was without value that i was worthless i knew i could be bought and sold for a handful of copper tarsks i knew what he would name me he did not cease to have me at length i cried out agonized i must yield master i cannot help myself i cannot help myself but yield to you must you yield he asked even though it might mean your death yes master i cried then yield slave said he with a cry i yielded to him you are dina he said laughing his voice like a lion you are the slave dina whom i own he laughed and cried out with pleasure in his triumph over the slave girl yes master i cried i am dina i am dina i clutched him joyously his dina loves master i wept dina loves master later i lay in his arms an owned slave girl content beside the mightiness of her master how i loved him strange he said looking up at the gorean stars master i asked you are obviously only a common girl he said yes master i said i began to kiss him gently about the shoulder only a common girl he said it was true he was clitus vitellius a captain of the city of ar i was only dina yes master i said i fear that i might begin to care for you he said if dina has found favor with her master i said she is pleased i must fight this weakness he said whip me i said no he said it is not you who is weak master i said it is i dina in your arms who am without strength i kissed him i am a captain he said i must be strong i am a slave girl i said i must be weak i must be strong he said you did not seem weak to me master i said when you laughed and took me and named me dina then you seemed magnificent in your power and pride it was only the conquest of a slave girl he said yes master i said i am your conquest it was true dina the earth girl she who had once been judy thornton a lovely college student and poetess was now the enslaved love conquest of clitus vitellius of ar you trouble me he said angrily forgive me master i said i should rid myself of you he said permit me to follow at the heels of the least of your soldiers i said i truly did not fear that he would rid himself of me i loved him i was confident that he too in spite of himself cared for me master i said yes he said has dina pleased you this night i asked yes he said i want your collar i said there was a long silence then he said you are an earth girl yet you beg to wear a collar yes master i said it is said in a gorean proverb that a man in his heart desires freedom and that a woman in her belly yearns for love the collar in its way answers both needs the man is most free owning the slave he may do what he wishes with her the woman on the other hand being owned is institutionally and helplessly subject in her status as slave to the submissions of love i sensed my master feared his feelings for me this gave me power over him dina wants masters collar i whispered kissing at him the collar would make me the equal of eta i decide what slaves will wear my collar he said yes master i said chastened if he saw fit to put me in his collar he would if he did not he would not does dina love her master he asked yes yes master i whispered i so loved him have i given you choice in this he asked no master i said you have made me love you helplessly and wholly your feelings then he asked have been fully engaged and you are now mine at my complete mercy fully and vulnerably with no shred of pride or dignity left yes master i whispered you acknowledge yourself then hopelessly in love with me and as a slave girl yes master i said amusing he said master i asked i and the men and other girls lie said will leave tabuks ford in the morning you will remain behind i am giving you to thurnus a girls will means nothing i fled for the cage i must reach it i threw myself into the cage on my hands and knees i turned wildly and seized the bar and flung it down behind me the snout of the beast thrust viciously part way between the bars it snarled and squealed and hissed i shrank back in the tiny cage on the other side of the bars of the vertically sliding lowered gate the blazing eyes of the sleen regarded me i cried out with misery had i run more slowly it would have caught me and torn me to pieces it turned its head and with its double row of white fangs bit at the bars i heard the scraping of the teeth on the bars it pulled the cage moving it until it caught against the chain and stake which anchored it then it moved about the cage on its six legs its long furred body angrily rubbing against the bars it tried to reach me from another side i knelt head down shuddering my hands over my head in the center of the tiny cage once its snout thrust against me and i whimpered i smelled its breath felt the heat of it on my flesh the bars were wet where it had bit at them the ground too about the cage was wet where the beasts saliva in its frenzy its lust for killing had dampened the clawed dust back called thurnus coming to the sleen and putting a rope on its neck dragging it away from the cage gentle gentle fierce one coaxed thurnus he thrust his head near the large brown snout cooing and clicking his hands in the rope on its throat he whispered in its ear the beast became pacified thurnus took a great piece of meat and threw it to the animal which began to devour it excellent said clitus vitellius i knelt in the slave cage my hands on its bars i had locked myself in the slave cage when i had flung down the vertically sliding gate behind me two notched projections bolts welded to the flat bar at the gates bottom had slipped into ironinclosed spring catches heavy locks one on the bottom left one on the bottle right the gate being thus secured i could not open these locks they responded to a key slung on the string about the neck of thurnus it is necessary to engage the locks not only because the animal follows so closely and the gate must be swiftly lowered but because if the locks are not engaged it will thrust its snout beneath the bottom of the gate between the bottom of the gate and the floor of the cage and throwing its head up fling up the gate and have access to the cages occupant the girls choices are simple either she locks herself in the cage imprisoning herself helplessly at the pleasure of the cage owner or the animal destroys her i frightened watched the sleen tear at the meat i knelt in the cage my fists whiteknuckled clenched on the bars the cage is tiny but stout i could kneel in it or crouch or sit with my legs drawn up i could not extend my body nor stand upright the roof of the cage was about the height of a mans belt it is so constructed that it can be linked with other cages or tiered though there is a wooden floor to the cage the wood is placed over bars the entire cage thus is barred the bars and their fastenings were heavy the cage in which i had locked myself would hold not only a girl it would also have easily and efficiently held a strong man it was accordingly an allpurpose slave cage i looked up through the bars clitus vitellius did not look at me already i had been given to thurnus the cage was in a sleen training pit surrounded by a low wooden wall and floored with sand within the walls were several individuals my sisters in bondage those still the property of clitus vitellius one of whom was encaged like myself chanda who was sitting in her cage wrapping a cloth about her bleeding leg thurnus another of his girls sandal thong some men assisting thumus and clitus vitellius and some of his men within the ring too were some eight sleen tied on short tethers to stakes at the sides and a rack of meats and poles and ropes and whips used in the training of the animals outside the low walls several individuals observed the proceedings the balance of the men of clitus vitellius some villagers including some peasant boys and melina veiled the slack fat companion of the huge thurnus melina regarded me i did not meet her eyes but looked down into the dust i was a pretty slave girl who had been given to her companion i did not care to meet her eyes i hoped she would not be cruel to me but she was of the peasants and i was only a slave i looked across the sand to chanda she too was locked in a tiny cage she sat on the boards hunched over her legs drawn up and slowly wrapped a piece of white cloth about her bleeding calf the blood stained through the cloth the bit of a garment that she wore had also been torn by the beast who had pursued her it too afterward had been fed when it had been fed it had been tethered with the others the men discussed the animals and their merits i held the bars and head down eyes closed pressed my forehead against the bars what hope had a girl for escape on a world which contained sleen i and chanda had been used for purposes of demonstration sleen had been dragged to us to take our scent we had been held by men while the animals had taken our scent then chanda had been released she had been run first then i had been released i had been run shortly after her i had run wildly in misery over having been given away by clitus vitellius i had fully determined in my hysteria and misery to escape what a foolish slave girl i was i had run wildly i had almost fainted when a brown sinuous shape sped past me i saw it turn chanda and snarling begin its attack she fled back toward the training pit i saw her stumble once and the beast seize her leg and she screamed and then she was again on her feet running her hands extended before her the girl either permits herself to be herded expeditiously swiftly or she dies i turned to flee i screamed it was there in front of me it lifted its head i stumbled back my hand flung before my face it snarled hideously distracted by the first sleen that in pursuit of chanda i had not even seen this sleen whose brain was alive with my scent circle me and approach no no i cried go away please go away it crouched there not five feet from me its head lifted hissing snarling please go away i wept i saw its belly lower itself to the ground the bead still lifted watching me its tail lashed its eyes blazed it inched forward it had two rows of fangs i looked to the left and right it squealed hideously it came closer it was a precisely trained beast but no training is perfect it is a balancing of instincts and conditioning it is never perfect the beast at the nearness and intensity of my scent was becoming uncontrollable the critical attacking distance for a sleen in the wild is about twenty feet this distance in a herd sleen of course is much smaller i could see its excitement mount the fur about its neck rippled and bristled then i saw it gather its four hind legs beneath it with a cry of misery i turned and fled i ran back toward the training pit and the open cage that had been designated for occupancy by the earthgirl slave i ran wildly helplessly it ran behind me snapping and snarling i felt its breath on my legs it cut with its teeth at my heels i gasped i fought for breath it drove me faster and faster the beast was well trained it knew well how to herd a slave girl it had a sense of the distance and of my limitations its speed and endurance which i suspect were superior to my own it had herded other girls it kept me at my limits not permitting me to think but only to run frenziedly madly a driven herded slave girl seeking her cage i was at its mercy it set me the pace which i must make if i would live i cried out with misery running it drove me perfectly my only hope of survival was to reach the cage and lock myself within it where i would await confined the pleasure of a master i threw myself into the cage on my hands and knees and wildly turned and flung down the gate behind me it securely locking the beast tried to reach me but could not do so i was safe within the cage but locked within it at the mercy of a master i had been herded what hope had a girl for escape on a world which contained sleen how completely we belonged to our masters there are many varieties of sleen and most varieties can be to one extent or another domesticated the two most common sorts of trained sleen are the smaller tawny prairie sleen and the large brown or black forest sleen sometimes attaining a length of twenty feet in the north i am told the snow sleen has been domesticated the sleen is a dangerous and fairly common animal on gor which has adapted itself to a variety of environments there is even an aquatic variety called the sea sleen which is one of the swiftest and most dreaded beasts in the sea sea sleen are found commonly in northern waters they are common off the coast of torvaldsland and further north in the wild the sleen is a burrowing predominantly nocturnal animal it is carnivorous it is a tenacious hunter and an indefatigable tracker it will attack almost anything but its preferred prey is tabuk it mates once a year in the gorean spring and there are usually four young in each litter the gestation period is some six months the young are commonly white furred at birth the fur darkening by the following spring snow sleen however remain whitepelted throughout their life most domestic sleen are bred it is difficult to take and tame a wild sleen sometimes young sleen following the killing of the mother are dug out of a burrow and raised if they can be taken within the first two months of their life which seems to be a critical period before they have tasted blood and meat in the wild and made their own kills there is apparently a reasonably good chance that they can be domesticated otherwise generally not although grown wild sleen have been caught and domesticated this is rare even a sleen which has been taken young may revert these reversions can be extremely dangerous they usually take place as would be expected in the spring during the mating season male sleen in particular can be extremely restless and vicious during this period the mating of sleen is interesting the female if never before mated flees and fights the male but he is larger and stronger at last he takes her by the throat and throws her upon her back interestingly belly to belly beneath him his fangs are upon her throat she is at his mercy she becomes docile and permits her penetration shortly thereafter their heat growing they begin locked together by legs and teeth to roll and squeal in their mating frenzy it is a very fierce and marvelous spectacle it is not unusual for slave girls seeing this to kneel at their masters feet and beg their caress after the female sleen has been taken thusly once no longer need she be forced she follows the male often rubbing against him and hunts with him sometimes she must be driven away with snarls and bites sleen interestingly often pair for life their rutting however is usually confined to the spring sometimes slave girls are called shesleen but i do not think this expression is completely apt sexual congress in the human is not confined to a particular season we are not shesleen the heat of the shesleen occurs in the spring we are slave girls our masters keep us in heat constantly i looked across the sand to chandas cage she had finished wrapping the cloth about her cut calf i hoped the wound was not deep no one seemed to be concerned about her i gathered that her leg would not be scarred and that her value would not be lowered if her leg did scar with the result that her block value was diminished it must be recalled that clitus vitellius my former master had had her for nothing sleen are used for a multitude of purposes on gor but most commonly they are used for herding tracking guarding and patrolling the verr and the bosk are the most common animals herded tabuk and slave girls are the most common animals tracked the uses to which the sleen is put in guarding and patrolling are innumerable it is used to secure borders to prowl walls and protect camps it may run loose in the streets after curfews it may lurk in the halls of a great house after dark it may deter thieves from entering locked shops it may stand sentry upon wharves and in warehouses there are many such uses to which the sinuous beasts may be put an interesting use which might be mentioned is prisoner control a tiny circle is drawn and the prisoner must kneel or assume some prescribed position within it then should the prisoner attempt to rise to his feet leave the circle or break the position in the slightest the beasts tears him to pieces aside from these common uses sleen are put to other uses too in thentis for example sleen are used to smell out contraband in the form of the unauthorized egress of the beans for black wine from the thentian territories they are sometimes too used by assassins though the caste of assassins itself by their caste codes precludes their usage the member of the caste of assassins must make his own kill it is in their codes some sleen are used as bodyguards others are trained to kill in the arena others perform in exhibitions and carnivals there are many uses to which such animals are put the herding tracking and control of beautiful slave girls is but one use the gate to my cage was unlocked and flung upward the sleen outside had been fed and taken by the men assisting thurnus on short ropes to their cages the men of clitus vitellius had left the sand pit and the area about it accompanied by his girls including chanda who too had been released the small crowd which had observed had now dissipated with the exception of melina companion of thurnus and two or three peasant boys who watched me sandal thong one of the girls of thurnus who had assisted in the training pit had left too now to attend to other duties including the watering of the sleen she wore a short slave tunic white of the wool of the hurt and a rope collar she was a large longarmed freckled girl of peasant stock clitus vitellius in the tunic of the warrior remained in the training pit to accompany thurnus back to his hut thurnus tapped on the bars of the cage with a sleen whip come out little slave he said on my hands and knees i emerged from the cage head down crawling out onto the hot sand it was the first time i had ever been caged without thinking i began to rise to my feet the butt of the sleen whip struck me heavily driven downward between the shoulder blades felling me i lay in the hot sand startled i hurt i could feel the warm sand granular between my fingers on my thighs master i asked frightened how had i displeased him were you given permission to rise slave he asked no master i said frightened forgive me it is common on gor for a girl emerging from a small cage on her belly or her hands and knees depending on the size opening at the feet of her master to remain pending her masters instructions on her belly or hands and knees i did not know it at the time i had never been caged before i lying in the sand was conscious of their feet about me i did not want to be beaten she is a pretty little thing is she not asked thurnus i supposed i did look beautiful a slave girl lying at their feet in the warm sand i am pleased that you like her said clitus vitellius i am grateful for the gift said thurnus it is nothing said clitus vitellius she is only a lovely trifle on your hands and knees girl said thurnus i rose to my hands and knees i felt a length of sleen rope tied on my neck the other end of the rope was looped several times and the loops loosely knotted about a bar of the sleen cage the resulting tether was about a foot long look up at me girl said thurnus i looked up at him you attempted to escape he said i had no chance to escape master i said a sleen was set upon me it is true said he that you had no chance for escape but you ignorant girl did not know that i was silent frightened did you try to escape he asked i had tried to escape yes master i whispered sit with your back against the cage legs drawn up he said i did so my neck roped to one of the bars he crouched down near me he drew out a sleen knife he felt the back of my legs with his left hand pretty legs he said thank you master i said do you know what these muscles are he asked touching the twin cords behind my right knee tendons master i said do you know what they are for he asked they control the movement of my leg i said without them i could not walk i felt the blade touch the left tendon behind my right knee if thurnus were to draw the blade toward him the tendon would be severed he replaced the sleen knife in its sheath then he struck me twice once striking my head to the right and then with the back of his hand lashing it to the left that said thurnus is for having tried to escape yes master i said he then took my legs drawn up in his hands pressing with his thumbs against the inner tendons behind both the left and right knee i shrank back miserable my head to one side against the bars remember small luscious beauty he said i looked at him with horror yes master i said the memory of the sleen knife was vivid in my mind he removed his hands from my legs and i almost collapsed in the sand on your hands and knees girl said thurnus i went to my bands and knees and he unknotted the loops of sleen rope from the bar of the cage and threw it loose beside me in the sand whence it rose to the bond on my neck look up at me girl he said i looked up at him the rope on my neck go to the hut he said yes master i said they then turned away from me thurnus and clitus vitellius i must leave before noon clitus vitellius was saying there are four sleen in which i am interested let us discuss the matter thurnus was saying they left the training pit on my hands and knees miserable in the hot sand the rope on my neck i looked about the training pit at the rack of whips and ropes the sleen tethers the cages the wooden barrier about the training area and then on my hands and knees made my way through the sand and out of the training area toward the hut of thurnus the rope dragging behind me i had begun to understand what it would be to be the girl of a peasant in the street of the village i stopped feet stood before me i looked up miserable in the dust the rope hanging from my neck it was two peasant boys what slave is this asked one he was bran loort leader of the peasant boys a rugged youth verging into his manhood he had in him said some the makings of a caste leader it is the clever beautiful slave who eluded us last night in our sport said his fellow so it is acknowledged bran loort it is said said the one she has been given to thurnus then said bran loort she will be in the village it seems so said the other please masters i said do not detain me let us not detain her said bran loort they stepped aside as though i might have been a free woman dragging the rope on my neck on my hands and knees through the dust of the hot sunny street i crawled past them how far from me then seemed judy thorton the lovely coed i thought of the college boys whom i had despised or tolerated with whom i had been so haughty how they would have laughed to have seen me now on a world where there were true men in the vicinity of thurnuss hut at the side of one of the wagons taken in the raid on the camp of the lady sabina being loaded with supplies and gear was clitus vitellius i seized at his knees weeping keep me keep me master i begged he looked down at me it was shortly before noon i looked up at him tears in my eyes i love you master i wept she does not want to be a peasants girl laughed one of the men i love you master i said clitus vitelllius rook the rope from the ground which hung from my throat he held the rope she does not want to be left in tabuks ford said one of the men who can blame her asked another i looked up at clitus vitellius my hands about his knees tears in my eyes he held the rope which was on my neck i am your conquered slave i wept please take me with you he put his foot on the rope pressing it to the ground then beneath his foot he drew the rope to him my head was dragged from his knees to the dust at his feet i lay before him helpless you are a slave girl in the village of tabuks ford he said then he threw the rope to the ground and turned away from me i scratched in the dust and wept beside the wheel of the wagon rain i cut at the soil with the hoe chopping and loosening the dirt about the roots of the sul plant the sun was high overhead it was hot there was a peasants kerchief on my head i worked in my masters fields i was alone i wore a peasants tunic it was white and sleeveless of the wool of the hurt it came high on my thighs thurnus had shortened it his companion melina had taken the tateera from me and burned it scandalous slave scandalous garment she had cried she had then thrown me a peasant tunic which had fallen to my knees thurnus wanting to see more of my legs to her anger had shortened it with shears i straightened my body my back hurt i wiped my forehead with the back of my hand you will learn toil small beauty he had said when i had knelt before him among the pilings beneath his hut my hands tied behind my back my neck roped to one of the pilings i remembered the morning bitterly i am going to ar with the master had said marla turning before me now who is the most beautiful she asked you marla i had said farewell slave she said and left me i had knelt there beneath the hut of thurnus in the tateera my hands tied behind my back my neck roped to one of the pilings to another of the pilings four beautiful shesleen were tethered they were on short tethers they were sleek lovely animals my master had purchased them they could not reach me clitus vitellius and his men milled about i shall miss you said eta kissing me i wish you well slave she said lehna donna and chanda came to me and kissed me and hugged me i wish you well slave they said i wish you well i said slave beads stood to one side looking at me will you not say farewell to your sister slave i asked she came to my side and knelt down beside me yes she said tears in her eyes we are all slaves she said she took me in her arms and kissed me slave beads was no longer the lady sabina she too now was only a slave i wish you well slave she said i wish you well slave i said to her coffle line snapped a guard swiftly the girls fell into coffle line i watched them i wished i were with them each beauty knew her place they did not daily forming the line they did not wish to be whipped marla led the line what beautiful legs she had the girls extended their left wrists for the rings to be locked upon them they stood straight their eyes looking ahead under discipline marias right foot determined the line each girl with the exception of maria the lines leader aligned her right foot with that of the girl before her in the line sometimes a coffle line is drawn in the dirt and the right foot of each girl is placed on it vertically such that the line besects the ball and heel of each foot clitus vitellius did not so much as look at me the guard who was the blond soldier mirus whom i found most attractive of the men of clitus vitellius after he himself unlooped the coffle chain from his shoulder the girls stood erect left arms extended wrist straight with the arm their left arms aligned each at a forty degree angle from her body right arms at their sides palms on thighs ankles closely together bellies sucked in chins up marlas wrist was locked in the first wrist ring she smiled she was coffled when the lock snapped on her wrist she placed her chained left wrist at her side her palm on her left thigh still looking ahead lehna who was very beautiful was the next locked in the coffle she placed her left wrist at her side looking ahead there are a large variety of coffle arrangements given mixtures and combinations of materials and bonds and aesthetic physical and psychological considerations coffle arrangements are seldom random from the physical point of view the most common coffles are leftwrist coffles leftankle coffles and throat coffles leftwrist coffles and throat coffles are useful trekking coffles the leftankle coffle and the throat coffle free the hands to carry burdens clitus vitellius still had the wagons stolen from the camp of the lady sabina and so his girls did not have to carry the burdens of his camp such burdens are often carried by girls in ankle coffle or throat coffle and are balanced on the head usually steadied by the right hand donna and chanda were now added to the coffle their left hands now locked in wristrings lay against their left thighs there was another snap of a wrist ring and the chain bore yet another jewel the lovely halfstripped slave beads last on the chain was eta the guard looked at her and their eyes met and then he put the chain on her i did not know why eta was last on the chain i knew the look in the eyes of the guard he wanted her for his own slave she looked frightened he stood behind her for a moment and she pressed back putting her head back against his shoulder then he moved away from her there was a mark on the side of etas face where she had been struck perhaps she had not been fully pleasing for an instant to one of the soldiers or to clitus vitellius and had thus been struck and put at the rear of the chain perhaps she was at the rear of the chain because she was the most beautiful and her beauty was being saved for last thus the chain would have begun with the beautiful marla and then with a surprise finished with a girl yet more beautiful than the first but perhaps she was thought to be ugly for a day or two until the blow healed and thus for ugliness was put at the back of the line or perhaps it was merely that the last wristring had then been open i being left in tabuks ford and thus there was no reason for her any longer to be excluded from the coffle thus she would merely have been placed in the available wrist ring in my place sometimes masters punish us without explaining the reason it is then for the slave girl to guess and wonder and try harder to please sometimes perhaps there is no reason we are so much at their mercy beside my knee in the dirt there was a pan of water and one of wet meal the last girl eta was now coffled stand easily slaves said the guard and walked away marla turned to face me she lifted her chained left wrist i wear the chain of clitus vitellius she said you wear the rope of a peasant yes mistress i said she turned away from me the men were now hitching the bosk to the wagons taken from the camp of the lady sabina two peasant boys stood nearby they looked at me i kneeling clad in the tateera my hands tied behind my back my neck roped to the piling beneath thurnuss hut regarded them greetings slave girl they said to me greetings masters i said to them they turned away grinning and left the vicinity of the hut the first team of bosk was hitched up two of the great animals broad shaggy with polished horns clitus vitellius was talking with thurnus i and the men and other girls he had said will leave tabuks ford in the morning you will remain behind i am giving you to thurnus i had cried out with misery and horror in his arms master i had cried he had then gagged me he then tied my hands behind my back and took me naked and stumbling from his furs he found an ankle stock of heavy wood near the perimeter of his camp area he put me on my back the stock consisted of two heavy oblong pieces of wood each about four inches thick joined together by hinged iron he flung open the stock he looked down at me i half reared up struggling to a sitting position my hands tied behind my back my eyes wild over the gag our eyes met he then swiftly brutally used me and i miserable helpless my eyes hot with tears again could not resist him and again unable to help myself responded to him and responded as a slave he laughed at me derisively and then crouching beside me threw my ankles into the stock and closed it one of the two fourinch blocks of wood on each side of my ankles and flung the hasp over the staple which would hold the blocks shut then with a drilled peg and a bit of binding fiber attached to the stock he slipping the fiber through the staple and securing it to the peg fastened the hasp down this would hold a bound slave if my hands had not been tied a padlock would have been used tied as i was i was the prisoner of the stock its weight and constraint i lay on the ground twisting moaning it seemed my guts had been torn out i looked up miserable at the stars clitus vitellius then left me to return to his furs to sleep i cut again at the soil with the hoe chopping down loosening the dirt about the roots of the sul plants the sun was terribly hot on my throat i wore a rope collar my hands were terribly blistered it was painful to hold the hoe my back hurt me it seemed every muscle in my body ached i wanted to throw myself down and weep but the suls must be hoed you will learn toil small beauty thurnus had told me i had well learned toil and misery it is not easy to be a peasants girl it is a hard slavery i remembered seeing clitus vitellius leave he had not looked back i had wanted to call out after him but i had not dared i did not wish to be whipped it is not easy to be a peasants girl it is a hard slavery i remembered the sting of the switch across the back of my thighs as melina had driven me to the kennel i will make you wish you wore a longer tunic slave she had cried i had dropped through the kennel door and some feet below struck the strawstrewn floor of the kennel the kennel was a cage a sleen cage tipped on its side fully barred sunk mostly into the ground the cage in its original attitude when used for sleen would have been some four feet in height six feet in width and twelve feet in length tipped on its side to better accommodate humans it was some six feet in height and four by twelve feet in breadth and length in this attitude it was entered from the top within there was a wooden runged ladder for climbing out of it it was sunk some four and a half feet in the ground wooden planks covered with straw lay over the bars on the bottom these planks were separated by some two inches apiece to facilitate drainage the cage was roofed too with planks these planks were set flush with one another they were fastened over the top of the bars including some sawed over the barred door at night a tarpaulin was thrown over the cage roof standing in the cage one could look out ones shoulders being approximately at ground level i dropped to the floor of the cage i heard the heavy barred gate at the top over my head with its attached planks flung shut it made a harsh sound of metal and wood then i heard the rattle of two heavy padlocks on chains there were two heavy metal snaps as the door above me was fastened shut i looked up i was locked within kneel said a voice i knelt there were four other girls in the cage in the position of the pleasure slave said one of them i complied let us see your brand said another i turned to the side and drew back the tunic a dina said another girl there were four besides myself in the cage thurnuss other girls did you know asked one that dinas are suitable to be the slaves of slaves no i said i did not you were not given permission to cover your brand said one sharply i drew back my hand i turned to face them on my knees they sat in the cage on the straw are you a pleasure slave asked one curious yes i said they laughed here you are a work slave said one here you will be worked hard said another i straightened my back they made me angry i assessed them obviously to a womans eyes though a man might not have noticed one by one it is a slight tacit thing that women understand i smiled they were angry perhaps i will not be worked as hard as you think i said i was clearly their superior in beauty insolent slave cried one how haughty you are slave girl said another i shrugged do you think you are more beautiful than we asked one of them yes i told them do you think you will please the master more than we asked another yes i told them i am clearly more beautiful shetarsk said one shesleen cried another you will be worked hard said another girl we will see to that vowed the fourth girl do you have a comb for my hair i asked do not break the position of the pleasure slave warned the largest of the girls sandal thong a longarmed freckled giantess of a peasant wench very well i said it becomes you said verr tail a wideshouldered auburnhaired girl thank you i said i did not wish to be caged with them i could sense their hostility too they could surely detect that i did not care for them but we were locked in the same small cage doubtless you will soon become the masters favorite said turnip a darkhaired widefaced girl perhaps i said tossing my head radish is now favorite said sandal thong indicating a blondish thickankled girl at her left i recognized her it was she whose heartbeat had given the time count in the boys sport of girl hunt the preceding night last night she had served one of the warriors of clitus vitellius i recalled her pressing back against him his hand on her heart his calling the count i myself had been in the arms of such men many times they were not peasant boys i was the girl of a warrior i told them you are very pretty said radish i decided i did not dislike radish you were poor in the furs said sandal thong that is why he gave you away no i cried poor in the furs laughed sandal thong why did he give you away asked verr tail i do not know i said poor in the furs said sandal thong pointing her finger at me we have few furs in this village laughed turnip we will see how you roll in the straw if you are not good said verr tail we will soon know thurnus will tell everyone whether you are good or not i am good i told them why did your master give you away asked turnip it amused him i said he is clitus vitellius a captain he can have many girls more beautiful than i he made me love him hopelessly and desperately and then for his amusement discarded me he toyed with me he used me for the object of his sport then when he had won fully and completely he cast me aside ridding himself of me giving me away did you truly love him asked radish yes i said what a slave you are laughed sandal thong he made me love him i cried defensively yet i knew i would have loved him even had he not made me love him had i had the choice as a free woman i would have chosen to love him but the choice had not been mine for i had been a slave he had overwhelmed me forcing me to love him consulting not my will before i could have chosen to do so i who had desired to kneel before him of my own free will had been commanded to his sandals as a slave girl you are a fool to have loved your master said sandal thong i love my master said radish sandal thong turned about and struck radish to the side of the cage slave she cried i cannot help it that i love my master said radish sandal thong spun about facing me do not break the position of the pleasure slave she said i held position are you not a slave too i cried sandal thong stood up she was a tall girl she fingered the rope collar on her throat she stood there in the brief slave tunic of the wool of the hurt it was the only garment she had as with the rest of us she was a large girl heavyboned tall stronger than we powerful when compared to us but to a man she too would have been slight at their mercy yes she said i can be beaten or sold or slain i can be given as a gift among men they can put me in chains they can burn me with irons they can do with me what they wish she looked out through the bars of the cage at ground level i must kneel to them i must be obedient i must do what i am told she looked down at me yes she said i too am a slave we are all slaves said radish i do not want to be a woman cried sandal thong suddenly shaking the bars of the cage she put her face against them weeping you weep like a woman i said she spun to face me once said i i did not wish to be a woman then i met men such as i had not dreamed could exist they made me happy to be a woman never again would i have wanted to be anything else my womanhood though it puts me at the mercy of men is now exquisitely precious to me among such men i would not trade my womanhood for anything in the world every girl has a master it is only sandal thong that you have not yet met yours she looked at me angrily the bars in back of her there is some man sandal thong i said whose sandals you would beg to untie with your teeth if thurnus would so much as look at me she said i would crawl ten pasangs on my belly to lick the dust from his ankles thurnus then i said is your master yes she said thurnus is my master what is your name asked radish do you have a name had asked thurnus of me earlier my former master clitus vitellius of ar i had said called me dina he thought so little of you asked thurnus yes master i said it is a pretty name he had said it is only that it is common yes master i had said i name you dina he said putting the name on me naming his animal who are you he asked dina i had said master what is your name asked radish i smiled dina i said many girls with your brand are called dina said turnip i have heard that i said it is a pretty name said verr tail thank you i said it must be nice to have a girls name said turnip i did not respond i am radish said radish i am turnip said turnip i am verr tail said verr tail sandal thong looked at me i am sandal thong she said tal i said to them tal they said to me you are first in the cage i asked sandal thong yes she said it will not be necessary to kick or beat me i said i will obey you we are all women we are all slaves said sandal thong we are all under the whip said turnip i have been hand whipped i said but i have never felt the slave whip have you been a slave long asked radish no i said you are very pretty to have been free said turnip i lived far away i said your accent marks you as barbarian said sandal thong yes i said where did you live asked verr tail a place called earth i said i have never heard of it said turnip is it in the north asked radish it is far away i said let us not speak of it how could i speak of earth to them i did not want them to think me mad or a liar could they believe a world might exist where men shouting political slogans vied with one another to surrender their dominance hastening gleefully to their own castration could such a world be welcomed by any save lesbians and men who were not men truth and political convenience i thought do not always coincide barbarian places are so dull said turnip have you never been chained in ar no i said i was sold once in ar she said it is a marvelous city i am pleased to hear it i said clitus vitellius i knew was of ar it is strange that you have never felt the slave whip said turnip i shrugged perhaps she was too pretty to whip said turnip i think it is always the ugly girls who are whipped said verr tail that is not true said radish i would suppose i said that any girl beautiful or not if she needs a whipping would be whipped by her master it surprised me that i an earth girl had said this yet why should a girl who needs a whipping not be whipped if she has a gorean master dina is right said radish they whip us said sandal thong when it pleases them radish laughed and slapped her thighs yes she said the beasts they put us under the leather whenever it pleases them whether we have done anything or not men are the masters said turnip they do with us what they please this is a peasant village dina said verr tail if you remain long us the village you will learn the slave whip well i shuddered i have never even really been switched i said eta had never switched me though she had held switch rights over me as first girl in the camp i had been stung twice across the back of the thighs below the short tunic by melina companion of my master thurnus when she had hurried me to the kennel it was been terribly humiliating and unpleasant it was hard to imagine what a true switching would be i could not even conjecture what it would be to feel the flash of the slave whip on my body does the whip hurt sandal thong i asked yes said sandal thong does the whip hurt very much i asked yes said sandal thong you are strong sandal thong i said do you fear the whip yes she said do you fear the whip very much i asked yes she said i fear the whip very much i shuddered if even the large strong sandal thong so feared the whip i wondered what it would do to me it is time to sleep now said radish we lay down in the straw and were soon asleep i awakened once sweating i had had a strange dream i had dreamed i knelt naked in a steel collar on smooth tiles in a beautiful room as though in a palace before me had been a low table on this table had been strands of thread and in small cups beads slave beads of various colors red yellow and purple and other colors i understood somehow that i must make a necklace a slave whip had been lifted before me what is this asked a voice a slave whip master i had said and what are you had inquired the voice a slave master i had said do you obey asked the voice yes master i had said the whip then roughly had been forced against my face it pressed against my lips bruising them i felt it with my teeth kiss the whip slave said the voice i had kissed the whip who commands me i had asked it had seemed as though i must ask that yet it was not the sort of thing a slave girl would naturally ask such an inquiry might be thought to border on insolence yet i was not taken by the wrists and thrown fiat upon the tiles and whipped you are commanded by belisarius slave girl was the response the response somehow seemed oddly fitting expected yet i knew no belisarius what is the command of belisarius the slave girls master i had asked it is simple said the voice yes master i had said bead a necklace slave girl said the voice yes master i had said then my hands had reached toward the strands of thread on the table and toward the cups of tiny beads then i had awakened i did not understand the dream i put out my hand i was not on smooth tiles my hand felt straw and wood and a steel bar and the tiered dirt behind it the dream was then gone i lay awake looking up at the bars and wood above me the moons were full outside and i rose to my feet in the straw i was not in a palace i was in a cage at tabuks ford i went to the side of the cage and over the vertical banking earth looked out my small hands held the bars the roof of the cage was a few inches above my head my fists clutched the bars i had been judy thorton i was caged i cried out startled bran loort grinned at me the other girls turned restlessly but did not awaken i shrank back from the bars i lay down in the straw he was looking at me i tried to pull the short woolen tunic more over my legs i am going to be first in tabuks ford whispered bran loort when i am first he said melina will give you to me he slipped away from the bars i drew up my legs i huddled in the straw trembling i chopped at the dry earth about the sul plant i had been twenty days slave at tabuks ford the peasant hoe has a staff some six feet in length its head is iron and heavy some six inches at the cutting edge tapering to four inches where it joins the stall it is fastened to the staff by the staffs fitting through a hollow ringlike socket at its termination a wedge is driven into the head of the staff to expand and tighten the wood in the socket i was too small to use such a tool well i did not make a good peasants slave it is difficult to convey the hardship of slavery in a peasant village particularly for a slight girl such as i i stood up straightening my back it hurt i shaded my eyes on the road from tabuks ford i could see the cart of tup ladletender the itinerant peddler he between its handles bent over drawing it i looked at my hands they were raw and blistered and dirty i moved my finger inside the rope collar moving it out a bit from my neck wiping sweat and dirt from under it the rope scratched my neck but i must wear it it was token of my slavery the day begins early before dawn when melina loosens the padlocks on our cage we climb out and kneel before her our heads to her feet she holds the switch over us she is our mistress verr are to be milked the eggs of vulos gathered and the sleen must be watered and fed and their cages cleaned in the middle of the morning we return to the hut of thurnus where pans of slave gruel have been put out for us beneath the hut this gruel must be eaten and the pans licked clean in the manner of peasant slave girls we kneel or lie upon our bellies and may not use our hands after our meal the true work of our day begins there is water to be carried wood to be gathered and fields to be tended many and various and long are the tasks of a peasant village upon slave girls do most of these tasks devolve we must do them or die sometimes the boys surprise us in the fields and tie us together and rape us it does not matter for we are only slave girls it seemed every bone in my body ached ten days ago thurnus had used me for plowing he did not own bosk girls are cheaper than bosk it was the first time i had felt a whip i had been hitched with the other girls and together sweating we had labored naked in the traces under our masters whip slowly leaning forward our feet digging into the earth we had pitted our strength against the restraining band of the harness and slowly the great blade had begun to move through the deep soil turning it for our master after a few yards i thought i might die who would know if i did not put my full strength upon the trace it was then that i first felt the whip it was not the fivebladed slave whip invented for the full and perfect punishment of an erring slave girl but only a light onebladed bosk whip little more than a switch of leather a mere incitement and encouragement to better performance on the part of a slacking plow beast but it struck my back like a hot snake and a rifle shot i could not believe what it felt like it was the first time i had ever been struck with a whip come dina pull harder said thurnus yes master i cried hurling myself against the trace he had not been angry my back felt as though it had been lashed with a hot cable i could not believe the pain of the whip i could not even conjecture what it would be to feel a true slave whip on my body yet i knew a girl could be subjected to a full and lengthy lashing by the true slave whip for so small a thing as having failed in some way that she might not even understand to be completely pleasing to a master indeed she could be subjected to such a lashing for no other reason than that it pleased the master to do so i had now for the first time the former judy thornton felt a whip i groaned in misery i now had a new insight into the condition of my slavery i would do anything eagerly the masters wanted but in less than an hour i had collapsed in the traces unconscious i dimly remember thurnuss hand on the back of my neck and sandal thongs saying do not kill her thurnus can you not see she is only a pretty slave that she is only for the pleasure of men and not for the fields we can pull the plow without her master said turnip we have done it many times before said radish do not break her neck master pleaded verr tail thurnuss hand left the back of my neck i remember him tying my hands behind my back and tying my ankles together and leaving me in a furrow i then again lost consciousness that night thurnus carried me bound over his shoulder back to the village and threw me down between the pilings of his hut what is wrong asked melina this one is a weakling said thurnus i will kill her for you said melina she drew from her coarse robes a short knife i rose on one elbow naked and bound helpless in the dirt at her feet i regarded her with horror she approached me with the knife please no mistress i wept go into the house woman said thurnus angrily you are the weakling thurnus snapped melina she then put away the knife and stood up it was a mistake to have followed you she said he looked at her without speaking you could have been a caste leader for a district she said instead i am only the companion of a village leader i could have companioned a district leader you stink of the sleen you train and the girls you own there were slaves present and yet she so spoke you are a weakling and a fool thurnus she said i despise you go into the house woman he said angrily melina turned and climbed the steps into the hut at the top of the steps she turned you do not have much longer to give orders in tabuks ford thurnus she said then she disappeared into the hut untie dina said thurnus and take her to the cage yes master said his girls poor little dina said thurnus looking down at me as the ropes were removed from my small limbs you make a very poor shebosk he said then he grinned then he turned away i struck angrily down at the ground with the hoe of course i made a poor shebosk it was not my fault i was not a female bosk like so many of the lasses of peasant stock marla and chanda and donna and slave beads would have been no better and i did not think lehna or eta would have been much better either how i would have loved to have seen maria try to pull the plow she would have done no better than i angrily i hoed the suls i was healthy and vital but i was not large not strong i could not help that it was not my fault i was small and slight and weak i could not help that it was not my fault i was perhaps beautiful but beauty availed nothing when one felt the weight of the plow at ones back and knew that behind you the master was lifting his whip thurnus was disappointed in my weakness i chopped down angrily at the ground with the hoe it was hard for me even to carry water to the fields struggling under the great wooden yoke over my shoulders with its attached buckets sometimes i fell spilling the water and i was slow the other girls who were my friends did parts of my heavier work and i in turn did much of the lighter work which was theirs yet i did not like this for it was harder on them i wanted to do my share it was only that i was weak that i was not a good peasants girl sometimes in the fields i hated clitus vitellius it was he who had left me in a peasant village he had made me love him conquering me to the last cell of my body and had then laughing given me to a peasant he knew the sort of girl i was delicate and sensitive slight and beautiful from earth and then he had to his amusement put me to harsh weighty slavery in a peasant village giving me to thurnus i struck down at the aids how i hated clitus vitellius i looked up again the cart of tup ladletender the itinerant peddler was now much farther down the road on the dirt road leading to the great road formed of blocks of stone leading to ar i was thought little of in the village though my cage sisters were kind to me i was not big enough or strong enough to be a good peasants girl i hated peasants what idiots they were there were better things to do with a beautiful slave girl than hitch her to a plow the village is not a good place for you dina turnip had once said to me you are a city slave you should be at a mans feet in the secrecy of his compartments collared and chained curled and purring like a content shesleen perhaps i said i would curl and purr at the feet of thurnus had said the large sandal thong we had all laughed but she had not been joking it seemed strange to me to think of the large sandal thong wanting to submit to the domination of a man yet she too i reminded myself was a woman because of my slightness of strength thurnus had had me help him often with the sleen some of the animals i grew to know but on the whole i feared the sleen and they sensing this were unusually vicious with me are you good for nothing had asked thurnus in exasperation i had backed away from him in the sand of the training pit where we had been working the sun bad been hot and the sand was hot it had not rained in several days the satarna was in danger of drought thurnus took me by the arms and shook me you are good for nothing he said angrily i had shuddered in his touch what is wrong he asked i averted my eyes shamed forgive me master i said but i have not been touched by a man for several days and i am slave ah he said i turned my eyes to him i looked up at him he was very large perhaps master would care to rape his slave i said does the slave beg slave rape he asked yes master i said suddenly clutching him yes yes i could not control myself he flung me back in the sand thrusting up the tunic over my breasts i lay at the foot of a slave cage he seized me and i reached hack for the bars of the slave cage and holding them cried out i twisted and squirmed with the pleasure of his having me once i cried out with misery for i saw melina watching from behind the wooden wall it is the mistress master i said he laughed i do what i please with my slave girls he said let her watch should she please to do so let her find excellent instruction in the behaviors of a hot slave but melina angrily had left i then again yielded to the pleasures of him moaning to the master a slave girls gratitude he had deigned to touch me when he had done with me i knelt at his feet whimpering i kissed his feet thank you master i said he laughed and lifted me up and looked at me and then in great humor flung me to the sand at his feet from where i looked up at him i see dina he laughed that you are good for something after all i looked down shyly thank you master i said it was now late afternoon the cart of tup ladletender was now disappearing in the distance a bit of dust rising behind its wheels he had done slave assessment on me this morning it was this morning that i had first discovered that i was a whore but i suppose that every slave girl must be at least a whore and a marvelous one he had not had me but i had in his assessment tried to present myself to him well i wondered if i would see him again it had begun this way remain behind dina had said melina companion of thurnus the other girls had left the village to carry water thurnus himself was gone he would not return until late he was visiting another village to buy vulos i was frightened of melina she was mistress too once she had prepared to kill me on the day when i had failed in the plowing too she had seen me in the arms of thurnus yet she had not of late threatened me and i supposed she was fully aware that thurnus used all his girls radish was used more than i surely melina knew this only sandal thong was seldom raped yes mistress i said apprehensively i knew melina did not like me but i did not think she hated me more than the other girls i was certainly not thurnuss favorite he preferred larger wider hipped larger breasted women than i more of the sort that melina might have been at one time before in her freedom she had gone slack and fat come over here pretty little bird had said melina gesturing to me she stood among the pilings of the hut in the shade i the earthgirl slave obeyed her i went to her and for she was free and i slave knelt deferentially before her my head down remove your tunic dina she said yes mistress i said i slipped the short woolen tunic over my head i was now naked go to this piling she said indicating one of the pilings and kneel there facing it i did so closer she said put your knees on either side of it and put your belly against it yes mistress i said do you like our village she asked oh yes mistress i said put your arms around the piling she said and cross your wrists palms up i complied are you happy here she asked oh yes mistress i said would you like to leave our village she asked oh no mistress i said then i added hastily unless it be mistresss will she removed a bit of cord from her robes i felt my wrists lashed together on the other side of the piling they were tied very tightly will that hold you she asked yes mistress i said she stepped back from me she looked at me and then she went up the stairs into her hut and soon returned with a coil of rope she tied one end of the rope on my rope collar and then leaving me about a foot of slack tied the rope about the piling at the level of my neck the rest of the rope depending from the piling she let fall to the dirt i looked up at her you are a pretty one she said because of the rope on my neck i could not stand at the piling quite pretty she said thank you mistress i said i was secured naked on my knees at the piling i was her prisoner a peddler she said is in the village i knew this his name was tup ladletender radish had told me this i had seen his arrival he drew a handcart it had long handles and two large wheels in the cart were many shelves and racks on which there was a rich miscellany of cheap goods and pegs and loops from which hung many utensils pans and tools drawers in the side of the wagon contained too mysteries of goods such as threads cloths scissors thimbles buttons and patches brushes and combs sugars herbs spices packets of salt and philtres of medicine no one knew what all might be contained in that unusual cart i am going to fetch him said melina to take a look at you at the piling my heart leaped melina was going to sell me off i thought while thurnus was out of the village present yourself to him well you little slut warned melina or i will switch you to within an inch of your life i will mistress i promised indeed i would when might come another chance to escape the slavery of the village i would do anything to escape peasant slavery present myself well indeed i would be a wonder to him of obedient sensuous female flesh then suddenly i was afraid what sort of man was he different modalities of wench excite different men i wanted to be exactly what he wanted i was desperate to be exactly what he wanted but what would he want what a whore you are i thought to myself my wrists squirmed in the bonds in which melina had fastened me i did not know what he would want would he want a quiet timid girl one to throw to his feet and abuse would he want a lascivious wench begging to reach him with her tongue would he want an angry defiant girl to be brought to her knees in docility and surrender or would he want perhaps a cold girl haughty icy with contempt to be turned into a writhing slave screaming piteously for his touch i did not know one thing i knew was that i would be presented beautifully physically to him melina had seen to that she was a clever shrewd woman a girl is most beautiful when she is naked save perhaps for a collar or chain and i was tied kneeling in submission position and my knees were thrust apart by the piling about which my hands were tied against which my belly was thrust this would suggest perhaps only subconsciously my vulnerability my penetration and the massiveness and irresistibility of masculine power to which i a slave girl must helplessly submit too my hands tied as they were contributed to the carefully calculated effect when i raised them tied as i was the softness of their palms was brought against and about the piling in an intimate clasp the piling thus would be embraced and held beautifully lastly there was a rope on my neck long a tether this might easily suggest again perhaps only on a subconscious level that i might be removed from the post have my hands tied behind my back and be led away like a tethered tabuk doe to the masters pleasure such a rope might easily be looped on the back of a wagon and i would follow naked barefoot behind the wagon in the dust melina was clever this is the slave said melina startled suddenly frightened i clutched the post it was an involuntary reaction but tied as i was i could not have helped but seize it beautifully i then realized melina had wanted to startle me from the direction from which she had approached and the suddenness of her assertion the man had seen the reaction of a beautiful startled slave girl bound at a post it had been completely natural melina had intended that it would be i decided that i would be an earthgirl slave the desirability of whose flesh was being assessed tied in a peasant village i did not know what else to do and that is what i was on this world i was a beautiful barbarian and alien from a world quite different one which had not prepared me for their world perhaps gorean men might find it of interest to own and tame and train me earth girls i had heard from eta made superb slaves i supposed it was true how are you little vulo he said well master i said she is barbarian he said oh said melina she knew i was barbarian open your mouth said the man i opened my mouth see he said to melina he had his fingers in my mouth opening it widely in the back tooth on the top on the left he said a tiny bit of metal physicians can do that said melina are you from a place called earth asked the man yes master i said see he asked melina clever slave said meina i feared i would be switched i am tupelius milius lactantius of the lactantii of the merchants of ar he said to me but we fell upon hard times and i though only eight at the time fell as well it being my duty caste discipline family pride and such i smiled she smiles well he said in the villages i am known as tup ladletender he said what is your name what do you think of her asked melina the man regarded me she is obvious collar meat he said i felt shamed at the post it was obvious to the eyes of a gorean male that i was a slave it was only a question as to my price and to whom i would belong is she not pretty asked melina in the cities said he such girls are numerous in ar alone each year thousands of such girls are vended and procured in the slave markets i shuddered what is her value demanded melina i could get for her at best he conjectured only a handful of copper tarsks i knew that i was a beautiful slave what i had not realized was that slave beauty was so plentiful on gor beautiful slaves are not unusual on this world beauty in collars was cheap on gor girls more beautiful than i often slaved in the kitchens of great houses or in state tunics and chains scrubbed the floors of public buildings at night melina was not pleased do you not want her she asked he caressed my flanks and i held the post she is not without interest he said suddenly without warning he touched me and i cried out my body thrusting against the post my hands clutching it my eyes closed i could not help myself ah he said i opened my eyes startled she is a hot slave he said that is good that is very good how hot is she asked melina again he touched me and i cried out miserable bound i could not help myself he laughed very hot he said he laughed then he said steady little vulo please master dont i begged then i cried out and began to writhe at the post my fingernails tore at the wood stop i wept please stop master he withdrew his hands and i shuddered against the post fearing only that he might again so touch me he stood up how hot is she asked melina she is hot enough to be a paga slut he said excellent said melina yet said he still i think i could get only tarsks for her why is that inquired melina the wars he said the raids the falls of cities there are many beauties many of them even formerly free who find themselves upon the block these days being sold for a pittance of tarsks but are they as hot as this one demanded melina yes many of them he said brand a girl put her in chains give her a bit of training and in a week she is panting hot and ready for a master so soon asked melina yes he said take a woman any woman not just these earth girls who are slave meat but any woman even one who is gorean and free and of high caste even one who is an iceberg lock a collar on her which she cannot remove teach her she is a slave and she will turn to fire melina laughed i reddened bound at the post how grievously had the women of earth been slandered did they not know i was a woman of earth of course they knew how casually how unthinkably they spoke in the presence of a slave i but i wondered if it were true if it were true in gorean law it could be no slander lock a collar on her said the man putting his hands about my neck as though they were a collar i tensed my throat collared in his hands i knew he could crush my throat easily with his gorean strength did he choose i felt very helpless he removed his hands from my neck and put them in my hair he tightened his hands and pulled my head back teach her she is a slave he said i cried out as he tightened his hands further in my hair and pulled my head back further he caused me only enough pain to let me know what he could do to me if he chose involuntarily i shuddered acknowledging him as male and master he removed his hands from my hair i tensed at the post i felt his hands at my flanks and he said chuckling she will turn to fire he touched me and i cried out tears in my eyes biting at the wood with my teeth hot enough to be a paga slut said melina yes he agreed the women of earth had been pronounced slave meat i wept if this were true it was in gorean law no slander i hoped that he would not touch me again the women of earth are slave meat i thought i am a woman of earth i clung to the post slave meat pretty slave meat he said gently touching my flanks i wondered if all the women of earth were slave meat i knew only that i undeniably was such perhaps others were not let other girls in their secret heart ask themselves that question they need tell no one the answer to that most private and revealing of questions unless perhaps they meet one before whom they can speak only the truth their master perhaps the matter is hormonal perhaps there are hormones which fit a girl for slavery as there are hormones which fit a man for mastery i do not know only on gor had i felt my true femaleness and that in the presence of gorean males who owned or could own me men capable of owning a woman as most men of earth simply are not my femaleness had been suppressed on earth first by my own conditioning the confused product of centuries of intellectual and social pathology and secondly by the set of societal institutions in which i had grown up and existed rather than lived institutions to which sexuality was irrelevant if not inimical it is difficult to know what would constitute a good society perhaps it would be a necessary condition for such a society that its institutions would be compatible at least with the truths of biology a society which sickens and weakens its members which cripples them and denies them to themselves is not obviously superior to a society in which human beings are organic and whole healthy and happy and great the test of a society is perhaps not its conformance or nonconformance to principles but the nature and human prosperity of its members let each look about himself and judge for himself the success of his own society man lives confused in the ruins of ideologies perhaps he will someday emerge from the caves and pens of his past that would be a beautiful day to see there would be a sunlit world waiting for him there is perhaps little to be said for the gorean world but in it men and women are alive it is a world which i would not willingly surrender it is a very different world from mine in its way i suppose it is worse in its way i know it is better it is its own place not anothers it is honest and real in it there is good air who is your master little vulo asked tup ladletender of me my master is thurnus i said caste leader in tabuks ford of the caste of peasants one who makes fields fruitful and is too a trainer of sleen i was proud of thurnus who owned me a peasant who is actively engaged in agricultural pursuits is spoken of as one who makes fields fruitful sometimes this expression is applied too to peasants who are not actively engaged in such pursuits as an honorific appelation whereas caste membership is commonly connected with the practice of an occupation such as agriculture or commerce or war there can be of course caste members who are not engaged in caste work and individuals who do certain forms of work who are not members of that caste commonly associated with such work caste commonly though not invariably is a matter of birth one may too be received into a caste by investment normally mating takes place among caste members but if the mating is of mixed caste the woman may elect to retain caste which is commonly done or be received into the caste of the male companion caste membership of the children born of such a union is a function of the caste of the father similar considerations in certain cities hold of citizenship caste is important to goreans in a way that is difficult for members of a noncaste society to understand though there are doubtless difficulties involved with caste structure the caste situation lends an individual identity and pride allies him with thousands of caste brothers and provides him with various opportunities and services recreation on gor is often associated with caste and tournaments and entertainments similarly most public charity on gor is administered through caste structure the caste system is not inflexible and there are opportunities for altering caste but men seldom avail themselves of them they take great pride in their castes often comparing others castes unfavorably to their own a goreans caste by the time he reaches adulthood seems to have become a part of his very blood and being the average gorean would no more think of altering caste than the average man of earth would of altering his citizenship from say american to russian or french to chinese the caste structure in spite of its many defects doubtless contributes to the stability of gorean society a society in which the individual has a place in which his work is respected and in which he can plan intelligently with respect to the future the clan structures are kinship groups they function on the whole given mating practices within the caste structure but they are not identical to it for example in a given clan there may be though often are not individuals of different castes many goreans think of the clan as a kinship group within a caste for most practical purposes they are correct at least it seldom does much harm to regard the matter in this way clans because of practical limitations on mobility are usually associated substantially with a given city the caste on the other hand is transmunicipal or intermunicipal these remarks would not be complete without mentioning home stones perhaps the most significant difference between the man of earth and the gorean is that the gorean has a home stone and the man of earth does not it is difficult to make clear to a nongorean the significance of the home stone for the nongorean has never had a home stone and thus cannot understand its meaning its reality i think that i shall not try to make clear what is the significance to a gorean of the home stone it would be difficult to put into words indeed it is perhaps impossible to put into words i shall not try i think this is one of the saddest things about the men of earth that they have no home stone what is your name little vulo asked tup ladletender of me my master has been pleased to call me dina i said if your master has been pleased to call you dina said ladletender then you are dina oh yes master i said quickly i had not meant to imply that my name might not be dina melina was glaring at me i am dina i said swiftly only dina the girl of my master those four letters in gorean as in english were my complete and only designation such matters lie entirely within the determination of the master pretty dina said ladletender thank you master i said do you want her asked melina she has rough hands said ladletender he pulled my small hands bound out from the post and rubbed his thumbs into my palms i shuddered you have rough hands dina he said i am a peasants girl master i said my hands were rough from digging and washing and holding tools i felt his thumbs rotating slowly in my palms they pressed in i thrust myself against the post eyes closed with lotions said he they may be softened so that they would be fit to caress men yes master i said i shuddered to think what his thumbs might have felt like in my palms had my palms been slavegirl soft make an offer for the little shesleen said melina ladletender touched my neck and put his finger inside the rope collar and pulled it out a hit from my neck you wear a rope collar he said it must be rough and unpleasant what pleases my master i said pleases me do you lie to a free man he asked oh no master i cried to be sure the rope collar was unpleasant and for that reason i did not like it but on the other hand i a slave was naturally desperately eager to please thurnus who was my master it was his will to which mine must conform it was he whom i must please fully there was thus a sense in which what pleased thurnus pleased me i was pleased to please him did i not please him i might be summarily slain i was pleased to please him to please the master is what most pleases the girl she is trying to be pleasing said melina would you not like her naked in your furs she can be purchased cheaply how cheaply he asked cheaply she said does thurnus know you are selling her off he asked it does not matter what thurnus knows said melina i am free and companion to thurnus i may do what i wish would you like pretty dina said ladletender fingering my neck to have a pretty steel collar perhaps enameled i have never owned a collar i said nor would you then pointed out ladletender yes master i said humbled it was not i who would own a collar but i collared who would be owned the collar like myself would belong to the master it would be his collar i would not own it i would only wear it this rope is rough and coarse said ladletender fingering the rope collar would you not like a smooth steel collar one slender and gleaming or perhaps ornamented and cunningly wrought or enameled perhaps to match your eyes and hair one designed in color and workmanship to enhance your style of beauty one perhaps measured or customfitted to the beauty of your own slave throat whatever pleases the master i said i knew that a steel collar did immeasurably enhance the beauty of a girl i had much envied eta her collar though it had been plain i had seen few collars on gor but i had learned from eta that there was great variety among them they ranged from simple bands of iron hammered about a girls throat her head held down on an anvil to bejeweled wondrously wrought closelocking circlets befitting the preferred slave of a ubar such collars whether worn by a kitchen slave or the prize beauty of a ubar had two things in common they cannot be removed by the girl and they mark her as slave in the matter of collars as in all things goreans commonly exhibit good taste and aesthetic sense indeed good taste and aesthetic sense abundantly and amply displayed harmoniously manifested in such areas as language architecture dress culture and customs seem innately gorean it is a civilization informed by beauty from the tanning and cut of a workmans sandal to the glazings intermixed and fused sensitive to light and shadow and the time of day which characterize the lofty towers of her beautiful cities the same attention of course which the gorean bestows upon his own life and world is naturally bestowed upon his slave girls they too must be perfect just as in our world it is not uncommon to seek the advice of an interior decorator in obtaining and organizing the appointments of ones own dwelling so too in the gorean world it is not uncommon to call in a trainer and beautician to appraise and improve a girl he considers such matters as her hair its cut cosmetics appropriate to her the proper type of earrings a variety of collars and slave silks how she walks and speaks and kneels and so on and makes his recommendations commonly he finds an apparently plain slave discovers her latencies and leaves a beauty an apparently plain girl is a challenge to such a man they are said to be able to work wonders they are often employed in slave pens a common challenge to them is to take an apparently plain free woman recently enslaved and transform her into a ravishing imbonded beauty half the work however some say is done by the collar some say the collar releases the beauty in a woman perhaps it is true i had worn only a rope collar but yet it seemed to me that it even in its coarseness made me more beautiful more exciting when thurnus had tied it on my throat he had shown it to me in one of melinas mirrors i had almost fainted at the sight of it so exciting it had made me appear so sexually charged it had made me seeing my state he had used me immediately and i had my whole body helplessly to my amazement responded instantly to him he had collared me i dared not dream what my responsiveness would have been had the collar been not of rope which i might cut or untie but of true steel in which i would be helplessly locked in a sense i both desired and feared a true collar collared how could i resist any man make an offer for her said melina tup ladletender rose to his feet and reached into his pouch here little vulo he said he took something from his pouch and thrust it in my mouth pressing it between my teeth with his thumb depositing it in the side of my mouth i was startled kneeling in the dirt at the post my hands bound about it thank you master i said it was a small hard candy it was sweet i closed my eyes it was the first sweet i had had since i had been brought to gor in the plain diet of a slave girl such things are very precious girls would fight and tear at one another for a chocolate confections are commonly used by masters as rewards in the training and conditioning of their girls beyond this they may continue to function as control devices and incitements even a slave girl of many years never loses her taste for a bit of candy for which she may have to work for hours it is common to give the girl the candy while she is in a kneeling position putting it in her mouth for her on the other hand in training candies are commonly thrown to the girls sometimes too for the amusement of the master candies will be thrown to the floor among several girls to observe their struggle to obtain these prizes make an offer for her said melina why do you want to sell her off asked ladletender make an offer said melina perhaps he said looking at me is she not pretty demanded melina yes she is pretty he said imagine her collared naked in your furs said melina rubbing against you desperate to please you i am a merchant said ladletender if i buy her i buy her to sell her for a profit but surely you could richly use her before you sell her suggested melina ladletender grinned two copper tarsks he said a strange sensation came over me i realized a price had been offered for me it is a very strange feeling the price of course even for an earth girl such as myself was not realistic it was intended only to begin the bargaining surely i would be worth at least four or five copper tarsks in any market i will sell her to you for less said melina ladletender seemed startled i opened my eyes startled too i need something from your wagon she said she looked at me narrowly come away from the post she said to ladletender they left me tied at the post she and ladletender who seemed puzzled went to his wagon with the two long handles they conversed there i could not hear their conversation i sucked at the candy it was delicious i wanted it to last as long as possible i did move a bit about the post where i might look as though inadvertently at the pair of free persons at the wagon i was curious i was puzzled from one of the many drawers in the wagon tup ladletender gave into the keeping of melina companion of thurnus a tiny packet such as might contain a medicine or powder i then turned about at the post so that they would not know i had observed them and continued to relish the candy in a short time melina returned and untied me from the post and to my surprise removed the long rope though not the rope collar from my neck i had expected to be bound wrists behind my back and tethered by the neck of the rear of ladletenders wagon to follow him his slave girl naked and barefoot from the village put on your tunic said melina to me get a hoe go to the sul fields hoe suls bran loort will fetch you and bring you back when it is time speak to no one yes mistress i said hurry said melina looking about i donned the brief woolen slave tunic slipping it swiftly over my head melina seemed agitated may a slave speak mistress i asked yes she said have i not been sold mistress i asked perhaps pretty dina said melina companion to thurnus we shall see yes mistress i said puzzled tomorrow my pretty little shesleen she said you will belong either to tup ladletender or bran loort i looked at her puzzled go she said hurry speak to no one i turned about and hurrying went to fetch a tool the last of the candy dissolved in my mouth there was no one to speak to i chopped at the dry earth about the sul plant it had not rained in fifteen days and it had been dry too before that time the land was in drought tup ladletenders cart had now disappeared down the road leading from tabuks ford he between its handles bent over drawing it left behind now was not even a bit of dust it was late afternoon i was totally alone in the fields unprotected i did not understand much of what had happened to me i did not know why i had been brought to gor i had awakened naked and chained by the neck men had demanded slave beads of me i had not understood them they had prepared to kill me i had been rescued by clitus vitellius who had branded me and made me a slave he had toyed with me making me love him helplessly and had then for his amusement given me away how i hated him how i loved him always i would remember his hands upon me always in my heart i would be his slave girl i wondered if he ever called to mind the girl he had so casually contemptuously discarded of course not she was only a slave and he had his pick of women even free women who would wear a collar for his touch he would not remember me a slave he once briefly owned and sported with but i would remember him always i loved him i hated him always in my heart i would think of him as my master i so loved him and hated him if only i could have vengeance upon him how sweet it would be to subject him to the revenge of a scorned slave girl but what chance had a slave girl for revenge she was only slave i cut down at the suls viciously i thought of the strange dream i had had in which i naked and collared kneeling on tiles in a beautiful room as though in a palace had been strangely commanded to bead a necklace who commands me i had asked you are commanded by belisarius slave girl was the response the response somehow had seemed oddly fitting expected though i had known no belisarius what is the command of belisarius the slave girls master i had asked it is simple had said the voice yes master i had said bead a necklace slave girl had said the voice yes master i had said then my hands had reached toward the strands of thread on the table and toward the cups of tiny beads then i had awakened i had not understood the dream bran loort had been near the bars of the cage he had startled me i am going to be first in tabuks ford whispered bran loort when i am first he said melina will give you to me he had then slipped away from the bars i had huddled in the straw trembling today i had thought that i was sold and perhaps had been but i did not know tup ladletender i knew had left the village without me i had been sent to the fields melina had purchased something from ladletender a packet containing a powder or medicine i was to say nothing bran loort would fetch me i had been told i was to remain in the fields until then i understood little of this i cut down at the suls i was to say nothing i was alone in the fields i lifted the heavy hoe with the stout staff and great metal blade again and again it was terribly hot work and hard my hack hurt my hands hurt my muscles ached i worked hard very hard for i was a peasants girl such girls are not treated gently if they do not do full work i did not wish to be whipped the sun was sinking my tunic was soaked with sweat my feet and legs were black with dirt and sweat the rope collar clung and scratched about my throat i stood upright in pain i was too slight a girl for peasant work i held the hoe breathing deeply my head back how i had wanted tup ladletender to purchase me to take me from the labors of the fields i would have been willing to be anything he had wanted at the post anything to interest him anything to escape tabuks ford but he and melina in their cleverness had manipulated me in such a way that i was unable to be anything but what i was an earthgirl slave whose passions put her helplessly at the mercy of men willing to be a whore i had been forced to be naturally myself a slave girl more helplessly a whore than any whore could be a slave girl must be at least a whore and a marvelous one at that being a whore is but a small step in the direction of being a slave girl but i did not care i would have done anything to escape tabuks ford a slave girl owns nothing she has nothing to offer a man but her service and her beauty she has nothing with which to pay but herself that is the way men want it i was sure that tup ladletender had found me appealing i did not know if he had bought me or not i bent again to my arduous labors suddenly i straightened myself bran loort i cried he stood a few feet from me a coil of rope in his hand my hands clutched the handle of the hoe he looked at me i flung it down a girl dares not raise a weapon against a free man some girls have been slain or had their hands cut off for so much as touching a weapon i have come to fetch you dina he said i looked about there was another peasant lad on my left he too carried rope i turned quickly four others were behind me another was on my right two others too appeared behind bran loort one of them carried too a coil of rope there was nowhere to run she is the clever girl who eluded us in the game of girl catch in the village said one of the lads greetings clever girl said another greetings master i said to him i extended my wrists crossed for binding to bran loort you are going to take me to my master i said he laughed i drew back my wrists i looked about fearfully the boys approached more closely closing about me i spun and ran but fled into the arms of one of the young males who roughly threw me back to the center of the circle i tried again to break the circle and was again caught and flung again to its center they were now close about me i extended my wrists crossed to bran loort bind me i said and take me to my master he smiled i trembled and shrank back before him almost into the arms of one of his brawny young cohorts are you going to rape me bran loort i asked and more said he thurnus will not be pleased i said tonight he said you will belong to me i do not understand i said tonight he said you will be a feast and a festival to us dina i trembled hold her said bran loort two boys held my arms ankleleash her both ankles he said this was done i stood before them ropes on my ankles put your arms at your sides said bran loort out a bit from your body i did so i then stood before them double wristleashed ropes placed knotted on my wrists the ropes on my wrists and ankles serving as leashes were cut from the coils of rope brought to the field the remainders of the coils swung in the hands of bran loort and one of his cohorts i knew i might be beaten with them you will obey said bran loort yes master i said remove your kerchief he said i lifted my leashed wrists and pulled away the kerchief shading my head freeing my hair pretty said one of the boys tear the kerchief said bran loort please i said i did not wish to destroy the kerchief it like the girl dina whom i was belonged to my master dina was responsible for it the master might not be pleased if it were torn or soiled dina might be beaten tear it said bran loort i with difficulty tore the kerchief the boys amused at my weakness drop it upon the ground and step upon it grinding it into the dirt said bran loort i did so with the heel of my leashed foot i was sure now that i would be beaten upon my return to the village i looked at the boys i realized suddenly i had more to fear from them than from the swift switch of an angry thurnus or melina their eyes terrified me my limbs were leashed i stood alone among them their prisoner i knew i must please them are you docile and cooperative asked bran loort yes master i whispered strip he said yes master i said i reached to pull the coarse brief tunic over my head i hoped they would be soon done with me but my hands held by the ropes on my wrists could not reach the bottom of the tunic my fingers struggled to reach it but an inch from its wool clinging about my thighs i tried again to seize the tunic but was prohibited by the ropes from doing so i looked at bran loort in alarm in protest strip he said he swung the coil of rope which he carried whiplike easily in his hand behind me there was another lad with such a coil of rope wildly i tried to seize the garment to pull it over my head but the boys would not let me touch it i struggled to get my fingers on the white coarse wool but i could not reach it are you docile and cooperative asked bran loort yes master i cried yes master strip he said again i tried to reach the garment but again was not permitted to do so then i tried to seize the garment at the neck and tear it away but the boys would not let my hands reach the garment you are a rebellious slave said bran loort no master i cried obey then he said i tried again to tear away the garment again i was not permitted to do so rebellious slave said bran loort suddenly the rope coiled held by the boy behind me hissed and cut into the back of my thighs oh i cried at the same time bran loort himself struck down at me with the rope he carried striking me across the shoulder and neck the boys yanked the ropes on my ankles and by their means and by means of those held by the other two boys those fastened on my wrists i was turned and thrown to my stomach in the dirt spreadeagled bran loort and the other lad struck me again and again with the ropes they carried and then i sobbing cut by the ropes marked even through the tunic was by the leashes on my limbs pulled to a kneeling position before him my arms held out from my sides there was dirt on the side of my face and on my body blackening and staining the sweatsoaked tunic i could taste dirt in my mouth bring her said bran loort i was jerked to my feet by the ropes on my wrists and stumbling dragged among them was conducted from the ml field the ruined kerchief and the hoe lay behind many are the clever things which may be done to a girl who is as i was fully limbleashed much sport had the cruel peasant boys with me they made me fall when they pleased and as they pleased sometimes they threw me forward sometimes backward sometimes they carried me face up or face down suspended between them sometimes they dragged me by an ankle or a wrist on my back or stomach or twisting sometimes they dragged me or made me walk where they wished though it might be through rocks or gravel i did not know if i could live so led we stopped once i was still clothed atthat time i was held by the ropes before bran loort i was covered with sweat and dirt i was gasping i was trembling shaken with muscular stress from the cruel march as well as with fear knowing myself fully in their hands not knowing what fate they might choose to inflict upon me we stood in the vicinity of a thicket of thorn brush of the sort which is occasionally used to wall camps you are still clothed said bran loort observing me let me tear away my clothes before you i begged that the beauty of a poor slave girl may be bared to you do so he said i cried out in anguish again the ropes would not let me strip myself you have apparently not yet learned your lesson he said please master i wept let the thorn brush strip her said bran loort no i cried by the ropes i was dragged into the midst of tenacious barbed brush that thicket of such i screamed with misery i begged mercy i was shown none the brush tore at my clothing and body rudely i was drawn through it i cried out throwing my head from side to side i kept my eyes closed that i be not blinded please masters i cried they did not see fit to show a girl mercy bloodied my body a welter of scratches and linear wounds i was pulled from the brush the earthgirl slave was now naked they hit me with the ropes and again we continued our journey they sang as they conducted me to the place of their feast on the grass by the stream there they held my wrists about a tree and striking many times put me under ropediscipline held against the tree feeling its bark with the side of my cheek weeping shuddering under the blows of the coiled rope i wondered what i had done to them that they should be so cruel to me they then took me and threw me to the grass on my back my ankles by the rope leashes tied on them held by two boys were pulled widely apart bran loort looked down upon me i realized then that i a slave girl had days ago eluded them in the game of girl catch i had in that game by my cleverness bested them i did not now feel clever i would now pay for my cleverness how foolish of a slave girl to attempt to best a free man does she not know she may someday come into his ownership i cried out bran loort was the first to have me come out thurnus called bran loort see what i have for you i lay at the feet of bran loort my knees drawn up on my side in the dirt my hands were tied behind my back i was naked and my body was covered with dried blood and dirt a rope knotted ran from my neck to his hand my cheek was in the dust i was cold and my body ached from the rope beatings and abuse to which it had been subjected i think i was partly in shock i could no longer cry the only flicker of feeling left in me was a fear of free men i a slave girl had once bested free men in the game of girl catch i had learned my lesson well never again would i try to best free men they were master i was slave come out thurnus called bran loort see what i have for you my head jerked as bran loort emphasizing his words drew on the rope tied on my neck i put my head down shoulders trembling thurnus come out cried bran loort i shuddered i lay in the dirt before the hut of thurnus it was night now and men stood about with torches there were the eight young men of bran loort and others too gathered from the village the free men and women were there and some slaves not yet caged for the night sandal thong was there and turnip and verr tail and radish melina had wanted them to see what was to occur there were no children present bran loort stood forward his staff in his left hand my neck rope in his right his eight young men stood near to him each with his staff ringing us were villagers and slaves all eyes turned to the doorway of thurnuss hut melina emerged from the hut and descended the stairs to the ground thurnuss hut was near to the center of the village near its clearing i could smell the sleen in the cool night air it was chilly my back and legs were covered with welts from the rope lashings i had been given my thighs were sore melina stood at the bottom of the stairs she too turned to face the opening i looked at bran loort he looked very splendid proud and strong a girls neck rope in his hand she proof of his manhood at his feet the staff he held was over six feet in length and some two to three inches in width i am going to be first in tabuks ford had bran loort once said to me i recalled too something else he had said when i am first he had said melina will give you to me come out thurnus called melina from the foot of the stairs below the hut i looked to the doorway of the hut it was dark empty the eyes of all looked at the opening to the hut thurnus did not appear men stood about with torches it was silent save for the crackle of the torches i lay bound the ropes on my wrists holding them closely behind my back were very tight i heard a sleen squeal from some eighty yards away behind the huts in the cage areas there was a change in the breathing of the crowd thurnus stood now in the entrance to his hut geetings thurnus called bran loort greetings bran loort said thurnus bran loorts heavily sandaled foot struck into my belly i cried out with pain on your knees slave girl said bran loort i struggled to my knees he took up the slack in the neck rope coiling it holding my head a foot from his thigh my vision blurred and then cleared i saw thurnus looking down at me he regarded me much and well had the young men of tabuks ford pleasured themselves with the girl from earth the former judy thornton now the helpless gorean slave girl dina i put my head down under the gaze of my master but i was not to be permitted this courtesy the rope bran loorts fist in it at my neck the knot under the left side of my jaw pulled my head up i was to be displayed to thurnus i have something here of yours said bran loort i see said thurnus she is a hot little slave he said juicy and pretty that is known to me said thurnus she kneels now at my feet said bran loort i see that bran loort said thumus swiftly bran loort then discarded the rope and with his foot thrust me to one side i fell sprawling in the dirt and turned lying on one side to watch bran loort stood with both hands on his staff one hand grasped in its center the other hand his left some eighteen inches below the center of the staff but thurnus had not moved no one stirred in the crowd i heard the crackle of the torches bran loort seemed for a moment unsteady he looked from one of his cohorts to another then he again turned to face thurnus who stood not speaking at the height of the stairs some six or seven feet above the level of the ground in the doorway to his hut i have abused your slave said bran loort that is what slaves are for said thurnus we took much pleasure in her said bran loort angrily did you find her pleasing asked thurnus yes said bran loort he gripped the long heavy staff more firmly standing ready then said thurnus it will not be necessary for me to beat or slay her bran loort looked puzzled surely you know bran loort said thurnus it is the duty of a slave girl to be fully and completely pleasing to men were she not so she would be subject to severe punishment including even torture and death should it be the masters wish we took her without your permission said bran loort in this said thurnus you have committed a breach of code it does not matter to me said bran loort neither a plow nor a bosk nor a girl may one man take from another saving with the owners saying of it quoted thurnus i do not care said bran loort what is it bran loort that separates men from sleen and larls asked thurnus i do not know said bran loort it is the codes said thurnus the codes are meaningless noises taught to boys said bran loort the codes are the wall said thurnus i do not understand said bran loort it is the codes which separate men from sleen and larls said thurnus they are the difference they are the wall i do not understand said bran loort you have left the shelter of the wall bran loort said thurnus do you threaten me thurnus of tabuks ford asked bran loort you stand now outside the shelter of the wall said thurnus i do not fear you cried bran loort had you asked of me my permission bran loort said thurnus indicating me with a gesture of his head willingly and without thought gladly would i have given you temporary master rights over her i lay in the dirt my hands bound behind my back the rope on my neck watching it was true what thurnus had said i could have been loaned to bran loort and would have had to serve him as though he were my own master but you did not ask my permission said thurnus no said bran loort angrily i did not before too you have done such things you and these others though not to the degree nor with the intent of this day it was true sometimes the boys had caught us thurnuss girls or those of others too and roped us together and raped us in the furrows of the fields but it had been done in the bullying rowdyism of their youth having slave girls at their mercy there had been no intent of insult or umbrage in it it had been the hot fierce innocent sport of strong young men powerful and excited who held brieftunicked branded girls in rope collars in their arms nothing more does a slave girl not expect slave rape some masters enjoy having their girls raped occasionally it serves to remind them that they are slaves this sort of rape is not uncommon in a peasant village it is usually taken for granted and ignored save perhaps by the abused girls but they are only slaves indeed it is sometimes encouraged to pacify young men whose natural aggressions otherwise might turn aside into destructive channels it is also regarded at times as an aid in helping young males attain their manhood if she pleases you run her down and take her son is a not uncommon piece of paternal advice in a peasant village i had heard this twice though it had not been i on whom the young man had been set verr tail had been caught and raped on her back struggling in the stream once and radish had been caught and forced to give pleasure between the sleen cages each of these young men had walked differently following their conquest i had shrunk back when they had approached i knew they were now men and i was only a slave these two young men were not among the cohorts of bran loort but what had been done today to me was clearly different in its intent and gravity from the casual expected fierce exhibitions of male aggression to which imbonded girls such as i must become accustomed i have been patient with you bran loort said thurnus we are grateful for your patience said bran loort he looked about at his cohorts grinning he set his staff butt down in the dirt i sensed that the codes were to be invoked what bran loort and his fellows had done exceeded the normal rights of custom the leniencies and tacit permissions of a peasant community commonly the codes are invisible they exist not to control human life but to make it possible the rapes of verr tail and radish interestingly had not counted as code breaches though in neither case had explicit permission for their conquest been granted by thurnus such permission in such cases was implicit in the customs of the community it did not constitute a taking from but a brief use of an enjoyment of without the intent to do injury to the honor of the master taking from in the sense of the code is not strictly theft though theft would be taking from taking from in the sense of the codes implies the feature of being done against the presumed will of the master of infringing his rights more significantly of offending his honor in what bran loort had done insult had been intended the gorean peasant like goreans in general has a fierce sense of honor bran loort had known exactly what he had been doing i am disposed to be merciful bran loort said thumus looking at me you may now request my permission for what you have done to this slave but said bran loort i do not request your permission i must then call the council said thurnus that we may consider what is to be done with you bran loort throwing his head back laughed as did his fellows why do you laugh bran loort inquired thurnus only the caste leader may call the council said bran loort and i do not choose to summon it into session are you caste leader in tabuks ford asked thumus i am said bran loort who has said this inquired thurnus i have said it said bran loort and he gestured to his fellows we have said it he added there were nine of them including bran loort they were large strong young men yes said more than one of them i am sorry said thurnus i had thought that you had in you the makings of a caste leader i am caste leader said bran loort in what village is that asked thurnus in tabuks ford said bran loort angrily have you conveyed this intelligence to thurnus of tabuks ford inquired thurnus i do so now said bran loort i am first in tabuks ford i speak for thurnus caste leader in the village of tabuks ford said thurnus he speaks it not so i am first here said bran loort in the name of thurnus he of the peasants caste leader of the village of tabuks ford said thurnus i speak he thurnus is first i am first cried bran loort no said thurnus bran loort turned white will it be the test of five arrows asked thurnus in this the villagers with the exception of the two contestants leave the village and the gate is closed each contestant carries in the village his bow the great bow the peasant bow and five arrows he who opens the gate to readmit the villagers is caste leader no said bran loort uneasily he did not care to face the bow of thurnus the skill of thurnus with the great bow was legendary even among peasants then asked thurnus it will be the test of knives in this the two men leave the village and enter from opposite sides a darkened wood he who returns to the village is caste leader no said bran loort few men i thought would care to meet thurnus in the darkness of the woods armed with steel the peasant is a part of the land he can be like a rock or a tree or the lightning that can strike without warning from the dark sky bran loort lifted his staff i am of the peasants he said very well said thurnus we shall subject this matter to grim adjudication the staff will speak the wood of our land will decide good said bran loort i noted that sandal thong had slipped from the crowd none other seemed to note her going slowly step by step thurnus descended the stairs from his hut melina eyes glittering stepped back from the foot of the stairs men and villagers all and slaves cleared a space near the hut of thurnus build up the village fire said thurnus men hurried to do this thurnus opened his tunic then pulled it down about his waist he flexed his arms and hitched up the skirt of the tunic higher in his belt until it was high on his thighs bran loort too did these things thurnus came to me and lifted me to my feet his hands on my arms is it because of your beauty little slave he asked that this has come about i could not answer him so miserable i was i could not stand without his holding me no said thurnus there is more involved here he turned me about and untied my wrists and unknotted the rope from my neck throwing it away i stood in my brand and rope collar before him i looked up at him he had been kind to me gag her and put her in the raperack he said to a man i regarded him startled as i was dragged from his presence i would be secured in the raperack the ready spoils for the victor i did not know why i would be gagged the young men of bran loort gathered about him encouraging him thurnus stood to one side not seeming to pay them attention with a cry of misery i was thrown onto the beams of the rack my left ankle was thrust into the semicircular opening in the lower left ankle beam and the upper left ankle beam with its matching semicircular opening was dropped and locked in place my other ankle was similarly secured in the separate matching beams for the right ankle the raperack at tabuks ford is a specially prepared horizontal stock cut away in a vshape at the lower end my wrists were seized and my hair and i was thrown down on my back wrists held in place and my head too by my hair in three semicircular openings a single beam with matching semicircular openings on a heavy hinge closes the stock it was swung up and then dropped in place and locked shut i was now held in the stock on my back by my ankles wrists and neck i could move very little i closed my eyes i opened them to see a man above me looking up and back my head down i saw a piece of cloth in his hand it was large i wept as it was wadded painfully in my mouth he then secured it in place with a narrow piece of folded cloth which slipped deeply between my teeth he then with another three scarves covering the bottom portion of my face one over the other completed the task of gagging the slave girl i could not utter a sound i did not know why i had been gagged my neck rested on the back of the semicircular opening in the lower beam it was painful i am judy thorton i tried to tell myself i am judy thorton i am an earth girl this cannot be happening to me but i knew i was only dina a gorean slave at the mercy of masters i turned my head to the side to see the combat i saw turnip looking at me her eyes were frightened then she looked away it could have been she in the stock radish was watching thurnus frightened so too was verr tail sandal thong was nowhere to be seen are you ready thurnus asked bran loort villagers had cleared a circle the fire was now high and one could see well will you not require a staff asked bran loort grinning perhaps said thurnus he looked at the eight cohorts of bran loort these fellows i gather said thurnus will not enter our competition i am sufficient onto the task of putting a slack fat fellow such as you under caste discipline grinned bran loort perhaps granted thurnus you will need a staff pointed out bran loort yes said thurnus he turned to one of bran loorts cohorts strike at me he said the young man grinned he smote down at thurnus thurnus seized the staff and suddenly with strength like that of a larl jerked the young man toward him at the same time kicking upward savagely blasting the fellow in the teeth with the heel of his sandal the young man reeling back blood spattering from his nose and mouth clutching at his face the staff in the hands of thurnus there were teeth in the dirt the young man sat dazed on the ground a good staff said thurnus must be one with which one can thrust and saying this looking at one young man he drove the staff like a spear into the ribs of another and slice added thurnus who then smote the first fellow whose attention was now on his struck fellow along the side of the face the first fellow fell in the dirt clutching his ribs i had little doubt that one or more had been broken the second fellow lay inert in the dirt blood at the side of his head but said thurnus a good staff must also be strong the young men stood tensed five of them and bran loort come at me said thurnus to another of the men enraged the fellow charged thurnus was behind him and smote down shattering the heavy staff across the fellows back he lay in the dirt unable to rise the staff had been more than two inches in diameter that staff you see said thurnus instructing the younger men was flawed it was weak he gestured to the fellow lying in the dirt his face contorted with pain scratching at the dust it did not even break his back said thurnus such a staff may not be relied upon in combat he turned to one of the four young men and bran loort give me another staff he said to one of them the young man looked at him and frightened threw him the staff not wanting to come close to him a better weapon said thurnus hefting the staff he looked at the fellow who had thrown him the staff come here he said uneasily the lad approached the first lesson you must learn said thurnus swiftly jabbing the staff deeply without warning into his stomach is never to give a weapon to an enemy the young man bent over retched in the dirt thurnus smote him sharply on the side of the head felling him he then turned to the other two young men and bran loort you should keep your guard up said thurnus to one of them who immediately warily raised his staff thurnus then smote the other fellow at whom he did not appear to be looking he turned watching the fellow fall into the dirt you too of course said thurnus should keep your guard up that is important the other young man he beside bran loort then suddenly struck at thurnus but thurnus clearly had been expecting the blow he parried it and slipped behind the others staff bringing up the lower end of his own staff the fellows face turned white and he sank away aggressiveness is good said thurnus but beware of the counterstroke thurnus looked about himself of the nine men only one bran loort now stood ready thurnus grinned he indicated the young men strewn about these others i now gather said thurnus will not enter our competition you are skillful thurnus said bran loort he held his staff ready i am sorry that i must now do this to you bran loort said thurnus i had thought you had in you the makings of a caste leader i am caste leader here said bran loort you are young bran loort said thurnus you should have waited it is not yet your time i am caste leader here said bran loort the caste leader must know many things said thurnus it takes many years to learn them the weather the crops animals men it is not easy to be caste leader thurnus turned away his head down to tie his sandal bran loort hesitated only an instant and then he struck down the staff stopped striking across thurnuss turned shoulder it had been like striking a rock bran loort stepped back too to earn the respect of peasants said thurnus straightening up retrieving his staff his sandal tied the caste leader should be strong bran loort was whitefaced now let us fight said thurnus swiftly did the two men engage with their quick staves there was a fierce ringing of wood dust flew about their ankles blows numerous and fierce were struck and parried bran loort was not unskilled and he was young and strong but no match was he for the grim and mighty thurnus caste leader of tabuks ford my master as well might a young larl with spotted coat be matched against a giant tawny claw ubar of the voltai at last bloodied and beaten bran loort lay helpless at the feet of thurnus caste leader of the village of tabuks ford he looked up glazedeyed some five of his cohorts two of whom had recovered consciousness seizing their staves edged nearer beat him cried bran loort pointing out thurnus there was a cry of anger from the onlookers the young men raised their staves together to charge upon thurnus who turned to accept their challenge stop cried a voice there were the shrill squeals of sleen sandal thong stood at the edge of the circle in each fist the leash a short leash of a sleen the animals strained against the leashed collars trying to creep forward their eyes blazing saliva loose and dripping from their jaws the wet fangs shining in the firelight on the first man who moves cried sandal thong i shall set a sleen the young men drew back melina cried out with fury throw down your staves ordered thurnus they looking at the sleen threw down their staves she is only a slave cried melina how dare you interfere she cried to sandal thong i freed her this afternoon laughed thurnus i saw no rope collar on her throat she had removed it when she had stolen away from the circle of the fire she stood there holding the sleen leashes a proud free woman in the firelight though she wore still the rag of a slave on your feet bran loort said thurnus the young man unsteadily stood up thurnus swiftly tore away the tunic about his waist and taking him by the arm rudely thrust him to the heavy rack where i lay helplessly secured here is the little slave you find so lovely bran loort said thurnus she lies before you helpless bran loort looked at me miserable she is a juicy little beauty is she not asked thurnus i recoiled on the beams so spoken of is she not a pretty little cake asked thurnus yes whispered bran loort take her said thurnus i give you my permission bran loort looked down go ahead urged thurnus take her i cannot whispered bran loort he was a defeated man bran loort turned away from the rack and bent down to pick up his tunic he went to the gate and it was opened for him he left the village of tabuks ford follow him who will said thurnus to the young men who had been his cohorts but none made to follow their former leader of what village are you asked thurnus tabuks ford they said sullenly and who is caste leader in tabuks ford asked thurnus sweating grinning thurnus they said go to your huts he said you are under caste discipline they withdrew from the circle of the fire i expected that they would tend his fields for a season melina had withdrawn from the circle of the fire returning to the hut she shared with thurnus let there be made a feast decreed thurnus there was a cheer but first thurnus my love said melina speaking now from the doorway of their hut let us drink to the victory of the night there was silence she carried a metal goblet and slowly in stately fashion descended the steps to the ground approaching thurnus she lifted the cup to him drink noble thurnus my love said she to him i bring you the brew of victory suddenly i realized what must be her plan melina was a shrewd clever woman she had counted on bran loort and his young men defeating thurnus yet in the event they did not manage this she had purchased a powder from tup ladletender the peddler had bran loort been victorious she had promised me to him but too i had been promised to tup ladletender in exchange for the powder were it successful in each plan dina the slave girl had been the bauble with which to bring about her will had bran loort been successful i would have been his ladletenders powder would then be unnecessary and would be returned to him if bran loort was unsuccessful then the way would be clear to use ladletenders powder and i of course bran loort defeated could then be straightforwardly tendered in payment for it the plans sharp alternatives excluded one another their common element was i as payment melina had planned well drink my love said melina lifting the cup to thumus drink to your victory and mine thurnus took the cup i tried to cry out but could not i struggled in the stock my eyes were wild over the heavy gagging that had been inflicted upon me none looked upon me i struggled in the stock i tried to scream i could utter no sound i wore a gorean gag do not drink it master i wanted to scream it is poisoned do not drink it is poison drink my love said melina i could utter no sound i wore a gorean gag thurnus lifted the cup to his lips he paused drink urged melina it is our common victory said thurnus yes my love said melina drink first companion said thurnus melina seemed startled then she said it is first your victory then mine my love thurnus smiled drink you first my love she urged my love smiled thurnus drink you first first you said she drink said thurnus his voice was not pleasant melinas face went white drink said thurnus she reached forth hands shaking to take the cup i shall hold the cup said thurnus drink no said she she put her head down it is poison thurnus smiled then he put his head back and drained the cup melina looked at him startled greetings lady said tup ladletender he had emerged from between the huts thurnus threw away the emptied goblet into the dirt it is a harmless draught he said tup ladletender and i as young men he said have fished and hunted sleen once i saved his life we are brothers by the rite of the claws of sleen thurnus lifted his forearm where one might see a jagged scar ladletender too raised his arm his sleeve falling back on his forearm too there was such a scar it had been torn by the claw of a sleen in the hand of thurnus the same claw in the hand of ladletender had marked the arm of thurnus their bloods had mingled though they were of the peasants and merchants he now has too saved my life said thurnus i am pleased to have had the opportunity said ladletender you tricked me said melina to ladletender he did not respond to her melina looked at thurnus she shrank back better said thurnus that the draught had been poison and you had drunk first oh no thurnus she whispered please no bring a cage said thurnus no she cried and a sleen collar he said no no she cried two men left the group let me be beaten with flails she begged set the sleen upon me come here female said thurnus she stood before him shave my head and return me in dishonor to my fathers village she begged his hands were at the shoulders of her robe he tore it down exposing her shoulders the shoulders of a female are apparently exciting to a man this fact is recognized in offtheshoulder formal evening gowns on earth the existence of such gowns if goreans were familiar with them except on slaves would be taken as more evidence of the fittingness and naturalness of enslavement for earth females she who wears such a gown begs in her heart to be owned thurnus protested melina he held her by the arms her shoulders bared he shook her slightly her head went back her shoulders were wide and strong and beautiful they would take a plow strap well yet every part of a female body is beautiful to a gorean a hand a wrist an ankle the back of a knee the turn of a thigh the sweet soft hair almost invisible and delicate below and behind the ear each part bespeaks the glory and wonder and promise of the whole i have heard gorean men cry out with joy at the sight of a woman there is little on earth to prepare the poor earth girl for the lust and desire with which she will find herself viewed on gor initially she is bewildered stunned and shocked then she is thrown on her back she makes swift adjustment she must it is the gorean world a truly mans world in which she is a woman the lust of gorean males has much to do doubtless with the robes of concealment worn in most cities by gorean free women they would not wish the casual inadvertent flirtation of an accidentally exposed ankle to lead to their hunt capture and enslavement slave girls on gor on the other hand when permitted clothing are usually dressed briefly and lightly that their charms be muchly revealed gorean men wish it this way that accordingly is the way it is thurnuss hands were on melinas upper arms now bared her robes pulled down from her shoulders he looked at her arms then he looked at her face the cage was brought a small sturdy cage tiny and tight and a sleen collar let me be killed thurnus she begged thurnus lifted the sleen collar before her with her hand she held it from her kill me instead thurnus she begged please put your hands to your side woman said thurnus she did so thurnus then looped the sturdy leather metalembossed sleen collar about her throat with an awl brought by a man he punched two holes vertically in the leather strap and thrust the twin buckleclaws through the holes he then took the long loose end of the strap for the sleen has a large neck thrust it through the four strap loops thick and broad and then with a knife cut off the portion of the strap which protruded beyond the last strap loop melina her shoulders bared stood before him wearing a sleen collar it had sewn in its side a heavy ring to which a sleen leash might be attached instantly she was stripped and thrown to the ground she looked up in fear at thurnus into the cage slave said thurnus thurnus she cried he crouched down and with the back of his hand struck her across the mouth leaving blood across the side of her face into the cage slave he said yesmaster whispered melina she crawled into the cage at a gesture from thurnus sandal thong surrendering the sleen leashes to a man who took the animals from the clearing came to the cage and with two hands flung down the metal gate to the cage locking her former mistress within there was a cheer from those about let there be a feast called thurnus caste leader of tabuks ford and in the feast fires let an iron be heated for slave branding there was another cheer in the tiny cage she who had been melina crouched down sleencollared her face miserable behind the bars clutching them with her fists she would soon wear the mark of a slave in her flesh men and women hurried about to prepare the feast at a gesture from thurnus radish turnip and verr tail ungagged me and freed me from the heavy stock they helped me from the stock and i by its head sank down to the dirt i could scarcely move i could still taste the heavy coarse sour wadding of the gag in my mouth i would not have believed so effective a gag was possible at that time however i had not worn the gorean slave hood with gagattachment verr was roasted and puddings made satarna bread was brought forth and heated sul paga poured freely at the height of the festivities the cage was opened and its occupant a former free woman whose name had been melina now a naked slave in sleen collar was ordered forth on her hands and knees a sleen leash was attached to her collar and she was marched as a shesleen crawling abused to the raperack in which i had been earlier confined therein she was fastened the beams locking her ankles and neck and wrists in place and as her left thigh was held by strong men branded by the hand of thurnus caste leader of the village of tabuks ford she screamed wildly branded and her thigh released cleanly marked moaned and twisted on the wood her head was then shaved then she wept her head back softly moaning held in place by the heavy beams forgotten as men and women returned to their feasting at thurnuss right hand sat tup ladletender on thurnuss left sat the free woman sandal thong whom he had earlier this afternoon freed she with the two sleen had boldly aided him in circumventing the concerted attack of bran loorts cohorts when they had been individually bested the feast was served by the village slave girls radish verr tail and turnip among them i was not forced to serve i lay near the rack on which the newly branded slave lay secured after a time she was quiet i could not conjecture the nature of her thoughts it did not matter they could only be those of a slave she the proud former mistress was now no more than i only another slave at the full mercy of men she was now no more than i nothing i looked upward and saw dark clouds in the sky racing across the faces of the moons there was a sense of moisture in the air this pleased me thurnus at the feast stood up he lifted a goblet of paga tup ladletender said he by the rite of the claws of sleen is my brother i lift my cup to him let us drink the villagers drank tup ladletender rose to his feet you have shared with me tonight your paga and your kettle said he i drink to the hospitality of tabuks ford there was a cheer the villagers and thurnus and ladletender drank and too this night said ladletender i drink to one with whom i do not share caste but that which is stronger than caste the blood of brotherhood thurnus he of tabuks ford there was another cheer the villagers all drank thurnus stood up again i ask this free woman said he indicating sandal thong for whom i muchly care to accept me in free companionship there was a great cry of pleasure from the villagers but thurnus said she as i am now free do i not have the right to refuse true said thurnus puzzled then noble thurnus said she evenly calmly i do refuse i will not be your companion thurnus lowered the cup of paga there was silence in the clearing sandal thong gently lowered herself to the ground and lay on her belly before thurnus she took his right ankle in her hands and holding it pressed her lips softly down upon his foot kissing it she lifted her head tears in her eyes let me be instead your slave she said i offer you companionship he said i beg slavery she said why he asked i have been in your arms thurnus she said in your arms i can be only a slave i do not understand he said i would dishonor you she said in your arms i can behave only as a slave i see said he caste leader of tabuks ford the love i bear you thurnus she said is not the love of a free companion but a hopeless slave girls love a love so deep and rich that she who bears it can be only her mans slave serve me paga said thurnus he handed the goblet to sandal thong she took it and knelt before him head down proffering him the goblet though she was free she served as a slave villagers gasped free women cried out scandalized thurnus set aside the cup have rope brought and collar me thurnus she said i am yours bring rope said thurnus rope was brought thurnus took the rope and regarded the girl she looked up at him collar me she said if i collar you he said you are again a slave collar me master she said thurnus wrapped the rope twice about her throat and knotted it sandal thong knelt before him his slave he seized her in his mighty arms and crushed her to him raping her lips with the masters kiss mighty in its lust and possession of the collared she and she clutched him helplessly crying out her head was back her lips were parted he had begun to tear the tunic from her with his teeth carry me from the light of the fire master she begged but you are a slave he laughed he tore the garment from her and threw her between the feast fires she looked up at him her eyes wild with the passionsubmission of the eager slave girl as master wills i she cried throwing her head and hair back in the dirt he leaped to her and between the feast fires did lengthy ravishment upon her her cries must have carried beyond the palisaded walls when he returned to his place at the feast she crawled to his feet his slave and lay there daring sometimes to touch him delicately on the thigh or knee with her fingers the feast continued late the clouds gathered further in the sky and i smelled moisture the moons were darkened by the skudding billows of vapor i think that i may have fallen asleep by the rack from my exhaustion and the pain of the beatings and rapings that i had endured but it was still dark when i awakened i awakened to the clear snap of slave bracelets on my wrists i looked up i looked into the eyes of tup ladletender i regarded my wrists they were confined in inflexible steel get up said he little vulo i struggled to my feet i stood there my wrists closely cuffed before me not more than an inch apart you are mine now little vulo he said master i asked yes he said you are mine now yes master i said i felt very strange so simply had i changed hands i looked about the feast had finished and most of the villagers had returned to their homes some lay about near the embers of the fires we stood near the rack on which the new slave she who had been the free woman melina lay captive thurnus was nearby and sandal thong and radish verr tail and turnip i name you melina said thurnus to the confined slave yes master she said he had much shamed her by giving her in slavery the name she had borne as a free woman she wore it now as the cognomen of a slave may a slave speak she asked yes said thurnus why have you had my head shaved she asked to return you as a shamed slave to the village of your father said he please keep me master she said why he asked that i may please you she whispered strange words from one such as you he scoffed i beg to be kept to please my master she said have you been bereft of your wits by the brand inquired thurnus i only wanted to be the companion of a district leader she said you are now anyones slave to whom i give or sell you he said yes master she said i did not move to become district leader said thurnus for it was your urging and intent that i do so had i sought the position it would have seemed to all that i did so for your ambition and to avoid the lashing of your tongue she squirmed on the raperack confined by the beams in misery in a mans own hut said he he must be master even though he has selected out for himself a companion it is the part of his companion to befriend and aid him not to insult and drive him i was a poor companion she whispered i will try to be a better slave if i choose to seek the leadership of the district said thurnus i will do so if i do not wish to do so i will not as master wishes said melina the slave you knew little of the matters of being a companion said thurnus i will study more diligently the matters of being a slave said melina you will begin in the morning when you are publicly whipped he said yes master she said he put his hand on her body at one time you cared for me she said yes he said that is true do you find my body of interest master she asked yes said thurnus and i am strong she said i can pull a plow by myself thurnus smiled keep me master she begged why he asked i love you she said you know the penalties for lying he asked i do not lie master she said i do love you one of the penalties which may in a peasant village be inflicted upon a lying slave girl is to throw her alive to hungry sleen i had little doubt but what thurnus might do this if he caught one of his girls in a lie how can that be asked thurnus i do not know she whispered it is a strange helpless feeling i have lain here in the stocks i have thought much tomorrow said thurnus you will have less time to think and more time to work long ago i loved you she said but as a free woman then for years i did not love you but despised you now again after long years i feel love for you only now it is the shameful helpless love of a bond girl for her master in the morning you will be whipped said thurnus yes master she said she looked up at him you are strong she said and masterful you are a great man whether you are a district leader or not my freedom blinded me to your manhood and your worth i saw you not for the things you were but for the things you might enhancing my own person become i saw you not as a man but as an instrument of my own perceptions and ambitions i regret that i did not in my companionship relish and celebrate what you were rather than an image of what you might become i never truly knew you i knew only the image of my own invention i never truly looked at you had i done so i might have seen you you were always a shrewd clever woman said thurnus there were tears in her eyes i love you she said i am putting you out into the village as village slave he said yes master she said at night you will be confined in a sleen cage during the clay you will feed on what men will throw you each day you will serve a different hut in the village yes master she said he looked down at her may i speak she asked yes he said may i not too sometimes serve my master she asked perhaps said thurnus he made as though to turn away please master said melina he turned to face her please touch your slave she said it is long since you have asked my touch said thurnus regarding her i beg it master she whispered she lifted her body in the stock i beg it we turned away as thurnus swiftly and brutally raped the slave girl in the stock when he had finished with her she lay gasping half shattered in the stock oh master she cried master she whispered be silent slave said thurnus yes master she said and the girl in the sleen collar was silent i looked upon her i suspected that never had thurnus wed her with such authority and force years ago doubtless she had been loved with the gentle tenderness accorded to free women this was the first time in her life i suspected that she had felt the uncompromising unbridled lust that may be vented on the helpless body of a female slave never before had she had an experience like this never before had she been so had she looked after thurnus startled confused awestruck bewildered enraptured i saw she wanted to cry out to him to beg him to return to her but she dared not for she was under discipline morning would be time enough for her to be whipped thurnus drew his tunic about him he looked at me under the eyes of a free man i knelt i have given you to tup ladletender he said yes master i said he was promised you in payment for the powder he gave to one in the village said thurnus the powder was used though it did not have the effect that one in the village had intended accordingly on behalf of one who was of the village who can no longer transact the affairs of business having fallen into the unfortunate state of slavery i on behalf of that person tender you to him in payment for the powder yes master i said my fists clenched in the slave bracelets i was tendered in payment for a small worthless powder i grew angry surely i was at least a few copper tarsks worth of slave girl but the powder was worthless i pouted but so too are you pretty little dina said thurnus he threw back his head and laughed yes master i said angrily he turned to sandal thong i pronounce you my preferred slave said he you will sleep in my hut and tend it a slave is grateful said she master too said he you are first girl as master wishes she said radish verr tail and turnip fled to her hugging her and kissing her we are so happy for you said turnip i am first girl said sandal thong i am so happy for you said radish fetch a switch said sandal thong sandal thong asked radish stunned fetch a switch said sandal thong yes mistress said radish hurrying away in a few moments radish returned carrying a switch which she placed in the hands of sandal thong kneel said sandal thong to the three girls they knelt in a straight line four horts apart facing the master she said she dressed their line straight she said she kicked back radishs knees backs straight hands on thighs bellies sucked in heads high she sad she tapped verr tail on the belly with her switch verr tail sucked her belly in tight she tapped turnip twice under the chin turnip lifted her chin in their eyes i could read their distress but they knelt beautifully under sandal thongs discipline here are your slaves master she said to thurnus excellent said thurnus he looked upon the three girls they dared not move a muscle i had little doubt but that sandal thong would richly switch any of them who disobeyed in the least or gave the least hint of disobedience thurnus grinned he began to suspect the wonders that he would now have from these girls you may cage them at your pleasure he said yes master said sandal thong in her love for thurnus she was determined that he would have the best from all his girls too i had little doubt but that when it was the turn of the village slave melina to serve the house of thurnus that she too would fall under the same strict discipline sandal thong switch in hand would see that melina served her master to perfection you may rise dina said tup ladletender to me i rose standing in close bracelets you may bid your former cagemate farewell said sandal thong radish verr tail and turnip came to me and wished me well hugging and kissing me i too wished them well slaves to your cage said sandal thong we must go to our cage said radish to me i wish you well i too wish you well i said i wish you all well the three girls hurried to the cage sandal thong switch in hand came to me she hugged and kissed me i wish you well dina she said i too wish you well mistress i said i addressed her as mistress for she was first girl sandal thong then turned and followed the other girls to lock them in the cage for the night thurnus came over to me and put his hand on my head and shook it i looked at him tears in my eyes the village said he is no place for you little dina the days are too long and the work too hard he looked at me you have the body of a pleasure slave he said you belong at the feet of men yes master i said come along slave said tup ladletender taking my arm he began to lead me away i stopped and turned pulling against his arm i wish you well master i said to thurnus you cannot even pull a plow he said i make a very poor shebosk i said you are not the shebosk he said but the meadow i put my head down reddening it was not mine to plow but to be plowed i wish you well little slave said thurnus thank you master i said i felt tup ladletenders band close more firmly on my arm will it be necessary to beat you he asked no master i said frightened and hurried on beside him his hand on my arm his cart with the two large wheels and the two long handles was near the village gate the gate was opened for us by its tender i expected to be tied to the back of the wagon that i might follow in its dust to my surprise he placed me between the two handles he removed the slave bracelets putting them in a drawer in the side of the cart i am too weak to draw the cart master i told him he removed two pair of wrist rings and chains from another drawer he locked one wrist ring from one pair on the left handle and snapped its matching wrist ring on my left wrist he then locked one wrist ring from the other pair on the carts long right handle and snapped its mate about my right wrist i was chained between the handles there was about a foot of chain between each wrist ring locked on its handle and its matching ring which clasped my corresponding wrist i cannot draw the cart master i told him i cried out as the whip cut my back i seized the handles and threw my weight against them bent over digging with my feet into the dirt i cannot master i cried the whip struck me again i cried out with misery and drew the cart i pulled tup ladletenders cart through the gate and out onto the dusty road leading from tabuks ford i felt a drop of rain then it began to fall lightly i looked up the billowing skudding clouds were swift in the night i could see the moons behind them then more rain splashed into the dust i felt it on my hair and naked body i pulled the cart then it began to pour and i slipped in the mud ladletender helped pushing at the wheels and cart at last we waited standing in the driving rain then he removed me from between the handles and together we sat beneath the cart the drought is broken said tup ladletender to me yes master i said after a time i said may i have a candy master i had not forgotten the candy he had given me beneath the hut of thurnus how sweet and good it had been it had been only a cheap hard candy but such things are rare in the lives of most slave girls they are very precious do you want it very much asked tup ladletender yes master i said he took me in his arms and thrust me back to the mud between the wheels of the cart i looked up at him earn it he said yes master i said reaching for him the rain drove down from the sweet dark sky in torrents one could scarcely see the trees and road i am an item of merchandise i swam out in the pool to the end of my neck tether and splashed in the water clean yourself well dina said tup ladletender you must be sparkling yes master i called to him i had knelt beside the pool and the rope on my neck washed my hair then i had been permitted to wash in the pool and cleanse my body the welts i had received from the beatings of bran loon and his bullies had healed i had only four marks on my body from the animal whip of tup ladletender with which he had encouraged me in my drawing of his cart these now had almost disappeared generally he disciplined me with a cuff of the flat of his hand i respected hint he managed me well i had been his slave for some two weeks we had visited various villages but on the whole we had made our way along the road to ar he must replenish his stores i was pleased that he had not sold me to peasants another fate i knew he had in store for me when we had come to the great road i had rejoiced it is broad fairly smooth and built like a wall sunk in the earth it is not hard to draw the cart on such a road my work thus was easier we could see villages here and there more frequently now too occasionally there were hostels and taverns on the road i enjoyed seeing caravans pass and villagers with their bosk wagons i feared the great tharlarion of the caravans often the animals wore belled harnesses once we were passed by a great slave caravan there were more than four hundred wagons with girls anklechained in them it was a caravan of mintar the great merchant another time we were passed by a smaller slave caravan in this caravan there were few wagons and those there were showed scarring and marks of fire goods and wounded men lay in the wagons afoot between the wagons walked a chain of forty girls they were neck chained and their wrists were fastened behind their backs with slave bracelets their heads were down many were beautiful what occurred asked tup ladletender raiders from treve said a man with bandaged shoulder in one of the wagons the great road to ar is marked with pasang stones we had followed the road to within two hundred pasangs of ar then we had left it and for two days followed a side road the countryside was still relatively populated tup ladletenders cart was now at the hut of a villager whom he knew in the distance even from the pool i could see the white looming walls of the merchant keep stones of turmus a turian outpost licensed for the storage of goods within the realm of ar such outposts are not uncommon on gor they are useful in maintaining the security of trade their function is not military but commercial turia is one of the great trading centers of gor it lies far to the south in the middle latitudes of her southern hemisphere look dina said tup ladletender pointing upward i looked up and saw far overhead some four tarnsmen in flight they carried the yellow banners of truce they are bound i wager for port kar said tup ladletender whence they will take ship to cos i had heard there was fighting between ar and cos it having to do with the alleged support by cos accorded to vosk pirates the vosk is a mighty river which flows westward emptying into a vast rence delta finding its way eventually to thassa the sea the motivation of the hostilities was apparently mostly economic having to do with trade monopolies sought by both cities in the territories bordering the vosk ar claimed the southern shore of the vosk cos and the other major maritime ubarate tyros on the other hand had traditionally conducted trade through overland merchant connections with these territories i watched the tarnsmen disappear in the distance twice earlier on the great road to ar tup ladletender had pointed out tarnsmen in flight presumably messengers marlenus of ar and other ubars commonly employed such couriers the thought of clitus vitellius passed through my mind he had spurned me how i hated him i felt a tug on the neck tether i am coming master i called i swam in to the side of the pool ladletender handed me a towel my tether he tied to a tree i toweled myself you must sparkle dina he said to me yes master i said i looked up to the keep of stones of turmus in the distance i wondered how much i would bring i had never been sold before pay attention to your master said tup ladletender yes master i said tup ladletender handed me a widetoothed comb i began with long strokes to straighten my hair i continued to look at the keep of stones of turmus it was high and formidable it was within those walls that i would be owned we had stayed in a nearby village overnight in which ladletender had a friend his cart was there now i had not drawn the cart this morning i must be refreshed brush your hair said tadletender yes master i said after i had finished ladletender retrieved the brush and comb dropping them in his pouch he looked me over i blushed under gorean appraisal i wore only my tether stand as a slave he said i stood beautifully back straight head high belly sucked in hip turned no woman can stand more beautifully than as a gorean slave girl excellent said ladletender smacking his lips master is pleased i said yes he said the slave too is then pleased i said behold said he he drew forth from a leather bag nearby a sack such as vegetables may be carried in i looked at it i was puzzled it was folded it was small he removed the tether from my neck i shook my head and hair the bond removed he gestured to the sack it had been used to carry vegetables there was printing on it put it on he said i opened the sack in it were cut an opening for the head and two for the arms i drew it over my head it was snug with binding fiber he cinched it on my body he stepped back lovely he said it came high on my thighs there was a casualness about it a carelessness about the shoulders with respect to my figure but the binding fiber bound twice about my belly and cinched tight at my left hip accentuated my breasts and hips there was a hint of lusciousness concealed within so apparently negligent a wrapper it was well contrived psychologically to suggest a cheap but most tasty slut i reddened here said ladletender he held up a string of slave beads i smiled i reached for them not so fast said he i put down my hands he put the beads in his belt turn about he said i did so it is the man on gor often who puts jewelry on the female bedecking her it is not uncommon even for him should he have a piercedear slave to fasten her earrings on her i assumed tup ladletender would rope the slave beads on my neck fastening them behind my neck they were of wood and cheap and pretty i would be pleased to wear a decoration once i had nearly had my throat cut for my lack of knowledge of bina or slave beads i still did not understand why too once i had had a strange dream that dealt with slave beads a meaningless dream i had not understood in which i had been asked strangely to string such beads my hands were pulled behind me and locked in slave bracelets then as i stood helplessly braceleted tup ladletender roped the cheap beads about my neck he stepped before me you are beautiful dina said he thank you master i said he then turned away come along he said i stumbled after him barefoot wrists braceleted behind my back we soon took the road to stones of turmus in an ahn we had come to the great gate the high white walls loomed above me they were more than eighty feet in height i felt very small there were six towers on the walls two defending the gate and one at each corner suddenly i wanted to turn and flee but i was braceleted and nowhere on gor was there a place for a girl such as i to run i was slave a small panel in a small door built within the great gate slid open tup ladletender here said ladletender greetings ladletender said a voice recognizing him i am vending a girl said ladletender indicating me welcome tup ladletender said the voice the small door in the great gate opened and we entered the small door was then shut behind us perfume and silk i will give you four copper tarsks for her said the captain ten said ladletender six said the captain done said ladletender my body ached my wrists were confined in wrist rings fastened to a chain depending from a ring in the ceiling my weight was borne mostly by the wrist rings and chain the tips of my toes barely touched the stone floor i was naked i had been examined thoroughly in gorean fashion i was miserable and purchased i had been unable to resist the captains touch i had struggled shrieking for mercy twisting on the chain she needs a bit of taming said the captain but we manage that i hung upon the chain limp the steel cutting into my wrists my eyes were closed my body ached i heard tup ladletender paid his money it being counted out from a small iron chest in the office of the captain then he had left look at me slave said the captain i opened my eyes you are a turian girl now he said yes master i said i had been sold for six copper tarsks it was my worth on gor are you tame he asked yes master i said he went to his desk and from one of its drawers drew forth an opened slave collar it was unlike most of the gorean collars it was a turian collar most gorean collars decorated or not are basically a flat circular band hinged which locks snugly about the girls neck the turian collar on the other hand fits more loosely and resembles a hinged ring looped about the throat a man can get his fingers inside a turian collar and use it to drag the girl to him it does not fit loosely enough to permit its being slipped of course gorean collars are not made to be slipped by the girls who wear them he threw the collar to his desk i watched it strike the desk i had never worn a true collar before suddenly i was terrified that it might be put on me it locked i would not be able to remove it no master i said please do not put a collar on me he came to me and with a key unlocked the wrist rings i fell to the stone floor at his feet you do not want to wear a collar he asked no master i whispered he turned away from me i half sat half lay on the stone floor my legs to the side the palms of my hands on the stones my head down i did not watch him tup ladletender had left he had taken the bit of sacking i had worn and the slave beads and the slave bracelets which had confined my wrists all he had left behind was she who had been judy thornton six copper tarsks worth of sold sheslave i will make you beg to wear a collar said the man i turned and looked up frightened he loomed over me he held a slave whip no master i cried well did he punish me then for my insolence there was nowhere to crawl or run he whipped me as a gorean master at last i lay blubbering at his feet i think now you are tamed he said yes master i sobbed yes are you tamed he asked i am tamed master i wept i am tamed do you now beg to wear a collar he inquired yes master i cried beg said he i beg to wear a collar i wept he then fastened the collar on my throat it closed with an efficient metallic snap i collapsed to the stones he turned and left me placing the slave whip on the wall where it had hung convenient to hand he rang a bell a door opened and a soldier a guard appeared send for sucha said the captain there is a new girl i lay on the stones timidly when he was not watching but sitting behind his desk engaged in work perhaps entering my acquisition and price in his ledgers i touched the collar rounded steel and gleaming it was truly locked on my throat i was collared only the brand had made me before feel so much a slave i wept i was branded and collared i heard the jingle of tiny bells slave bells i became conscious of a womans feet bare near me the bells tiny in four rows were thonged about her left ankle a whip touched me prodding me in the back i shuddered get up girl said a womans voice i looked lip she wore a wisp of yellow silk her dark hair was bound back with a yellow silk talmit i stood up stand as a slave she said i stood beautifully a dina said the woman her own brand was the customary kajira brand the initial letter in cursive gorean script about an inch and a half high and a half inch wide of the expression kajira the most common gorean expression for a female slave it was clearly visible on her thigh the wisp of silk she wore made no pretense to cover it i am sucha said the woman yes mistress i said why were you whipped asked sucha i asked not to be put in a collar i whispered remove it she said i looked at her puzzled remove it said the woman i tried to pull the collar from my throat i jerked it against my neck until i cried i struggled to force it apart i turned the collar and with my fingers tore at the lock it remained obdurately perfectly inflexibly fastened i looked at the woman with agony i cannot remove it i said that is true slave girl she said and do not forget it yes mistress i said what were you called she asked dina i said sucha looked at the captain it is acceptable he said for the time then said sucha until masters wish otherwise you will remain dina yes mistress i said follow me dina she said i followed her she too wore a turian collar the girls of the wagon peoples too i understand wear such collars we walked along a long passage then we left that passage and took others we passed numerous storerooms closed by barred gates at one point we passed through a heavy iron door watched by a guard on the other side of the door she said precede me dina yes mistress i said i preceded her we walked along another long passage it too was lined with barred gates giving access to storerooms you are very beautiful mistress i said over my shoulder do you wish to feel my whip she asked no mistress i said i was then silent i knew why i was now preceding her it was fairly common gorean custom we must be nearing the slave quarters if i should now turn and flee she was behind me to stop me with the whip sometimes new girls become frightened at the entrance to their slave quarters there is something fearful about being locked within as a slave are you tamed i asked her there was a pause then she said yes we walked on we are all tamed girls here she said we have been taught our collars men can tame us i wept men tame girls or not as they please said sucha it is their will which determines the matter some men do not tame their girls quickly in order to tease and play with them longer but the girl if she is not a fool knows to whom it is in the end that she belongs in the end it is the man who holds the whip this the girl knows in the end when the master wishes we crawl into his arms docile and tamed we are women we are slaves i hate men i cried speak softly lest you be whipped cautioned sucha do you not too hate men i demanded i love them said sucha i cried out in anger i turned about i am not tamed i cried i will never be tamed tell it to the masters said sucha i shuddered you are tamed said sucha yes i said miserably i have been tamed i had been tamed since the first gorean male had touched me long ago when i had worn a chain and collar in a gorean field something instantly in me had told me who were my masters and i remembered clitus vitellius and thurnus and the captain strict with me in his office i touched the turian collar which i wore looped and locked about my neck tamed girl said sucha yes said the former judy thornton now the slave dina i am tamed i knew i must obey men here said sucha is the entrance to the kennels of the female slaves i shrank back the door was small and thick and iron some eighteen inches by eighteen inches square enter said sucha she stood behind me with the whip i turned the handle on the tiny door and falling to my belly squirmed through sucha followed me within we stood up i gazed about myself with wonder the room was lofty and spacious it contained numerous slender white pillars rich hangings it was tiled in purple and there was in it a scented pool the walls were glossy and richly mosaiced with scenes of slave girls at the service of their masters i uneasily touched the collar at my throat light filtered down from narrow barred windows set high m the glossy mosaiced walls here and there about the pool lay indolent girls not set to work they regarded me appraising my face and figure doubtless comparing it to their own the room is beautiful i said kneel said sucha i knelt you are dina she said you are slave now within the keep of stones of turmus this is a merchant keep under the banner and shield of turia that the keep was under the banner of tuna designated it as a turian keep distinguishing it in this sense not only from keeps maintained by other cities but more importantly from the free keeps maintained by the merchant caste in its own right keeps without specific municipal affiliations similarly the merchant caste which is international so to speak in its organization arranges and conducts the four great fairs which occur annually in the vicinity of the sardar mountains the merchant caste too maintains certain free ports on certain islands and on the coasts of thassa such as teletus and bazi space in a free keep is rented on a commercial basis regardless of municipal affiliation in a banner keep or one maintained by a given city preference if not exclusive rights are accorded to the merchants and citizens of the city under whose banner the keep is established and administered that the keep was also under the shield of tuna meant that it was defended by turians that its garrison was turian sometimes a keep will fly a given banner but its garrison will be furnished by the city within whose territory it lies it is not unknown for a keep to fly the banner of one city and stand behind the shield of another both banner and shield of stones of turmus however were turian stones of turmus was turian in the garrison there are one hundred men and five officers said sucha there are twenty men who are ancillary personnel a physician porters scribes and such the other girls in the room came casually to where i knelt before sucha there were several of them most were naked all wore turian collars a new silk girl said one i straightened my body it pleased me that they saw me as a silk girl there are twentyeight girls in stones of turmus continued sucha we come from nineteen cities six of us are bred slaves she is a pretty one said another girl i smiled teach her she is low girl said sucha one of the girls seized me from behind by the hair and threw me back to the tiles i cried out the other girls then swiftly kicked and struck at me i screamed twisting enough called sucha the beating had lasted no more than a brief handful of seconds perhaps no more than five or six seconds its purpose was no more than to intimidate me i looked up horrified my head still held down by the hair my leg was bleeding where i had been bitten release her said sucha kneel dina my hair released i knelt you are low girl said sucha yes mistress i said i was terrified i did not even dare look into the eyes of the other girls i could sense their readiness their eagerness on the least provocation to put me under slavegirl discipline there was a pounding on bars from several yards away i heard a mans voice it sounded authoritative especially significant in such a place we listened sucha carefully too the girl sulda he called is summoned to the couch of hak haran be swift sulda whispered sucha hak haran does not like to be kept waiting yes mistress said a stunning brunet her face suffused with pleasure hurrying away from us the girl hears and obeys called sucha it is well said the man i said another of the girls am never summoned except to the couch of fulmius the other girls laughed at her leave us said sucha the other girls some with last looks at me drifted away they do not like me i said you are very pretty said sucha it is natural for them to resent you i thought they were tamed i said they are tamed to men who are the masters said sucha but we are not tamed to one another i do not want to be hurt i said remember then said sucha that you are low girl please them conduct yourself with care among your sisters in bondage yes mistress i said get up follow me said sucha yes mistress i said i knew that slave girls were often left to impose their own order upon themselves masters usually not interfering in such matters the kennel rooms of slave girls could be jungles usually the strongest largest girl with her cohorts dominated order tended to be imposed by physical means the head girls too their dominance assured often did not impose a further order among the lesser girls leaving it to them to determine their own rankings squabbles among slave girls can be nasty in them there is likely to be much screaming and rolling upon the tiles vicious clawing biting kicking and hair pulling tend to figure in such feminine disputations even more shameful perhaps is the fact that the other girls find such contests amusing and encourage the contestants sometimes a strong girl even orders two friends to fight until one establishes a dominance over the other i have been beaten is the whimpered submission phrase of the loser clawed and frightened command me mistress she then whispers she must then serve the victor if she objects the matter is again subjected to physical adjudication in a closed set of kennels the order among the girls is usually meticulous and extremely precise i was low girl here is your kennel said sucha you will customarily be locked in here at night if you are not serving the men yes mistress i said it was a cell alcove off the large room with a small barred gate it must be entered and left on the hands and knees a girl thus cannot rush from it too in leaving it she is simple to leash perhaps most importantly she can enter or leave her place only with her head down and on her knees this involving a tacit mnemonic psychology reminding her and impressing upon her that she is a slave the cell itself was some eight feet deep and four feet wide and four feet high i could thus not stand in the cell its furnishings were only a thin scarlet mattress and a crumpled slave blanket of repcloth i trust you find the accommodations satisfactory she said yes mistress i smiled indeed it was the most luxurious cage i had seen it was dry and there was a mattress short of being chained on furs at the foot of a masters couch what more could a girl desire follow me said sucha yes mistress i said following her she took me about the pool to another room in walking about the pool she pointed out the gates of the kennels to me this is the rear gate she said it is that through which we entered it was small and iron there is no handle on this side i said no said sucha it may be opened only from the outside i recalled the other gate down the corridor which had been tended by a guard why then i asked was there a guard down the corridor sucha looked at me did you not see the side gates in the corridor she asked yes i said to guard them said sucha not us i asked she laughed we are the least valuable things in the fortress she said oh i said i continued to follow her but looked behind me at the small gate it was stout it could not be opened from our side beyond it in the corridor lay storage rooms for truly valuable merchandise worthy of having a guard posted in the passage i had passed earlier in walking through the corridors several storage rooms they had been locked but not individually guarded they held less valuable bulk goods i was angry that sucha had said we were the least valuable things in the fortress but then i remembered i had cost only six copper tarsks sucha walked past a small room and came to a short corridor leading from the lofty room in it was a large barred gate with another visible beyond it it had been on the bars of the innermost gates that the man had pounded when summoning sulda the slave to the couch of the man hak haran but there were now no soldiers or guards in sight both gates however were double locked with square heavy locks two keys would be required for each the gates were separated by about twenty feet an ornate corridor could be seen beyond with vases and carpeting i looked at the two heavy locks on the innermost gate they cannot be picked said sucha they are sleeve locks the sleeve prevents the direct entry of a wire or pick too within the sleeve there is a plug a rounded metal cone which must be unscrewed before the key can be inserted a wire or pick could not turn the cone is there anything i asked in the kennels which might serve as a stout wire or long pick one of suitable length to even try no said sucha i held the bars dismally you are an imprisoned slave said sucha come along with one last look at the heavy bars and locks i turned to follow her she led me to the small room we had passed earlier it was a preparation room for slave girls in it were mirrors in them i saw a lovely darkhaired girl naked in a turian collar myself followed by a beautiful woman darkhaired in a wisp of yellow silk carrying a whip sucha indicated one of five small sunken baths and oils and towels she showed me the use of the oils and towels you are an ignorant girl she said you do not even know how to take a bath i blushed my hair then i washed and dried and combed and brushed taking from it the dust of the road leading to stones of turmus and the sweat of the afternoon and early evening i am hungry i said sit on the tiles she said i did so i sat naked on the tiles she threw a linkage of rings and bells to the tiles beside me bell yourself she said they lock i said bell yourself she said i extended my left ankle and carefully aligned the four rings the rings were linked vertically at five places by tiny metal fastenings each ring opened hinged terminated on one end with a bolt and on the other with a tiny lock i slipped the small bolts into the four tiny locks there were four tiny snaps the rings linked together fitted snugly each ring bore five slave bells i looked at the bells they were locked upon me i dared not move my foot for fear i might cry out for a man can you dance naked asked sucha i do not know the dances of a slave girl i whispered i cannot dance do you know the arrangements of pleasure silks she asked no mistress i said putting down my head do you know the cosmetics and perfumes of a slave girl and their application she asked no mistress i said the jewelries she asked no mistress i said do you know the giving of exquisite pleasures to a man she asked i know very little mistress i said i was afraid to move my ankle for the bells are you trained at all she asked i know very little mistress i said a slave eta i said in her kindness once taught me simple things that i might not be completely displeasing and would not be too often whipped who was your last master asked sucha tup ladletender i said a peddler before that thurnus of tabuks ford of the peasants i said before that she said clitus vitellius of ar of the warriors i said good said sucha but i was owned only briefly by him i said before that she asked two warriors i said i did not know who they were only that i was theirs sucha did not question this often a girl does not find out who a master is she might be caught in the afternoon enslaved in the evening and sold in the morning before that asked sucha i was free i said sucha looked at me and laughed you she queried yes mistress i said sucha laughed i blushed hotly i gathered that the collar looked natural upon me you know little or nothing of the arts of the female slave said sucha you seem to know nothing of the movements and glances the positions attitudes and postures the expressions of a slave girl let alone the techniques crafts and subtleties that may determine whether or not men permit you to live i looked at her frightened but you are pretty she said men are more lenient with a pretty girl there is hope for you thank you mistress i whispered why have you not moved your left ankle asked sucha the bells i whispered what of them asked sucha they shame me i said they make me feel so much a slave excellent said sucha then she snapped rise slave girl i leaped to my feet with a jangle of bells i was a belled slave walk to one end of the room and back said sucha please no mistress i begged she lifted the whip i did as she commanded when i again stood before her she to my dismay touched me i turned my head away biting my lip in shame excellent she said a mere jangle of slave bells and you are ready for the arms of a man please mistress i begged you are a hot little slut she said kneel before the mirror i did so there are one hundred and eleven basic shades of slave lipstick said sucha much depends on the mood of the master yes mistress i said later many of the other girls joined us in the room of preparation for they must serve as i in the repast of the evening it is common in a gorean fortress if it is not under siege for the evening to be a time of pleasure for the men in five ehn cried a man from outside you must be in the hall of the feast the girls cried out nervously making last minute additions or adjustments to their jewelries and silks some intently applied cosmetics two nearly fought over a small disk of eye shadow but the whip of sucha lowered between them divided them sulda seemed radiant returned from the couch of hak haran she applied lipstick the girls smoothed their silks i looked at the incredibly lovely girl in the mirror she bedecked in a rope of red silk madeup perfumed vulnerable soft with armlets and bracelets golden beads intertwined in the turian collar she is beautiful i whispered sucha had much helped me rather pretty for a peddlers girl smiled sucha i am afraid i said do not be afraid said sucha what are my duties i asked exquisite beauty and absolute obedience said sucha i looked at the girl in the mirror i remembered the words of thurnus you belong at the feet of men he had said i looked at the girl in the mirror her ankle was belled she was beautiful she was a collared silked perfumed slave she was very beautiful i had no doubt she belonged at the feet of men she was a slave girl she was i exquisite beauty and absolute obedience said sucha yes mistress i said i heard the pounding of a metal bar on the inner gate leading to the quarters of the slave girls the girls were frightened even sucha seemed frightened hurry she cried hurry we fled from the room of preparation to the inner gates soon i and the others had been ushered through the two gates and i with them found myself beyond the gates barefoot on the carpeting between the vases at the ornate walls being hurried to the pleasure of masters the silver leaf master i asked i knelt before him lifting the platter of meats to him with a turian eating prong he forked meat from the platter onto his plate the girl kneeling beside him lifted wine to him i arose and went to kneel before the next man to offer him viands from the platter i bore the sensuous music of turia filled the room the girl in yellow silk belled danced her beauty among the tables i had been more than a month now in the keep of stones of turmus often was i kept late to serve the men i had learned much from sucha i was a different girl now from the one who had been sold for six copper tarsks to borchoff captain of the keep of stones of turmus well could he congratulate himself on his buy what did she cost you a lieutenant had asked him six tarsks of copper he had said you have an excellent eye for slave flesh had said the lieutenant borchoff had grinned i had hurried away she is paga hot a soldier had once said then he had thrown me to his fellow i could not help myself sometimes i lay awake in my barred alcove weeping not wanting to be a slave you are a natural slave sucha had once said to me you were born to the collar yes mistress i had said i lay sometimes in my small cell shamed weeping strangely i thought often of elicia nevins i had been her chief competitor in beauty at the exclusive college i had attended on earth how i thought she would have laughed at me and scorned me to see me now her former beauty rival as a slave meat dina cried a man i swiftly went to him knelt and lifted the platter to him i did not wish to be whipped there were twentynine girls now in the keep of stones of turmus the population in the slave quarters had changed somewhat five girls had been sold to passing turian merchants affiliated with the keep but similarly here and there over the weeks some six others had been acquired thus the stock was kept freshened for the men you will not be sold dina sucha had said to me you are a prize yes mistress i said we girls in the keep were pleasure slaves but it must be clearly understood that we were the only girls in the keep thus we served too as work slaves scrubbing must be done and the sewing and the washing and ironing of clothes and the cleaning too we aided in the kitchen usually in the preparing of vegetables and in the scouring of pots and pans too water must be carried to the men on the parapets there was much work of a lowly and servile nature which it fell naturally to us the girls of the keep to perform yet generally i think we did not have too much to complain of we were permitted to sleep late in the slave quarters and manual labors for most of us tended to be curtailed in the early afternoon that we might rest and prepare ourselves for the evening i think few of us did on the average more than two or three ahn of light labors on a normal day we were never under any delusion that our main task was not the delight and pleasure of our masters i was no longer low girl in the slave quarters it was not that i had fought for there were few girls there whom i suspected could not beat me but that the matter had been determined by sucha she carried the whip each new girl as she was introduced among us became automatically low girl the other girls being correspondingly advanced we obeyed sucha she never hesitated to use the whip we were kept in perfect order i was not displeased had borchoff not placed the whip in the hands of sucha i for one would have fared much more poorly in the slave quarters slave quarters as i have mentioned can become a jungle this was prevented at stones of turmus by the whip of sucha i was not the only girl who was not displeased to be protected from intimidation and violence sometimes masters in their cruelty do not appoint a first girl then the slave girls as best then can by teeth and nails must adjudicate their differences and establish a mode of governance for themselves sometimes masters do not appoint a first girl in order that the lower ranking girls will strive ever more desperately to please them to become favorites and thus to be to some extent more protected if you beat me the master will not be pleased is not a threat to be taken lightly in the slave quarters particularly if it is thought to be true the distant menace of the masters displeasure has its influence and effect naturally on the social arrangements of the kennels sometimes a girl will pretend to be more favored by the master than she is for her own prestige and to win position in the kennels but it is not hard to know the truth in these matters who is most often summoned to his couch meat dina cried another man and i hastened to him to kneel and serve him i wore red silk a golden necklace about my throat intertwined with my collar and bells i saw sucha lying soft in the arms of a lieutenant kissing him how marvelously she melted in his arms his she was seldom permitted to carry her whip outside the slave quarters except in conducting a new slave through the corridors and bringing her through the small iron door as she had me when she left the slave quarters she normally knelt before a guard and handed him the whip her authority ended he would then take the whip and thrust it against her lips and she would kiss it after which he would order her to her feet and discard the whip which she would retrieve on her way back to the slave quarters outside the slave quarters we were normally under the governance not of sucha but men we stood under her governance outside the quarters only when she was permitted to retain the whip i watched her yielding in the arms of the lieutenant moaning under his touch she did not now have the whip she was now in the hall of turian pleasures as it is called only another slave girl dina called a man i was struck by a soldier past whom i hurried i gathered the man had called before and i had not heard him the soldier had struck me for i had been tardy in responding to the first man i brushed the silk of the girl who danced between the tables the music swirled about me i knelt before the man who had called are you deaf he asked forgive a miserable girl master i begged i did not hear you give me meat he said i lifted the platter to him and he thrust the eating prong into a slab of meat hot with turian spices it was the last piece on the platter he looked at me i will fetch more meat immediately master i said you are the meat i want dina he said it is not yet time to serve the wine i whispered this is a common gorean idiom i was reminding him timidly that the time of general pleasure had not yet arrived i and several of the other girls had not yet been released from our serving duties there were still courses of the banquet to be served to our masters in the time of desserts and wines we would crawl to their tables slave girls fetch in the prisoner called borchoff captain of the keep of stones of turmus this afternoon i had been upon the heights of the keep carrying water to the men on the parapets i had stood there looking out over the wall at the vast fields about it was more than eighty feet to the ground is it your intention dina had asked a soldier coming up behind me to dash yourself to the ground no master i said to him i am not a free woman i am a slave girl i backed gently against him and lifted my head turning it to him i felt his hands on my arms attend to your duties slave girl he said yes master i said i had been summoned more than once to his couch i poured him a cup of water from the small verrskin bag over my shoulder it was hot on the parapet the stones were hot to my bare feet i wore a brief onepiece brown work tunic it was all i wore with the exception of the collar we wore such tunics when engaged as work slaves the tunics of work slaves are usually brown or gray i looked above me at the posts mounted on the walls between them was slung fine wire gently bending and swaying in the slow breeze of the hot afternoon such wire is tarn wire it is used to prevent the descent of tarns into the courtyard of a fortress it is common in gorean defenses i looked again over the wall master i asked yes he said i see dust there i said pointing to the road beneath winding toward the fortress they have him said the soldier beside me two tharlarion ponderous and stately made their way toward the keep they were mounted by two warriors with lances more warriors eight men from the keep followed bearing spears between the tharlarion fastened by neck chains running to the stirrups of the two beasts strode a man he was darkhaired he wore chains his wrists were fastened behind his back who is it master i asked we do not know said the soldier but word had come to us that he had been making inquiries concerning the keep its defenses and such what is to be done with him i asked he has been brought in said the soldier doubtless he will be branded and enslaved i do not envy him i watched the man he walked proudly i knew there were male slaves on gor but i had not seen them most gorean slaves are female male captives are commonly killed bring water to the men slave girl said the soldier yes master i said i took the cup back from the soldier and hurried on along the parapet to serve others when i was descending the stairs and had come to the courtyard between the walls the gate had been opened and the party with their prisoner had entered the gate then closed behind them borchoff captain of the keep came to inspect the prisoner i curious stood idly by watching the emptied water bag over my shoulder my ankles in the dust of the courtyard the man was tanned darkhaired very darkhaired large strong he wore chains his hands were manacled behind him he stood proudly between the two beasts bearing easily the weight of the two stirrup chains attached to his capture collar it pleased me to see a man captive he wore heavy iron manacles and could not hurt me i approached more closely his guards did not stop me what is your name asked borchoff of the man i do not remember he said he was struck by one of the guards for what purpose inquired borchoff were you attempting to ascertain the nature of our defenses it has slipped my mind said the man again he was struck he scarcely flinched though the blows were cruel borchoff turned away from the man to converse with the lieutenant one of the men on the tharlarion pertaining to the details of the prisoners capture i approached the prisoner more closely none stopped me he looked upon me i blushed hot red my body was not much concealed in the brief onepiece work tunic and i wore a collar gorean men have a way of looking at a woman which is like stripping them and putting them to their feet i felt naked i put my hand to the thin brown cloth clutching it as though to close it more but i only moved it more tightly about me and higher upon my thighs i felt under his gaze that every detail of my body must be clear to him i shrank back borchoff turned about briefly taunt him said he dina i warn you captain said the prisoner do not do to me the insult of the taunting slave girl taunt him said borchoff to me then turning away the prisoner stiffened in silent rage suddenly i felt very powerful he was helpless and too almost overwhelming me i felt a sudden fury against men for what they had done to me even to the collar and brand and this man was gorean and he had a moment before looked upon me as a master upon a slave girl yes master i said to borchoff captain of the keep of stones of turmus i approached the prisoner looking up at him he looked away does master fear a slave girl i asked i touched him with my finger tracing idly on his shoulder i smiled to myself the only men i knew who would fear a slave girl would be men of earth a slave girl would confuse and frighten them they would not know what to do with one they would doubtless attempt to indoctrinate her swiftly with masculine values and turn her into an imitation man she would then be safe for them they would doubtless proceed in this matter regardless of her feelings oblivious of her integrities for they would not be truly interested in fulfilling her nature whatever it might be but in avoiding the responsibilities of their own women and men are identical this the defensive thesis of weak fearful men it is simple if women are not women then they need not be men why do many men fear manhood i do not think it would be so terrible you are large and strong master i said to the prisoner and you are handsome too i said he looked away angrily why do you not take me in your arms and kiss me as a slave girl i whimpered do you not find me attractive he said nothing oh i said you wear chains i kissed at his arm he was more than ten inches taller than i and must have weighed twice as much i was very small next to him let dina give you pleasure master i whispered let dina please you i bit at his tunic which was torn with my teeth you should let dina please you i said for soon you may be branded and then you will be only a poor little slave like dina with my teeth i tore away his upper tunic stripping him to the waist he had a mighty chest i caressed his flanks and licked and bit at his belly male slaves i said may be slain for so much as touching a slave girl i looked up at him dina is sorry that you will soon be a slave master i said i will not be a slave he said i looked at him puzzled then again he did not look at me i took the waist of his tunic in my teeth do not slave girl said he i shrank back frightened run along dina said borchoff returning to the prisoner yes master i said i left them returning to the quarters for female slaves to swim and bathe and refresh myself before the duties of the evening fetch in the prisoner called borchoff rising behind the low table in the hall of turian pleasures lifting his goblet i knelt near the man to whom i had served meat the platter was now empty the girl in yellow silk had stopped dancing and the musicians were quiet there must have been some fifty men in the hall and most of the girls welcome called borchoff as the prisoner was broglit in he wore chains on his ankles and his hands were locked behind his back in iron manacles he had been much beaten the prisoner was thrown to his knees before borchoff captain of the keep of stones of turmus he was held on his knees by two guards you are guest here said borchoff tonight you will feast you are generous captain said the man tomorrow said borchoff you will speak beneath our persuasions i do not think so said the man our methods are efficient said borchoff they have not yet served said the man borchoff appeared angry but i will speak when it pleases me said the man we are humbly grateful said borchoff the prisoner inclined his head you are of the warriors said borchoff perhaps said the man i like you said borchoff then he called out sulda tupa fina melpomene dina feast and please our mysterious guest he who finds it difficult to recall his caste his name or city we fled to the kneeling chained man obeying come nightfall next we trust said borchoff his memory will be much improved is it the nineteenth hour asked the prisoner no said borchoff i shall speak said he at the nineteenth hour you fear the persuasions of the morrow inquired borchoff no said the prisoner but there is a time and a place for speaking as there is a time and a place for steel it is a saying of the warriors said borchoff is it inquired the man borchoff lifted his cup to him saluting him borchoff too was of the warriors it is unfortunate said borchoff that you fell living into our hands the tharlarion pens of turia require slaves for their cleaning there was much laughter about the tables at the witticism of borchoff i too and the other girls laughed merrily much insult had he done to the prisoner should he be of the warriors i and the others found the thought amusing that the fellow should be enslaved and set to such lowly tasks he had intimidated me in the courtyard in spite of the fact that he had been helpless and chained i thus found the thought of his prospective enslavement and labors particularly delicious it would serve him so right the prisoner did not respond to borchoff borchoff nodded to us and then drank from his cup poor master i said to the kneeling chained prisoner i knelt beside him and took his head in my hands and pressed my lips to his kissing him poor master i said he looked at me you are the slut of the courtyard he said yes master i said it will be pleasant to tag your ear he said i did not understand him i and the other girls then began to kiss and caress him to bring him wines and feed him delicacies much did we move about him and serve him it is the time of general pleasure called borchoff the men in the room responded eagerly dina called the fellow to whom i had earlier served the spiced hot meat i kissed the kneeling chained prisoner swiftly with the insulting kiss often given by the wives of earth to their husbands forgive me master i said i must now serve another then i hurried away i heard the prisoner inquire the hour of borchoff it is the eighteenth hour said borchoff i lay in the arms of the turian soldier on the cushions on the tiles of the hail of turian pleasures i kissed him he was the fourth one to whom i had been thrown how marvelous you are master i whispered to him i cuddled up to him delicately lifting my head i wanted him to give me a cube of meat honeyed from the metal plate which lay near him i and the other girls might not take such food for ourselves our hands could be cut off we are not fed hours before the feast and in serving the feast are not permitted in the least to partake of it the feast was not ours to eat but to serve we were slave girls we might however be fed by the men if we would eat we must earn our food please master i wheedled feed dina he put a cube of meat boiled in wine honeyed in my mouth thrusting it between my teeth and cheek with his finger thank you master i whispered kissing him the meat in my mouth i looked up savoring the meat i looked across to sulda i had fed better than she this evening i was well learning in the keep of stones of turmus how to serve men i smiled at sulda and she looked at me angrily i looked over to the kneeling prisoner now abandoned he knelt alone on the tiles chained i was surprised to see his eyes upon me more than once though this night i had noted his eyes upon me i smiled at him i pursed my lips and blew a kiss to him brushing it toward him with my fingers i was permitted this gesture of insolence the man with whom i lay laughed i continued to look at the prisoner well had i and the other girls earlier mocked him this night well pleased were we with ourselves and i thought that i had been the best in this work how dared he adopt the attitude of a master toward me when he was only a chained captive we had given him of wines and of delicacies upon which to feast often had we spoken to him soothingly as though in deference and pity as though he might not be kneeling chained in the fortress of enemies sometimes too we had spoken to him in husky whispers as though he had much aroused our feminine slave bloods much had we pressed upon him our kisses our caresses and attentions well had we teased him and taunted and humiliated him in his helplessness slave girls are excellent in such work and i thought that i had been the best he regarded me the soldier in whose arms i lay pulled me down and more closely to him eagerly i kissed him i heard the musicians playing the music of gor another soldier seized me by the ankle wait said the first his word muffled against the side of my throat where his mouth and teeth below my ear half kissed half held me i felt the hand of the first in my collar behind my neck pulling the steel up tight under my chin that i not be pulled from him hurry with the slave said the second his hand on my ankle only if it pleases me said the first not releasing my collar i laughed then i cried out as the first began to make me yield to him a little wine for dina master i begged i snuggled closer to him i as other girls had crawled among the tables some men are more generous than others fina crept close go away i ordered her angrily she crept away to seek another a little wine for dina please master i begged he held back my head by the hair and thrust the rim of the cup against my mouth i laughed feeling the wine in my mouth and spilling at my throat running under the collar and beneath the light silk over my left breast the door to the hall suddenly burst open with a crash helmeted armed men thrust their way into the room the tarn wire has been cut cried a man then he reeled bloody from a blade borchoff drunk staggered to his feet between the tables the turian soldiers looked wildly about the music had stopped outside the hall we could hear fighting and shouting to arms cried borchoff ring the alarm bell more men swept into the room turian soldiers ran to the walls to seize at their weapons slave girls screamed then the room was in the control of the strangers they were fierce swift men efficient terrible they wore gray helmets with crests of the hair of larls and sleen their leather told me they were tarnsmen the key to these chains demanded the prisoner rising to his feet blades were set at the throat of borchoff his men were throwing down their weapons the surprise had been complete for the music we had heard nothing the wire had been cut with bladed hooks swung on long lines below giant tarns cut and torn from its posts the tarnsmen had approached from the dark quadrant away from the moons low not more than a few feet from the ground hidden by the shadows of the world and then had without warning little more than a quarter of a pasang from the keep swept into the air the first wave striking at the wire the second third and fourth waves dropping through the cut billowing wire to the parapets roofs and courtyard of the keep numbers had fought their way almost instantly to the hall the plan of the fortress seemed well known to them they moved with dispatch borchoff angry half sober threw the key to the prisoners chains to one of the intruders swiftly they were unlocked the man stood proudly rubbing his wrists are you the leader of these men asked borchoff yes said the man you were apprehended making inquiries said borchoff into the structure of our fortress and the nature of its defenses the inquiries said the man were completed earlier and the plans devised it was then necessary only to let myself fall into your hands you intended your capture asked borchoff yes said the man i was thus brought into the fortress where i might make further determinations of such a nature as to expedite the transactions of my men he then turned to certain of his lieutenants issuing orders the lieutenants in turn communicated with their men men sped to their work you have been observant said borchoff i attempted to improve my time said the man he grinned at borchoff and your men as i anticipated were most helpful speaking freely before and to one whom they thought destined to the chains of a slave borchoff glared at his men the leader of the intruders was handed a pouch which he slung about his shoulders and a sword i would continue the conversation captain he said but you must understand that we must move with dispatch of course captain said borchoff we lie within the patrol limits of the tarnsmen of ar the evenings patrol will be delayed said the man it seems there was a distraction a burning field some pasangs to the south it must be investigated and reported borchoffs fists clenched chain him said the man indicating the very chains with which he himself earlier had been secured the chains were snapped on borchoff who are you demanded borchoff in fury his wrists and ankles confined is it the nineteenth hour asked the man yes said borchoff i am rask he said of the caste of warriors of the city of treve the slave girls screamed and i broke and fled with them behind us we could hear orders being given the fortress would be sacked i fled wildly down a dark passageway i could hear a man behind me then he turned aside to pursue another girl the silk was half torn from me i tried to tear off the slave bells on my ankle a girl sped past me turning into another hallway i looked wildly about i saw a steel door i slipped through it was not guarded beyond the door was a passageway i ran panting slave bells jangling on my ankle down this passageway then opening a door i saw a new passageway one in which there burned a lamp hanging on a chain i remembered this second passageway i had been conducted through it on my first day in stones of turmus it was lined with barred gates i pulled at the barred gates then i backed away from them it would not be wise to hide within could i even gain admittance behind lay treasures they would be sure to be looted i must look for the grosser storage places those in which bulk goods were kept these places i remembered were farther down the passageway on the other side of a steel door i fled down the passageway i came to the heavy steel door it was not now guarded i left it ajar gate after gate i tried along the passageway below the steel door those gates giving access to the storage areas for larger less valuable merchandise but all were locked i jerked at the bars i could not open them i wept with frustration i looked wildly back down the passageway frightened if anyone should enter the passageway i would be immediately visible a fleeing hunted beautiful half silked belled slave girl i jerked again at the bars of a gate i could not hide there was no place to hide i spun about miserably my back to the bars moaning i could feel them against my back i looked again down the passageway no one was yet in it i touched the collar i wore i clutched the bit of silk which still clung loose about my hips i moaned i was too beautiful i knew to be treated gently by gorean men i feared their ropes and whips i was a slave who knew what they would do to me if they would catch me i saw then below me down the hallway the door to the office of borchoff i ran to the door pulled it open and entered on the wall i saw the whip with which i had been disciplined after some strokes of which i had begged tamed sobbing to wear a collar i touched the collar at my throat i shrank back from the sight of the whip even the sight of a whip strikes terror into the heart of a slave girl she knows what it can do to her she has felt it one of the most frightening things to a girl about the whip is the knowledge that the gorean male if he is not pleased with her will use it and without hesitation i heard shouting from the passageway leading to the other door of borchoffs office i heard the striking of swords i heard a girl scream i heard a girl crying out piteously pounding and scratching hysterically at the other side of the door i hesitated then i heard her an instant later screaming being pulled away from the door bind her and take her to the parapets i heard she is your tag said a voice i shall take the next i heard the girl cry out in sudden pain then a few moments later i heard her being dragged away i heard other voices then i moved back toward the door through which i had entered the handle of the other door was being tried then i heard men kicking at the panels i saw wood breaking in splintering and an arm reaching through to unlatch the door i turned and fled away back the way i had come i heard men coming into the room which i had left gasping my bare feet hurting on the stones i ran back down the passageway i darted through the steel door i spun running my hands along the door to find a way to lock it i cried out with misery its five bolts could not be shut they were controlled by a vertical bar which slid in brackets the bar was padlocked back i ran again i did not know if the men who had entered borchoffs office were in pursuit of me or not i stopped once again trying to twist the slave bells one by one from the fivelinked anklet which i wore with its twenty bells if i had had a tool to insert in the rings i might have done so but i had no tool the task was beyond the strength of my fingers i heard men in the passage my heart sank i was still belled then i thought that if i might reach the room of slavegirl preparation i might obtain the key to the bells the keys were kept in a shallow wooden box in that room a box the key to which was generally in suchas keeping if the box were not open i might be able to break it or its small lock and thus obtain the keys i ran back along the passage in a few moments i reached the small iron door through which i had first been introduced into the quarters for slaves it opened from this side i knelt down and opened the door peering through i saw a girl being dragged by the hair from the room bent over stumbling and weeping at the side of a warrior i saw another girl melpomene thrown on her stomach on the tiles beside the pool a warrior kneeling across her body tying her hands behind her back then he threw her over his shoulder and carried her lightly from the room only one other person did i see in the room redhaired fina stripped lying at the gate to her slave alcove her left wrist wore a slave bracelet the matching bracelet was closed locked about one of the bars of the alcove she looked at me miserably i could not help her she would wait for the return of her captor i tore bits of slave silk from my garment and wedged them in the two bolt receptacles that the door not shut behind me i hurried to the room of slave girl preparation it appeared in disarray ransacked i gathered girls had been taken there the box containing the keys had been broken open perhaps by men looking for jewelries keys were scattered about i heard shouting screaming frenziedly i tried keys in the first of the locks outside the door i saw sulda flee past i shrank back she was taken on the far side of the pool do not tag me she screamed then i heard her cry out moments later i saw her wrists tied behind her her hair down about her face being thrust along stumbling held by the upper arm at the side of a warrior hurry her to the parapet i heard someone call i found the key to the slave bells i unlocked the first tiny lock and then the next four the fivelinked joined circlets opened i cast the bells aside i then crept from the room of slave girl preparation and slipping about the side of the pool went to the small iron door i did not exit through it i heard men on the other side approaching i turned again and fled this time running through the barred gate which leads from the quarters of slaves i then passed through the second gate i felt the carpet under my feet i must find a place to hide i ran lightly down the hall suddenly ahead from a side passage i saw two men emerge they held a girl tupa between them i turned again to flee back down the hall but behind me now came two more men doubtless those i had heard behind the small iron door who had then entered the quarters for slaves examined them and the room for slave girl preparation and emerged through the two gates i was trapped in the corridor i shrank back against the wall they approached it is the dina said one of them let her go said the other then the four men joined and went hack toward the great hall taking tupa with them i stood back against the wall breathing heavily bewildered terrified they had not secured me i did not understand this did they not want me was i not suitable for them was i to be left free at the far end of the hall away from the gates leading to the quarters of slaves i saw a figure that of a man tall handsome strong splendid with the bearing of one who leads gorean warriors it was he called rask of treve i turned and fled away i crouched in the dark passageway cornered i saw the tiny lamp approach from far down the passageway i felt the walls of the passageway about me behind me there was a barred gate locked the lamp came closer there were walls of stone on either side of me he lifted the lamp and the light fell upon me i knelt be merciful to a poor slave master i whispered kneel said he with your belly and cheek against the wall and place your hands behind your back with your wrists crossed i did so he placed the lamp he carried on a shelf to one side he placed the sword he carried behind him on the stones of the flooring and crouched behind me binding fiber was looped about my wrists and pulled tight then it was tied i winced i was helpless he took me by the arms and turned me sitting me down on the flooring my knees up my back against the stone wall be merciful to a poor slave please master i whispered i had muchly taunted him and much had i delighted myself at his expense now i wore his binding fiber and was alone with him in a dark passageway deep below the keep of stones of turmus i blinked against the light of the lamp he withdrew an object from his pouch and held it before me do you know what this is he asked it was like a small veined metal leaf narrowly ovate in shape it had a tiny hole in the wider end in which in a tiny loop there was twisted a small wire on the leaf indented m was a sign and some tiny printing do you know this sign asked the man no master i whispered it is the sign of treve he said yes master i said can you read this asked the man pointing to the printing no master i said i could not read gorean i was illiterate in the language this was not uncommon many masters think it desirable to keep a girl illiterate in their language thinking it makes them easier to control and puts them more at their mercy other masters differ in this relishing the ownership and absolute domination of literate girls preferably those who are well educated highly intelligent and gifted such girls must be regarded as quite valuable on the block they commonly bring the highest prices it is also said they make the best slaves had i been sold on earth i would have counted as such a girl on gor however i was only another piece of illiterate collar meat it is my name said the man rask yes master i said it is with these devices said the man holding up the tiny leaf with its wire sign and printing that we of treve in our various ventures of raiding mark our booty please no master i cried i shrank back against the wall he held my left ear lobe pulling it taut i cried out wincing as the wire pierced the lobe and then he threaded the wire through and twisting the ends together formed a tiny loop from which the silver leaf dangled i felt it at my left cheek it will be pleasant to tag you he had said to me earlier i had not understood him at the time i now understood him i looked at him with horror i had been tagged you do not now appear so insolent as formerly he said no master i wept he then seized my ankles and pulled me from the wall i threw my head back moaning an ear had been pierced this in itself is little or nothing but on gor it is mighty in its portent the other ear almost certainly now to match its mate would sometime be pierced and i would then be a piercedear girl the lowest of female slaves i had heard another girl crying out earlier as she had been tagged although at the time i had not understood what had been done to her it had not been the pain which had made her cry out so miserably but its meaning an ear had been pierced i looked up at rask of treve reproachfully he laughed he well understood what he had done to me and he knew well too that i understood is your vengeance sweet master i asked him i have not yet begun to take my revenge pretty little slave he said he thrust apart my ankles i resolved to resist him i turned my head to the side and heard the small sound of the silver leaf on its tiny loop fastened in my ear touch the stones of the flooring of the passage but his hands were sure no i begged do not make me yield to you but he did not see fit to show me mercy i cried out with misery lost in sensation lifting my body to him piteous for his slightest touch when he finished with me i lay between his feet a shattered yielded slave girl he lifted his head smoke he said i too smelled smoke the keep is afire he said on your feet slave i struggled to my feet bent over we journeyed through flaming halls in a few ehn we emerged after climbing stairs on the roof of one of the buildings and thence by a narrow bridge crossed to one of the parapets there there were several tarns great fierce saddle birds of gor i could see fire licking through the roof of one of the buildings the parapet was crowded goods were bound over the saddles of tarns strings of plates and vessels were tied at the pommels girls stood beside the winged monsters their hands over their heads slave braceleted through the stirrups of the beasts they would dangle from the stirrups in flight two on a side behind some of the beasts there were tarn baskets on trailing ropes girls too and various goods had been thrust in these i saw sucha her hands braceleted over her head at one of the stirrups she looked terrified men mounted swiftly to the saddles below in the courtyard chained together i could see borchoff and the soldiers and staff of the keep there was much smoke about them i saw tharlarion released in the courtyard men struggled not to be trampled i was pulled along by the arm by my captor let us hurry captain said one of the men we must move under the cover of darkness said a lieutenant we must be at the merchant rendezvous before dawn to your saddle lieutenant grinned rask of treve the man grinned and leapt to the ladder leading to the high saddle of the great beast i saw below that the great gate of the keep had been swung open tharlarion rushed through i was thrust into the hands of a soldier who conducted me to one of the tarn baskets borchoff below in the courtyard looked upward rask of treve lifted his hand to him in a salute of warriors the gate had been opened borchoff and his men might make their way though chained to safety then rask of treve looked about himself making swift inspection of his men and tarns and their burdens riches and slave girls the soldier lifted me lightly from my feet and thrust me feet first through a hatchlike opening with flat door in the top of the tarn basket he pushed my head down thrusting me down between the other girls i crouched down wedged in i could scarcely squirm i looked up seeing the flat door swung shut in an instant he had tied it closed i knelt we could not stand upright eight of us were imprisoned in the basket our wrists were tied behind our backs silk and gold too had been thrust in the basket i looked about scarcely could we move from the left ears of the other girls as from mine there dangled a silver leaf a tag which had been placed upon them by the men who had taken them ho cried rask of treve i thrust my head to the wall of the basket ho cried the men of rask of treve the man who had placed me in the basket and then tied it shut climbed swiftly to the saddle of his tarn our trail lines those attached to the basket in which we were confined ran to the tarns stirrups when the tarn took to flight the basket following it would be lifted into the air he awaited only the command of flight ho cried rask of treve he drew back on the first strap of his tarns harness ho cried his men rask of treves tarn smote the air with its mighty wings i was frightened the span of those wings may have been thirty feet or more his tarn screaming departed the walls of the keep of stones of turmus those of his men followed him even in the shelter of the basket the torrent of air was frightening if one had stood upon the parapet surely one would have been hurled in its blasts to the courtyard below there was a moment of slack and then the lines on the basket drew taut our tarnsman drew the basket over the courtyard and gaining altitude there then departed the walls of the keep following the others when the basket dropped from the parapet toward the courtyard we screamed frightened but then it swung below the tarn and we felt ourselves being lifted high into the air as though toward the moons of gor itself i wondered how many slave girls helpless and bound a tiny silver leaf dangling from their ear had been carried by the men of treve in this basket and how many more in the future would find themselves its captive i could see the keep of stones of turmus in flames dropping away below us i am publicly auctioned the sheet was ripped from me i cried out startled ascend the block slave girl said the man yes master i said he prodded me with his whip i looked at the worn stairs of solid wood leading in their spiral upward i glanced down at the other girls sulda and tupa among them who sat huddled at the foot of the block clutching their sheets about them sucha and others had already been sold it cannot be happening to me i said to myself they cannot be going to sell me i felt the whip push against my back slowly i began to ascend the wide concave stairs worn by the bare feet of countless slave girls before me there were twenty steps to the height of the block my hair was longer now as it had not been cut on gor save to trim and shape it it now fell below my shoulders and swirled behind me shaped into the slave flame no longer did i wear the turian collar it had been roughly filed from my neck by a male slave under the whip of his overseer he had been struck once when he had let his finger touch the side of my neck i do not know if he did it on purpose or not no longer did i wear in my left ear the silver leaf identifying me as a catch of rask a warrior and raider of the city of treve i had been sold before dawn at a slavers camp on the outskirts of the city of ar i had been thrown naked to the slavers feet swift expert assessment had been done upon me i cried out in misery i brought rask of treve my captor fifteen copper tarsks this was not bad for an earth girl in the current market this figure had been entered into accounts on a ledger on another ledger one kept by one of rasks men this figure was also entered with a sign following it indicating him to whose private account the amount was to be credited he who had taken me rask the warrior of treve when the figure pertinent to my sale had been entered in the two ledgers the wire loop from which dangled the silver leaf had been cut from my ear the silver leaf was then returned to him who kept the ledger for rask of treve and he dropped the leaf with others into a nearby box humiliated then i was thrown to the slavers chain behind sulda a ring lock was placed through the turian collar which i wore at the time and a link in the slavers chain and then snapped shut securing me on the chain by the collar with the others the chain was heavy tupa was then added to the chain after me she brought her captor only twelve copper tarsks hurry slave girl called the man at the foot of the stairs i hesitated about my neck i wore a light chain locked from it depended an oval disk on this disk was a number my lot number or sales number sucha who could read told me it was she had been we were being sold in the auction house of publius on ars street of brands it is a minor auction house usually handling lesser cheaper slaves usually females in greater volumes it lacks the prestige of such houses as that of claudius and the curulean nonetheless it is not unfrequented and it has a reputation as a place in which not unoften bargains may be obtained i heard the step of the man on the stairs behind me i turned about stricken i am naked i said did he not understand i was of earth i had been sold before but not like this i was of earth surely they could not truly be going to display me publicly and sell me at auction i had been sold before but privately the thought of my beauty being exposed so publicly so brazenly to large numbers of men buyers nauseated me i looked to the height of the block i thought i might die the room was an amphitheater it was lit by torchlight i had earlier been exposed in the exhibition cages that prospective buyers might scan the merchandise at close hand forming their suppositions as to its value that their bids later if they cared to make them might be shrewd and realistic in the exhibition cages we were forced to obey the commands of the men outside the cages moving in certain ways and such but they were not permitted to touch us we were told to smile much in the cages and be beautiful i shared my cage with twenty girls each of us with a chain and disk on our throats outside the cage posted were our lot numbers or sales numbers corresponding with the disk numbers and a listing of certain of our features primarily measurements i heard the man hurrying up the steps behind me i had spent eight days in the slave pens waiting the night of the sale i had been examined medically in detail and had had administered to me while i lay bound helplessly a series of painful shots the purpose of which i did not understand they were called the stabilization serums we were also kept under harsh discipline close confinement and given slave training i well recalled the lesson which was constantly enforced upon us the master is all please him fully what is the meaning of the stabilization serums i had asked sucha she had kissed me they will keep you much as you are she said young and beautiful i had looked at her startled the masters and the free of course if there is need of it you must understand are also afforded the serums of stabilization she said adding smiling though they are administered to them i suppose with somewhat more respect than they are to a slave if there is need of it i asked yes she said do some not require the serums i asked some said sucha but these individuals are rare and are the offspring of individuals who have had the serums why is this i asked i do not know said sucha men differ the matter i supposed was a function of genetic subtleties and the nature of differing gametes the serums of stabilization effected it seemed the genetic codes perhaps altering or neutralizing certain messages of deterioration providing i supposed processes in which an exchange of materials could take place while tissue and cell patterns remained relatively constant ageing was a physical process and as such was susceptible to alteration by physical means all physical processes are theoretically reversible entropy itself is presumably a moment in a cosmic rhythm the physicians of gor it seemed had addressed themselves to the conquest of what had hitherto been a universal disease called on gor the drying and withering disease called on earth ageing generations of intensive research and experimentation had taken place at last a few physicians drawing upon the accumulated data of hundreds of investigators had achieved the breakthrough devising the first primitive stabilization serums later to be developed and exquisitely refined i had stood in the cage startled trembling why are serums of such value given to slaves i asked are they of such value she asked yes she said i suppose so she took them for granted much as the humans of earth might take for granted routine inoculations she was unfamiliar with ageing the alternative to the serums was not truly clear to her why should slaves not be given the serums she asked do the masters not want their slaves healthy and better able to serve them it is true i said sucha on earth animals were given inoculations by farmers to protect them from diseases on gor it would be a matter of course provided the serums were readily available to administer them to slaves i stood with sucha trembling i had received a gift which on earth could not be purchased by the riches of the wealthiest men a gift which was beyond the reach of earths mightiest millionaires which even the billionaires of my planet could not buy for it did not exist there i was incredibly rich i looked at the bars of the cage but i am caged i cried of course said sucha you are a slave now rest tonight you are to be sold i felt the hand of the man tight on my arm beside me on the step i am naked i said you are a slave he said do not show me to the men i begged i am not as the other girls ascend the block said he slave he thrust me upward i fell on the stairs my legs trembled i sensed him lift the whip i will cut the flesh from your body with the whip he said no master i wept girl called the auctioneer from the height of the block it was an announcement to the crowd i looked upward the auctioneer came to the edge of the block he smiled down in a kindly fashion he extended his hand to me please he said i am naked i said please he said he put his hand further toward me i lifted my hand to him and he took me by the hand helping me to the height of the block the block was circular and some twenty feet in diameter there was sawdust upon it by the hand he led me to the center of the block she is reluctant he said to the crowd in explanation i stood before the men are you comfortable now dear lady he asked yes i said thank you suddenly angrily he threw me to the wood at his feet i heard the hiss of his whip five times he lashed me and i screamed covering my head with my hands then i lay trembling lashed at his feet she is girl he said to the crowd from an assistant he took a board with rings and papers he read from that paper which was now first upon the board others being loose and thrown back he said reading irritably is brown haired and brown eyed she is horts in height her weight is stones her block measurements certified are horts horts horts she will take a numbertwo wrist ring and a numbertwo ankle ring her collar size is ten horts she is illiterate and for most practical purposes untrained she cannot dance her brand is the dina the slave flower her ears are pierced he looked down at me and kicked me lightly with the side of his foot stand slave he said swiftly i stood i looked about myself miserably in the torchlight i could see in the rings of the amphitheater ascending before me and above me on three sides the crowd there were aisles at the side and two aisles in the tiers with steps the tiers were crowded and on them men ate and drank here and there too robed and veiled i saw women among them watching me one woman sipped wine through her veil staining it all were fully clothed save i who wore only a light chain locked with its attached disk of sale stand straight said the auctioneer i stood straight my back hurt terribly from the whipping which he had given me so you see he said are there any bids the crowd was silent the auctioneer took my hair in his hand and cruelly bent me back standing horts said he indicating my breasts horts said he slapping me on the belly horts said he reaching across my body and placing his hand on my right hip indicating the width of my body these were my block measurements i knew a master might keep me to such measurements with the whip if necessary small said he but sweet a delicacy noble sirs with promise two tarsks called a man from the crowd i hear two tarsks said the auctioneer it was true that i was not large but i did not think i was unusually small i was in earth measurements some five feet four inches in height and weighed about one hundred and sixteen pounds my figure though delicate was in earth measurements approximately i had not known my collar size on earth for i had not purchased garments with such attention to the neck on gor it was ten horts accordingly it must have been in earth measurements in the neighborhood of twelve and one half inches i have a slender delicate neck i do not know what my wrist and ankle measurements would be i do know i take a numbertwo wrist ring and a numbertwo ankle ring these run in separate series the ankle rings being larger of course than the wrist rings it is regarded as desirable in a slave that she takes the same number wrist and ankle ring this suggesting a delicious symmetry there are four numbers in the series one is regarded as small two and three as normal and four as large i could not slip four ankle ring of course i could slip a four wrist ring if it were set at four most such wrist and ankle rings however are adjustable to or thus they like slave bracelets lock to the perfect holding point on each girl the auctioneer stood very near me i did not know my wrist or ankle size in earth measurements for such measurements are not important for a girl on earth as they are on gor but the interior circumference of the numbertwo wrist ring is horts and the interior circumference of the numbertwo ankle ring is horts thus my wrist size in earth measurement must be about six inches and my ankle size must be about eight and onehalf inches in the slave pens of course a girls measurements are taken on a tape measure marked in horts and entered on her sheet of sale she wears the dina said the auctioneer indicating to the crowd my brand the slave flower would you not like to own this pretty little dina do you have a dina among your girls he twisted my head held by the hair from side to side and her ears noble sirs said he are pierced this had been done in the pens of the house of publius four days earlier the puncture in my left ear lobe from the wire of rask of treves silver leaf his booty claim was now matched perfectly by a similar penetration of my right ear lobe i might now be put in earrings i was now a lowly piercedear girl five tarsks called a man a gross fat man swathed in robes sitting in a middle tier to my right he sipped from a cup i shuddered i could not well see the faces of most of the buyers it was i not they who was well illuminated by the torches stand straight suck in your belly turn your hip out said the auctioneer to me under his breath i complied my back still burned from his whip note said the auctioneer indicating me with his coiled whip the turn of her ankle the sweetness of her thighs the tightness of her belly the pleasure of her figure the delicacy of her throat awaiting your collar the delicacy sensitivity and beauty of her features he looked to the crowd would you not like her in your compartments he inquired would you not like her m a tunic and collar of your choice on her knees before you would you not like the owning of every inch of her she your slave yours to command hers to obey would you not like her serving you responding swiftly and perfectly in all things to the least whim of your will six tarsks called a man six tarsks repeated the auctioneer walk little dina said he to me and well tears sprang into my eyes my body burned red with shame but i walked and well i feared his whip men cried out with pleasure at the displayed girl upon the block note the fluidity and grace of her movements said the auctioneer the sweetness of her figure the straightness of her back the proud carriage of her head for a few copper tarsks you can own her a tear ran down my face over my left cheek walk well little dina cautioned the auctioneer yes master i said i walked back and forth turning red with shame before the buyers stand proudly little dina said the auctioneer i stopped and stood on the block my head high buy her and put her to work for you challenged the auctioneer conceive of her naked in your collar on her knees shackled scrubbing the tiles of your compartments consider her cleaning and washing and sewing for you consider her shopping for you and cooking consider her entertaining and waiting upon your guests consider her waiting in the furs for you ten tarsks said a man ten tarsks said the auctioneer eleven said another man from the left eleven said the auctioneer i looked out upon the crowd the men and women there must have been some four hundred in the amphitheater vendors moved about among them proffering light foods and beverages i lightly fingered the chain and sales disk at my throat i saw a man buy a roll of meat wrapped about a sauce he began to eat looking at me our eyes met i looked away some men conversed among themselves not noticing me i hated them i did not wish to be looked upon but they did not look upon me examine this beauty said the auctioneer indicating me with his whip consider the perfection of her block measurements horts horts horts he cried jabbing me with the whip fourteen copper tarsks called a man fourteen cried the auctioneer but can the house let this little beauty slip its collar for a mere fourteen tarsks say no noble sirs fifteen said a man fifteen said the auctioneer i knew i had been sold by rask of treve to a slaver for fifteen copper tarsks the slaver who had purchased me had sold me to the house of publius for twenty copper tarsks the auctioneer doubtless knew this doubtless it was entered on my records the auctioneer looked at me girl said he to me softly menacingly you will whether sold or not spend this night in our pens is that clearly understood yes master i whispered he was not satisfied with the bids if i did not go for a price which satisfied the house i would spend the night under gorean slave discipline i would doubtless be richly whipped on your belly little dina he said let us interest the buyers yes master i said i fell upon my belly at his feet awaiting his commands i looked up terrified afraid that he might strike me with the whip i lay there for a long moment he did not strike me the crowd was amused at my terror you will be prompt obedient and beautiful said the auctioneer to me softly yes master i said then suddenly snapping the whip he said harshly on your back one knee lifted the other leg extended hands over your head wrists close as though confined in slave bracelets i complied then he began to put me rapidly through the paces of the exhibited female slave he held me in each position for the sweet instant that well revealed me tantalizingly in that attitude or posture and then barked forth a new command to a new position or attitude the sequence of these moves was not an accident each move followed easily sometimes by a roll or turn from the preceding position shrewd rhythm and flow calculated and sensual physically melodious characterized the performance humiliatingly inflicted upon me i must submit to the choreography of slave display i who had been judy thornton a girl of earth was put through gorean slave paces then i lay on my belly at his feet as i had begun i was trembling i was covered with sweat my hair was loose about my head and eyes i felt the auctioneers foot upon my body i put my head to the block what am i bid he called eighteen tarsks called a man eighteen said the auctioneer nineteen do i hear nineteen nineteen called a man my tears stained the block i felt its sawdust with my finger tips its sawdust too adhered to my body held by the sweat the leather of the auctioneers whip loosely coiled was near my back i looked up there were women in the crowd why did they not rise up and cry out in protest at the indignity inflicted upon their sister but they looked upon me impassively i was only a slave twenty called a man twenty said the auctioneer he removed his foot from my body and tapped me on the back with the whip kneel he said i knelt on the block near its front miserable in the position of the pleasure slave the light chain and sales disk on my throat i have a bid of twenty copper tarsks for this lovely little beauty said the auctioneer do i hear a bid of more he looked out over the crowd i knelt very still i knew the house had paid twenty tarsks for me twentyone called a man twentyone said the auctioneer i breathed more easily the profit was small but it had been turned upon me i was very conscious of the sales disk at my throat it was on a looped closefitting chain i could not remove the chain it was locked twentyone tarsks had been bid upon me i would not be a loss to the house of publius it costs only a pittance to maintain and train a girl in the barred strawstrewn pens of a slavers house what is the cost of gruel and a whip i have heard a bid of twentyone tarsks called the auctioneer do i hear a bid for more the crowd was silent i was suddenly frightened what if the house were not satisfied with the profit they had turned surely it was not much i hoped they would be satisfied i had done my best to obey the auctioneer i did not wish to be whipped gorean males tend not to be lenient with girls who have displeased them stand collar meat said the auctioneer i stood it seems said the auctioneer that we must let this little beauty go for a mere twentyone copper tarsks please do not be angry with me master i begged it is all right little dina he said with surprising pleasantness considering how harshly he had managed me upon the block i swiftly knelt before him holding his knees looking up is master pleased i asked yes he said then dina will not be whipped i asked of course not he said he looked down pleasantly it is not your fault he said that the market is slow thank you master i said now on your feet little beauty he said and hurry from the block for we have more animals to sell yes master i said swiftly rising to my feet i turned to descend the block on the stairs on the opposite side from that from which i had ascended the block one moment little dina he said come here yes master i said running lightly to him place your hands in your hair he said and do not remove them until you are given permission master i asked i placed my hands in my hair he took me by the back of the neck with his left hand and turned me to the crowd behold noble sirs and ladies he said suddenly i screamed fighting the looped heavy coil of the whip stop please stop master i cried in misery i dared not remove my hands from my hair i feared i would in my helplessness tear out my own hair please stop master i cried out twisting and squirming held in place by his hand on my neck i tried to fight the sensation of the whip writhe little dina he said writhe i cried out begging him to stop did you truly think he hissed we would take a profit of only a copper tarsk on you do you think us fools to buy a girl for twenty and sell her for twentyone do you not think we know our trade little slut i screamed for mercy then his demonstration finished he released my neck i fell to my knees before him on the block my head was down my hands were still in my hair you may remove your hands from your hair he said i took my hands from my hair and put them over my face weeping i shut my knees tightly trembling sobbing forty copper tarsks i heard call from the floor from the tavern of two chains the pleasure silk bids fifty tarsks i heard i had been tricked the auctioneer had caught me by surprise without warning i had been forced to reveal myself as a true slave girl openly inadvertently spontaneously incontrovertibly helplessly the jeweled ankle ring bids seventy i heard he had handled his work well he had exacted from the crowd the highest possible price in the given market before he revealed unexpectedly and to her dismay the delicious richness and vulnerability of the girls exploitable latencies they as much a part of her as her block measurements and as much for sale my responsiveness like my intelligence my service and my skills such as they were came with my price the gorean is satisfied only with the whole girl it is the whole girl that he buys the perfumed rope bids eighty copper tarsks i heard i could not believe the bids she is paga hot laughed a man true said another i wish i had her in my collar on the block i sobbed kneeling i could not help that i had responded as i had to the touch of the whip i could not help it the silver cage bids eightyfive i heard i wept shuddering i had been exhibited naked i was being sold to the highest bidder and i knew that i was not being sold merely as a beautiful girl for such a girl might have gone for twentyone tarsks but as something more as a beautiful slave girl i have heard from the agent of the silver cage called the auctioneer a bid of eightyfive copper tarsks is there another bid the belled collar i heard bids one silver tarsk there was silence in the hall there is a bid of one silver tarsk said the auctioneer i could tell he was pleased i looked down shuddering my knees closely together the recent bids had been by the agents of paga taverns i had some notion of what it would be to be a paga slave the belled silked girls of the taverns were well known in the cities of gor their purpose was to please the customers of their master they came with the price of a cup of paga the belled collar has given us a bid of one silver tarsk called the auctioneer is there a higher bid i looked up and startled saw the eyes of the various women over their veils upon me the holding of their bodies and what i could see of their faces frightened me i was regarded by them now with unmistakable hostility it is hard to be naked as a slave before a woman they make you feel doubly naked i would rather there had been only men in the market were the women comparing their beauty with mine perhaps unfavorably were they wondering perhaps if they might give a man more pleasure than i i wondered why now for the first time they looked upon me with such resentment such anger before they had only looked upon me as merely another girl slave to be sold from the block in her turn for a handful of copper tarsks but now they looked upon me differently now they looked upon me with the fury of the free woman for the hot desirable female slave were they jealous did they resent the interest of men did they wish that it was they upon the block i did not know free women are often cruel to beautiful female slaves they put us under terrifying discipline perhaps they sense in us something of greater interest to men than themselves something which constitutes to them a threat something which is subtly competitive and successfully so to them i do not know perhaps they fear us or the slave in themselves i do not know mostly i suspect the women were furious with me because i had been responsive to the touch of the auctioneers whip free women desiring to yield pride themselves on their capacity not to yield to maintain their quality and integrity slave girls on the other hand are not permitted such luxuries they whether they desire to yield or not must yield and totally perhaps free women wish they did not have to be free and could relate in biological naturalness like the slave girl to the dominant organism perhaps they wish they were slaves i do not know one thing is certain and that is that there is a deep psychological hostility on the part of the free woman for her sister in bondage particularly if she be beautiful slave girls accordingly fear free women slave girls want to be locked in the collars of men not women to make matters worse the women in the tiers because of the bidding now saw me and understood me as a girl destined for the taverns hot spiced meat delicious to men a delectable accompaniment like the music to the tawny fire of paga some of them looked at their companions or escorts did they wonder if some of them might now frequent a new paga tavern i shuddered i feared the hostility of the women for i was a slave stand little dina said the auctioneer i stood i brushed back my hair i choked back my sobs i looked out to the crowd to the men and the women i have from the tavern of the belled collar said the auctioneer a bid of one silver tarsk is there a higher bid strangely at that time i thought of elicia nevins who had been my rival at the college how amused she would be i thought to see me being sold naked from a block sold to the belled collar for a silver tarsk said the auctioneer i had been sold he then thrust me toward the stairs and i stumbling descended the stairs on the side opposite from that from which i had ascended the block girl i heard him call at the foot of the block a man from the house took me by the wrist and pulled me to a chain slave bracelets were fixed on the chain he thrust me behind the last girl on the chain she was kneeling braceleted to the chain facing away from me her head was down kneel he said i knelt he fastened my wrists in the dangling slave bracelets attached to the chain i then knelt at the chain secured in time another girl who too had been sold was placed on the chain behind me and then another and another i knelt locked in the bracelets secured to the chain i had been sold two men paga master i inquired he waved me away i turned from him with a rustle of bells looking about me the girl in the sand was quite good it was still early in the evening the sixteenth hour she scarcely moved swaying ankles close arms over her head wrists back to back palms turned out yet she subtly danced controlled by the music of a single flute some men watched her we had five dancers at the belled collar i thought all were fine the best would perform later in the evening four performed a day and one would rest i could not dance there was only one musician at the side of the sand others would join him later their leader was andronicus who played the czethar paga called a man i hurried to him carrying the large bronze vessel of paga on its strap about my shoulder i knelt and filled his cup he did not order me to an alcove i rose and carrying the vessel of paga went to the door of the tavern to step outside to taste the air as a paga girl i came with the purchased cup of fluid but of course i like the others was only a lovely option whether i served in an alcove depended entirely on the whim and appetite of the customer many men naturally came to the tavern only to meet their friends to talk and drink some nights i had not been used at all i had been of course completely available as paga girls went i was popular and my master busebius was not disappointed in me he had made i gather a good buy on me more than many of the girls had i squirmed in the alcoves sometimes chained writhing under the touch of masters whimpering and crying out the submission i could not help but yield i knew there were men who came back particularly for me i had brought business to the tavern the rules of the tavern with respect to the slave girls were simple the customer could select any serving slave for his pleasure providing he had paid the price of the paga he could pick the girl of his interest whether she had poured him the paga in question or not to be sure the customer usually commanded his paga from the wench who had caught his fancy if he was planning on using her if he was not interested in the having of a slave girl he would usually call his paga from the closest wench each cup of paga entitled him to take one slave to the alcove thus theoretically he might use several in one evening these arrangements however terminated with the dawn and the closing of the tavern he might not so to speak save his cups for later dancers must be separately negotiated for i stepped outside the tavern to drink in the pure air of gor we were permitted outside the tavern i stood beneath the sign of the belled collar which swung above me a large collar from which hung bells greetings teela said a man passing by greetings master i said i was teela a paga slave of the belled collar that could be read i understood on the closefitting steel collar i wore a tenhort collar i looked out over the bridge to the towers and cylinders beyond and to the sunset over the walls of ar i saw the tracery of the bridges against the sky the people moving about on them far below in the streets i could see carts and wagons too being drawn by tharlarion i looked up one or two tarnsmen on patrol i saw in the sky i thought of clitus vitellius greetings teela said the girl who now stood beside me who had come like myself from the tavern she like i wore slave bells on her left ankle brief parted yellow silk the house collar we stood barefoot on the bridge i did not speak to her but looked away i am sorry i fought you for the candy she said i won it i said angrily yes teela she said then she said angrily it fell closest to me it should have been mine busebius our master sometimes before ordering us to bathe and prepare ourselves for the floor scattered a handful of hard candies among us they were very precious and on the tiles of the slave room we fought for them i looked at bina i had leaped for the candy it had been snatched by her hand i had torn open her hand and thrust it in my mouth she had struck me and pulled my hair rolling wildly screaming we had bitten clawed and kicked at one another then busebius had whipped us apart we had shrunk back from one another cringing punished slave girls how foolish you looked laughed busebius we reddened we were only girls did he expect us to fight like men how small and weak we felt hurry now to the baths he said and thence to the room of preparation for you must be soon upon the floor yes master we had said standing outside the door to the belled collar we stepped back and knelt bran loort who had once been of tabuks ford carrying a low table entered the tavern he performed odd jobs about the tavern in return for his keep and a tarsk a week we had knelt because he was free yet i wondered if in his heart he was free he seemed a downcast defeated man he carried the table past us which he had taken to the shop of a carver and enameler to be inlaid with a kaissa board he was now returning it to the tavern he slept in the tavern overnight he was entitled to the use of the girls of the tavern as it was his place of employment yet he had never used one of us i feared he could not do so i recalled he had been defeated by thurnus and then stripped thrust before a raperack in the village on which a girl naked and helpless awaited him i give you my permission had said thurnus bran loort had looked down go ahead had urged thurnus take her i cannot had whispered bran loort he had been a defeated man he had turned away from the rack and bent down to pick up his tunic he had gone to the gate and it had been opened for him he had left the village of tabuks ford he had found his way to ar he did small work about the tavern bina and i regained our feet i am sorry i fought you for the candy she said i am stronger than you i said you should have given it to me no she said i did not speak to her but it is embarrassing to fight before the men as a slave she said the candy i said belongs to the girl who is strong enough to take it you are the only girl i know here said bina we were once both the slaves of clitus vitellius we have shared a chain before i want to be your friend you too i said looking at bina slave beads are the only old friend i have here let us be friends she said we are friends i said good she said hugging me i hugged and kissed her but the candy was mine i said slave she hissed her eyes flashing slave i cried hurry inside said busebius standing at the door do you think i bought you to stand outside like free ladies and sniff the air no master we cried and hurried within paga called a man i hurried to him it was now the eighteenth hour the tavern was more crowded i knelt back against the low wall my wrists braceleted over and behind my head to ring a customer had reserved me to himself i waited while he addressed himself to a game of kaissa i had been longer in the tavern than bina i had been twenty days slave here and she had been with us only six there were twentytwo slaves in the tavern not counting the dancers of which there were five do not run away had said the man putting me on my knees and braceleting my hands above and behind my head to the ring no master i had said through gritted teeth i watched him playing kaissa completely absorbed in the game i clenched my fists in the bracelets then i saw that he had brought about capture of home stone they put away the pieces sliding them into the drawer in the kaissa table they then conversed a bit discussing it seemed the game then one man left and he who had reserved me for himself as though recalling me took the rental key from his pouch and approached me i put my head down he unlocked the bracelets i looked up at him what is your name he asked teela i said i had told him before go to alcove six he said yes master i said does master desire special equipment or harnesses hook bracelets he said yes master i said putting my head down to his feet he then left me to return the bracelets and keys to the counter i rose to my feet and went to the slave room to fetch the hook bracelets leather cuffs with locks on them and snaps they are soft and the snaps as opposed to the cuffs require no key some men enjoy them on their slaves by means of the snaps the girl may be variously secured by the locked cuffs her hands being fastened behind her or before her or perhaps to her collar i then hurried to the alcove climbing the ladder the master was awaiting me he put forth his hand and i gave him the hook bracelets the keys for the hook bracelets are kept at the counter as are the keys to the steel slave bracelets remove your silk he said i did so extend your wrists he said i did so he fastened the hook bracelets on me he did not however fasten them together i knelt before him on the scarlet furs in the small alcove in the light of the tiny lamp i knelt in the position of the pleasure slave the cuffs locked on me address yourself to my pleasure he said yes master i said crawling forward head down my hair upon his body to kiss him it was well after the nineteenth hour and again i was upon the floor the tavern was crowded the music swirled loudly our finest dancer helen a slim blond earth girl tantalized the customers of busebius in her silver chains she wore the same collar as i there was no escape for her or for me our brands our collars the society guaranteed it if we escaped one master we would but fall to another we were slaves paga called a man i hurried to him on gor i had met four earth girls all were slaves too i had met several who though gorean bore the names of earth girls such names on gor i knew are regarded as excellent names for slaves i knelt and poured the man his paga paga called another i leaped to my feet to hurry to him and serve him never it seemed had we been so crowded i had not even had time to go to busebius behind his counter to have the hook bracelets removed from my wrists i brushed against bina she hurrying to serve another of our masters customers i heard helen cry out as silk was torn from her thigh still she danced a man reached for my ankle i fled past him i hurried to the counter and handed busebius who was beaming the paga vessel and strap again it had been emptied he dipped the vessel into a great vat of paga and returned it to me paga paga i heard i did not even have time to slip the vessel on its strap over my shoulder holding its two handles with my hands i fled back with a jangle of slave bells to the floor to serve the door of the paga tavern flew open the music for a moment stopped helen froze in a motion eyes turned toward the door my heart skipped a beat impressive men stood there warriors though not in the garb of ar their leader without helmet but in cloak and medallion indicated that the music should continue the musicians again played and again helen danced the leader of the newcomers removed his gloves slowly and thrust them in his belt his eyes viewed the slave body of helen as a masters eyes look upon the flesh of a property girl busebius bowing rushed to him the stranger casually looked away from helen and she bit her lip tears in her eyes no longer under his scrutiny he looked upon me and i straightened my body he was incredibly strong and handsome i hoped that i looked my most beautiful he turned his attention to busebius who was speaking to him who is it i heard a man ask bina stood near to me she shook she read the medallion of the stranger see the medallion said a man busebius conducted the visitors his honored guests to a private corner of the tavern from which on the raised dais there they might well view the room the musicians and the dancer do you not know them asked a man no said the other beside me bina trembled they are the delegation of the salerian confederation said the first their leader asked the other thandar of ti said the first i now well understood the agitation of bina thandar of ti of the warriors of the four cities of the salerian confederation was the fifth son of ebullius gaius cassius of the warriors administrator of ti high officer of the confederation at one time a girl the lady sabina the daughter of a merchant kleomenes of fortress of saphronicus high merchant of that city had been pledged in companion contract to this thandar of ti raiders had struck the companion caravan acquiring its riches and carrying off the lady sabina and others to guarantee the frustration of the companion contract and to prevent the alliance of fortress of saphronicus with the salerian confederation the lady sabina had been reduced to slavery she had been made worthless in the affairs of state the alliance of fortress of saphronicus and the confederation of saleria had never taken place bad blood now existed between them how beautiful he is breathed bina never had thandar of ti and the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus as far as i knew looked upon one another their companionship had been an intended match of state bina slave beads gazed upon the powerful wondrous thandar of ti he is handsome i said my ears are pierced wept bina my ears are pierced never now if ever could she have hoped to be companion to such a man thandar of ti and his fellows some five of them ordered from busebius who stood eagerly about them they would have more than paga they would be fed and have wines the presence of the august visitors except perhaps by the slaves was forgotten thandar of ti looked in our direction we knelt two beautiful slave girls lowly piercedear girls paga slaves it was a great honor for girls such as we that a man such as thandar of ti would even deign to cast a glance upon us thandar of ti looked away i smiled to myself at the irony of the situation in looking upon one of us upon one of two lowly exquisite slaves he had been looking upon she who had once been the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus once intended to sit regally at his side gloriously robed his free companion there were tears in the eyes of bina thandar of ti i noted was very handsome you have little paga left i said my flask is full i will serve them more than one must serve them said bina please teela he is quite handsome i said i will be enough i wish to serve him said bina simply i will serve him i said do you think he will buy you asked bina i do not know i said perhaps i rose lightly to my feet bina quickly followed my example busebius hurried toward us he gestured to us and to four of the other girls he gathered us about him we were excited you six will serve he said indicating the men on the dais two of the girls cried out with pleasure to be selected go swiftly to the room of preparation he said garb yourselves as the hunters catch i was startled the guests must be important indeed we hurried to the room of preparation busebius went to give orders to the men in the kitchens we must serve the initial wines swiftly with the matched breads and cheeses we tore aside our silks in the room of preparation we freshened our perfumes and adjusted our makeup we must be soft and perfumed and luscious busebius thrust his head into the room of preparation earrings he said jewelry then he disappeared again i do not want to wear earrings wept one girl put them on slave i snapped i did not want to be beaten for one of us who was not pleasing i fastened golden loops in my ears and slung necklaces about my throat i slipped on an armlet beside me bina placed earrings unprotestingly on her ears do you too not weep to put on earrings i asked her no she said i am a piercedear girl the earrings i noted jeweled droplets were very beautiful upon her i reached into a chest for hunters netting it is a stout cording used to net mediumsized game its mesh was spaced at some two horts about two and a half inches cunningly we twisted netting about us from our throats to our brands high upon our thighs we garbed ourselves as the hunters catch we looked in the mirror several of us gasped seldom had we seen such exciting girls hurry said busebius again appearing at the entry to the room of preparation we knew then the wines and the matched breads and cheeses were ready teela wait said bina the other girls left the room of preparation we must hurry i said i know what you intend teela said bina and it is not proper i do not understand i said how could she know what i had in mind bina stood between myself and the door get out of my way i said do you want us to be beaten i looked at her angrily do you fear i asked that your thandar of ti will find me more pleasing than you no she said teela i do not i am not a free woman i do not fear your slave competition i know that i am beautiful and i can compete with you as a slave girl for any man i sniffed but you have more in mind teela i know you you are not gorean you do not understand these things i looked at her in fury failing to please him more than i failing to interest him in your purchase she said it is your intention to tell him who i was i looked at her startled how could she have known my plan you think then he will free me and free you for having told him this truth i did not speak to her she turned her head from side to side my ears are pierced teela she said you will only do him dishonor if you show him my present state dont you want to slip your collar i asked i seized the closecircling steel on my throat do you want to wear this i cried do you want to be a slave at the complete mercy of men i will not do dishonor to thandar of ti she said i will serve him not known to him lovingly as only what i am a lowly paga slave you are mad i said i am gorean she said this decision i smiled we will let thandar of ti make we will let him decide no teela she said i have decided it get out of my way i said no she said look i said even if he likes me and buys me i will tell him who you are a little sooner or a little later if only to gain our freedoms i know you would teela said bina i have your interest too at heart i said i am sure you do she said but you do not understand us you do not understand goreans i want to be free i snapped look at yourself in the long mirror teela said bina i did so and saw there a marvelous girl soft and perfumed branded she wore a bit of netting and jewelry she wore earrings she was collared what do you see there asked bina a slave girl i said do you think a girl such as you so soft and beautiful with your slave reflexes can ever be anything but a slave on this world no i said bitterly and your ears are pierced she said i tossed my head i know i said that in itself i knew would be enough to keep me a slave on gor i would always be a slave on gor abandon then your mad plan to reveal my former identity to thandar of ti said bina no i said she looked at me angrily i could win for myself and you i said if nothing better an easier slavery no she said do you think i want to be only a paga girl i asked do you think being a paga girl is an easy slavery for a girl of earth i am not as you i am more sensitive do you think i like being at the bidding and mercy of any male who can afford a cup of paga if you spoke to thandar of ti said bina you would win for us both only a whipping i shall take that chance i said i am sorry said bina you shall not out of my way i said this is a matter between slaves she said and i have decided it you may think to serve him like a little fool he not knowing who you are i said but i shall not permit that hurry hurry called one of the other girls we must hurry i cried miserably it is your intention then said bina to inform thandar of ti of my former identity yes i said i shall i will gamble anything for an easier slavery now get out of my way she did not move but looked at me angrily i am stronger than you i said get out of my way surely she remembered how easily i had robbed her of the candy earlier in the afternoon she was no match for me suddenly i cried out as she leaped upon me tearing and scratching i could scarcely defend myself she seized me by the hair and threw me headlong across one of the vanity tables before the long mirror i slid on the table scattering combs and perfume she was on my back tearing down the netting fouling my legs in it i still wore the hook bracelets she pulled my wrists behind my back and swiftly snapped together the leather cuffs i twisted on the vanity table and fell to the floor my wrists confined by the linked snaps behind my back i shall scream i cried swiftly bina thrust a scarf in my mouth wadding it tightly and fastened it in place with another scarf pulling the second scarf tight behind my neck and deeply between my teeth she then with the netting tied together my ankles she then found another hunters net but one which had not been cut she threw the net over me and drawing tight its strings confined me helplessly in it she then pulled me by the cords to the side of the room she sat me against the wall and using the four cords of the net tying them through a slave ring at the foot of the wall fastened me netted to the wall i squirmed in the netting but could not free myself i looked at her in fury you are the catch of the huntress said bina bina i heard teela i am coming cried bina teela is ill she then blew me a kiss and hurried out of the room i struggled helplessly it was the first hour in the morning of the same night when bina returned she was radiant she removed the netting from me and the gag from my mouth thandar of ti i asked he is gone now she said she happily undid the netting which confined my ankles you did not tell him i asked no she said of course not you are a fool i said it was i she said of the six girls whom he chose to pour his paga six i asked when you were taken ill she laughed busebius sent helen to serve with us i see i said would you please unsnap the hook bracelets in an instant with infuriating ease she had opened the snaps freeing my wrists one from the other i was furious it was so simple she who wears the bracelets of course cannot reach the snaps it was i too said bina dreamily whom he took to serve him in the alcove she closed her eyes holding herself with her arms oh how beautiful he is she said and how well i served him she opened her eyes the pleasure he gave me she moaned i could not believe the pleasure she looked at me directly how fortunate it is she said that i did not become his companion i do not understand i said for then this night i could not have been his slave she whispered oh i said i shall remember all my life she said the night i was slave to thandar of ti i looked down i remembered the joy of once having been the slave of clitus vitellius of having been his to dominate and command then i remembered that i hated him teela said a voice a mans voice that of busebius yes master i said are you feeling better now he asked yes master i said why then he asked are you not in your silk and pouring paga i looked at his whip i hurry master i said quickly paga called a man and i in bells and silk hurried to him to pour him drink i was barefoot on the tiles the slave bells thonged were tied about my left ankle there were fewer now in the tavern and in another ahn or two we would close the doors some of the girls already had been permitted to retire i knelt before the man and poured him paga head down the hook bracelets had been removed from my wrists by busebius who held their key i wore only bells and silk it was late the earrings the necklace the armlet i had left in the room of preparation i was now only a simple paga slave only one other girl was on the floor paga said a mans voice i turned toward him i saw he sat with a second man i knelt before them head down and poured the paga into his cup serve me the paga said the man i put down the paga flask which i carried that i might unencumbered assume the position of serving paga or wine to a gorean male first remove the silk he said i did so he was a customer i was his to command then i knelt naked before him head down you may now serve the paga he said yes master i said i reached to take the cup in both hands one kneels one proffers the cup head down with both hands to the male i reached to take the cup suddenly on my closely placed wrists ns i went to lift the cup with a startling flash of metal and two swift snaps slave bracelets locked i looked up startled no i cried we have you he said i tried to jerk back but his hand on the chain between the bracelets held me my hands confined in his bracelets you have been the object of an intensive and difficult search said the second voice i regarded them terrified i have sold you for two tarsks to these gentlemen said busebius i felt him remove the thonged slave bells from my left ankle he placed them on the table i felt him thrust a key into the small heavy lock at the back of my collar he opened it and placed it too on the table she is yours masters be said oh no no i begged busebius turned and left the table we have paid two silver tarsks for you said one of the men i knelt naked before them horrified wearing their bracelets you are now ours said the other man do not kill me i begged serve us paga said the first man trembling i nude braceleted proffered paga first to one and then the other they drank slowly enjoying their triumph and my misery we must now be on our way said the first man each took one of my arms and between them half thrust half dragged they forced me from the paga tavern please do not kill me i begged they were the two men whom i had first encountered on gor when i had awakened nude chained by the neck in the wilderness they had at one point prepared to cut my throat please do not kill me i begged please masters do not kill me between them held braceleted i was forced from the tavern and out onto the long bridge into the gorean night i am spoken to by my mistress i was thrown to the tiles before the recumbent figure seated on the curule chair this is your mistress said one of the men indicating the recumbent figure with lovely figure veiled and gowned who sat easily regally on the curule chair i looked up from my knees her slave the bracelets had been removed from me i had been placed in a brief white house tunic sleeveless i was barefoot it was all i wore leave us said the seated woman the two men withdrew i put my head down to the tiles alone with my mistress lift your head judy said the woman i looked up startled do you not know me judy asked the woman no mistress i said the woman put back her head and laughed merrily my mind raced i could not know her and yet she spoke as though i should know her and she had called me judy i had not been called judy since i had left earth judy thornton laughed the woman i detected by her laughter that she was young that she too was only a girl save perhaps that she might be a bit older than i my mistress was a girl i was owned by a girl mistress i asked has slavery been hard for you lovely judy she asked oh yes mistress i said would you not like to be free she asked yes mistress i cried smiling with a graceful gesture the woman lifted back her veil revealing her face elicia i cried elicia nevins i cried weeping with joy i threw myself into her arms sobbing and she put her arms about me i could not control my emotions the ordeal was now over i shook half choking half sobbing behind me now was the steel of slave bracelets the fear of the whip the misery and degradation of the slave girl i love you elicia i cried i love you i would now be free soon with elicias help i would be returned safe to earth she had rescued me i love you elicia i wept the woman thrust me from her and i startled slipped back losing my footing to the tiles i was on my knees i looked at her puzzled it is well she said that a slave girl loves her mistress please do not joke i begged are you not grateful to me she asked yes yes i cried i am grateful so grateful to you elicia it is well she said that a slave girl is grateful to her mistress that she is permitted to live and is not slain elicia i asked do not rise from your knees she said coldly when will i be freed and returned to earth i asked you always were a stupid little fool she said i wondered what the boys ever saw in you i do not understand i said that is why you are a slave and i am free she said surely i whispered you do not intend to keep me as a slave you are of earth this is not earth she said oh please elicia i said silence she said i was silent we were great rivals were we not she asked yes i said i shall enjoy owning you she said as a serving slave oh no elicia i begged i saw you as a slave even on earth she said coldly when i saw you in classes in the cafeteria in the library walking on campus attending functions dating laughing applauding lying beside the pool posing for the boys cute pretty trying to pretend to be more beautiful than i i saw you as what you truly were and deserved to be and would someday beonly a lovely little slave free me i begged she laughed you asked if i wanted to be free i moaned do you she asked yes yes i cried that will make the owning of you all the more pleasant she said but you should not be free you are a natural slave she said like many of the women of earth you are of earth i cried yes she said but i am not a natural slave i am different from the others i put down my head are you familiar with the duties of a serving slave she asked elicia i cried are you she asked i do not wish to spend a great deal of time training you to some extent i said coldly it is all a little thing like you is good for she said i will get much use from you please elicia i wept breaking go into my room she said through the door on your right on the wall there is an opened slave collar and a slave whip bring them i went into the beautiful room lavishly appointed with chests mirrors and sunken bath i found the collar and whip and barefoot returned i handed her the collar and whip kneel she said i stepped back and knelt you were very pretty on the block she said you saw i moaned everything she said i put down my head she had seen me exhibited naked and sold why did you not buy me then i asked there were excellent reasons not to do so she said it was enough to know your location and where you could be obtained i do not understand i said to determine she said that others did not follow you i do not understand i said the search for you she said was long you have gone to much trouble i said to secure a female serving slave your name is judy she said naming me yes mistress i said you understand of course she said that you bear the name now as a slave name yes mistress i said it might be changed or taken from me at her whim you will address me she said as lady elicia my mistress or as you have done simply as mistress that sort of thing yes lady elicia my mistress i said excellent judy she said you learn swiftly she leaned back oh i shall relish owning you she said i shall demean and humiliate you and work you and have whatever i wish from you yes lady elicia my mistress i whispered my former rival now owned me she rose easily from the curule chair and stood before me she held the opened collar before me it was slender but sturdy steel enameled with white decorated with tiny flowers in pink a collar suitable for a womans girl there was printing in the enamel tiny exact see the printing she asked yes mistress i said i know you are illiterate she said so i shall read it to you it says i am judy return me to the lady elicia of six towers then she said put down your head slave i knelt with my head down the collar was locked on my throat she stepped back miss judy thornton she said collared at my feet she turned in the lovely gown she wore her arms raised fists clenched eyes closed the triumph the pleasure of it she cried the collar i whispered has my name on it yes she said looking at me it has been waiting for you a long time it is a tenhort collar i whispered i could tell by its feel your size exactly she laughed i wondered when the measurement could have been taken from what she had said i gathered the collar had not been made recently that it had not been made following the sale in the house of publius in which my various measurements those of a slave had been made public i looked at her you were measured when you were unconscious she smiled before you left earth how did i come here i asked unconscious she said naked in a slave capsule i shuddered do you know she asked who it was who picked you for slavery who designated you for the collar from among hundreds of other girls screened who might have been taken no mistress i said it was i she said but why mistress i begged because it pleased me she said and i wanted you for my slave i looked at her with horror i felt the whip thrust against my mouth press your lips to the whip she said i did so what is the duty of a slave girl she asked absolute obedience i whispered kiss the whip she said i did so she then went back to the curule chair and seated herself upon it regarding me she held the whip in her right hand its blades folded in her left i am sure we will get on well wont we judy she asked yes lady elicia my mistress i whispered she looked at me intently what is it like truly to be a slave she asked horrifying mistress i said i mean she said to be the slave of aof a man oh it is horrifying mistress i said i would have thought she said that you a girl such as you not i might have enjoyed it oh no mistress i said it is humiliating degrading and terrible we must obey them in all things you cannot conceive of what it means are you not what is spoken of as a hot slave she asked oh no mistress i protested i saw you on the block she said i put down my head confused angry i think you are a little whore she said a little tart i have always thought so oh no mistress i said it is girls such as you responsive to men she said who demean our sex who have made it difficult for us on earth oh no mistress i said you insult women and make us seem slaves she said angrily i despise your sort i hold you in contempt i shook my head negatively tears in my eyes do you find pleasure in the touch of men she asked no mistress i said no she looked at me not speaking it seemed strange to me later that we together had spoken so it was as though each of us desired to appear more frigid and less passionate than the other as though the restriction or impairment of our natural sexuality were somehow desirable or meritorious women of earth i knew sensitive to a heritage of insane values of antibiological acculturation sometimes competed with one another in their attempts to appear frigid a competition which was often carried into the bedrooms of their husbands few wives i knew would dare to let themselves appear to their husbands as a hot panting bitch slave girls on the other hand are given no choice as a free woman she said i have had little opportunity to see a slave girl used she looked at me curious tellius she called barus the two men who had caught me entered the room the lady elicia indicated me to them amuse yourselves with her he said have mercy on your slave i cried by the arms i was thrown back on the tiles i wept the tunic torn away from me my body red and helpless writhing on the tiles can there be more asked the lady elicia amazed she has not yet even experienced the first slave orgasm said tellius crouching beside me looking up i turned my head from side to side in misery i looked up at him i tried to lie still but my body leaped to his touch i cried out in misery is it soon she asked yes said tellius note her breathing the mottling of her skin how she moves her eyes oh please mistress have mercy on me i wept do not let them touch me further please please mistress then i threw back my head and screamed i clutched at tellius you are my master i whispered hoarsely you are my master do not move he said oh please master i wept you may now move he said i screamed and clutched at him eyes closed clawing at him trying to bring our bodies closer then i threw back my head eyes wild lips parted and screamed delivering my body to my master it is the first of the slave orgasms said tellius i love you master i wept clutching him gone now was the thought of the lady elicia i a slave girl was in the arms of a gorean male i covered him with kisses and caresses weeping please touch your slave more master i begged little whore sneered the lady elicia touch me more master i begged i knew you would be like this even at the college she said lovely judy a little whore i licked at the hair on the upper arm of tellius please master i begged him you are lower than a whore said the lady elicia she looked down at me in fury you are a slave girl i love you master i whispered to tellius finish with her said the lady elicia rising angrily from the curule chair and when you are done with her see that she is cleaned and groomed and presented to me in a fresh tunic yes lady said tellius the lady elicia left the room i looked at tellius with terror please do not finish swiftly with your slave master i begged do not fear little slut he said and they did not finish swiftly but exacted from me the full ecstatic penalties of my bondage when barns rose from my side spurning me with his foot i had been well used kneel said the lady elicia i knelt before her in fresh tunic in her bedroom you were long she said forgive a girl i said do you have any doubt asked the lady elicia that you are a slave no mistress i said i put down my head i remembered tellius and barns prepare my bath she said i went to draw water from the cistern too i lit the tiny oil fire beneath the tempering vessel on its iron tripod one regulates the temperature by mixing warmer and cooler waters a serving slave must know the exact temperature at which her mistress wishes the water of her bath the lady elicia would tell me once i knew after that if it were not correct i would be punished i knew she would have little patience with me i must serve her perfectly when the water was ready i prepared the oils the towels and foams of the bath your bath is ready lady elicia my mistress i said kneeling before her untie my sandals she said sitting on her bed and disrobe me i obeyed remove your tunic she said i did so look now she said in the great mirror who is more beautiful i knelt looking in the mirror i choked back a tear i had always thought that perhaps it was i who was the most beautiful but i saw now that we were naked that she my mistress was more beautiful than i elicia nevins who had been my beauty rival i saw was truly my superior in beauty i had not known this until now who is more beautiful she asked you lady elicia my mistress i said truly she asked smiling yes i said head down lady elicia my mistress she walked to the side of the tub bring me the whip she said i fetched the whip and handed it to her judy she said yes mistress i said you are now a womans slave she said yes mistress i said you will comport yourself with dignity she said you will not be an embarrassment to me mistress i asked suddenly she struck me with the whip and i turned spinning away and was struck again and i fled to the wall and was struck again and i knelt at the wall my face to it my hands to the wall and was struck again if you so much as look at a man she said i will whip the flesh from your bones yes mistress i wept slave girl cried the lady elicia i crouched by the wall having been whipped yes lady elicia my mistress i said attend me now she said i would bathe she entered the water gracefully her hair bound in a towel luxuriating in the multicolored foams of beauty she lifted her limbs washing herself indolently beautifully i knelt beside the sunken bath to wait upon her her slave should she desire aught what are you thinking judy she asked if i told mistress i said she would whip me no said the lady elicia what are you thinking i was thinking i said that a man would love to have his collar on you she laughed merrily perhaps she said i am very beautiful yes mistress i said you are one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen do you think i would bring a high price she asked yes mistress i said she laughed free me mistress i begged free me do you truly think she asked that you were brought to gor to be freed and returned to earth i do not know why i was brought to gor i said i do she said merely to be your slave i asked it could have been that she said we have our pick but there is more i asked of course she said we needed a girl one to bear a message she would be placed in a given location secured when it seemed safe she would be picked up and transmitted to the proper contact there she would deliver the message she looked at me unfortunately she said tellius and barus lost you they were going to kill me i cried they sought the message in clear form she said they did not at that time understand how you carried the message i do it is fortunate for us as well as you that you were not slain they thinking you had disposed of the message cheating us of its contents they wanted slave beads i said i had none yes she said i carry no message i said you do she said but you do not know you carry it i did not believe this but it is not wise to argue with the mistress could not a man have carried the message i asked slave girls she said attract little attention save by their flesh and person they may be bought and sold and may easily change hands they are often transported great distances even hooded if they are ignorant they are ideal couriers they themselves do not even know they carry the message they cannot even suspect themselves why should others then seeing only another branded chained girl suspect them you are very clever mistress i said further she said even should the message fall into the wrong hands it is concealed and would not be understood as a message and even if it were understood as a message its secret would be kept for it is well enciphered your security is brilliant mistress i whispered she lifted one of her arms bathing it letting the water fall from it you are involved in a struggle i said yes she said i am an agent of a military and political power a greater power than you understand exists one of interplanetary scope it is called the kurii worlds are locked in war a fierce silent war unknown to you unknown to millions at stake are gor and earth in such a war i said communication is important and difficult she said the enemy are not fools could not radio be used i asked i assumed such devices must be available signals can be jammed and scrambled she said and it is dangerous to bring such material to the surface of gor the enemy swiftly locates and destroys it she lifted one slim lovely ankle observing it and then dipped it again into the foams of her bath i thought she would take like myself a numbertwo ankle ring as you note she said there is nothing here at six towers which suggests that i am not an ordinary woman of ar what is the message i carry i asked i do not know she said any girl i said might have carried this message any piece of suitable slave flesh said the lady elicia then why was i chosen i asked she laughed at the college she said you competed with me you challenged me you dared to set yourself up as a rival to me it was then that i determined you lovely meaningless little fool that i would have you as my serving slave what is to be done with me i asked in the morning she said you will be appropriately identified and transmitted as a naked slave by tarn to the port of schendi whence by slave ship you will be transported to the island of cos identified i asked slave ship a small chemical brand she said which you will wear in your flesh something by which our agents in cos will recognize you chemical brand i said it will remain invisible until the proper reagent is applied she said can it be removed i asked yes she said but you cannot remove it it requires the proper combination of chemicals will it be removed i asked of course she said after it has done its work identifying you for our agents it would be foolish to leave it fixed in your body would it not to arouse the puzzlement of the curious perhaps even to identify you as our message girl to the agents of the enemy yes mistress i said she blew foam from her hand watching the bubbles drift in the air the slave ship she said will not be pleasant what will be done to me in cos i asked you will be placed in the chatka and curla a paga tavern she said and from there our agents will make their contact will i understand the message i asked no she said you will not understand it you will only deliver it and i asked when the message is delivered then she said you will be returned to me and then i asked then she said leaning back in the sunken bath luxuriating in the warm foamy water you will begin your life as my serving slave judy yes lady elicia my mistress i said a sail i screamed wildly in the darkness jerking back my ankle from the edge of the sturdy mesh about me my ankles would pull back toward me only some six inches as they were chained i lay on my back i clasped my shaven head in my hands my hands too were chained the two chains running to a heavy ring over and above my head in the slatted wood of the tier on which i lay i could lower the heel of my hands only to the side of my neck but it was enough to cover my ears when it became necessary to do so i screamed and thrashed i could tell my ankle was bleeding from the feeling of the wound and the wetness about my shin and on the wood i tried with my right foot to press against the wound to stanch the flow of blood i saw the blazing coppery eyes of the longhaired ship urt on the other side of the mesh i had let the shin of my left foot rest against the mesh let me out i screamed let me out sometimes an urt manages to force its way through the mesh or between one of the vertical cage lids one at each end of the cage and the cage the girl then chained as she is is at its mercy be silent said a girls voice from the next cage i could not see her or the others please masters i wept let me out let me out masters be silent she scolded i tried to be silent i twisted on the slatted wood please master i had wept put me in a deck cage these were small cages lashed down sometimes kept on the deck of a crowded slave ship this ship a small one had only twenty such cages arranged amidships in two rows back to back two cages high five cages long in harsh weather and at night these cages are often covered with tarpaulins this tends to prevent undue weathering of the cagemetal due to salt and moisture during the day the tarpaulins are usually laid aside unless they are tied over the cages to discipline the girls there are two major advantages to having the tarpaulins put aside first the sailors may then for their pleasure gaze upon the lovely prisoners of the cages secondly the girls when they reach their port of sale will be tanned perfectly completely any girl on the ship incidentally unless she is certified white silk a virgin is free to the sailors for their sport there were no white silk girls on board we were all red silk this was not unusual there are few virgin slaves their virginity usually does not last more than an ahn beyond their first sale it is the deckcage girls who are most often used for the sport of the sailors in daylight hours their charms are on almost constant display they are not chained in the hold they may pose and wheedle and thrust their arms through the bars to touch the sailors also they are more readily available a cage door need only be opened and the girl pulled to the deck or thrown across the tarpaulins put me in a deck cage master i had begged he had looked down upon me captain of the ship chain her below he had said i had been dragged from his feet i screamed again be silent said another girl angrily i thrashed on the wood i could feel the ship lice i could not tear at them with my fingernails i was not chained in such a way as to permit that this was intentional i writhed on the slatted wood screaming be silent said the first girl it is not the time permitted for screaming i do not care i cried i heard a noise i was frightened a hatch was thrown open and a man descended the stairs into the hold suddenly in the dim light falling through the opened hatch i could see the musty tiers and their helpless fair occupants the man looked about she it was she it was who screamed cried the girl next to me indicating me with her head no i cried it was not i it was she cried the first girl yes she cried several others i sensed the man standing behind me on a ramp i was bitten i said i was bitten i twisted on the wood trying to see him have mercy master i said i was bitten it was not the time permitted for screaming he said yes master i said forgive me i begged master there were eight slave platforms in the hold each with six tiers these platforms were separated by narrow aisles also they did not adjoin the sides of the hold thus allowing a passage between them and the wall of the hold on both the left and right side of the ship on each tier of each platform there were five girls there were thus two hundred and forty girls in the hold a cunning mesh and cage arrangement is incorporated into the platforms the slatted wood of the tiers on which the girls lay permits cage mesh to pass unimpeded from the roof of the sixth tier to the bottom of the first tier the mesh is cleated to the wood of each tier each girl in effect has her own meshed cage separate from that of the others thus if an urt manages to enter one area he has at his mercy only one captive not five the top of the sixth tier and the bottom slats of the first tier are sheathed in tin to prevent being gnawed by urts mesh too heavy and sturdy closes off the ends of the slave cubicles formed in the mesh at the ends of the cubicle formed both the end at the girls feet and that at her head there is a tiny gate the girl may be placed in the cage or removed from it from either end she normally inches her way into the cubicle from the top end and one slaver from the bottom secures her ankles in their irons then shutting that gate and another secures her wrists in their irons then shutting that gate each girl thus has to herself a small rectangular cage area surrounded on four sides by mesh on the bottom by the slatted wood of the tier and on the top by the wood of the tier above her unless she is on the sixth tier and then she has above her of course the ceiling of her cubicle the bottom of the platform roof she is chained in such a way as to preclude movement which might tear at the mesh or break it thus making possible the entry of urts which might eat at her lowering her price and to preclude her tearing hysterically with her hands and fingernails at her own body bloodying herself perhaps scarring herself again lowering her price in her attempt to obtain relief from the bites and itching consequent upon the infestation and depredation of the numerous almost constantly active ship lice the first tier is raised from the floor of the hold by some eighteen inches providing a crawl space the open spaces between the tinsheathed wood slats on the first tier are covered from the bottom by cleated mesh which prevents urts from entering from the bottom the crawl space between the floor of the hold and the first tier is cleaned once a day each girl all in all has a space private to her slavery of some twentyfive inches in width by some eighteen inches in height by some six feet five inches in length in this space she is chained helplessly of the six tiers in my platform i was on the fourth i heard the man loosen the small gate behind my head i did not know why he did this master i asked he let the gate then swing down on its hinges and lie against its bolts he did not snap it shut master i asked frightened he turned away i heard him on the ramp master i screamed terrified i will be silent i will be silent i turned my head wildly trying to look back please master i begged please i will be silent master the sharp furred cold snout of an urt could now as the gate lay against its bolts thrust between the gate and the side of the cage the animal might now swiftly furtively slither into the cage which i helplessly chained must then share with it master i screamed i was terrified of urts master please i screamed i will be silent i will be silent i heard him pause on the ramp he turned and returned to my cage i will be silent master i whispered terrified i will be silent master i whispered please master he snapped shut the tiny gate and left in a few moments the hatch closed and we were again in total darkness the ship shifted in the water and i could hear the waves against the hull in a few minutes the man gone i heard the urt it or another moving about on the wood between the meshes i gritted my teeth so that i would not cry out from the misery of the lice i drew my feet and hands in their chains as near the center of my space as i could i made no sound the vertical gate of the cage space that gate behind my head was thrown open and hooked back i put my head back master i said but i could not speak for the spike of the bota was thrust between my teeth and i must drink when the spike was withdrawn i again tried to speak master i begged but his heavy hand thrust bread in my mouth crusts of satarna bread wadding it in then he went to the next cage and the next similarly watering and feeding their occupants i knew he would return to finish the feeding with another draft of water a spoon of salt and a slice of the bitter tospit bit by bit flake by flake dampened struggling trying not to choke i swallowed the crusts with which my mouth had been crammed i heard him again then behind my head almost never did i get to see the male at whose mercy i was chained the botas spike was again forced into my mouth i drank when the spike was pulled away i whispered quickly please master may a slave speak yes he said remove me from the cage i begged let me go on deck i will do anything you are a slave he said you must do anything anyway yes master i said miserably it was true a slave had no bargaining power all that she could possibly give was free to the master at his slightest glance or word open your mouth he said select me out i begged when next a girl is pulled from the cage for the sport of the sailors no me said the girl next to me i am a pleasure slave i said i too master said the girl next to me on my left i felt the spoon beside my mouth and i opened my mouth and the salt was thrown into my mouth you each he said in your turn will have half an ahn on the deck thank you master i said the slice of tospit was thrust in my mouth the cage gate behind me was snapped shut i bit into the tospit it was bitter but juicy it was relished by my body i made each drop last as long as i could i had not finished it even when the feeding was done and the hatch closed shutting us again in the darkness of the hold of the slave ship i threw back my head reveling in the wind and sunlight i could not believe the freshness of the air the winds of thassa the brightness of the sky this morning i had been removed from the cage a tether put about my left ankle given a rag and pan and set to clean the crawl space beneath the slave platforms four times had i vomited and fainted but each time by the tether i was drawn from beneath the platform and revived and set again about my work i was struck twice with the whip with four other girls later with buckets i emptied the bilge which lies below and at the center of the floor of the hold under a removable wooden grille we had then been permitted to ascend to the deck to empty the wastes and seepage after this we had been permitted to clean ourselves as we could with sea water and brushes the deck is kept clean by the girls in the deck cages the girls in the deck cages are permitted to keep their hair the hair of the belowdeck girls mercifully is shaved off indeed our body hair too was shaved off completely these precautions prevent to a great extent the nesting of ship lice after we were cleaned we were leashed and exercised for a few minutes on the deck then each of us for the remainder of our time on deck the precious half of an ahn was chained in a kneeling position our hands before our bodies i had been taken by tellius the henchman of the lady elicia of ar by tarn to schendi this infamous port is the home port of the famed black slavers of schendi a league of slavers well known for their cruel depredations on shipping but it is also a free port administered by black merchants and its fine harbor and its inland markets to the north and east attract much commerce it is thought that an agreement exists between the merchants of schendi and the members of the league of black slavers though i know of few who have proclaimed this publicly in schendi and lived the evidence if evidence it is that such an agreement exists is that the black slavers tend to avoid preying on shipping which plies to and from schendi they conduct their work commonly in more northern waters returning to schendi as their home port the ship on which i was carried was the round ship or cargo ship clouds of telnus registered in cos but with shipping papers clearing it for the waters of schendi it was some twenty feet wide at its broadest point and some one hundred and twenty feet in length it had two masts with permanent rigging it was also equipped with oars but these were primarily used in entering and leaving a harbor the round ship as opposed to the long ship or war ship relies predominantly upon its sails the clouds of telnus was said to be a mediumclass ship its deep hold i gather would carry several tons of cargo i found it a lovely ship discounting the miseries of its hold and it was particularly beautiful under sail the sails like those of most gorean ships were triangular telnus our destination is the capital city of the island of cos one of gors two largest maritime ubarates cos lies north of tyros and west of port kar which latter city is located in the tamber gulf which lies just beyond the vosks delta there are four major cities on cos telnus selnar temos and lad telnus is the largest of these and has the best harbor the ubar of cos is lurius from the city of jad the capital of tyros gors other largest maritime ubarate is kasra its other large city is tentium her ubar is called chenbar he is from kasra and is spoken of i understand as the sea sleen some years ago tyros and cos joined fleets for war on port kar but in a significant naval battle the two ubarates were defeated port kar lacked the power and shipping to follow up its victory tyros and cos and port kar remain to this day in a state of war with respect to one another the deck was white and smooth to my knees it had been rubbed with deck stones and washed down and scrubbed the deckcage girls on their hands and knees ankles shackled attended to this work i looked out across the water the sky was very bright it was precious being above deck how ugly you are belowdeck girl said one of the girls in a small deck cage i looked at her she was auburnhaired and like all the slave girls on the clouds of telnus whether cage girls or belowdeck girls stripped girls are not permitted clothing on a slave ship she was sitting with her knees drawn up in the tiny cage she could not completely stretch her body i did not bother to respond to her if her hair had been shaven away she too would not be too beautiful i would have liked to have stood over her her control slave whip in hand when she had scrubbed on the deck she would not then i think have spoken so insolently i heard the lookout cry out from high above on the highest the second of the two masts he spoke of a sail and its location it could not be seen from the deck men ran to the left side of the ship some climbed one of the two masts the captain spoke swiftly to his crew the two men at the steering oars one on each side of the ship at its back turned the vessel away from the left men rushed to the benches and slid oars through the oar openings in the side of the ship another man began to call to them and their oars in unison began to dip and pull men ran here and there about the deck some attended to ropes some lashed down loose objects on the deck weapons were fetched and sand and water hatches were closed and secured i was very excited but helpless i could not participate in the least in what might ensue i knew the waters of thassa were plied by many ships and among them were the ships of pirates cos and ar i had heard were now at war the matters having to do with the piracy on the vosk not having been satisfactorily adjudicated but ar had no navy though it did have a fleet of river ships that patrolled the vosk the ship might of course be of port kar or of one of the northern ports or even of torvaldsland i could not free my ankles wrists and belly of their chains which kept me by their arrangement on my knees i was frightened if the ship fell to pirates i and the other girls i knew would fall helplessly to them too lovely spoils naked slave booty to the victors i hoped that they would want us if they did not we would be thrown overboard in such circumstances girls try to be wanted get those slaves below deck called an officer i and the other four girls who had been on deck at the same time were seized by the arms and dragged along the deck the hatch to the slave hold was opened to my horror i saw my sisters in bondage tumbled down the ladder no i cried then i too was thrown through the hatch striking the stairs rolling chained tumbling to the flooring of the hold i was much bruised no i heard cry then the girls from the deck cages too were taken to the hatch and rudely ordered to descend into the hold the smell screamed one of them and then she was thrust flying through the opening twenty girls from the deck were then with us looking up we saw the heavy hatch close the new girls screamed at the darkness we heard the hatch bolts flung into place and the two heavy locks snapped shut the leash the heavy door opened some men were there one of whom held a tiny lamp the room was long and wide and low with many square wooden pillars the walls and flooring were of stone i think it may have been beneath a warehouse near water i did not know i had been brought there bound and gagged in a closed sack in a lighter from the pirate ship i had been in the room some four days the men entered the room i did not know where the room was i wore the slave oval locked about my belly and was neck chained the slave oval is a hinged iron loop which locks about a girls waist two wrist rings on sliding loops are fitted on the oval it also has a welded ring on the back through which a slave bolt may be snapped fastening the girl to a wall or object or through which a chain might be passed my wrists were locked in the wrist rings i sat on straw my legs drawn up my neck wore an iron collar with its ring behind my neck through which a long chain passed the chain too being held to the wall by its own rings the chain with its collars was more than a hundred feet long some forty or fifty girls were chained on my side of the room and another forty or fifty on the other side of the room the room was dingy and smelled of musty straw the light of the tiny lamp the man carried seemed bright in the room what girls here asked one of the men who seemed imposing in helmet and cloak with four fellows of the man with the lamp a short fat fellow in the merchants white and gold are from the clouds of telnus none of course noble sir said the merchant it is well known said the tall man the leader of the others that you deal in blackmarket slaves not i cried the shorter man the merchant the taller man in the helmet looked down upon him menacingly perhaps the noble sirs would like gold suggested the fat man much gold the taller man extended his hand the fat man thrust gold into the others palm that is twice the normal fee he pointed out the tall man dropped the gold into his pouch what girls here he asked are from the clouds of telnus the fat man shook two he whispered show them to me he said the short fat man led the way toward myself and the auburnhaired girl who had been in a deck cage we were chained side by side she wore the normal kajira brand i wore the dina i felt uneasy and so too doubtless did she we could not kneel before the free males for we were in close neck collars held closely to the wall were you two from the clouds of telnus asked the tall man yes master we said the tall man crouched down beside us irritably one of the men with him wore the green of the physicians the tall man looked at us as naked female slaves we averted our eyes from his i smelled the straw wristring key said the tall man the merchant handed him the key that would unlock the wrist rings leave the lamp and withdraw said the tall man the short merchant handed him the lamp and frightened left the room the men crouched down and crowded about the auburnhaired girl i heard them unlock one of her wrist rings we are going to test you for pox he said the girl groaned it was my hope that none on board the clouds of telnus had carried the pox it is transmitted by the bites of lice the pox had appeared in bazi some four years ago the port had been closed for two years by the merchants it had burned itself out moving south and eastward in some eighteen months oddly enough some were immune to the pox and with others it had only a temporary debilitating effect with others it was swift lethal and horrifying those who had survived the pox would presumably live to procreate themselves on the whole presumably transmitting their immunity or relative immunity to their offspring slaves who contracted the pox were often summarily slain it was thought that the slaughter of slaves had had its role to play in the containment of the pox in the vicinity of bazi it is not she said the physician he sounded disappointed this startled me am i free of pox master asked the auburnhaired girl yes said the physician irritably his irritation made no sense to me the tall man then closed the auburnhaired girls wrist again in its wrist ring the men crouched down about me i shrank back against the wall my left wrist was removed from its wrist ring and the tall man pulled my arm out from my body turning the wrist so as to expose the inside of my arm i understood then they were not concerned with the pox which had vanished in the vicinity of bazi over two years ago the physician swabbed a transparent fluid on my arm suddenly startling me elating the men there emerged as though by magic a tiny printed sentence in fine characters in bright red it was on the inside of my elbow i knew what the sentence said for my mistress the lady elicia of ar had told me it was a simple sentence it said this is she it had been painted on my arm with a tiny brush with another transparent fluid i had seen the wetness on the inside of my arm on the area where the arm bends on the inside of the elbow and then it had dried disappearing i was not even sure the writing had remained but now under the action of the reagent the writing had emerged fine and clear then only a moment or so later the physician from another flask poured some liquid on a repcloth swab and again as though by magic erased the writing the invisible stain was then gone the original reagent was then again tried to check the erasure there was no reaction the chemical brand marking me for the agents with whom the lady elicia my mistress was associated was gone the physician then with the second fluid again cleaned my arm removing the residue of the second application of the reagent the men looked at one another and smiled my left wrist was again locked in its wrist ring am i free of the pox masters i asked yes said the physician the tall man removed a marking stick from his pouch and on the interior of the left shoulder on its softness of the auburnhaired girl wrote a word your name is narla he said that was the word i gathered which he wrote on her shoulder yes master she said then he turned to me and with the same marking stick wrote on the interior of my left shoulder you are the girl yata he said yes master i said i gathered it was this name which he had written on my body the stain of the marking stick would last until it was washed off the men then rose to their feet and left the room they met the merchant by the door there are penalties for this sort of thing the tall man warned the merchant please masters whined the merchant do you have more gold asked the tall man yes yes masters cried the merchant then the door closed and again we were left in the darkness i could still feel the press of the marking stick in my flesh i gathered that a name had been written there the name yata i was yata what is your name asked the man of the auburnhaired girl narla she said if it pleases master it is acceptable he said what is your name asked the man of me yata i said if it pleases master it is acceptable he said i had them from the fine slaver alexander of teletus said the merchant but their papers were lost in transit i will take them both said the man he did not much haggle over price soon narla and i sharing a common neck leash two collars with a strap with center grip stood outside the long low room in the corridor the leash dangled between us depending from our leather collars our hands were braceleted behind our backs is it a long voyage to telnus master i asked you little fool he said you are in telnus why have you bought us master i asked to work in my establishment as paga girls he said narla groaned i smiled and what is the name of your establishment master if a girl may ask it is the finest in all telnus he said yes master i asked it is called the chatka and curla he said thank you master i said the hood and cloak was then tossed over narla the hood was brought about and fastened under her chin effectively hooding her she would thus not know from what establishment she had been taken the lower portion of the cloak was then snapped under her chin below the leash the cloak which was brief had four circled oval cutouts it was a tantalizing garment there was writing on the cloak i had little doubt but what it advertised the chatka and curla i too was then hooded and cloaked i could see nothing within the hood i could feel the cloak brief on my thighs i could sense the air through the cutouts then i began to walk responding to the leash of the master i was in telnus the slave sack i moved carefully the tray over my head between the tables the chatka and curla is a large paga tavern it is built on four levels a large open court wooden floored an encircling dais some twenty feet deep and over the dais two encircling balconies each some ten feet deep we were crowded tonight the tavern is dimly lit by wagon lanterns paneled with red glass which hang on chains from the ceilings and balconies the crowd was boisterous i made my way toward the second balcony i brushed against other girls and customers coming and going on the wooden ramps i managed the tray with care it is not well to drop a tray many girls worked at the chatka and curla more than one hundred i climbed carefully the ramps have raised slatted ridges these are spaced some twenty inches apart for better footage i heard a girl scream in one of the alcoves the red cord or curla was knotted about my waist tightly the knot a slip knot which might be loosened with a single tug over my left hip over the curla in front slipping under the body and between the legs and passing over the curla in the back was the chatka or narrow strip of black leather some six inches in width some five feet or so in length it was drawn tight when a girl wears the curla and chatka the brand whether on left or right thigh is fully visible for the inspection of masters i also wore a brief open sleeveless vest of black leather the kalmak a patron parted it holding it open as i tried to move past him on the ramp i stood quietly stopped helplessly the tray held over my head he kissed me twice little beauty he said a girl would rejoice if she were permitted to please you in an alcove i said it was a line taught us and expected of us but i uttered it not without some genuine sincerity he had had me before several days ago when first i had been sent out upon the floor of the chatka and curla he well knew how to get much from the helpless beauty of a slave girl later he said slave yes master i whispered i continued on my way in addition to the curla the chatka and kalmak i was belled and collared in a black enameled ankle ring with five black enameled bells on tiny golden chains and a black enameled turian collar it too with five bells black and enameled on five tiny golden chains my hair had begun to grow out from having been shaved away for the voyage on the slave ship but it was still quite short i wore a broad koora which kerchieflike covered most of my head when i had come to the chatka and curla i and narla too had been dipped and scrubbed to clear us of ship lice and the residues of filth accumulated from the voyage and our consequent captivity the dip was of water saturated with chemicals toxic to ship lice we did not open our eyes or mouth when held under by the girls cleaning us they controlled us by a clamp placed on the right ear lobe later we were permitted to bathe ourselves few baths in my life had i appreciated more than that one paga cried a man i shall tell a girl master i said passing him on the first balcony making my way to the second which was the fourth level of the tavern on the ramp to the high balcony i passed naria returning from that level the man at table six on the first balcony wants paga i said slave fetch it yourself she said slave i am occupied i said slave too bad she said slave he has a whip i said slave her face went white some patrons bring whips or quirts to the tavern if they are not pleased the girls are informed a slave ring with thongs is fixed in the edge of every table we strive to wait the tables well i smiled to myself seeing narla hurry down the ramp to fetch his paga on the slave ship she in her deck cage had once insulted me demeaning my beauty and referring to me as a belowdeck girl it was not my fault that my hair had been shaved off nor that i was not blond or auburnhaired like herself those hair colors tend to bring higher girlprices i thought that i when my hair was again dark and glossy would surely be her equal or superior in beauty and i had little doubt that i could bring a master more pleasure i knelt before the table on the second balcony placing the tray on the floor and quickly deferentially placing its contents on the table the assorted meats and cheese the sauces and fruits and wines and nuts do masters desire more from yata their slave i asked leave slave girl said the womans voice that of a free woman kneeling in her robes and veil at the table with her escorts who sat behind it crosslegged free women came sometimes escorted to the chatka and curla her voice had not been pleasant yes mistress i whispered picking up the tray and head down withdrawing the men i thought had she not been with them might indeed have wanted more from yata their slave often to the irritation of other patrons they had kept me at their table binding my wrists at the slave ring keeping me for later i went to the balcony railing and looked down i was some twentyfive feet or more above the wooden flooring dancers in the chatka and curla and there are several move between and among the tables sometimes a dancer if she is indeed superb is displayed solo in the center of the scarlet wooden flooring within the painted yellow ring of the slave circle men came and went i stood there on the high balcony with the tray beneath my arm i had not been contacted i did not know why this was for all i knew i was merely another lowly paga girl i served as the others did fully no differently i looked about at the decor of the tavern it suggested the plains of turia or the lands of the wagon peoples there were scenes of hunting of caravan raiding of girl taming scenes were fixed there of the great bosk herds and the strings of the wagons of the fierce plains nomads in one place there was fixed a painting of the walls and towers of turia and riders of the wagon peoples on hills looking toward the city the dress and costume of the paga girls too was intended to suggest the common garb worn by the enslaved beauties who well served the mounted lancebearing riders of the lofty silken kailla in such a garb a girl was given no place to conceal a weapon and was well displayed in her captive curves to the eye of her master below on the first level two men began to shout and fight squabbling over first master rights to their waitress lyrazina an exquisite little collared blond from teletus she crouched shrinking back terrified almost at their feet strabo the floor master at a sign from aurelion the proprietor and master of the chatka and curla hurried to the combative couple thrusting them apart they seized at him and i heard clothing tear another man from the tavern a fellow who did odd jobs about as bran loort did in ar at the belled collar leaped to the fray two more customers joined in fight cried patrons a girl screamed sometimes i had thought in the midst of such a diversion one might flee the tavern but this was not possible whereas most taverns are open and a girl might simply slip out the door and run there is little prospect of her flights being successful she wears only a collar and a brand and a bit of silk and she flees into a society that will promptly return her to her owner unless it chooses to keep her for itself escape is not on the whole a realistic possibility for slave girls on gor indeed girls are often sent unattended in a brief repcloth tunic on errands for their masters they return to their masters for there is nowhere else to go also a girl who is well mastered will often undergo great privations and hardships to return to the brute whom she cannot help loving with every slave inch of her slave girls are often hopelessly in love with their masters but the chatka and curla did not resemble most paga taverns in their openness it was not possible there for a girl to even step outside for a breath of air as it is in most taverns there are double iron gates and only the free may come and go as they please another deterrent to the escape of slave girls of course is the severity of the penalties connected with escape attempts whereas the first penalty is commonly only a severe beating the second one often involves hamstringing or the cutting of the tendons behind the knees this cripples the girl and makes her generally useless save as a pathetic example to her sisters in bondage of the foolishness of attempted escape the most interesting attempted escape which i know of however took place in a locked tavern not unlike the chatka and curla in it a clever slave girl taking advantage of just such a diversion as now rocked the chatka and curla neckthonged a free woman from behind and dragged her helpless to an alcove there intimidating and overpowering her she stripped the free woman and bound and gagged her then in the confusion and noise of the brawl she pretending distaste at the activity of the ruffians involved went to the gate was released and made away she was free only a few hours however for as an unescorted free woman guardsmen swiftly went to her protection prepared to help her safely home in a few moments they questioning her it became clear to them that something was amiss a free woman was found who thrust back her robe and veils her ears had been pierced the free woman then as the guardsmen looked away tore down her robes to the shoulder revealing the collar which bore of course the name of her master she was swiftly returned to him for a severe beating the most interesting portion of this tale deals with the free woman who had been left stripped bound and gagged in the alcove in leaving the tavern the disguised slave girl to cover her retreat placed a discipline sign on the alcove occupied by the helpless free woman it read take me masters sometimes a girl as a punishment is placed helplessly in an alcove free for the use of all several of the men patrons of the tavern willing to oblige the taverns proprietor entered the alcove and untying her ankles well used the helpless free woman they in the darkness not knowing the loftiness of her condition this caused a great scandal in ar the slave who had so abused her was to be tortured and publicly impaled but to the amazement of the citizens of the city the free woman herself spoke on the slaves behalf and begged that she be only put lengthily under the leather it was done in this manner to satisfy the desires of the free woman to the astonishment of all in the court when the chained slave girl crept on her knees head down to render gratitude to the free woman the free woman had knelt beside her and kissed her and then turned away thereafter the free woman had seemed strange and restless she began to take to walking upon the high bridges once when a tarnsman snapped by pursued by guardsmen mounted too on tarns she had torn the veils from her face and boldly supplicatingly had lifted her robes revealing her left thigh to the hip the tarnsman circling about took mercy upon her and it is said she cried out with joy as his braided leather rope dropped about her and tightened on her body jerking her its prisoner from the high bridge the tarnsman with his captive escaped he had returned to ar later when his city was at peace with ar with him was a beautiful slave girl who had once been the free woman of ar much was she abused and spat upon by the free women of ar in their fury but she did not seem unhappy she had made her choice rendering love and service to a master had not seemed obviously inferior to her to the reduced sexuality and the squabbling competitiveness which had been expected of her as a free woman freedom and love are both estimable values some women choose freedom others choose love let each make what choice seems best to her i felt a knotted double strand of leather looped about my left wrist and pulled tight master i said it was the fellow who had earlier opened the kalmak and kissed me i was not displeased to see him nor to be on his thong come to the alcove he said i placed the tray i carried on a rack the fight continued below i was pulled by the leather thong on my left wrist toward an alcove in the wall of the level of the high balcony there was shouting below several had now joined the fight i heard the musicians begin to play on aurelions orders to attempt to pacify the crowd to distract it a dancer i supposed had been sent to the center of the floor usually such fights are stopped by the separation of the combatants and the awarding to each of a girl for the night i supposed lyrazina would be given to one and an even more exquisite beauty to the other thus contenting both but if this strategy was to be successful it did not seem to be yet successful i heard glass break below this one said the man indicating an alcove he released the thong on my wrist and stood behind me i climbed the five steps into the alcove and crawled within it occurred to me that none had noted him conducting me to the alcove all eyes had been on the fight below i crawled to the back of the alcove and there turned to face him he whom i must now as he chose please he turned his back to me and with the belts and buckles closed the leather curtains on the alcove that we might be closed within and be undisturbed from the outside he gestured that i should remove my garments and i did so even to reading his eyes the red koora on my head he then gestured that i should crawl to him and kneel back on my heels facing away from him i did so i felt my wrists with binding fiber tied behind my back master i asked do not face me he said yes master i said i sensed him remove with a rustle of leather an object from his tunic suddenly i felt the wadding of the gag of a slave hood thrust in my mouth and with its straps secured it was done swiftly i could utter no sound i was gagged then the hood itself was pulled up and jerked down over my head and buckled under my chin he threw me forward and i fell on the furs on my right shoulder he tied together my ankles i sensed him move aside some furs then i felt my body doubled up and my feet slipped inside the mouth of a slave sack the sack was drawn up over my body i sat doubled up my head was pushed down a bit the sack was drawn shut over my head and with a snap locked shut then to my wonder i heard him open a door it must have been behind the hanging at the rear of the alcove i felt the sack being lifted through the opening and then it was dragged along a woodenfloored passage then he threw it lightly to his shoulder and began to descend short flights of stairs i squirmed in the sack but was helpless he was very strong i bead a necklace and am then used for wench sport i was kneeling i felt hands untying the binding fiber on my ankles and at my wrists the slave hood was unbuckled and pulled up over and off my head i could see its leather lay against my breasts held by its attachments to the gag the gag straps were loosened a hand extracted the heavy wadding letting it fall open to dry i almost vomited freed of the gag then i put my head back and breathed deeply the hood and gag were then pulled away one of the men put them with the binding fiber in his belt two other men crouched beside me two others stood nearby the man on my left in his two hands took my left wrist the man on my right with his two hands took my right wrist they stood throwing me upright to my feet between them i was unclothed save for the black enameled belied collar and the black enameled belled ankle ring as i had been in the alcove of the chatka and curla my face was red from the slave hood my body was broken out from the moisture and heat of the slave sack i stood between the two men their hands on my wrists i was in a torchlit anteroom of large size a long rug some forty yards in length narrow red led toward a large pair of white doors which opened from the center two guards helmeted with spears stood at that door there were shields and crossed spears on either side of the door i shrank back looking at the tall doors i felt pressure on my wrists come animal said one of the men yes master i whispered by the wrists i was led toward the great door i was very frightened for i knew these must be the men associated with the mistress lady elicia of ar they thought that i bore a message for them but i did not they would be disappointed they would be angry gorean males are not patient with displeasing slave girls i did not wish to be disfigured or tortured or slain i was innocent i would plead my innocence perhaps then i would be only whipped the doors were swung open by the helmeted guards i was flung to my knees kiss the floor slave said one of the men i did so my arms held high straight behind me thrusting me down then again rudely i was thrown to my feet and led into the room it was a lofty beautiful room as though in a palace it was floored with purple glossy tiles broad and shining there were slender lofty white pillars golden hangings i was led toward a dais on which a large corpulent man sat one of enormous weight reclining on cushions he wore white robes stained with wine swollen with fat bordered in laced gold his face was heavy coarse pitted where whiskers one by one had been pulled from it by tweezers he was balding and wore upon his head a crown of grape leaves from the famed ta grapes of the terraces of cos i sensed in him intelligence vanity wealth cruelty and power i saw that at the foot of the dais before me before where i now knelt released by the men who had held me there was a low table and on this table there were strands of thread and in small cups beads wooden slave beads beads of various colors of many colors i looked down at the low wooden table the beads in the tiny cups i trembled it seemed i had knelt here before or somewhere like this in a dream which had once tormented me in tabuks ford i wondered if i had ever knelt in such a place as this before or if it were merely the figment of a slave girls dream the dream had seemed real i wondered if it were in some odd sense a recollection or anticipation i dismissed such nonsense from my mind but the similarity of this setting to that of the dream was uncanny and frightening a slave whip by one of the nearby men was lifted before me i then was truly frightened for this too had been in the dream what is this i knew a voice would ask what is this asked the man a slave whip master i said knowing that i would and what are you inquired the voice a slave master i said i wanted to scream out to them that i knew nothing of their messages or whatever it was they might seek i wanted to scream out to them that i was only a miserable slave and knew nothing i wanted only a bit of mercy from them do you obey asked the voice yes master i said i trembled these things had been said too in the dream i did not think the dream was prophetic rather i understood now that in someway the dream had recalled to me or touched upon a ritual in which i had been rehearsed i pulled back my head fearing the press of the slave whip to my lips this puzzled the man i sensed but then as was his part he thrust the whip against my lips he did it angrily he had not been pleased to have been anticipated the heavy leather of the whip folded back about its handle bruised my lips i tasted a drop of blood i could feel the whip hard against my teeth lying across them diagonally kiss the whip slave said the man i kissed the whip there was a silence who commands me i asked i had sudden respect for whoever had devised the ritual we were enacting my last question was not the sort of question a slave girl in such a situation would ask it was too bold the master if he wishes will inform the girl as to who it is who commands her if he does not wish to inform her he does not the girls needs to know only that she is a slave and that it is hers to obey yet the question was not utterly incontextual a bystander might simply infer that the girl was new to her collar and did not understand that such a question might bring the whip down upon her another subtlety was that the expression master had not been included in the question the gross corpulent man looked at one of his lieutenants a helmeted fellow who stood nearby they exchanged glances i had by this response identified myself for them the identification would be confirmed by the next responses the corpulent man looked at me and shifted his weight rotund immense and slack on the cushions you are commanded by belisarius slave girl he said i did not know if belisarius was his true name or a code name for the contact i knew now however incontrovertibly that this was the contact this was the specific individual to whom i was expected to communicate the intelligence which i supposedly conveyed i wanted to cry out that i knew nothing the small eyes deep in the fat of the heavy face regarded me what is the command of belisarius the slave girls master i asked i could scarcely hear myself speak it is simple said the voice yes master i said bead a necklace slave girl he said yes master i said a strange state of consciousness seemed suddenly to come over me i was aware of what i was doing and yet it seemed as though i behaved in terms of some prearranged pattern it was again almost as though i were in a dream i reached toward the strands of thread on the table and toward the cups of tiny beads i do not know why i first chose a yellow bead but i did and then i chose a blue bead and a red and then another yellow i began to bead a necklace i knotted the end of the thread on the necklace i lifted it to belisarius one of his men took it carefully and handed it to him he placed it on the dais before him i shook my head strangely as soon as the necklace had been taken from me my natural state of consciousness returned the behavior whatever might have been its import had been discharged it was as though i awakened from a dream i saw belisarius looking carefully at the beads before him i had strung the same order of beads more than once to complete the necklace too the necklace was long and loose like most slave necklaces it would loop at least twice about a girls throat it seemed to be indistinguishable from thousands of necklaces which i had seen on the throats of slave girls it did not take belisarius long to regard the necklace suddenly he pounded his heavy fist on the dais with pleasure at last he said at last the men about him did not ask what significance he had found in the necklace nor did belisarius explain to them what he had seen in the arrangement of the beads i felt a knife at my throat shall we kill her asked a man behind me no said belisarius the message has now been delivered what if she falls into the wrong hands asked a man it would not matter said belisarius he looked at me bead the same necklace slave girl he said i trembled suddenly i knew i could not i could not remember the order of the beads i cannot master i said please do not kill me even if she could rebead the necklace said belisarius its message could not be understood and even if it could be understood it would be meaningless to others he laughed and even if its meaning could be understood it would be too late for the enemy to act they could then understand only the danger in which they would then stand the knife was drawn away from my throat i almost fainted on the tiles belisarius regarded me besides said he the lady elicia wants the pretty little thing for a serving slave the lady elicia said one of the men would i wager look well naked and in a collar the men laughed perhaps later said belisarius when she has served her purposes the men laughed i felt my hands being tied behind my back the wadding of the gag of the slave hood was rolled and thrust deep in my mouth the gag straps were drawn back deeply between my teeth i winced then behind the back of my neck they were cinched tightly i looked at belisarius bound and gagged before him use her for wench sport he said and then return her to the chatka and curla the slave hood was pulled up and opened and then pulled down and over my head it was folded and tucked under the chin taking up its slack and the leather belt looped twice about my neck was drawn through its loops tightened and buckled shut by one ankle i was pulled across the tiles to the side of the room a slave girls revenge i walked in the morning an ahn before noon on the wharves of telnus i could see the great gates of the harbor some two pasangs across the water the harbor was filled with many craft i avoided the tar on the planks of the wharf beneath the planking of the wharves here and there i could see water and small boats tied at pilings men came and went going to and from ships and disembarking and embarking cargo i passed the throne of the wharf praetor he in his robes with the two scribes for the settling of disputes which might occur on the quays four guardsmen too were there they grinned at me as i walked past and i smiled back at them they were handsome guardsmen and i was a slave girl but i must not annoy them soliciting their patronage for the tavern for they were on duty i had been struck five times across the back of the legs my wrists held when i had made this mistake before the praetor was a sour fellow after i had delivered the message to belisarius and had served to amuse his men i had been returned to the chatka and curla still hooded and bound in the slave sack as i had been brought from it by the same men through the secret door in the rear of the alcove i had been removed from the sack in the alcove unbound unhooded and ungagged the man who had taken me from the alcove and returned me to it then swiftly used me for his pleasure and left through the customary leathercurtained door i was left behind in the alcove naked and had i put on the garments of the tavern i looked behind the hanging at the rear of the alcove there was a stout door there made of iron i put my finger tips on it timidly softly i tried the handle it was now locked it had been locked apparently behind the man who had brought me back into the alcove there was no key or lock mechanism on my side of the door it may have been of course that the door had been left unlocked originally and that it had locked automatically when closed behind the man when he had reentered the alcove returning me to it i did not know i did know that it was now locked and that i could not open it i let the hanging fall back concealing the door even had i been able to open it i would not have dared to go through it suppose i had been found in an area where i was not supposed to be i did not know what would be done to me on the whole surface of the planet there was nowhere to run nowhere to go i was a slave girl i left the alcove to return to my duties on the floor those of a paga slave the man who had taken me from the alcove and returned me to it had not incidentally as nearly as i could tell conducted me to and from the house of belisarius i had been carried and transported for a time in a small boat and for a time in a cart hooded and captive in the slave sack i had no sense of direction and very little of time i gathered from what i had heard that contacts had been made by men wearing masks who spoke signs and countersigns i doubted that my original captor himself knew the identity of these other men paga had cried a man and i had fled to serve him after i had delivered the message i was no longer under the same security which i had earlier experienced at the chatka and curla sometimes now like certain other girls i was permitted to wander forth before the busy hours of the tavern to solicit patronage for its proprietor my master aurelion of cos i wore the belled collar and belled ankle ring of the tavern and a bit of black silk on the silk in yellow there were words which narla had translated for me i am yata own me at the chatka and curla i was barefoot i wore a red kerchief for my hair had not as yet fully regrown i saw a sailor and ran to him kneeling at his leg touching it does master desire paga i asked begone slave he said i drew back and he strode away with the rolling gait of his profession i looked about at the boxes and bales on the wharves i did not bother the men who were busily engaged their foremen did not wish them distracted by the presence and banter of a slave girl more than once they had taken their belt to me driving me from the vicinity of the men i perched on top of a large box on the wharves holding my legs closely together i enjoyed the smell of the salt water the sight of the soaring harbor gulls i wore a collar and was clad for the pleasure of men but i was not unhappy when i had first been sent to the wharves some weeks ago my wrists had been braceleted behind me and i had been accompanied by other girls later i had been permitted to go alone my wrists still locked behind my back later i had been permitted to go alone to the wharves in wrist rings and chain my hands before my body separated by some twenty inches of light gleaming chain there are many things clever subtle exciting things a girl may do with such a chain some of these were shown to me and others i invented sharing them with other girls at the tavern girls struggle to become ever more perfect and beautiful in their slavery girls often share slave secrets i struggled hard to learn all that i could to become more pleasing to masters something in me was not displeased to belong to men at one time such a thought would have horrified me and i would have thrust it wildly from my consciousness not daring to regard it now i entertained it with a shameless pride i had become a slave girl one thing that was shown to me was the slave bridle the male takes the light chain back between the teeth of the girl and holds it together behind her neck thus too pinning her hands there helplessly he then controls her by means of the bridle my own invention was the chain kiss one clasps the leg with the chain against the interior of the thigh and then from the side of the knee one begins to kiss the leg ones lips and teeth hot about the chain the male feels both the chain and her mouth biting and kissing climbing the chain she climbs the chain and descends it and climbs it again until he orders her to leave it i heard the sounds of chains and a whip below me i saw a line of prisoners men of ar who had been captured on the vosk river in the river fightings cos and ar i knew were at war contesting commerce rights on the western vosk there were some twenty of them they wore rags their wrists were manacled behind them they were in neck coffle the chain was heavy hurry sleen called their whip master there were four guards with them one man fell and the whip master was upon him in an instant he struggled again to his feet and continued on in the coffle trudging along the hot wharf they would be taken to a holding area i knew and there branded slave they would then row on the merchant galleys of cos warships commonly have free oarsmen merchant ships commonly but not always use slaves seeing the men sweaty chained under the whip i was affrighted it was a grim fate which awaited them the confinement and pain of the benches the weight of the long oars the shackles the whip the drum of the hortator the stench the black bread and onions of the ponderous galleys then i thought that such a fate was too good for them for they were of ar i remembered clitus vitellius who had sported with me and then discarded me i remembered i hated clitus vitellius how i hated him but i felt sorry then for the men of ar they were not clitus vitellius better it were clitus vitellius in their place but he was a noble captain of ar and would not be involved in the insignificant skirmishes on the vosk the prisoners the men of ar disappeared down the wharf i dropped down from the box on which i had sat aurelion of cos would not be pleased if i did not bring customers to the chatka and curla i was not chained now the last four times i had been permitted to come to the wharves unchained aurelion i think was pleased with me once he had ever permitted me to serve his pleasure how proud i had been and how envious the other girls had been i struggled to be fantastic to him i think he was not displeased afterwards he had before leaving thrown a candy to the floor before me which i gratefully in the manner of the chatka and curla which was necessary had picked up in my mouth thank you master i had said the candy was hard and very sweet i showed it off to the other girls i pleased the master i boasted he once gave me five candies said narla liar i cried i knew the master had never even called for her we leaped toward one another tima the first girl had separated us with a whip i looked about the wharves a long ship i could see was moving into its wharfage its lateen sail furled on the long sloping yard it was a warship of cos i saw other girls from other taverns running down to its mooring quickly i joined them i knelt with them in a line of some seven or eight girls we called forth the praises of our respective establishments but when the men had disembarked carrying their sea bags and weapons none had stopped to stand before me i rose to my feet looking about some officers with a few members of the crew remained on the ship i turned away a sailor passed me he carried a long bag on his shoulder tied shut i saw the bag move it carried i conjectured a bound woman from the lineaments of the bag over his shoulder i gathered she was naked i wondered if she were slave or free he boarded one of the numerous ships at the many wharves going below decks two men passed me pushing a cart of furs of sea sleen i could smell spices in a bale near me a man walked by carrying a long pole from which dangled dozens of the eels of cos it was now past noon and i had not yet conducted a patron to the chatka and curla soon it would be time for me to report back though i now wore no chains on the wharves i was still of course in a sense chained in my bondage i was clad as a slave girl and wore a belled collar which identified my master and a belled ankle ring too i was branded masters take little risk with their girls when they send them to the wharves they are as slave on the wharves as behind the barred gates if i did not report back promptly when due i would be beaten i was full slave it was now past noon i was growing apprehensive i had not yet found a guest for the tables of aurelion girls are not sent to the wharves for the delights of smelling the fresh sea air they are sent forth half naked in their collars to bring back paying customers i parted my silk a bit and ran to kneel before a sailor i looked up at him own me at the chatka and curla master i said he spurned me from him with his foot forcing me back to the hot planks of the wharf i ran to kneel before another i am yata i said please own me at the chatka and curla master i begged he with the back of his hand struck me from his path hurling me by the force of the blow to my shoulder on the boards i tasted blood in my mouth i knelt on the hot calked boards angrily he had gone it had not been necessary to strike me i rose to my feet and again looked about the large yellow shield on the high pole in the harbor had already been hoisted and fallen and near it the fire of white smoke had been lit when the shield reaches the top of the pole in the harbor and is permitted to fall it is the tenth hour the gorean noon at the same time the whitesmoke fire is lit at the twentieth hour the gorean midnight a beacon is lit these things serve to synchronize chronometers in the port and serve to regulate schedules and the utilization of the tide tables i was beginning to feel desperate toward me a couple was moving a bearded sailor and a redhaired paga girl i saw by her silk she was from the cords of tharna an establishment competitive with the chatka and curla i knelt boldly in their path and looked up at the sailor yata can please you more i said he is mine said the redhaired girl holding the sailors arm i am his should he be pleased to have me i said i smiled at the sailor please master i said he looked from one of us to the other i saw we both pleased him he grinned fight he said with a scream of rage the redhaired girl leaped upon me clawing and biting throwing me back to the boards she was larger and stronger than i she could not well get her hands in my hair for as yet it was too short i tore at her hair rolling with her on the boards and got my fingers in it but she with the heels of her two hands struck back my head i felt her scratch for my eyes i screamed as her teeth bit me in the arm i was then terrified and tried to defend myself as she struck me she crouched beside me striking down at me with her fists i rolled over covering my head she leaped up i turned she kicked at me i felt her foot strike me in the stomach i could not breathe i gasped wildly for air she threw herself over me and held my head down locking her right arm about it she held her legs about my body preventing me from using my arms with her left hand she shoved up as she could the collar at my throat to my horror i felt her teeth pushing aside the bells trying to seize my throat then her teeth were on my throat then her head was pulled back and away suddenly from me the sailor had her by the hair kneeling twisted back she fought to look at me held la kajira mistress i wept i am a slave girl mistress she had clearly won i was her inferior i shrank back fighting for air he is mine she hissed i put my head down in defeat then she cried out in pain as she was flung by the hair to his feet you are mine he said i am yours she whispered terrified then he took her by the hair and dragged her to her feet and left she bent over held by the hair running stumbling beside him to me she had been formidable but to him she was only a wench for his pleasure i rose to my feet shaken i rearranged my silk it had not been torn i looked after the sailor and the redhaired girl stumbling beside him held by the hair i saw he would use her well very well this pleased me a male slave his wrists chained separated by some eighteen inches of linked metal pushing a wharf cart passed me he looked upon me i was furious i ran to him in rage and slapped him do not look upon me i cried in rage i am not for the likes of you you are a slave a slave he pulled back his head angrily slave i screamed slave i spun about i saw one who must be his master a merchant i was red with fury i ran to the merchant and knelt before him i pointed to the male slave he looked upon me i cried he looked upon me have you permission to speak he asked may a girl speak i asked frightened yes he said emboldened then i pointed again to the male slave he dared to look upon me i said i knew that male slaves were carefully supervised i knew it could be quite unpleasant for one of them to be caught looking upon a slave girl to be caught looking upon a free woman could mean death for them he looked upon me i said pointing to the male slave surely he would be at the least whipped for his indiscretion the beauty of slave girls was for free men not for the slave likes of such as he you are too good for him asked the merchant yes i said i then realized this was not the proper thing to say but i had said it you are both animals he said yes master i said but you are a female he said yes master i said and he he said though slave is yet male yes master i whispered and is not the male animal the master of the female animal he asked yes master i said i knew that male dominance was pervasive among mammals and that it was universal among primates it can be frustrated only by an extensive and complex conditioning program one adequate over a period of years to distort the order of nature do you find this slave of interest asked the master of the male slave he shrugged she is small he said i looked at him frightened but she is not without interest he conceded do you think you can catch her asked the master of course said the male slave i rose to my feet frightened i began to back away she is yours said the master i turned to run he caught me before a large box and flung me face forward against it when i recoiled back from the hot wood the chain on his wrists had looped about me and i was his held to him by the chain about his wrists it is long since i have had a wench he said he dragged me along beside him the chain looped about my body cutting into my waist over the left hip be merciful to a slave master i begged behind some boxes on the boards of the wharf he threw me down under him please be kind to a slave master i begged he laughed the master did not hurry him but i think attended to other matters the wharf cart had been empty when the slave left me i had yielded to him as though he might have been a free man i was much shamed i lay behind the boxes and looked up at the blue sky i was miserable i had been used by a slave but too i was frightened it was surely past the time when i should have returned to the chatka and curla i did not want to be whipped slowly painfully my legs stiff i climbed to my feet i rearranged the bit of silk i wore i stepped out from behind the boxes i must hurry back to the chatka and curla i stopped startled then i shrank back beside the large boxes he was far off but i was certain i began to breathe rapidly my heart began to pound it could not be but it was i did not know what to do at first i felt unrestrainable overwhelming me an incredible flood of love and elation i felt the incredible love and joy the elation possible only to a slave girl he was approaching from down the wharf carrying a sea bag in the guise of a sailor i wanted to run toward him crying out the length of the wharf and throw myself to his feet weeping covering them with kisses then i was frightened that i had made a mistake it could not be true but i watched i grew more and more sure and then i was certain he stopped to buy a cake from a vendor on the wharf it was he it was my master clitus vitellius of ar oh master i wanted to cry out i love you i love you master then i saw him glance at a paga girl who posed turning before him and spoke to him suddenly i hated her and him he dismissed the girl but i had seen him look upon her as a warrior a master i hated them both it had been clitus vitellius of ar who had first enslaved me he had marked me with the hot iron marking my very flesh branding me a slave girl he had made me serve him he had made me love him and had then when it pleased him his sport done thrown me aside giving me to peasants a bold plan relentless and terrible formed in my mind i breathed deeply in cold fury resolved he would find that a slave girls vengeance is not a light thing i straightened myself i parted the silk lasciviously i lifted my head with the small sounds of the bells on the collar he was coming toward me now eating on the bit of cake he had purchased i saw he carried no weapons this pleased me i ran toward him with short steps and knelt before him i kissed his feet at his feet i felt suddenly a wave of love for him the helpless weakness of a slave girl overcome at her masters feet but then i caught myself and every bit of me became cold and calculating and sensuous i held the calves of his legs in my hands and looked up at him dina he said my master calls me yata i said master then you are yata he smiled yes i am yata i said i looked up at him smiling are you as innocent and as clumsy as before he asked no master i said putting my head down beginning to kiss him on the side of the leg deeply puffing sucking at the hair a tiny bit i see not he said laughing i looked up i have been taught how to please men i said of course he said you are a slave girl yes master i said are you good he asked some masters have not been fully displeased i said do you think you could please me he asked my heart leaped i applied myself as subtly and marvelously as i could touching his leg variously bringing my mouth slowly biting and loving to the side of his knee no master i whispered yata could never please a great warrior like you he looked about say only sailor he said here i am not a captain of ar he clitus vitellius but only a seafarer a simple oarsman from tyros one called tij rejar i looked up at him as master wishes i said then i again applied myself to his legs master will not cuff me from him will he i begged clever slut he said he lifted my head and brushed back the kerchief on my head i reddened i was some weeks ago slave cargo i said my head down and pretty slave cargo indeed he said i am pleased if master is pleased i said i held his legs my cheek against his thigh i wanted to cry out that i loved him but then i checked myself remembering my project i knelt at his feet only to bring him low i did not think it would be difficult if i could get him to the chatka and curla he would pay he would pay i looked up at him smiling i was once yours i said master he looked down at me almost tenderly perhaps it was a mistake to have given you away he smiled i caught my breath but remained firm i must not relent i would be remorseless how vulnerable in a way i was in silk and collar at his feet but i held great power it is strange i said once you owned me now in faraway cos on the wharves i kneel at your feet in the collar of a paga slave it is a pretty collar he said thank you master i said i see by your silk he said that you work in the chatka and curla yes master i said what is your duty there he asked to please the customers of my master i said it is long since i have held your hot little body he said i blushed though i was a slave girl you are a hot lovely slave you know he said in your arms i said any girl even the daughter of a ubar would find herself only a responding slave i did not doubt but what this was true i remembered myself miserable in his arms writhing with unwanted ecstasy then unable to help myself unable to hold out longer suddenly surrendering to my enslavement in his arms though i had been of earth he had reduced me to a spasmodic yielding slave i am thirsty for paga he said i know a place i said the chatka and curla he asked yes master i said but are there girls there he asked yes master i said are you one of them he asked yes master i said it is long since i have owned you he said i looked up at him boldly own me again at the chatka and curla i whispered you are a curvacious tempting little slut said he yata does yata dare to suspect i asked that master once cared for her a little does a slave girl wish to be whipped he asked no master i said head down i have other matters to attend to he said i looked up frightened please master i begged come with yata to the chatka and curla i am busy he said but master thirsts for paga i said he grinned and yata i wheeled was detained upon the wharves i remembered the slave who had been set upon me by his master to discipline me i had been well ravished and at length he had forced me to respond to him as a slaves slave it was now well past the time when i should be at the tavern bathing and preparing for the labors of the evening she is late i said if she does not return with a customer after all this time her master may not be pleased it is nothing to me said he if a girl is tied at the slave ring and put under the leather of course not master i said but then i looked up at him but yata i said softly begging him supplicating him desires to serve master paga i knelt before him on the boards of the wharf eyes lifted holding him have me with the cup master i begged please master he looked down upon me have pity on a slave master i begged have me with the cup master please master he smiled conduct me to your tavern slave girl he said thank you master i breathed i put down my head so that he might not see the smile of victory of triumph that suffused my features submissively with the sound of bells those on my collar and ankle ring i rose lightly to my feet turned and excited scarcely daring to breathe barefoot as a slave girl led the way toward the chatka and curla i heard him following me the double gate of barred iron shut behind me i turned suddenly screaming pointing to he who had followed me within he is of ar i cried he is an enemy seize him clitus vitellius looked at me startled seize him i cried his hand had gone to his left hip but the short sword in its scabbard did not now hang there strabo assistant to aurelion of cos leaped upon him and was struck back clitus vitellius looked about himself wildly seize him i cried two of the men who worked within the tavern hurried toward the gate men leaped up from tables clitus vitellius turned to the double gate and tore at the bars but could not fling them hack for the bolts had slipped into place a man leaped on him and he shook him off he bent to strabo to rip the keys from his belt there were many keys he cut with the keys holding their ring at the face of the second man of the tavern who fell screaming bloodied reeling back he slashed about him with the keys long and heavy on their thick ring some six inches in width a man leaped at him low seizing his legs two others leaped bodily upon him they struggled then two others sped to him and then there was a sword at his chest where the tunic of the sailor had been torn away four men held him back against the bars of the gate aurelion of cos rushed forward what is going on here he demanded i pointed to the powerful bloodied captive he is clitus vitellius of ar i cried he is a captain of ar a spy cried a man kill the spy cried another he says he is tij rejar an oarsman of tyros but he is of ar of the warriors he is clitus vitellius he is of ar he is a captain aurelion looked at me it would not be well for you slave said he to be mistaken in this matter i am not mistaken master i said who are you asked aurelion suddenly i was frightened if his identity were sufficiently well established so as to truly appear an oarsman from tyros it might not go well for me i might be boiled alive in the oil of tharlarion i began to sweat i scorn to conceal my identity from those of cos he said i am clitus vitellius a captain of ar i laughed with pleasure see i cried bring chains said aurelion clitus vitellius looked at me i shrank back chains were placed upon him he is securely manacled said strabo whose face was swollen as a consequence of the blow of clitus vitellius ankle chains were then placed too upon the warrior of glorious ar and a chain ran too from his wrists to the chain on his ankles a collar with two guide chains one on each side was fastened on his neck kill the spy said a man no said aurelion we will take him to the magistrates the double gate was unlocked by strabo who had recovered his keys four men made ready to conduct clitus vitellius from the tavern it is the heavy galleys for spies said one man better to kill him now said a man no said aurelion conduct him to the magistrates they will have much sport with him before he is chained to a bench the heavy galleys were round ships large ships which usually carried bulk goods such as lumber and stone it was usually impractical to employ free oarsmen on such ships clitus vitellius looked once more upon me i saw that he was securely chained i approached him ho clitus vitellius i said it seems you now wear chains like a slave he did not speak tome you will soon be slave in the heavy galleys i said i posed before him as a slave girl opening my silk men laughed look well master i said for there are few girls in the rowing holds i turned before him and again faced him do not forget yata master i said remember it was she who put you in chains who puts you upon the bench of the galleys he regarded me not speaking i went to him and suddenly with all my might slapped him he scarcely moved the vengeance of a girl i said is not a light thing neither said he looking at me is the vengeance of a warrior i shrank back frightened take him away said aurelion clitus vitellius was conducted from the tavern you did well slave girl said aurelion thank you master i said then suddenly i knelt before him i had rendered great service to the state of cos free me master i begged bring a whip said aurelion to strabo no please master i cried put her at the slave ring said aurelion and give her ten lashes and then throw her a pastry she has done well i shall aurelion said strabo in moments i knelt at the slave ring my small wrists crossed and bound to it the silk pulled away from me down about my calves i was struck ten times and then released a pastry was thrown to the floor before me you did well slave girl said strabo thank you master i whispered i reached for the pastry the whip stayed my hand forgive me master i said i took the pastry in my mouth chain her in the kennels said aurelion on my hands and knees as a punished slave girl holding the pastry in my mouth i crawled from the floor to the kennels followed by strabo there at the concrete wall on my blankets i lay down the chain and collar was fastened on my neck strabo left i took the pastry in my hands and began to eat it what a fool i had been to beg my freedom i had only to look in a mirror to see that i would never be free on gor i lay in the darkness of the long kennel on my blankets in my place chained by the neck i was a gorean slave girl then i cried out with anguish weeping and hurled the pastry from me i pounded at the concrete beneath the blankets i wept i had betrayed clitus vitellius my master strabo accompanied by narla approached me he poked me with a whip be quiet he said she carried a lamp she was eating the pastry which i had discarded strabo unlocked the collar on my neck there is a sailor here said he who is drunk from the cords of tharna who is calling for you yes master i said i recalled the fellow who had had the redhaired girl who had bested me in combat on the wharf i had said to him that i could please him more than she he had now apparently come to the chatka and curla calling for me please do not make me serve i begged narla said he will help you ready yourself be quick do you want some pastry asked narla holding a piece out to me no i said i looked up at strabo i betrayed clitus vitellius of ar i wept you did well he said now hurry please master i begged he struck down with the lash and i cried out in pain i hurry i wept i hurry i fled from the kennel followed by narla to the room of preparation i could hear the fellow on the floor calling for me a convoy departs from the harbor of telnus i appear on the cargo manifest of one of its ships i scarcely noticed as my wrists were braceleted behind my back i wore a brief yellow slave tunic of closely woven repcloth i stood near the gate of the chatka and curla come yata said strabo taking his direction toward the wharves i barefoot braceleted head down followed him i knew now that i truly loved clitus vitellius of ar yet to my misery i had betrayed him how i would if i could have undone that deed how i would if i could have tried to pit my small strength against the heavy oar which he would now draw i would if i could have changed places with him better that i if i could be chained to a bench an oarsman slave than he i a worthless slave girl in her vanity and pettiness had laid low not a warrior but my own beloved what mattered it that he cared naught for me that i was but rude collar meat in his mighty hands it mattered nothing i loved him more deeply than i realized one could love he had stirred such emotion such rage such hatred in me that i would not have believed it possible i had lived for my vengeance dreaming of it and when i had attained it i found it only misery and ashes and unspeakable anguish for it had cost me my very self he whom i loved clitus vitellius of the city of ar the men in the tavern and the girls too had been pleased that i had designated clitus vitellius how excited and pleased all had been you did well they assured me i had been thrown a pastry but alone with myself i wept with misery i had not known i could so love i would have given all to undo that deed he had not treated me well but it did not matter all that mattered was that i loved him yet i had betrayed him how small a thing it was that he had sported with me and then in his simple cruelty given me to a peasant did i not know i was a slave girl what did i expect to be treated as a free woman how vast a thing how vicious and disproportionate it was that i a mere slave girl for so small a fault if fault it was had sentenced him to the tortures of the galleys i had done well i cried out in anguish i loved him i loved him i should have served him in the tavern and then kissed him farewell surrendering him to his glory and freedom i remaining behind forgotten a girl whom once he had owned and discarded i could then have known him free would it not have been enough but i had betrayed him he whom i loved strabo turned and looked at me forgive me master i said i had moaned with anguish we continued on our way toward the wharves the night i had betrayed clitus vitellius i had been beaten i had failed miserably to please the drunken sailor twice later too on ensuing nights i had been beaten you seem to be worthless as a paga girl had said aurelion of cos my master forgive me master i had said it is perhaps time said he to return you to ar i could now smell fish and salt for we were quite near the wharves between buildings i could see galleys at their moorings we descended toward the wharves i no longer wore the black enameled belled collar and snide ring of the chatka and curla i heard men shouting and saw them running there seemed excitement below i now wore a ship collar of locked steel gray with its destination tag the tag i had been told read send me to the lady elicia of ar of six towers i had betrayed clitus vitellius of ar i could not have hated him so much had i not loved him so deeply i had betrayed him he whom i loved strabo took me by the arm this puzzled me as i was braceleted he pulled me through the crowd men ran here and there the fire of white smoke had been lit near the shield pole though it was not yet noon i heard an alarm bar ringing on the height of the shield pole there was hoisted a scarlet disk come said strabo making his way through the crowds holding my arm escape i heard they have escaped cried a man they have escaped cried another man i saw guardsmen hurrying by with shields and spears people stood on roofs who has escaped i cried the alarm bar rang steadily strabo pulled me through the crowds and conducted me swiftly toward one of the wharves who has escaped i cried kneel he said i knelt near the foot of the gangplank leading to the deck of a ramship the jewel of jad such ships are sometimes used for merchant service they carry much less cargo than a round ship but lean and shallowdrafted they are much faster strabo conferred quickly with one of the ships officers one who held a cargo manifest strabo indicated me the man nodded stand said strabo i stood he then thrust me up the gangplank onto the deck of the ship it was some twenty feet wide strabo gave the ships officer the key to my collar and the officer placed it in his pouch the officer then gestured to one of the sailors and indicated me with his head the man fetched a set of light ship chains i stood and felt ankle rings snapped on my ankles joined by some twelve inches of chain another chain attached to this chain was some three feet in length and terminated with light manacles strabo unbraceleted me dropping the bracelets and their key back in his pouch the sailor then lifting the vertical chain behind me fastened me in the light manacles my ankles then were chained and joined to them by the vertical chain behind me were my chained wrists i wish you well slave girl said strabo i wish you well master i said he then left i saw the gangplank drawn up from the wharf moorings were cast off i saw three sailors with long poles edging the ship from the wharf oarsmen free sailors sat upon the benches the helmsmen two of them were in their places the oar master stood below the helmsman on the small high stern deck i saw the captain slowly gently the ship began to move from the wharf an oar count would not be given until clear of the wharfage the lateen sail would not be dropped until clear of the harbor gates on the wharves men seemed still agitated i saw more guardsmen the alarm bar yet rang white smoke billowed from the platform near the shield pole from whose height now swung a scarlet disk i went to the rail of the ship the cargo officer was there other ships too i saw were edging from their wharves we would sail in convoy who has escaped master i asked have you not heard he asked no master i said a chain of twenty men of ar he said how could they escape i asked i was sure these must be the same men i had seen some days ago on the wharves when later i had encountered my master clitus vitellius they were freed by an escaped prisoner he said they fought like larls he said what prisoner freed them i asked one called clitus vitellius he said i trembled on the deck i thought i might faint the joy i felt was incredible they were last seen said the officer heading for a paga tavern the chatka and curla i said nothing but trembled it seems said he a slut there betrayed their leader clitus vitellius he laughed cruelly i would not wish to be she he said the vengeance of a girl i had said to clitus vitellius is not a light thing neither had said he looking at me is the vengeance of a warrior i had shrunk back frightened take him away had said aurelion of cos my master he had been conducted from the tavern he is a warrior of ar said the ships officer standing near me i would not wish to be that slave girl i looked at the wharf which seemed to drift gently away from us did you know her he asked he knew i had come from the chatka and curla yes master i said but he will not find her at the chatka and curla she was sent away good fortune said he for the treacherous slut yes master i said the bow of the jewel of jad turned toward the gate of the harbor there were eyes two large eyes one on each side of the bow they were outlined in black their interior was blue their pupils were black they looked toward the harbor gate i heard the call of the oar master ready oars the oars slid through the thole ports stroke he called the oars in unison twenty on each side dipped into the waters of the harbor drew and lifted the water falling from them in bright droplets splashing back into the harbor i was indescribably happy though too i was apprehensive clitus vitellius was free and had men the officer was looking at me i was chained at his side you are the only slave girl on board he said i looked at him and laughed delightedly he looked at me puzzled i will be a wonder to you master i laughed i will be a wonder to you he lifted the brief skirt of the yellow slave tunic to my left hip you are a dina he said yes master i said i have heard dinas are good he said we are fabulous master i laughed we are slave flowers he laughed at the pun we shall test your boasting later little dina he said i tried to press myself against him i wanted to feel my body in his arms his suddenly clitus vitellius free and with men the world seemed open and glorious again again suddenly i rejoiced in the beauty of men and my slavery to them again almost making me want to cry out with joy i felt their attractiveness irresistibly and deeply again suddenly i felt myself helpless and owned by them loving and helpless to their least touch and command i tried to lift my lips to the officer but he held me from him what a slave you are he laughed yes master i said again i could not help my responsiveness to men true men gorean men to an earth girl accustomed to the hypocrisy and weakness of the men of earth their shame their inhibitions and pretenses the gorean male in his honesty his power his lust his manhood is a hurricane of joy clitus vitellius i knew had been angry that i could not help but respond to men scorning me for this rightly perhaps as the slave and slut i was but i did not care though any gorean male might make me in spite of myself a panting orgasmic slave in his arms i knew it had been only he clitus vitellius whom i had truly loved and yet loved in his arms i had always been the most helpless he was my love master the officer gestured to the sailor who had first chained me and he approached though you are the only girl on hoard said the officer do not think that you will be treated easily no master i said i knew i was a slave girl take her below decks he said and chain her by the neck to a ring the sailor threw me over his shoulder i knew i would be kept below decks until late chained that my needs might grow even keener and more frustrated then when i was whimpering i would be pulled to the deck what occurred southeast of cos i walked about the deck of the jewel of jad the deck was hot the sun was bright i brushed back my hair which was now about an inch and a half in length with my two hands and closed my eyes stretching i opened my eyes and looked up at the sky it was intensely blue and the clouds were so white it almost hurt my eyes to look upon them the single lateen sail stretched from its yard swelled with a clean slow wind i could see other ships to both the left and right too with lateen rigging both ramships and round ships there were some twenty vessels in the convoy we were bound for schendi we were two days out of telnus and it was the tenth hour i loved to walk the deck and feel the wind and the spray the water was only a yard or so below the railing as the ship shallow drafted and freighted plied the sea sunlit and sparkling i looked to the horizon noting the other ships they were beautiful with their masts and sails i understood then how it could be that men might love the sea gorean sailors as the sailors of earth speak of her as she i fingered the ships collar on my throat with its tag it read send me to the lady elicia of ar of six towers at schendi i would be bound and sent by tarn to ar there to be returned to the mercies of elicia nevins a former beauty rival from earth who would then be again my mistress i knew she would get much work from me as her serving slave i touched the ships collar it is a hard thing for a girl to belong to a woman further i knew she would wish me to be a demure girl a fitting serving slave for a lady of wealth and rank one whose status and image requires that her girls be paragons of shy perfect obedience humility and modesty that they reflect not the least dishonor upon her if i so much as looked at a man even a slave i had no doubt she would tear the mesh from my bones with the delicately beaded feminine slave whip which by its slender leather loop hung upon its peg in her bedroom where i her girl might constantly see it i had already felt it it would be torture to belong to her not only from the shame of being forced to serve her perfectly but because she would expect me to adopt her values and conform absolutely to them values which involved her proud determined independence of men and her contempt of them the slave girl must be as the mistress wishes i had felt the hands of gorean men tight and strong on my slave body i did not know if i could now live without them i resolved to put my mistress from my mind and live for the moment for the joy the men the ship and the sea near the stern of the ship men who had been trolling a line now began sweatily bracing themselves to draw it in it pulled back away from them powerfully i ran to the stern that i might watch half out of the water then returning to it i saw a great speckled grunt fourgilled it dove and swirled away another man came to help with the line i observed the struggle one often fishes from the ships on thassa and the diet of the sailors consists in part of the catch part of each catch is commonly saved to serve as bait for the next i cried out with fear one of the men shouted with anger rising from under the grunt swiftly was a longbodied shark white ninegilled it tore the grunt from the line and bore it away other dorsal fins of smaller sharks trailed it waiting sharks and sometimes marine saurians sometimes trail the ships to secure discarded garbage and rob the lines of the fishermen the convoy by its size had doubtless attracted many such monsters i had seen yesterday the long neck of a marine saurian lift from the waters of gleaming thassa it had a small head and rows of small teeth its appendages were like broad paddles then it had lowered its head and disappeared such beasts in spite of their frightening appearance are apparently harmless to men they can take only bits of garbage and small fish certain related species thrive on crustaceans found among aquatic flora further such beasts are rare some sailors reportedly have never seen one far more common and dangerous are certain fishlike marine saurians with long toothed snouts they are silent and aggressive and sailors fear them as they do the longbodied sharks the sea sleen vicious fanged aquatic mammals apparently related to the land forms of sleen are the swiftest predators to be found in thassa further they are generally conceded to be the most dangerous they tend however to frequent northern waters occasionally they have been found as far south however as the shores of cos and the deep inlets of tyros i walked back toward the bow of the ship i reached into a wooden bucket and took a tospit bit it open and began to suck at the juice no one stopped me although the cargo officer my first day on board had warned me that i would not be treated easily he had not been as good as his word i was permitted the freedom of the ship i was not even chained at night the men were fond of me and they treated me well with the rough comraderie and friendship that is sometimes accorded an owned girl one who is common to all and must obey all for all the restraints placed upon me i might have been a free woman save that the distinction between us apart from my tunic and collar would have been clear when a man snapped his fingers and pointed to the deck at his feet or whistled for me in the night and i must run to him as might a pet sleen to serve him a slave girl one who truly serves men has often much freedom since they have everything and anything they want from her and she is complete slave and they total master there is no struggle between them she accordingly in a strange way is prized and treasured how many women of earth i wonder are prized and treasured by their men one can prize and treasure of course only something which one owns a free person can be respected and even loved but cannot stand to another in that unique relationship which is that of prize and treasure to stand in that relationship a woman must be owned further since each man in his heart desires a beautiful woman as a slave he is when he owns one at least in this respect contented satisfied and pleased a contented pleased satisfied man is a happy man and a happy man is a kind man and a generous man he is jealous only of his prerogatives over the slave of course when his heat is upon him then he becomes less kind and generous and more the harsh master she then to her pleasure well understands his dominance over her then her slavery is truly brought home to her even among free lovers i have heard the man in the fullness of his heat often laughs at the womans illusion of freedom and seizes her to him as a slave how marvelous to the man then if she is truly a slave with what joy may such a woman in true bondage be seized and used moreover her bondage naturally extends beyond the brief several hours of pleasure she simply belongs to him and must continue to serve him however he pleases how exciting it must be for a man to own so delicious a creature as a woman how utterly marvelous for him it is more difficult to speak of women in my heart i know there lies a slave girl once denied then secretly feared now openly and joyously recognized who longs for a master i do not know if this is true for other women or not let them look into their own secret hearts i do not think the longing of men is an oddity in the genetic history of a species i think there is a reciprocity which has been intricately evolved this desire this longing for a beautiful slave for a beautiful female who stands to him as slave to master which is universal in glandularly normal strong men does not seem likely to have evolved in isolation the evolution of the tigers tooth suggests the presence of game the evolution of the eye suggests the existence of light the existence of blood suggests the organisms presence in an environment which supplies water and salt similarly a mans desire to own a slave suggests that there are slaves to be owned waiting to be mastered in the animal kingdom the instinct to dominate and the instinct to submit are functions of one another each real and deep in the blood of the evolved complementary beasts let the woman who desires to kneel naked before her male and put her head to his feet do so but let her be wary as he cries out with pleasure and seizes her for she is then a slave sail cried a man sail i looked up he was high above the deck he stood barefoot on the lookout platform high on the tall single mast well above the long yard and the billowing triangular sail the lookout platform is a wooden disk fixed on the mast his hands were on a ring also encircling the mast where away called an officer on the high deck whipping out a small telescope schendi half ship called the man the new vessel was abeam on our port side sailors of cos usually refer to the left side of the ship by the port of destination and the right side of the ship by the port of registration this alters of course when the ports of destination and registration are the same in that case the sailors of cos customarily refer to the left side of the ship as the harbor side the right side of the ship normally continuing to be designated as before by reference to the port of registration this sort of thing occasionally presents problems in translation between gorean and english for example an expression in gorean which might intelligently be translated as off the starboard bow would be more literally translated for the ship on which we were as to the telnus bow the exact expressions port and starboard do not exist in gorean though there are naturally equivalent expressions the english expression starboard is a contraction of steering board and refers to the side of certain ships particularly northern ships on which the steering board or rudder was to be found most gorean vessels on the other hand like many early vessels of earth are double ruddered a reference to the rudder side would thus in gorean be generally uninformative it might be noted however if it is of interest that the swift squarerigged ships of torvaldsland are single ruddered and on the right side a reference to the rudder side or steeringboard or steeringoar side would be readily understood at least by sailors if applied to such a ship the captain of the jewel of lad hurried to the high deck the officer there on watch handed him the telescope it has two masts two sails he said and ten oars to a side it must thus be a round ship it flies the flag of port kar said the captain with pleasure see now said the officer pointing i see said the captain she is turning about another officer ascended to the high deck he too bore a glass it is a round ship said the first officer it is low in the water said the second officer he who had just come to the high deck it is heavily freighted said the first officer the captain lowered the glass he was still looking across the water he licked his lips the jewel of jad was a long ship a ramship though she was now in merchant service she flees said the first officer let us take her the second officer continued to regard the ship she seems long said he for only ten oars to a side she flies the flag of port kar urged the first officer let us take her we shall take her said the captain signal our intentions to the flagship the convoy will lay to yes captain said the first officer and called swiftly to men to run the signal flags of cos to the mast the captain spoke soberly to the helmsmen and the jewel of jad turned to pursue the ship of port kar men leaped to the benches and our oars slid outboard the oar master took his place on the steps below the helmdeck weapons reposed at the foot of the benches it would be holiday and carnival the decks were not cleared none even noted me nor if they did sent me below missile weapons were not readied sand was not brought to the decks they did not even take the time to lower the yard and drop the mast which is commonly done in such vessels before an engagement it would be easy work there would be shares for all the captain grinned stroke called the oar master the jewel of jad like a living thing leaped in pursuit of the fleeing vessel only the second officer he also with the glass seemed troubled observing the fleeing ship with the glass then he was ordered to his station i stood near the railing below the steps leading to the helmdeck the signal flags of cos snapped in the wind behind us in the distance hove to lay the convoy we would rejoin them shortly i was very excited never had i seen a capture at sea when the clouds of telnus had been taken i had been locked below decks with other slave girls we had not known to whom we belonged until the hatch had been opened and we saw strangers faster called the captain stroke called the oar master stroke the convoy fell behind captain called the lookout behold her her masts are dropping she is turning about i could see from where i stood the yards lowering the sails being furled the masts being unblocked on the other ship also i could see it swing about it is as i feared cried the second officer he who had not been sanguine about the vessels pursuit he fled to the high deck hold called the captain hold called the oar master the men looked at him puzzled see said the second officer look you are to be at your station shouted the captain i submit sir said the officer you should turn about the captain studied the ship in his glass the second officer too observed it round ships i knew commonly had two masts fixed and permanently rigged the ship we now watched had no mast we could see note the oars captain pressed the second officer there are now twenty to a side additional oars had been slid through thole ports that is no round ship captain said the young officer its lack of height in the water had not indicated a weight of freighting buts its design swift and terrible like a mighty racing shell its oarage had been only half revealed now its masts were down ramships enter battle under oar power i urge you sir cried the young officer turn about or build speed to shear the ship was bearing down upon us rapidly turn about or build speed to shear cried the young officer see the flag cried the first officer who had been eager to pursue now not only the flag of port kar but another flag too snapped on its line at the stem castle of the approaching vessel hurling toward us like a swift knife its oars flashing it was a broad flag white with vertical bars of green superimposed upon the bars of green gigantic black and horned it bore the head of a bosk it is the flag of bosh of port kar cried the first officer turn about turn about screamed the captain we are lost men cried a sailor rising in terror from the bench i screamed and saw the new ship suddenly large seem to lift itself in the water and then heard the shattering splintering wreckage of wood and the loud swift swirl of water the ship struck and men screaming and saw the lines loose wild the yard and sail leaning awry the deck shifting and becoming steep and i couldnt stand and i lost my footing stumbling and seized a line rolling on the deck it fastened to the mast the ship seemed then for a moment to right itself the new ship had backed away from us and seemed turning its prow away then the deck of the jewel of jad began to tilt toward the water where we had been struck the water pouring into the hold men leaped from the ship into the water the ship then seemed again to right itself but began to settle i crouched terrified gripping the line by the mast suddenly i felt on my feet the cold water of thassa the deck was awash the other ship moved away from us like a silken sleen on the high deck the captain alone stood his hand on the rail i looked about the helmdeck was deserted the benches empty i heard a man scream from the water too from afar i heard signal horns the captain looked down toward me there is no safety here he said release the line and flee to the water i shook my head no i said no i was terrified suddenly he looked upon me as a gorean master he began to descend from the high deck toward me yes master i cried i released the line and fled to the railing and leaped into the water i was a slave girl i feared a gorean master more than the water the water was greenish and cold i felt miserable i went beneath the surface and then emerged come away from the ship called a man i swam toward him i was some yards from the sinking vessel when it slipped beneath the water i was dragged back and submerged but in moments i managed to regain the surface i could not see for the salt water in my eyes it burned in my nostrils for a moment i spit water out a hand seized me and pulled me to a piece of wreckage some plankings from the ships side we will be picked up momentarily said a man there were some four men on the planking i could see other ships from the convoy there were several about converging upon us wait said one of the men they are turning about there are other ships cried another i stood up unsteadily on the boards i could see to be sure that several of the convoy ships were turning about too in the distance between some of them i could see other ships approaching the convoy said one is under attack i saw the young officer in the water he was assisting the captain of the jewel of jad they found wreckage i saw a fin long and white suddenly cut the water a ship passed near us but it was one which flew the flag of port kar a light galley it did not pause for us i saw a trail of smoke looping through the sky as a fire missile was launched from a ships catapult far to our left we saw a galley aflame it was one of cos signal horns could be heard two longboats approached lowered from one of the ships of the convoy one of them picked up men from the water and the captain and young officer the other nosed toward us the four men boarded the longboat i too made ready to board the longboat i was stopped and thrust back we have no room for a slave said one of the men please masters i begged i knelt on the planking the yellow repcloth i wore was wet and thin and clung close upon me gorean slave girls are commonly not permitted brassieres or undergarments please masters i begged they drew me into the boat i knelt between their feet my head down making myself small in a few moments we drew alongside the mothership and i and the others boarded her i was taken and put immediately in the hold a slave girl said a womans voice there was a tiny lamp forgive me mistress i said and knelt she mounted the stairs i will not share the hold with a slave girl she cried be silent woman said an angry man who was on the deck she tried to move back the heavy hatch but it had been battened down she came angrily back down the stairs i did not dare to look at her forgive me mistress i begged she paced back and forth we had both been placed in the hold we were both women i and the free woman who did not deign to speak to me remained many hours in the hold as the fighting and maneuvering continued for several hours through the afternoon and night the lamp burned out and we remained in the darkness outside and above decks we could hear shouting and the sound of sprung ropes as the canisters of flaming pitch were lofted from the deck catapults once late we were partly sheared losing several oars on the port side a few moments later we had been boarded but the boarders had been repelled after the repulsion of the boarders the hatch had been opened briefly the ship is secure lady had said the captain i shall have food brought she had ascended the stairs going to the deck behind her unnoticed i crept to the height of the stairs it was still dark on deck there were dark lanterns sometimes in the distance i saw flares lofted from one ship or another burning upward and then their silken globelike chutes opening burning steadily descending to settle into the water and be extinguished too there was light on the water to our left from flaming ships i will remain no longer in the hold said the lady to the captain i must insist said he no she said you will go below of your own free will said he or i will have you put there chained to the bottom of the steps you would not dare she cried bring chains he said i shall comply with your wishes captain she said angrily and descended the stairs i slipped down before her the hatch was again closed it was opened in a few moments and food and drink was brought she did not share it with me i could tell when morning came as i could hear the men above changing the watch then i fell asleep i was awakened by the free woman pounding on the hatch demanding to be released that we had not been released led me to believe that there was still danger from what i could hear the convoy as a whole had maintained good discipline and given a satisfactory account of itself we were apparently now flanked by several other ships of the convoy then we heard the cry of sail sail once more the weary men scurried about the decks we felt the ship shift as oars took the water we heard the call of the oar master they are coming again we heard they are coming again we felt the ship come about what happens asked the free woman of me if we below decks are rammed it was the first time she had spoken to me perhaps mistress i said someone will remember to open the hatch but if not she asked let us hope they will not forget mistress i said we were boarded last night she said yes mistress i said if i had fallen into the hands of the enemy she asked what would have been done to me you would have been stripped mistress i said to see if you were pleasing to the men and if i were she asked mistress would have been made a slave i said forgive me mistress i added and if i were not pleasing she asked i do not know mistress i said the enemy are men of port kar perhaps you would be thrown to the sharks she made a small noise of fear it pleased me to hear it i think she understood her womanhood a bit more clearly now than perhaps she had before if we are rammed she said frightened and the men do not remember to open the hatch or do not have time to do so what will occur sometimes i said the planking is opened widely perhaps we could escape it would not be likely that we would be successful she said no mistress i said we heard the count of the oar master increasing there was not much other noise on deck then we felt the ship perhaps half of an ahn later suddenly veer to one side we heard some oars snapped i want to know what is going on screamed the free woman she pounded on the closed hatch none paid her attention about a quarter of an ahn later suddenly we hard the screaming of men and not more than three or four ihn afterwards to our horror the wall of the hull opening into the hold with a wrenching sound of rupturing wood suddenly burst inward toward us we could see nothing at first but were struck with a torrent of cold swirling water we screamed then we could see some light and the horizon and the bow of a ship against us and the curved ram of the predator among our planking the attacker backed his oars and the ram its work done splintering more wood withdrew and settled away from us the hole in the hull was more than a yard in width water flowed through making it impossible to approach suddenly it seemed we were to our waists in water the ship rocked back and we saw the sky and the water stopped flowing inward and then it rocked back again and the water smoothly in a broad flow swirled in we climbed the steps of the hold each screaming the hatch was flung up and we saw the sky an officer stood there with unsheathed sword we climbed to the deck scrambling wildly he seized the free woman by the arm he pulled her toward a longboat none paid me attention the attacking ship had withdrawn seeking other prey i saw that there were many ships about it was early in the morning apparently wisps of fog hung upon the water and fog was high in the north ships engaged i heard shouting and on another ship the clashing of weapons within a hundred yards there may have been as many as four or five ships two were aflame men began to crowd into the two longboats one slid capsizing into the water the free woman was handed down into the other men fought to right the capsized boat the stern of the ship began to settle in the water men leaped into the water and began to swim toward other ships i ran to the rail to look after them i did not see the second ship from behind me from amidships approaching it was itself a ship of cos running and could not in the time given the proximity of the ships turn sufficiently aside it too struck the ship on which i stood i screamed and fell thrown to the deck it tilted and i slipped backward i scratched at it as though to climb it toward the bow then i caught the railing and as i felt the ship slipping back into the water the bow lifting high i pulled myself over the railing slipped into the water and swam from the side of the ship the mast of the struck ship lowered had come loose from its deck lashings and had plunged through the railing and slipped into the water it was that mast which i seized lifting my head and arm above the water it turned in the water twisting and was half submerged when the ship disappeared but in a moment it lifted again to the surface i was not fifty feet from a burning ship the water was filled with wreckage i heard signal horns and saw flags on the signal lines i saw two men fighting in the water then suddenly the fog from the north began to move more steadily in about us the burning ship seemed dim in the gray fog i heard more signal horns there was shouting in the water then it seemed there were none about me i cried out the burning ship sank beneath the water the horns were now farther off men who had been near me in the water seemed now to be gone i was suddenly alone i cried out helplessly suddenly i screamed with fear as something longsnouted with rows of tiny teeth closed upon my leg i began to scream with misery trying to hold the mast it did not tear at or wrench my leg i could not see what it was but could sense its weight my hand slipped on the mast it was drawing me downward away from the mast the snout slipped higher on my leg i struck down at it with my fist i struck something hard something heavy and alive i saw a round eye lidded and lensed i screamed wildly my fingers slipped on the mast i struck down striking again and again at the thing then i screaming crying out with misery it drew me from the mast and turning about twisting under the water dove downward i scratched and tore at it but could not free myself the cold water swirled about me i could no longer tell where the surface of the water was i could not breathe my blows became weak then it seemed outward from me in the distance there was a shifting dull flickering light it was the surface i reached toward it bent backward i swallowed water something too was in the water moving downward from the surface things began to go black weakly i tried to push away the jaws that held me long and narrow with many fine teeth i could feel the teeth with my fingers i could not breathe i could not fight there was nothing to breathe the surface receded dimly i was aware of movement near me in the water something other than the beast that held me i thrust out my hand touching nothing i closed my eyes i decided that i would breathe surely there would be something to breathe then the beast suddenly startling me twisted and swam a tight angry circle its long tail thrashing and then the water seemed suddenly different somehow more viscous and greasy the beast thrashed angrily i felt its grip on my leg loosen then suddenly it shook spasmodically i was buffeted away from it i saw it turn slowly in the dark water above me rolling a tiny fish bit at my leg others darting pursued the irrationally moving titan that had held me i felt myself seized by the arm and pulled toward the light remote in the cold water i saw the beast which had gripped me now below me swiftly i was drawn toward the surface unable to see my eyes filled with salt water my head broke the surface and i coughed and gasped an arm strong supported me i shuddered and lost consciousness i think that i was unconscious no more than a few seconds i awakened being drawn onto a large jagged splintered square of wreckage heavy beamed like a raft i lay on my stomach on the wreckage then i lifted myself to my elbows and threw up into the water twice then again i collapsed a few feet from the raft rolling lifeless in the water was a grotesque marine saurian fishlike but reptilian more than twenty feet in length i saw the fins of sharks near it and saw their snouts pressing it and then beginning to tear at it i was conscious of the feet of a man near me he stood there was still fog on thassa he took me by the arms and turning me roughly threw me on my back on the heavy beams of that gigantic raftlike structure before him i wore a bit of wet yellow repcloth it was thin it clung about me revealing me as though i were naked i lifted one knee i lay on my back helpless at his feet i opened my eyes master i cried i struggled to my knees before him my heart flooded with elation i love you i cried i put my head to his feet covering them with kisses and tears i shook with emotion master master i wept i love you i love you he pulled me to my feet shesleen he said quietly and with menace he released me i shrank back from him master i said then suddenly i was terrified oh no master i said i love you he looked to the sharks which moved about the body of the inert buoyant saurian others too smaller restless whitefinned moved about the raft no master i cried i love you i love you master he strode toward me and seized me by the back of my neck and an ankle he lifted me high over his head no master i wept he strode to the side of the raft i could do nothing he could throw me to the sharks in an instant no he said angrily this is too easy for a warriors vengeance he threw me to his feet on the boards he looked about there was a ring on the wreckage where it sloped higher out of the water he dragged me to this ring and tore open my repcloth tunic he knelt across my body and with strips from the repcloth tied my hands over my head and fastened them to the ring i lay on my back before him my head higher than my feet my body at an angle of some five or ten degrees with his foot he kicked aside the repcloth which he had torn open in his belt there was a bloodied knife that with which he had slain the marine saurian he drew forth the knife and looked at me i love you master i whispered i shall cut you to bits he said and throw you little by little to the sharks he could do with me what he chose i was his he drew back the knife the blade in his hand behind his head i closed my eyes it struck in the wood sinking four inches deep beside me i opened my eyes i shuddered he was looking down at me i have you now he said yes master i said he dropped to one knee crouching beside me he jerked the tag on my collar he read it aloud send me to the lady elicia of ar of six towers he laughed you a ladys serving slave he grinned then he lifted my flanks from the wood and then thrust me back holding me to the wood i closed my eyes almost fainting from his touch he released me he stood up looking down at me i love you master i said he kicked me viciously and i cried out lying slave girl he said he crouched again beside me and jerked the knife free from the wood i felt its point at my throat then he thrust the knife again into the wood a foot from me he looked down at me no he said the sharks the knife are too good for you i felt his left hand at my throat he could crush it easily i shuddered then his hand moved from my throat to touch my right breast musingly no he said the sharks the knife are too good for you have pity on a poor slave i begged but i saw in his eyes that he would have no pity on me i felt his right hand on my body i have pursued you he said those at the chatka and curla were kind enough to tell me that you had been shipped on the jewel of jad we seized a small oared galley we joined with those of port kar in the engagement i sought you it was not easy captives were persuaded to speak survivors from the jewel of jad were picked up by the ramship luciana of telnus we sought her we found her in the engagement the galley was destroyed my men swam to a ship of port kar i yet did hunt for you your hunt has been successful master i said you have caught me yes he said the vicious little lying slave the little shesleen and collared traitress is now caught he looked down at me she lies now before me naked and bound at my mercy yes master i said slut said he yes master i said he turned my head from side to side even your ears are pierced he said yes master i said there were tears in my eyes the vengeance of a warrior said he you will learn little slut of a slave is not a light thing i am yours master i said i looked up at him in the fog i felt the raftlike structure shifting beneath us i was bound at his mercy my bit of tunic torn aside on a particle of wreckage on a great sea i am yours master i whispered do with me as you will his left hand held me his right hand moved at my body his teeth and lips pressed suddenly savagely against the side of my throat over the collar i love you clitus vitellius i cried he struck me savagely for i a slave had spoken his name then he continued his depredations on my body in moments to the sky and sea and to his manhood helplessly i cried myself his the raft i lay in the arms of clitus vitellius my master under the bright stars of gor under the white moons and the black sky on the rough wood in the midst of that great lonely sea i heard the water lap at the wreckage on which we lay he had freed me of the ring that my hands under his directives might pleasure him i put my head on the leanness of his belly and my arms about him he held my head in his hands he lay upon his back do not think you are my love slave said he you are only a lying slave my prisoner a captured traitress i will have my way with i know master i said pressing my lips to him he had been very cruel to me he had punished me much if i were you said he i would be terrified i kissed him you do not seem to be terrified he said i have always feared you master i said your temper your strength your will but i love you too he seized me by the arms and flung me to my back on the wood he looked down upon me holding me he was very rough lying slave he said i looked up at him it is true i said master you love any man he said i wear a collar i said he laughed i am a girl of earth i said i cannot help myself in the arms of a gorean male but it is you master whom i most love whom i truly love you seek to escape punishment he said no master i said punish me i felt his hands on my arms so tight he had terrible strength i felt weak i own you he said yes master i said you will not said he with your smiles and pretty noises evade my vengeance he struck me cruelly no master i said he stood up angrily on the wreckage he stepped away from me looking out to sea i remained as i was then he turned about regarding me i lie at your mercy master i said avenge yourself he drew forth the knife at his belt then angrily he thrust it again in its sheath he turned away i smiled and climbed to my knees and stretched a girl is hungry i said he remained looking out to sea it is strange he said what is strange master i asked be silent said he to me slave yes master i said he would not speak to me of his thoughts can it be clitus vitellius he asked himself aloud he turned about angrily and looked at me i betrayed you master i said because i so much loved you had i not loved you so much i could not have so much hated you i had lived for the moment when i might avenge myself upon you and when it presented itself i performed delicious but unspeakable treachery when they took you away i felt anguish and a grief i cannot describe to you i cried out and wept with misery i had betrayed he whom i loved life then to me was but stones and ashes better that it had been i who had been betrayed when i learned of your escape elation and joy flooded me it was enough to know you lived and were free traitress said he i am here i said do with me what you want he regarded me with fury but then he looked away again after a time he turned again to face me it is near dawn he said i am weary it is time to bind you for the night please do not bind me master i said i rose to my feet and brushed back my hair i smiled at him i promise i will not run away master i said i stood on the shifting piece of wreckage i am well aware of the penalties for a runaway slave girl i said lie down by the ring he said and be silent yes master i said i lay down near the ring on your side he said i complied he was the master i felt my wrists taken behind my back crossed and tied together tightly i wanted so much to find some way to convince him of my love for him i wanted him to know truly how i loved him after that he could do what he wanted with me he took two pieces of my tunic twisting them together he then thrust them about the collar i wore between the metal and my neck he then by means of this improvised rope tied my collar close to the iron ring on the wreckage no more than an inch from it he then removed the knife from his sheath plunged it into the wood a few feet from him and lay down in a moment he had turned away from me and was asleep i could understand his anger with me a warriors fury but his distrust hurt me most i could move my head but little i was tied by my collar close to the ring i could not free my hands they had been tied by a warrior i wanted to be his love slave instead i was his prisoner a girl who had betrayed him now caught by him a captive slave and traitress one who now lay helpless bound within the full compass of the displeasure and vengeance of her betrayed master who was a warrior of gor i knew he had not yet worked his vengeance upon me i struggled helplessly for the first time i became terribly afraid it became cold upon the raft i am chained in the hold of a galley awaken slave said clitus vitellius he kicked me i awakened i recalled looking up at him bound i was the girl who had betrayed him he freed my collar of the ring and took the rope of twisted cloth from my torn tunic which had tied me at the ring and crossed my ankles and bound them together the last bit of repcloth tunic which still clung about me he tore away and threw it into the sea i sat up on the wreckage naked my hands tied behind my back my ankles crossed and secured a ship was approaching a mediumclass galley with twenty oars to a side dipping unhurriedly the lateen sail was slackened clitus vitellius stood on the wreckage waiting at the mast line snapped two flags that of port kar and the other that with vertical green bars over a white field superimposed on which was the head of a gigantic bosk it had been identified to me two days ago by the conversation of officers on the jewel of jad it was the flag of bosk of port kar the galley swung about and eased to the side of the wreckage a large man broadshouldered yet lithe with large hands a broad face grayish blue eyes and unruly shaggy windswept reddish hair stood at the rail there was something like an animal about him indefinable unpredictable tenacious intelligent cruel to look at him one knew though it was the deck of a galley he bestrode that he was of the warriors i would have feared being owned by him his eyes appraising me made me conscious of my slavery clitus vitellius lifted his hand in a salute of warriors the man returned the salute i am clitus vitellius of ar he said am i your prisoner we have little quarrel with those of ar said the man you have little shipping clitus vitellius laughed clitus vitellius of ar and his men said the man by accounts rendered to me by samos of port kar of the council of captains participated creditably in the action of the day before yesterday on behalf of the jewel of thassa port kar is sometimes spoken of by her citizens as the jewel of thassa other men speak of her differently rather as a den of thieves and cutthroats a lair of pirates the city is under the governance of a council of captains we did the small things we could said clitus vitellius cos as you know wars with ar then clitus vitellius looked to the man on the ship my men he asked sound and hale said the man on the ship of samos the thassa ubara excellent said clitus vitellius your vessel said the man grinning appears seaworthy but has clumsy lines i request passage for two said clitus vitellius myself and indicating me this slave the man on the ship looked at me a sleek beautiful little animal he said a traitress said clitus vitellius doubtless you will discipline her well said the man it is my intention said clitus vitellius i put down my head i grant you passage smiled the man on the ship i felt myself taken and lifted bound to a sailor who lifted me over the rail he put me by the mast kneeling bound in a moment clitus vitellius aided by the hand of the man who had spoken to us leaped aboard bring her about called the man to his helmsmen left oars called the oar master stroke slowly the galley began to swing about the man who had welcomed us aboard permitting us passage looked down at me i looked up at him naked and bound in courtesy said clitus vitellius i grant you and your men slave rights upon this woman but beyond this i reserve her to myself if you wish her beyond my permissions we must do contest you wish to keep her for your discipline asked the man yes said clitus vitellius the man crouched beside me he thrust open my mouth holding it with two hands barbarian he said yes said clitus vitellius the master a free male permitted me to close my mouth he took the tag on my collar in his fingers he scraped salt from it i was being sent to the lady elicia of ar i said my mistress you should belong to a man said the man yes master i said you seem interested in the slave said clitus vitellius puzzled you are an enslaved earth girl said the man to me yes master i said you were sent once he asked to a paga tavern on cos called the chatka and curla yes master i said i felt his hands hard on my arms excellent he said he looked at me and i felt terror i shall now ask you a simple question he said and you will answer it immediately and truthfully if you would live for another five ihn two sailors seized clitus vitellius who struggled i looked at him wildly have you heard of one called belisarius asked the man yes master i whispered i brought him a message what message he asked i do not know i cried he stood up we shall have the message he said i do not know what it is i cried release me demanded clitus vitellius thurnock said the man take the slave below put her in sirik chain her in the hold a large man blondhaired powerful threw me to his shoulder master i cried to clitus vitellius i heard him struggling release me cried clitus vitellius i would speak with you upon the high deck said the man to clitus vitellius and i would speak with you alone i do not understand said clitus vitellius release him said the man the sailors released clitus vitellius come with me to the high deck said the man he turned and led the way clitus vitellius followed him angrily the large man descended a short flight of stairs leading downward from an opened hatch the ceiling of the hold was low and at the bottom the man bent over and carried me in his arms in the hold there were many supplies and weapons and riches the convoy had been broken and it had scattered many ships had been taken much loot lay in the hold this ship alone i gathered carried the ransom of a dozen ubars the man lay me on my side on the boards of the hold against the wall of the hold there were five girls illuminated in the light of a tiny ships lantern they were stripped each was chained by the left ankle to a common ring the man brought a sirik and locked it on my throat and about my wrists and ankles then with another chain looping it through the sirik chain which fell from my sirik collar to my braceleted wrists and confined ankles he secured me to a heavy ring passing one end of the looped chain through the ring and then with a heavy padlock closing the open end of the loop only then did he untie the bonds on my wrists and ankles when i was freed of those bonds i was chained in sirik fastened at the ring i was secured much more heavily than they the men said one of the women were taken from the boat and chained and put in a round ship what men i asked her puzzled the men who were with me in the longboat she said do you not remember me no i said we were together she said on the luciana of telnus you are the free woman i exclaimed she laughed ruefully and lifted with her small hand the chain which held her fair ankle she indicated the other girls beside her we were all free she said rejoice said i that men found you pleasing the girls shuddered they are going to take us to port kar and sell us said one what is it like being a slave asked one of the girls i looked at her beauty and laughed you will find out i said slave she shrank back frightened against the wall of the hold what ship is this i asked it is the dorna said one of the girls and who is its captain i asked referring to the man who had spoken with us the lean strong reddishhaired man so like an animal clearly of the warriors he frightened me that is bosk of port kar said one of the girls above us the hatch was closed i heard it lock i looked upward i was in sirik fastened to a ring chained in the bold of the dorna the ship of the dreaded pirate and slaver bosk of port kar i lay down on the planking of the hold naked in my chains we shall have the message he had said but i did not know what the message was we shall have the message he had said i did not know what the message was when i failed to give it to him i did not know what would be done to me these were days of war i had been an unwitting message girl for one side i had now fallen into the hands of the other side i looked at the other girls how i envied them they would be branded and made simple slave girls they need only obey and be dreams of pleasure to men i felt the planking of the hold with my body the chains were tight on me i did not know what would be done with me the message i lifted the strung beads to the squarejawed man with short closely cropped white hair his face was windburned and in each ear there was a small golden ring to one side crosslegged sat he who was bosk of port kar near him intent watchful was clitus vitellius beside the man before me the man with white shortcropped hair who was samos of port kar chief among the captains of the council of captaim of port kar was a slender grayeyed man clad in the green of the caste of physicians he was iskander said once to have been of turia the master of many medicines and one reputed to be knowledgeable in certain intricacies of the mind i knelt back on my heels there were two other slave girls in the room in slave silk collared kneeling to one side waiting to serve the men should they desire aught i was naked as i had been when i had strung beads for he called belisarius in a house in cos samos put the beads before him on a tiny table he looked at them puzzled is this all he asked yes master i said iskander of the physicians had given me of a strange draft which i slave must needs drink this will relax you he had said and induce an unusual state of consciousness as i speak to you your memory will be unusually clear you will recall tiny details with precision further you will become responsive to my suggestions i do not know what the drug was but it seemed truly effective slowly under its influence and the soothing but authoritative voice of iskander i responsive to his suggestions obedient to his commands began to speak of the house of belisarius and what had occurred there i might in my normal waking state have recalled much of what had occurred there even to the words spoken but in the unusual state of consciousness which iskander by means of his drug and his suggestions had induced in me even the most trivial details little things which a waking consciousness would naturally and peremptorily suppress as meaningless unimportant were recalled with a lucid patient fidelity notes had been taken by a thin blond slave girl in a brief blue tunic named luma her tunic suggested that she might once have been of the scribes her legs were pretty she knelt close to bosk of port kar what does it matter samos had asked iskander whether a word is spoken before or after another it may matter much said iskander it is like the mechanism of the crossbow the key to a lock all must be in order each element must be in place else the quarrel will not loosen else the lock will not open this seems strange to me said samos it is strange to you because it is unfamiliar to you said iskander but in itself it is no more strange than the mechanism of the crossbow the mechanism of the lock what we must do is reconstruct the mechanism which in this case is a verbal structure a dialogue which will release or trigger the salient behavior the stringing of the beads could she not simply be commanded to recount the order of the beads inquired bosk of port kar i could not do so no said iskander she cannot do so or can only do so imperfectly why asked samos is the drug not sufficient the girl has been carefully prepared said iskander she is under powerful countersuggestion in that particular we might in time break through it but we have no assurance that we would not tap a false memory set within her mind to deceive or mislead us what i would suspect we would encounter would be overlays of memories the true with the false our best mode of procedure appears to be to reconstruct the trigger behavior you suspect then asked bosk that several arrangement orders of beads might be in her memory yes said iskander each of which i suspect would be correlated with a different message we would thus said bosk not know which of the messages was the true message precisely said iskander but we do know the trigger sequence will release the crucial message otherwise said bosk the intended recipient of the message would also not know which message was the one intended for communication correct said iskander proceed then said samos in your attempts to reconstruct the trigger or the key in this matter iskander had then continued his questioning of me i lifted the strung beads to the squarejawed man with short closely cropped white hair samos of port kar i knelt back on my heels samos put the beads on the small table before him is this all he asked yes master i said it is meaningless he said it is the necklace said iskander i have done what i can should it bear an import it is up to others to detect it give me the necklace said bosk of port kar samos handed it to him the pirate regarded it note said he the frequency of yellow beads each third bead is yellow yes said samos why should that be smiled bosk i do not know said samos from the fact that each third bead is yellow said bosk we may infer that the units of import consist of pairs of beads separated by the yellow beads note that this pair consists of a red bead followed by a blue bead and this other pair by an orange bead followed by a red bead there are several such combinations we might suppose that say a red bead followed by a blue bead correlates with one alphabetic character what if the order were reversed asked samos doubtless if that combination were used it would correlate with a different character said bosk we do not have the key to the cipher said iskander we can try all combinations cried samos pounding the table we may suppose said bosk as a working hypothesis that the message is in gorean as far as we know belisarius whom we know only by name and it may be a code name is gorean yes said samos see said bosk who was examining the necklace the most frequent combination of colors is blue and red so asked samos in gorean said bosk the most frequently occurring letter is eta we might then begin by supposing that the combination of blue and red signifies an eta i see said samos the next most frequently occurring letters in gorean said bosk are tau aika omnion and nu following these in frequency of occurrence are ar ina shu and homan and so on how is this known asked samos it is based upon letter counts said bosk over thousands of words in varieties of manuscripts these matters have been determined by scribes asked samos yes said bosk why should they be interested in such things such studies were conducted originally at least publicly as opposed to the presumed secret studies of cryptographers in connection with the sardar fairs said bosk at meetings of scribes concerned to standardize and simplify the cursive alphabet also it was thought to have consequences for improved pedagogy in teaching children to first recognize the most commonly occurring letters i was taught the alphabet beginning with alka smiled samos as was i said bosk perhaps we should first have been taught eta that is not the tradition said samos true admitted bosk and these innovative scribes have had little success with their proposed reforms yet from their labors various interesting facts have emerged for example we have learned not only the order of frequency of occurrence of letters but as would be expected rough percentages of occurrence as well eta for example occurs two hundred times more frequently in the language than altron over forty percent of the language consists of the first five letters i mentioned eta tau alka omnion and nu that seems impossible said samos it is true said bosk further over sixty percent of the language consists of those five letters plus ar ina shu and homan we could still try all possible combinations said samos true said bosk and in a short message which this appears to be we might produce several intelligible possibilities short messages particularly those which do not reflect statistical letter frequencies can be extremely difficult to decipher even when the cipher used is rudimentary rudimentary asked samos there are many varieties of cipher said bosk both of the substitution and transposition type i suspect we have before us in this necklace a simple substitution cipher why asked samos it was interpreted almost instantly by the man called belisarius said bosk a more complicated cipher indexed to key words or key numbers would presumably have required a wheel or table for its interpretation can all codes be broken asked samos do not confuse a code with a cipher said bosk in a code a given character or set of characters will commonly correlate with a word as opposed to a letter codes require code books codes in effect cannot be broken if the code book can be captured of course the code is useless codes are vulnerable in one way ciphers in another do you feel the enemy would risk a code book or code device on gor asked samos bosk smiled it seems unlikely he said are there unbreakable ciphers asked samos yes said bosk both from a practical and theoretical point of view from the practical point of view if a cipher is used briefly and for a given short message it may be impossible to break there is just not enough material to work with from the theoretical point of view the uniquesequence cipher cannot be broken it utilizes key words or numbers but each message is further altered in a prearranged random manner each message is thus unique but decipherable in its position in the sequence of messages both sender and receiver know for example that message six will be randomized in manner six and so on this is complex said samos it requires that both sender and receiver have the deciphering tables at hand said bosk thus although it is more convenient than a code book it shares some of the vulnerability of the code book samos looked down at the necklace on the table before him why should this be a simple substitution cipher he asked i think that it is said bosk from the ease with which belisarius read the message i find it not implausible that it should be a simple substitution cipher because of the simplicity and convenience of such a cipher is it as secure asked samos the security of this cipher smiled bosk lies not in itself as a cipher but rather as is common that it is not understood as a cipher it is not for example a strange message written upon a scrap of paper calling attention to itself as a secret communication challenging the curious to its unraveling but apparently only an innocent necklace beaded with wood common vulgar and cheap fit only for the throat of a lowly female slave samos lifted the necklace i did not know what secret it contained further said he who was called bosk of port kar the slave herself did not understand the nature of her role in these matters she did not for a long time even understand that she bore the message great security was achieved too in the manner of releasing the behavior of stringing the beads and in the countersuggestion that she be unable to recall the order of the beads without the appropriate trigger structure being reconstructed bosk smiled add to this said he the convenience of a simple substitution cipher the absence of the necessity for a code book the lack of need for cipher wheels or deciphering tables and you have an arrangement of circumstances which maximizes not only security but under the appropriate conditions ease of communication worthy of the enemy said samos i think so said bosk could we not seize this belisarius asked samos we do not know where he is said bosk he looked at iskander of the physicians if we should be able to seize him who is spoken of as belisarius do you think we could derive the cipher key from him perhaps said iskander but i suspect that a spoken word uttered by belisarius himself would by suggestion remove the cipher key from his mind could the enemy be so subtle asked samos iskander of the physicians pointed to me i think so said he you see what their power is in such matters i looked down could we by the use of drugs obtain it asked samos perhaps said iskander but presumably we would encounter numerous keys who knows samos looked at bosk can you read the cipher he asked i do not know said bosk see the repetitions of the beads there are several repetitions to compose the entire necklace the message itself is thus short it may be impossible to rend asked samos yes said bosk samos looked at me i wonder said he why when finished with this wench they did not cut her throat i shuddered they apparently feared little said bosk their security they deemed was impregnable may i speak masters i asked yes said samos belisarius said i said that others would not understand the message even if they might read it that it would be meaningless to them samos looked to bosk captain said he begin work i shall captain smiled bosk he turned to the slave girl luma copy down said he on your paper the order of the beads in widely spaced rows give me then your marking stick and your paper yes master she said in moments her quick hands had accomplished this business and she surrendered to bosk of port kar both the paper and the marking stick we shall begin said bosk by supposing that the sequence of blue and red corresponds to eta the next most common sequence is orange and red we shall tentatively suppose that corresponds to tau i leaned back on my heels and watched no one spoke samos and clitus vitellius were intent bosk worked swiftly but upon occasion he seemed angry more than once for certain letters he altered his initial hypothesis of correspondence substituting another and sometimes yet another and another at last he laid down the marking stick and ruefully viewed the paper before him i have the message he said soberly samos turned to the two slave girls who knelt to one side begone slaves he said swiftly in their silk they fled from the room commanded by a man bosk looked to luma yes master she whispered she too rose to her feet and in her brief blue tunic hurried from the room under the command of masters slave girls do not dally would you wish me to withdraw inquired clitus vitellius samos looked at bosk of port kar then samos said remain if you would clitus vitellius captain of ar clitus vitellius nodded i knelt as before a naked captive slave bosk looked angrily at the words on the paper before him it makes no sense said he what is the message asked samos he called bosk of port kar read from the paper before him halfear arrives he said then he added it is meaningless no whispered samos his face white it is not meaningless what is the meaning asked bosk of port kar when did you give this message slave girl demanded samos of me in the last passage hand master i said i took her from two men near the country of the salerian confederation said clitus vitellius in the early spring since that time i had been the slave of clitus vitellius of thumus of tabuks ford of the keep of stones of turmus and of the belled collar i had been owned too by elicia nevins and had labored too in the chatka and curla it is too late said samos miserably in what way asked bosk of port kar doubtless halfear even now is upon the surface of gor said samos grimly who is halfear asked bosk of port kar we do not know his true kur name said samos he is only known upon gor as halfear who is he asked bosk of port kar he is a great war general of the kurii said samos is his arrival on gor significant asked bosk of port kar he has doubtless come to gor to take charge of the operations of kurii upon this world i did not understand this talk of kur and kurii they were i gathered the enemy that he should come to gor at this time is significant asked bosk i fear terribly so said samos he seemed shaken this surprised me for he seemed generally so stern and strong it must be a dire intelligence indeed conveyed by the simple message to disturb to such an extent so mighty a man what does it mean pressed bosk of port kar it means i fear said samos the invasion is imminent invasion asked clitus vitellius there are enemies said samos of ar asked clitus vitellius angrily of ar and of port kar and of cos and tarna and of a world said samos halfear said bosk of port kar musingly i should like to meet him i too cried clitus vitellius i know something of him said samos of port kar i do not think i would care to make his acquaintance we must locate him said bosk of port kar we have no clue said samos no clue samos looked down at the necklace which lay again now upon the table before him we know only said he dismally that somewhere upon gor halfear is among us i could hear the oil crackling in the bowl of the tiny lamp on its stand near us samos looked at me absently then he said to the guards behind me take her to the pens and chain her heavily i return to ar what was done to elicia nevins my mistress your bath is ready mistress i said kneeling head down in brief white slave tunic before the lady elicia of ar of six towers she seated herself on her great couch and extended her feet one alter the other to me i kneeling removed her sandals kissing each and laying it aside she stood up and i rising and standing behind her lifted away her robe i kissed it and put it upon the couch she smiled approvingly perhaps i shall yet make a serving slave of you judy she said it is my hope that i will be pleasing to my mistress i said she gestured and i brought the towel kissing it which i then wrapped about her head that her hair not be dampened she then went to the edge of the sunken bath and slipped her toe within the water and then stepped down into the bath and reclined leaning back excellent judy she said thank you lady elicia my mistress i said i had well judged the temperature of the water mixing the water from the cistern with other water heated in the tempering vessel on its iron tripod the temperature was acceptable i would not be whipped i served her as she wished with absolute perfection i glanced at the beaded feminine slave whip hanging by its loop upon the wall i had no wish to feel it i looked at the mistress luxuriating in her warm bath beautiful in the multicolored foams of beauty i was judy her house and serving slave i kept her compartments dusting and cleaning i cooked and washed i did all trivial unpleasant and servile work for her it was a great convenience to her to own me often she would send me shopping my hands braceleted behind my back a leather capsule a cylinder tied about my neck containing her order and coins the merchant would then fill her order tie the merchandise about my neck put the change in the leather capsule close it and sometimes with a friendly slap dismissing me reminding me that i was pretty regardless of being a womans slave send me back to my mistress at other times my mistress would shop and i would follow her deferentially to carry her purchases eyes cast down lest i should be caught so much as looking upon a man a handsome male slave had once smiled at me and i inadvertently had reddened and basked in his pleasure i had been turned about and marched home to be put under the whip the lady elicia as i soon discovered and had earlier suspected despised and hated men yet too she found them somehow intensely fascinating and intriguing often she asked me questions which a slave girl might respond to intimately and easily if asked by another slave girl but which were difficult to respond to if asked by a free woman she would ask questions about the tethering and chaining of slaves and their feelings and what men made them do and how they were expected to speak and behave she wanted to know intimate details of such things as what it was like to be a peasants girl and what men exacted of girls in a paga tavern i tried to answer her honestly she would profess rage and indignation yes mistress i would murmur putting my head down how pleased you must be judy she sometimes said to have been rescued from all that to be a womans slave oh yes mistress i would say how could i tell her the joys of a slave girl obeying the uncompromising dominant male and writhing in his arms she lifted one fair limb her left arm from the foam and washed it slowly with her right hand regarding it approvingly like many frigid women she was incredibly vain of her beauty did she not understand that it and she were biologically meaningless if not seized in the arms of a master how rude and despicable men are judy she said yes mistress i said often in the bath for some reason she would speak of men and her contempt for them today she said in the market i saw a man beating a slave girl tied to a ring it was terrible yes mistress i said i wondered what the girl had done i supposed she had been displeasing i had not accompanied her today to the market i had been left at home chained to the ring at the foot of her couch afterwards she said the miserable girl covered his feet with kisses terrible mistress i said i supposed the girl was attempting to placate her master and express her gratitude her joy at his reassertion of his dominance over her yes terrible said the lady elicia of ar my mistress of six towers too she said my errand took me inadvertently near the street of brands oh mistress i asked sometimes when she went on errands i did not accompany her there she said i saw a chain of girls stripped in the open men looking upon them disgusting yes mistress i agreed she lifted one leg her right gracefully from the water foam and water fell from it her toes were pointed her leg was shapely do you think i am beautiful judy she asked yes mistress i said she often asked me this truly she asked yes mistress i said it was indeed true my mistress was an incredibly beautiful young woman she was clearly more beautiful than i do you think that men might find me pleasing she asked yes mistress i said do you think she laughed as though jesting that i would bring a high price yes mistress i said she had asked me this sort of thing before i had answered her truthfully before and i answered her truthfully now i wondered at her curiosity concerning such matters i had no doubt that elicia nevins on the block naked under the auctioneers whip would sell for at least a piece of gold she finished washing her legs one after the other dreamily i heard the small noise that i had been waiting for for several days she reclined in the tub easing her lovely body gently lower in the water closing her eyes the water the multicolored foams of beauty were about her chin then she sat a bit more upright in the tub the water and foam about her shoulders she opened her eyes and looked up at the ceiling what is it like being a mans slave she asked mistress will soon know i said she turned about and then suddenly first seeing him cried out startled who are you she cried are you the lady elicia of ar of six towers he asked i am she she cried i charge you said he in the name of the priestkings of gor with being an agent of kurii and as such subject to the penalties connected therewith i do not understand a word you are saying she cried he drew forth from his tunic a folded yellow paper closed with a seal and ribbon i saw on the yellow paper stamped upon it in black ink large the common kajira mark of gor i have here he said a bill of enslavement signed by samos of port kar examine it i trust you will find that all is in order he threw the paper to the tiles no she cried frightened trying to cover herself then she cried out tellius barus your minions said the man will be of little service it is understood they are of cos they are already in the custody of the magistrates of ar tellius barus she screamed you are quite alone lady elicia he said there are none to hear your screams he was tall and strong clad in a warriors scarlet at his belt there was a long leash looped emerge from your bath said he and prepare to accept slave bonds no she cried then she cried out to me run judy fetch help do not said the man yes master i said i looked at the lady elicia forgive me mistress i said i am a slave girl who has been commanded by a man i knelt to one side bitch bitch she cried yes lady elicia my mistress i said she spun in the tub agonized covering herself to face the tall guest there is some mistake she cried leave me you intrude in a ladys compartments emerge from your bath said he to accept the bonds of a slave never she cried are you a virgin he asked yes she said angrily if i must fetch you in the water he said you will be taken in the water bring me my robe she said he went to the robe on the couch but instead of handing it to her he examined it lifting it to the light in one sleeve in a tiny narrow sheath he found a needle which he held up then he approached the bath she shrank back frightened he washed the needle dried it on a towel and replaced it in the sheath i had not known the sheath and needle were there so cunningly had they been concealed in the weaving he looked at her i had little doubt the needle had been poisoned probably with kanda you have disarmed me warrior she said will you now please hand me my robe he threw the robe to the side of the room she looked at it crumpled at the side of the room please she said i am rich i can give you much gold stand in the bath he said i would see your hands above your head you intrude upon my privacy she cried soon he said you will have no right to privacy my modesty she cried when you are a slave he said you will not be permitted modesty this was true have mercy warrior she cried obey or be lashed he said elicia nevins stood in the tub and lifted her hands over her head in an attitude of surrender the guest regarded her casually openly at length with the appraisal of a master she shook with fear seen by a gorean warrior the warrior then went to the side of the tub crouching near what had been the side to her right she stepped back in the water away from him he brushed back the foam carefully he examined the wall of the tub in moments he had retrieved the tiny dagger which lay there in its small compartment concealed behind a tile he cleaned the poison from the side of the dagger dried it with a towel as he had the needle and then threw it to the side of the room where lay her robe which he had earlier discarded i had not known of the existence of either the compartment or the small poisoned weapon which it concealed elicia stood in the water on the far side of the large sunken tub her hands lifted free me she said i will pay you much he regarded her i will give you enough to buy ten slave girls in my stead she said but they would not be elicia nevins he said she shook her head haughtily she still wore the colorful towel about her head would you care to examine the bill of enslavement he asked if i may she said step forth he said keeping your hands lifted she did so and went to stand near the paper on the floor her hands lifted you will make a lovely slave he said then he said you may lower your hands and kneel the woman always examines the papers of enslavement on her knees slave girl said the man speaking to me remove the towel from about her head and permit her to dry her hands upon it yes master i said i removed it carefully lest it contain a needle or other device of which i might be unaware the lovely cascade of dark hair which was elicias fell down her back yes said the man a lovely slave elicia dried her hands and miserably broke the ribbon and seal and examined the paper you are literate inquired the man yes she said acidly do you understand the document he asked yes she said it is an order of enslavement you understand further of course said he that under gorean merchant law which is the only law commonly acknowledged binding between cities that you stand under separate permissions of enslavement first were you of ar it would be my right could i be successful to make of you a slave for we share no home stone secondly though you speak of yourself as the lady elicia of ar of six towers you are in actuality miss elicia nevins of the planet earth you are an earth girl and thus stand within a general permission of enslavement fair beauty quarry to any gorean male whatsoever earth girls had no home stones no legalities thus were contravened in capturing them and making of them abject slave girls the first to capture you owns you he said prepare to be leashed as a slave he unlooped the long leash at his belt with its slip ring and snap lock wait she said extending her hand yes he said beware of leashing me in this city she said i am truly of ar describe to me said he the home stone of ar she looked down confused she could not do so young men and women of the city when coming of age participate in a ceremony which involves the swearing of oaths and the sharing of bread fire and salt in this ceremony the home stone of the city is held by each young person and kissed only then are the laurel wreath and the mantle of citizenship conferred this is a moment no young person of ar forgets the youth of earth have no home stone citizenship interestingly in most gorean cities is conferred only upon the coming of age and only after certain examinations are passed further the youth of gor in most cities must be vouched for by citizens of the city not related in blood to him and be questioned before a committee of citizens intent upon determining his worthiness or lack thereof to take the home stone of the city as his own citizenship in most gorean communities is not something accrued in virtue of the accident of birth but earned by virtue of intent and application the sharing of a home stone is no light thing in a gorean city you claim to be of ar said he yet you cannot describe her home stone explain to me then in precise detail the ceremony of citizenship or perhaps the performances enacted upon the planting feast i cannot she stammered shall i have you taken before the magistrates of ar he inquired to substantiate your claim of citizenship no she mid no she looked at him terrified to claim a home stone as ones own when it is not is a serious offense among goreans elicia nevins shuddered she had no wish to be impaled upon the walls of ar mercy warrior she begged are you of ar he asked no she said i am not of ar read further in the bill of enslavement said he her hands shaking she read further sex he asked female she read origin he asked the planet earth she read name elicia nevins she read the document designated her by her own name she trembled the document shook in her hand is that your name he asked she looked at me and then she looked again at the warnor yes she said it is my name you are elicia nevins he asked yes she said i am elicia nevins fate he asked slavery she read she handed him the document with trembling hands prepare to be leashed he said he looked aside casually as he returned the bill of enslavement to his tunic in this moment elicia springing to her feet ran to the side of the room and picked up the small dagger i cried out she whirled holding the dagger he closed his tunic the bill of enslavement concealed within it he looked at her unmoved i do not think elicia realized at this time that he had already begun her training get out she cried i have a knife i will kill you get out you have finished your bath he said and are fresh and ready adorn yourself now with cosmetics and scents get out she screamed you seem slow to obey he remarked she looked wildly about her toward the open door leading from the chamber of her bath and couch there is no escape he said the outer door is secured with a small chain she fled through the door and ran to the outer door we followed her watching we were then in the room containing the curule chair the room in which she had first interviewed me her new slave girl she pulled at the chain on the door looped in rings holding the bolt in place and cut at the door with the knife hysterically then she turned again wildly gasping her hair about her face viewing us she fled then again into the chamber she had so recently vacated and shut the door throwing its bolts in place the warrior rose from the curule chair in which he had taken his place and went to the door i stood back startled he kicked it twice splintering it back until it hung wildly open on one hinge the side of the door and the door frame had been splintered loose with one foot he then brushed the door back within the room miserable brandishing her knife stood elicia stay away she screamed he entered the room and faced her i too slipped into the room remaining much behind him you have not yet complied with my command to adorn yourself with cosmetics and scents he observed are you disobeying get out she screamed apparently you require discipline he said get out she screamed get out he approached her swiftly she struck down at him and he took her wrist and turning her body suddenly savagely thrust her wrist behind her and forced it up high against her back she screamed with pain she was high on her toes his left hand was on her left arm holding her his right hand held her right wrist small high behind her back the knife clattered harmlessly on the tiles with his right foot he swept it to one side he held her still for a moment her head was back her eyes were shut her teeth were clenched then with his left foot he kicked her feet from beneath her and she knelt at his feet head down her arm twisted high behind her the wrist now bent held between two of his fingers she knelt near the bath you require discipline he said please she wept he released her wrist and arm and taking her by the hair thrust her on her stomach on the tiles at the edge of the bath her head over the water i will buy my freedom she cried let me pay you he thrust her head under the water under the foams of beauty after a time he pulled her up sputtering i do not want to be a slave she gasped water running from her head again he submerged her head holding it under the water after a time a longer time he again pulled her head up freeing it of the water she gasped she spit water she coughed water streamed from her head her eyes were blinded by water and foam i do not want to be a slave she cried i do not want to be a slave again he thrust her head beneath the water i feared he might drown her again he pulled her head by the hair from the water i will obey master she gasped he kept her on her stomach by the bath and slipped the leather loop of the leash over her head quickly his large efficient hands shortened the loop sliding the slip ring to a snug fit then securing it in place preventing its backward movement with the snap lock the leash could then tighten functioning as a locked choke leash but could not loosen elicia nevins turned to her side unbelievingly she touched the leather she had been leashed she looked up at the warrior master she asked soon he said whose leash do i wear she asked that of bosk of port kar he said not he she cried i gathered she had heard of her enemy he said bosk of port kar she trembled leashed i did not think hers would be an easy slavery i did not envy her the name of bosk of port kar was dreaded among women on gor he pulled her to her knees by the leash she looked up at him he gestured to me where is the key to her collar he asked in the yellow drawer in the vanity she said hastily beneath silk fetch it said bosk of port kar to me i fled to the drawer and found the key i did not daily to obey he had spoken to me in the voice of the gorean master he indicated that i should press the key into the hands of elicia and kneel with my back to her i did so remove the collar said he to elicia fumbling she opened my collar and pulled it away putting it and the key on the tiles say i no longer own you commanded the warrior i no longer own you whispered elicia to me frightened i sprang to my feet and turned to face her she shrank back leashed my fists were clenched she looked up at me it was sweet to me to see her on her knees leashed kneel said bosk of port kar to me yes master i said i was still a slave elicia and i knelt near to one another he stood near elicia and looked down upon her her lip trembled you are an agent of kurii he said and are a valuable as well as beautiful catch will i be taken to port kar to be interrogated she asked yes he said i will be cooperative she said i will speak all i know she had no desire to be put under the tortures of port kar of course he said he glanced outside the long high window in her compartments out upon the towers of ar it was still bright the blue sky was intense among and over the lofty towers of the city it is early afternoon she said it will be difficult to take me from the city by day that was true tarnsmen periodic and alight patrolled the city doubtless she said you are awaiting the fall of darkness that is true said he prisoner she looked up at him his leather on her throat do not fear said he we will find a way to while away the time how am i to be taken from the city she asked bound naked belly up said he across the saddle of a tarn scarcely the way to transport a free woman she said by nightfall said he you will be fit cargo for such mode of transport she shuddered go to the vanity he said and kneel before it she did this he then crouching behind her crossed her ankles and with the long loose end of the leash tied them together the leash then ran from her throat back to her ankles her hands were free apply cosmetics and scents said he you are to be absolutely beautiful he said she reached miserably for the tiny boxes and brushes go into the outer room he said to me among my things you will find an iron prepare a brazier and heat the iron you will find there too earrings and a saddle needle bring them yes master i said it was in the late afternoon that i holding its handles with quilted cloths slid the brazier into the chamber of the couch and bath i had not done this earlier in order that the room not be made uncomfortably hot how beautiful you are elicia i said startled she sat at the foot of the couch her knees drawn up and together on furs thrown to the tiles from its surface she no longer wore the leash her ankles were tied and her hands were tied behind her she was made up beautifully for her branding her left ankle i noted on a chain of some five feet in length was fastened to the slave ring at the couchs foot on many nights i had slept there chained it had been bosks decision that she would be branded at the slave ring of her own couch judy she wept what is he going to do he is going to brand you i said no she said you were not forced to come to gor i said she struggled in the bonds bosk of port kar with the quilted cloth drew forth the iron and thrust it back it would soon be ready you are a beast and a barbarian she cried to him drawing back then she could move no further back against the stone couch she could draw her feet up no further he took her and threw her to her right side wedging her in the corner formed by the tiles and the foot of the stone couch with the leash he tied her thighs tightly together leaving between the tight confining leather strips an open space a small lovely territory for the passage of the iron he gestured that i slide the brazier near to him and i did so he indicated that i should give him the quilted cloth with which he might seize the iron and i did so help me judy wept elicia you were not forced to come to gor elicia i told her she lay on her right side bound thrust against the foot of the couch wadded furs helped to hold her in place her thighs had been tied for the iron bosks weight too pressed upon her she shut her eyes i looked outside at the clouds the blue sky of the late afternoon it was sunny the towers were beautiful i saw some small birds in flight i closed my eyes when she screamed i listened to the iron patient performing its identificatory work i smelled the branding bosk did not hurry he did his work upon her well i again opened my eyes the sky was lovely and blue outside of the window more birds flew by i heard the girl sobbing there was a new slave girl on gor i looked upon her she looked at me tears in her eyes she had been marked incontrovertibly and well i am a slave she said yes i said remove the brazier and iron said bosk of port kar set the iron to cool yes master i said with the quilted cloths i took the brazier from the room and the iron too outside in the outer room i put the iron aside on the tiles near his belongings it would cool when i returned to the chamber of the bath and couch he had sat the new slave up against the couch he with a saddle needle was piercing her left ear lobe i saw the needle run through and a tiny spot of blood he had already pierced her right ear lobe then he took the earrings i had brought golden loops an inch in diameter and fastened them in her ears he then gave me the saddle needle to clean and replace in his gear which i did when again i returned to the chamber of the bath and couch he had freed her of her bonds with the exception of the chain on her left ankle which fastened her to the slave ring at the foot of the couch she lay on the deep furs at the foot of the couch chained by the ankle branded in earrings she looked up at me greetings slave i said greetings mistress she said bring wine said bosk of port kar to me i will be served by the slave yes master i said i fetched wine and placed it on the tiles within reach of the girl does she not even know how to kneel he asked quickly i instructed the girl in the position of the pleasure slave kneeling back on heels back straight head high hands on thighs knees wide what shall we call her he asked me whatever master wishes i said he saw the discarded collar inscribed i am judy return me to the lady elicia of ar of six towers he opened the collar he approached her perhaps said he we shall call you judy she shook with misery please she begged master flow offended and miserable she would be the proud former elicia nevins to be forced to wear my name i of whom she had been so contemptuous what think you asked the free man of me grinning i think master i said that the name is not truly fitting for this slave given her nature and appearance there is often a fittingness sought between name and slave it did seem to me that judy was not the proper name for the newly enslaved beauty who knelt before us it was not merely my desire that she not be given a name which i had formerly worn when free true said bosk of port kar commending me on my view of the matter the girl breathed more easily bring from my belongings the open slave collar there to be found said bosk of port kar to me yes master i said and hurried to comply from his belongings i fetched the collar he took the collar from me it was simple and steel straightforward and secure read it said he to her i am the slave elicia she read i belong to bosk of port kar she looked at him with horror she would wear her own name as a slave name submit he said she looked at me wildly piteously i aided her i showed her how to kneel back on her heels her arms extended to him wrists crossed her head down between her arms say i submit i said i submit she said he bound her wrists tightly before her body look up i told her she looked up he collared her i was very pleased to see her in the collar of bosk of port kar bosk then left the room i heard him too leave the outer room i heard him outside moving to the roof doubtless he a warrior was checking the avenue of his egress i did not know if the tarn would be waiting on the roof or would be summoned from the roof by tam whistle i looked at the new slave girl she knelt miserable collared branded her wrists bound before her body on the thick furs at the foot of the couch she looked at the surface of the couch she would not dare to ascend to it unless ordered there by a master her place unless commanded otherwise was at the foot of the couch at the slave ring i a slave had spent nights at that slave ring at the foot of my mistresss couch now she who had been elicia nevins of earth who had been my mistress knelt there no more than a lowly slave herself she looked at me disbelievingly we are both slave girls she said yes i said i have been branded she said my ears are pierced i wear a collar that is true elicia i said i had used her slave name she understood this i looked at her your collar is very becoming i said is it she asked yes i said it is a common collar she said it is still very beautiful on you i said truly she asked yes i said is it more beautiful because it is locked she asked yes i said i did not doubt but what that was true that the collar was locked did not simply mean that she could not remove it a fact which played its important role in guaranteeing slave recognition and identification but perhaps even more importantly was momentous in its significance of bondage a brand might be concealed by clothing even the brief garb commonly allotted a female slave but the collar consistently and openly proclaimed her girl property the collar stressing her vulnerability as a slave is sexually exciting to the girl who wears it and to the men who look upon it perhaps that is why free women do not wear collars the steel on her lovely throat lost beneath her hair glinting beneath it contrasting so with her delicious softness is sexually and aesthetically maddening no girl is so beautiful i suspect as she who wears a gorean slave collar elicia looked at herself in the mirror across the room she lifted her head and turned it to one side it is not unattractive she said no i said it is extremely exciting and attractive she looked at me frightened what will men think she asked that you are a slave i said i shrugged she shook with fear then again she regarded herself in the mirror turning is my brand pretty she asked why do you ask i asked i was only curious she said oh i said is it she asked you were a student of anthropology i said you can look upon the institution of slavery dispassionately and objectively as an interesting cultural phenomenon characterizing certain civilizations i am a slave she cried do you not understand what that means she struggled with the bonds on her wrists i understand very well what it means i assured her i thought of clitus vitellius where is your coolness i inquired where is your objectivity i am owned she said yes i said i did not know it could feel like this she said she looked at me wideeyed it is indescribable she said you are now experiencing a cultural institution from within i said so too one who is a master experiences it from within she shuddered as she thought how a master must look upon her with what desire and power in the past i said you have had some verbal acquaintance with cultural institutions now perhaps for the first time you have some inkling of what it is to understand one she looked at me with fear do not be afraid elicia i said you need only leam how to please men immensely i laughed i do not even like men she cried it does not matter i said the earrings are pretty i said she rose to her feet the chain on her ankle and fumed her head back and forth they are pretty she said yes i said i never wore earrings she said for they were too feminine you are very feminine elicia i said to her you should not have fought your femininity she looked angrily at me your days of fighting your femininity are at an end i told her men will not permit it they will force you to yield to your femininity to be feminine is to be less than a man she said whatever it is i said it is what you are is it what i am she asked yes i said judy she said i did not answer her mistress she begged yes i said is my brand pretty i laughed yes i said it is deep and clean and it marks you well the beast put the iron well to my body she said angrily i could also detect a bit of pride in her voice yes i said he did indeed i wonder if i am the first woman he has ever branded she said he is a warrior i said oh she said subdued then again she regarded the brand it is deep and clean she said and it marks my body well as that of a slave but mistress is it pretty is it attractive what do you think i asked she looked at me in anguish then she said i think it is beautiful i do too i said it is a perfectly beautiful brand many girls will envy you such a lovely brand she looked at me gratefully the brand with which she had been marked was the common slave brand for the gorean female incised deeply in her thigh about an inch and a half in height and a half inch in width was the initial letter in cursive script lovely of the expression kajira the most common expression in gorean for a female slave it was indeed a most beautiful brand more than half of the branded beauties of gor i conjecture wear that brand look into the mirror i said she did so what do you see i asked a slave she said she smiled shyly lowering her head it seemed an uncharacteristic gesture for she who had been elicia nevins i smiled but a slave who has much to learn i said she looked at me questioningly do you not hear the step of your master descending the stairs outside the compartments i asked she listened yes she said you will learn to listen for that step i told her she looked at me frightened is that how you will receive your master i asked standing like a free woman swiftly she knelt in the position of the pleasure slave i do not know how to please men she wept you will be taught i assured her lift your head a little higher she did so i looked upon her i do not know why it is but the condition of slavery makes a woman very beautiful it removes inhibitions to the manifestation of her femininity and her deepest needs bosk entered the room he stopped for a moment almost startled then grinned he saw a slave knelt at the foot of the couch all is in readiness he said to us i shall gag and saddlebind the slave at midnight he said looking at elicia then said he i will take flight from ar master must be wary of the patrols i said i have counted from the roof he said they are not randomizing their flights i see master i said bosk was thorough he left little to chance yet there would be risk yet i feared little for him i did not think i would care to pursue him on tarnback were i a mounted guardsman of ar he looked down at elicia she knelt in the position of the pleasure slave her wrists were bound before her body her left ankle was chained to the slave ring a lovely slave he said it is not yet midnight master she said he untied her wrists serve me wine slave he said i gasped she lifted the vessel of wine i had earlier brought and filled the goblet no i whispered to her and then instructed her how to serve him wine master she asked yes slave he said then she knelt before him back on her heels head down lifting the goblet to him proffering it to the master with both hands he took the goblet from her and regarding her drank i could see he was well pleased with his new acquisition the lovely beauty elicia bring a pan and pour wine into it said he to me and give it to the animal yes master i said i found a pan and poured wine into it shallowly and put it on the tiles before elicia who frightened putting her head down drank from it she lifted her head you have made me drink like a shesleen she said you are a slave he said yes master she said he was teaching her her slavery now said he you will serve me the second wine elicia turned to me frightened she knew the second wine which was commanded of her it was the wine of her slavery then she looked to bosk terrified i shall withdraw master i said i do not know how to please a man master said elicia i saw this did not please bosk i do not know how really master she wept forgive a slave please fetch the whip said bosk to me i went to fetch the whip i will try master cried elicia then she looked wildly at me please mistress she begged help me please help me mistress does a slave wish assistance i asked the slave elicia she said begs the aid of mistress i looked to bosk of port kar instruct her he smiled with the whip i touched her on the neck with the whip put your head down slave i said she did so although you are only a slave your master is permitting you to serve him i said this is a great honor she seemed startled then it became clear to her that this was for her a slave an honor you have a treasured opportunity i pointed out to serve the master yes mistress she said a man such as bosk of port kar i said has many women will he keep you for himself or will he throw you to his men or sell you or discard you she trembled if you are not pleasing i said you may be slain she shuddered i will try to be pleasing she stammered do you wish to serve your master i asked yes she said yes mistress i pointed to the feet of bosk hold his feet i said remove his sandals with your teeth she did so begin now i said to lick and kiss below the left shin she did so desire to please the master as a slave girl i said i do she suddenly said throatily i laughed and stepped back she seemed startled she looked up there were tears in her eyes no she said suddenly i did not mean that bosk laughed and slipped to the furs beside her and threw her on her back she looked up at him terrified i shall have her instructed in long lovings at my leisure said bosk to me obviously she is an ignorant slave elicia squirmed on the furs the earth girl in her suddenly fighting to retain her selfimage no she wept i am not a slave i am not a slave bosk kissed her on the throat and she closed her eyes i saw her small hands seize at him i am not a slave she said to him her eyes open sternly touch her laughed bosk to me feel the helpless oil and heat of her she cried out in misery naughty naughty elicia i laughed she looked at me in fury you are a slave elicia i laughed delightedly i was very pleased to have learned this she threw back her head wildly twisting it from side to side bosk had touched her i saw her eyes wild trying to retain the image of the earth girl then suddenly i saw that she was becoming sensuous uncontrollable appetitious she was fighting the gorean slave girl in herself in the arms of a man such as bosk of port kar i did not think her struggle would be successful he toyed with her resistance sometimes permitting it to become stronger sometimes even letting her think she might be able to withstand him but then again he would begin to induce in her subtly the surrender spasms of the female slave she well knew he was playing with her beast she wept how long will you sport with me many times he brought her to the verge of surrender teeth clenched eyes shut and then let her subside retaining yet to her cruel disappointment a shred of her earthgirl dignity i do not want to be a slave she would cry but i could see that her eyes and her body locked in his arms were begging him to complete her conquest how small she seemed in his arms you squirm as a slave girl elicia i observed no she would cry in her collar she tried to hold herself still rigid but when he chose could not do so at his least touch elicia i pointed out to her you leap as a slave no she would cry no but it was clear to me that she wanted him to make her a slave girl she wanted to be his slave girl i will show you she said to me how a woman can resist a man then he had rolled away from her turning his back to her i am weary he said i would sleep i suddenly saw to my amusement fear and keen disappointment registered on the countenance of the beautiful elicia master she said she turned to him she touched him on the shoulder please master she said what is it he asked elicia swallowed hard i was present please do not stop touching your slave master she said i laughed but elicia was not deterred why he asked because i am your slave she said acknowledging herself his i smiled gently but elicia did not notice i saw that she was truly his slave i felt great happiness for her does the slave elicia beg the touch of her master he asked the slave elicia she said piteously and humbly begs with all her heart the touch of her master bosk of port kar he rolled over and seized her you are a slave elicia i said to her yes she said i am a slave then she cried out to bosk of port kar the slave is yours take her master quietly i withdrew gently with his foot bosk of port kar awakened me i had lain asleep at the foot of the curule chair in the outer room it is nearly midnight he said to me i must be away yes master i said rubbing my eyes elicia knelt behind him her hands were tied behind her back he would take her to the roof and tie her over the saddle of his tarn carrying her away to port kar i looked at her her dark hair was loose about her shoulders i could see the gold of the earrings almost hidden in the hair the steel collar on her throat there is something vulnerable sensuous and soft about a female slave she was beautiful in her bondage may a slave speak she asked yes he said she looked up at him his slave i know she said that i am to be taken to port kar and will there be assiduously interrogated yes he said i will speak all i know she said that is true slave he said but then she begged what then when i am emptied of information and can be of no further use to you in your strategies what then will be done with me will i then be bound and thrown to the urts in your canals perhaps he said is there no hope for my life she asked yes he said you are beautiful he said to her in explanation i will try to be pleasing she said she pressed her lips to his thigh she had been well conquered i had little doubt the beautiful elicia even when rendered valueless in the conflicts of worlds would be kept for the pleasures of men again i looked upon her no longer was she a high agent of a mysterious power of interplanetary proportions she was now only a lovely bound gorean slave girl on your feet slave said bosk of port kar to elicia she rose lightly to her feet in his hand he had the gag he would fix upon her before taking her to the roof please master she begged a moment please master he stepped back elicia approached me her hands tied behind her the collar on her throat we are both now slaves she said judy yes i said elicia the college seems far away now she said yes i smiled i love you judy she said suddenly i love you too elicia i said i embraced her holding her her arms bound behind her we kissed i wish you well she said slave i wish you well too slave i said then from behind bosk of port kar thrust the wadding in her mouth and secured it in place she faced me gagged bosk of port kar then tied my wrists behind my back he then gagged me as he had elicia your throat he said is for the collar of another i could not question him for i had been gagged he then said to me kneel and i knelt cross your ankles he said i did so then with the loose end of the fiber which bound my wrists he tied my crossed ankles together fastening them thus to my wrists some six inches of strap separated my bound wrists and bound ankles he then not speaking further freed the door of its control chain slung his gear about his shoulder and taking elicia by the arm conducted her through the portal i heard them climbing the stairs to the roof i knelt alone on the tiles before the opened door it was after midnight i was a gagged and bound slave in time i heard steps approaching climbing stairs to the level of the compartments my heart leaped i knew the step clitus vitellius stepped into the threshold he looked at me troubled i wanted to cry out my love for him the helpless vulnerable love of a female slave he looked down at me angrily i did not understand his anger he untied my ankles and i lay before him on the tiles i wanted to tell him how much i loved him i could not do so i was gagged angrily he crouched down and by an ankle drew me to him half under him with his hands he thrust up the brief skirting i had been permitted as a female slave and ruthlessly used me i threw back my head reveling in his touch swiftly he finished with me and cutting a length from the loose end of the strap which bound my wrists rebound my ankles my wrists and ankles were no longer bound to one another i looked at him there were tears in my eyes i loved him i wanted to tell him of my love i wanted to tell him how much i loved him he did not remove the gag he did not permit me to speak he threw me to his shoulder and carried me from the compartments i kneel in the yellow circle i lay at his feet like a pet shesleen he clitus vitellius in his compartments sitting in a curule chair his hands were on the arms of the curved chair he stared moodily out the window at the towers of ar i rose to kneel before him master i said i did not think i could dissuade him i wore a brief street tunic his collar i put my head upon his knee i felt his hand in my hair there was a tear in my eye you trouble me he said i am sorry i said if i have displeased you i do not understand the feeling i have toward you he said he held my head between his hands and looked down at me you are a mere slave he said only your slave master i said he thrust me from him to the floor i looked up at him and you are of earth he said only a wench of earth collared and enslaved yes master i said softly he stood angrily he had in the past days treated me with great brutality i fear you he said suddenly i was startled i fear myself he said angrily i fear you and myself he said he glared down at me i shrank back from him for i was a slave you make me weak he said angrily i am a warrior of ar a slave laughs at her masters weakness i shouted angrily fetch the whip he cried in fury i ran to the whip and brought it to him kneeling before him thrusting it into his hands i looked up at him angrily his hand seized my tunic at the neck and shoulder and prepared to tear it from me that i might be hurled to the floor at his feet to be put writhing beneath the sharp discipline of his domination his hand was on my tunic the whip was uplifted then he released my tunic and threw the whip from him he held my head between his hands oh he said you are an interesting and clever slave that is one of the reasons you are so dangerous dina you are so clever so intelligent whip me i begged no he said angrily does master care for dina i asked how could i clitus vitellius a captain of ar care for a slave he demanded forgive a girl master i said should i free you he asked no master i said i could not then help myself i would oppose my will to yours i would strive against you do not fear he said to me i am clitus vitellius of ar i do not free slaves on the way to the curulean we stopped at the belled collar there clitus vitellius untied my hands that i might as though i were still a paga girl there serve him will you not force me to the alcove i asked him shesleen he smiled sipping his paga i saw slave beads serving men it was early afternoon i was quite good as a paga girl i said i do not doubt it he said various of the girls whom i remembered and slave beads in particular had with the permission of busebius the tavern master spoken with me and kissed me i think several of them envied me my master but i informed them that i was being taken to the curulean there to be sold do you need a slave girl master asked helen the earthgirl dancer at the belled collar she put out her hand timidly to touch his knee buy me she whispered i will serve you well he cuffed her sharply back bringing blood to her mouth she looked up frightened from the floor dance for us earth wench he said her accent had betrayed her yes master she said before the table to the music of some four musicians helen commanded danced before a gorean master there were tears in her eyes then he dismissed her and she fled away i was not displeased i saw bran loort entering the tavern with a basket of vegetables he saw me and looked away he went to the kitchens he did small work at the tavern where is marla master i asked i had regarded her as my greatest rival where clitus vitellius had been concerned i sold her to a slaver said he who specializes in the training of dancing girls i remembered marlas long dark hair her beautiful face her stunning figure she would look well belled in the dancing sand i thought she would be a marvelous dancer i gave eta said clitus vitellius to the guard mirus i am pleased master i said i remembered the young blond giant minis how he had put her on the coffle in tabuks ford i had seen they had been intensely attracted to one another now he owned her i thought eta would be extremely happy i was much pleased for her mirus i had thought had been the most attractive of the men of clitus vitellius saving himself of course slave beads as you know said clitus vitellius is now owned by busebius yes master i said lehna and donna and chanda said clitus vitellius i gave to two of my men lehna to one and donna and chanda to the other for good service in war i nodded it is not unusual among warriors to bestow beautiful slave girls as rewards for good service or valor slave girls make lovely gifts are we to leave soon for the curulean master i asked yes he said but first i am awaiting the arrival of a friend may i ask whom master i asked only if you wish to be whipped he said i was silent but you know him said clitus vitellius i looked at clitus vitellius curious but i did not ask i did not wish to be whipped certainly not before the other girls there are diverse philosophies of discipline some masters believe a girl should be whipped only privately others believe she should be whipped whenever and wherever she deserves it immediately while her offense such as it is is fresh in her mind clitus vitellius perhaps wisely believed it depended upon the girl and the context sometimes punishment is much more effective when a girl must wait for it generally a girl is not whipped before another girl who is owned by the same master they only know when the door is closed that their sister in bondage is to be whipped that is enough for them i had little doubt however that clitus vitellius in the present context would hesitate to whip in the belled collar itself he knew i would not care to be exposed and publicly put under the leather here where i had worked and certainly not before the girls i knew to be whipped with helen watching for example would be almost unspeakable agony i was very quiet soon i heard a roisterous peasant singing thurnus whatever might have been his virtues was not skilled in melody it is thurnus i laughed yes clitus vitellius do not give me to him again i begged do not fear little slave said clitus vitellius he leaped to his feet and he and thurnus who was carrying his great staff met embracing among the tables in moments they had come to our table thurnus was already drunk i thought it seemed strange to me that they had met here though i knew that they were friends thurnus clearly was in ar on some business greetings little dina he roared greetings master i said he looked powerful and hardy and was much pleased with himself i knew the drought had been broken the fields i suspected were doing well i wondered on what business it was that he had come to ar it was in the fall now i noted bran loort peering out from the kitchens but he then withdrew his face in misery he dared not be seen in this place performing the chores of a churl he had been of the peasants i recalled the dishonor and agony in which bran loort had been banished from tabuks ford rather than permit himself to be seen in tavern work by thurnus caste leader of tabuks ford i thought he might choose death i looked to slave beads she was busily engaged in serving thander of ti of the salerian confederation and four of his men when in ar negotiating commercial arrangements between ar and the confederation it seemed he regularly patronized the belled collar there was a girl there to whom he had taken a liking her name was slave beads sul paga cried thurnus pounding on the small table with his great staff be quiet said a fellow at a nearby table he was drinking with some five companions sul paga shouted thurnus pounding on the table be silent said some fellow at another table sul paga sul paga cried thurnus the great staff banged on the table busebius rushed to the table master said he we have many pagas those of ar and tyros and koroba and helmutsport and anango and tharna sul paga shouted thurnus several men about at various tables regarded him most unpleasantly i had worked in the belled collar and later in the chatka and curla in cos it did not require a great deal of experience to sense that thurnus must soon be quiet or there would be trouble the pagas mentioned by busebius were all of course satarna pagas of various sorts and localities varying largely in the blend sul paga demanded thurnus sul paga as anyone knew is seldom available outside of a peasant village where it is brewed sul paga would slow a tharlarion to stay on your feet after a mouthful of sul paga it is said one must be of the peasants and then for several generations and even then it is said it is difficult to manage there is a joke about the baby of a peasant father being born drunk nine months later sul paga shouted thurnus silence cried a brawny fellow some two tables away please master said busebius we do not have sul paga here thurnus rose to his feet his face a maze of conflicting emotions disbelief and incredulity chief among them sit down cried one critic eject him cried another no sul paga said thurnus no master said busebius then i shall sing said thurnus i thought this a splendid threat thurnus as good as his word broke into wondrous song at this point unable to help himself one of the fellows at another table leaped bodily upon thurnus and began to pummel him he was joined shortly in this endeavor by several others clitus vitellius to my surprise slipped to one side i crawled between the legs of fighting men i saw some two men fly off their feet held up toward the ceiling by thurnus their heads made a dull sound as they were struck together a slave girl screamed then i saw thurnus go down under a pile of attackers a blur brown and huge leaped past me i covered my head and backed away i saw bran loort seize a man by the collar and loft him into the air the fellow flying backward then falling crashing skidding across two tables i am done for cried thurnus from somewhere under the pile but i saw his hand reach out and seize a paga cup which he drained while men fought over him struggling to pound upon him largely striking one another do not fear caste leader cried bran loort he hurled another fellow away headfirst into a wall he seized two by the collars pounding their heads together i winced at the sound he spun another man about and the fellow had little time to register the large hamlike fist which rearranged his features i saw two teeth fly out of the mouth of the next man struck bran loort fought like a madman do not fear caste leader he cried i am here thurnus by this time had extricated himself from beneath the pile of bodies and stood to one side a goblet of paga in his hand he fights well said thurnus to clitus vitellius yes said clitus vitellius moving his head to one side to avoid a flying bottle then we saw bran loort backed against the wall with what must have been twenty angry men of ar encircling him he looked wildly about himself he saw thurnus there are only twenty called thurnus and you are of the peasants he flung his staff to bran loort who caught it out stabbed the staff a man screamed about swung the staff and men tried to struggle backward the staff whirled about almost invisible a branch lashed in a hurricane i saw teeth flying and blood and a jaw broken one man howled with misery a shin shattered more than one i think must have received a broken leg the staff punched out thrusting into another mans stomach it lashed to the side and i heard ribs crack men crept to the side to outflank the young peasant thurnus broke a table over the head of one busebius was weeping stop stop masters he cried then thurnus and bran loort were fighting back to back the goblet of thurnus left in the hands of clitus vitellius bran loort held the staff and behind him using half of the broken table thurnus protected him fending blows and thrusting out now and again with the shattered table at last he split the remainder of the table over the head of a brute who staggered back then thurnus and bran loort the wall at their back stood side by side i heard a sword leave its sheath then i heard six swords more leap from the sheaths i was frightened no said thandar of ti standing on a table he had drawn his own blade then so too one after the other did the four men with him all were of the warriors the men of ar looked angrily at thandar of ti and his men no said thandar of ti again the sword too of clitus vitellius my master the captain of ar had left its sheath he had placed thurnuss paga on a nearby table he stood between thumus and bran loort and the men threatening them i must agree with my fellow of the warriors said clitus vitellius it is not proper that you should attack with steel those who defend themselves with wood what he says is true said a man we are of ar he resheathed his blade free paga for all cried thandar of ti and i called clitus vitellius will fee the second round of cups cheers for the peasants cried a man with bloody face cheers for the peasants they cried then they surrounded thurnus and bran loort pounding them on the back i shall not sing promised thurnus bring paga cried busebius to the girls who had drawn back frightened with a scurrying flight of bells they hurried to their work and what are you doing here miserable bran loort demanded thurnus bran loort put down his head i have taken service here he said i am shamed that you should find me here rightfully so roared thurnus he had retrieved his goblet now handed to him by clitus vitellius and throwing his head back splashed its contents down his throat what are you doing here asked bran loort is it not time to harvest the satarna i thought you might have forgotten said thurnus no said bran loort thurnus regarded the young man it is certainly a great surprise to me he said to find you here but as it turned out it was fortunate i am pleased said bran loort if i could be of service an amazing coincidence marveled thurnus clitus vitellius smiled yes admitted bran loort puzzled more paga called thurnus a girl filled his cup swiftly again the contents vanished but what are you doing here asked bran loort suddenly shrewdly it is time to harvest the satarna i am looking for men he said to aid in the harvest i am strong said bran loort there were tears in his eyes good said thurnus bran loort embraced him weeping drink a cup of paga said thurnus then we must go the satarna grows impatient bran loort cried out with joy and whirled about arms uplifted like a child running and turning in the sun he seized a cup and tore a vessel of paga from a startled girl and filled it himself he threw his head back and drained the cup and flung it away he has much to learn said thurnus but someday he will be a caste leader he will have too his own home stone i am pleased said clitus vitellius to have been of service thurnus grasped his hand my thanks warrior said he bran loort looked at me i am so happy he cried you are so beautiful dina so beautiful i am pleased if master is pleased i said i was very happy for bran loort bran loort looked to clitus vitellius and the warrior smiled and lifted his hand oh i cried bran loort seized me by the hair which was now long enough to permit a master to grasp it come slave beauty he cried and bending me over my hands trying to grasp his wrist ran me stumbling to the nearest alcove he did not even draw the curtain i turned i shrank back my back against the rear wall of the alcove i drew up my legs how beautiful you are dina he cried how beautiful you are i nm so happy and you are so beautiful you are so beautiful remove quickly your garment he said happily or i will tear it from your body i undid the five buttons red which ran from the throat of the garment to the waist buttons interestingly were a relatively recent innovation in some gorean slavewear they are not used on the garments of free persons most gorean garments do not have buttons but are slipped on or held with brooches or pins hooks however are used with some frequency buttons interestingly are regarded as rather sensuous on gor buttons obviously may be unbuttoned or cut away with a knife thus revealing the slave many masters do not permit a girl to button her tunic in the privacy of their compartments when a slave opens the door of the masters compartment and kneels head down say to admit a visitor her garment may have been closed only an instant before this is also true of a hooked slave garment slaves too may be kept nude in the compartments these before answering the door will usually don a light tunic slipping it over their heads or wrapping it about their shoulders when one sees the slave one does not know if a moment before she has been beautifully naked in her slavery or if when the door closes she has again behind the door stripped herself for her masters pleasure i undid too the red repcloth sash of the tunic the buttons and sash on the tunic were red the tunic itself sleeveless was white i slipped the tunic over my head and hastily cast it aside i now faced bran loort clad only in the collar of my master and my brand you are beautiful dma he cried please do not hurt me i begged joyfully he seized my ankles and dragged me to him and then with a peasants roughness thrust them widely apart please master i begged i am so happy he cried and you dina pretty little slave are so beautiful oh i cried oh and i seized him i threw my head back i think that bran loort overcome in his joy had little time or patience for either his own pleasure or mine oh i cried then he was finished with me and i was shaking he covered me with kisses i am so happy he cried he then crouched beside me and kissed me again the satarna must be harvested he said yes master i said i wish you well dina he said i wish you well master i said he then leapt from the alcove to find thurnus they left the tavern together i was left lying on the furs after a few minutes i pulled my garment over my head buttoned it and retied the sash i went to kneel behind clitus vitellius he was drinking with thandar of ti and his four men they were being served by slave beads the salerian confederation clitus vitellius was saying is a threat to the security of ar correct said thandar of ti you seem distracted said clitus vitellius who apparently wished to discuss politics thandar of ti was watching slave beads who head down was pouring him drink a pretty little slave said clitus vitellius yes said thandar of ti he reached forth and gently touched slave beads about the throat as she poured the drink she blushed and trembled head down kneel before the table slave he said to her she did so putting the paga vessel to one side she knelt in the position of the pleasure slave she was briefly silked perfumed collared and belled i had learned earlier in speaking with the girls that thandar of ti when in ar came often to the belled collar i had little doubt that the small beauty slave beads was the reason do you think i should buy her asked thandar of ti of clitus vitellius as he regarded the lineaments and beauty of the girl slave beads shook with emotion she almost broke the position of the pleasure slave she is a beauty said clitus vitellius if she pleases you make an offer to busebius busebius called thandar of ti i thought slave beads might faint i have taken a fancy said thandar of ti to busebius who had hurried to the table to this little slut of a slave indicating slave beads i will give you a silver tarsk for her master is generous said busebius to offer so much for so miserable a girl then it is done asked thandar of ti five tarsks said busebius scoundrel said thandar of ti i will give you two now done laughed busebius he was pleased he had made a profit on slave beads whom he had had i understood for less than one silver tarsk in the market and had yet retained the good will of thandar of ti a valued customer slave beads slipped to the floor in a faint she was still unconscious when busebius removed his bells and collar and silk from her leaving her naked save for her brand lying on the tiles beside the table she had not yet regained consciousness when thandar of ti placed his slave bracelets on her braceleting her small wrists before her body in a few moments she regained consciousness opening her eyes discovering herself nude beside the table in his bracelets am i yours master she asked lifting her braceleted wrists to him yes slave he said she knelt before him reaching out to him weeping with joy she looked to me once that i might not reveal what had once been her identity she had once been the lady sabina of fortress of saphronicus the daughter of kleomenes of fortress of saphronicus promised in companion contract in a proposed political alliance intended to further the fortunes of fortress of saphronicus and the salerian confederation to the fifth son of the warrior ebullius gaius cassius the administrator of ti thandar of ti also of the warriors he rose to his feet she looked up at him thandar of ti her master regarded her she had once been promised to him in companion contract as a free companion now he had purchased her as a slave i love you master she said let us return to the inn said one of the men i think we have a slave here who is eager to serve her master rise slave said thandar of ti she did so standing before him her wrists braceleted before her body lovely he said thank you master she said he examined her thigh a fine brand he said he brushed back her hair and turned her head from side to side holding her chin in his hand pierced ears he said excellent he stepped back admiring her as superb slave flesh a good buy said one of his men yes he said he looked down into her eyes i think i shall call you sabina he said she started master she asked she looked at me but i was confused i had not spoken her secret to anyone is it not a lovely name for a slave he asked yes master she said it is a lovely name for a slave you little shesleen he laughed seizing her by the arms do you not think i know who you once were master she asked you were once sabina the daughter of kleomenes he laughed once promised to me in companion contract she looked at him wildly now of course you are only a slave he said yes master she said when the companionship was under consideration by the council of the confederation he said i slipped away on tarn to fortress of saphronicus i spied on you to see if you pleased me pleased she cried it is beneath the dignity of a free woman to please a man slave girls please men yes he said it must have been difficult she said for you to tell i clothed in the robes of concealment if i pleased you you recall your quarters he asked and the window high in the wall yes she said it may be reached by a rope from the roof he said she gasped you were quite beautiful in your bath he said she looked down confused blushing is a slave modest he asked no master she said then she looked up at him shyly did you find me pleasing truly she asked yes quite he said the girl marla too and the others he said were also quite beautiful yes she said my serving slaves were beautiful she looked up at him were they more beautiful than i she asked not to me he said i am pleased she said you can well understand my dilemma he said seeing you i wanted you you were one of those women who is so feminine and attractive that a man finds it difficult to think of you in terms other than jealous ownership i wanted to own you i wanted you at my feet naked in my collar yet you were intended to be my companion how could one relate to a girl as feminine and beautiful as you i ask you other than as a master to a slave i do not know she said besides he said you were only of the merchants it is unseemly for a warrior to take as a companion the daughter of a merchant i detest the politics which seemed to make such a match expedient surely i was not consulted in the negotiations no master she said nor was i she added pointing this out but you are a woman he said that is true she said the daughters of merchants he said are fit only to be the slaves of warriors oh master she asked archly yes he said evenly regarding her yes master she said dropping her eyes besides he said you free were an arrogant shesleen you needed enslaving collaring and whipping yes master she said frightened i resolved to refuse the companionship said thandar of ti i resolved to flee the city he grinned as it turned out he said that was not necessary how did master find me she asked there is a fellowship among warriors he said clitus vitellius smiled thank you master said slave beads now sabina to clitus vitellius he nodded accepting her thanks sabina the slave turned again to face thandar of ti looking up at him you have found me she said you own me there were tears in her eyes i had hoped she said that my identity might have remained unknown to you why he asked puzzled she looked down confused she shook her head why he asked must i speak she asked you are a slave he said angrily speak she looked up at him boldly tears in her eyes because she said i wanted you to keep me as a slave she looked down again confused i sense she said that you are my true master and i am your true slave the men looked at one another cognizing well the confession of the small beautiful slave too she said i did not wish my fate known to dishonor you that the flank of a merchants daughter has met the iron cannot dishonor me said thandar of ti i see that it cannot she said a bit angrily but it was true what is it on gor that a girl is caught and branded and made a slave but now in honor knowing my fate she said you must free me oh he said yes she said you will now free me and once again the plans of fortress of saphronicus and the salerian confederation will proceed as before i freed will be repledged to you in companionship matters then regardless of our wishes will be as they were before thandar of ti laughed clitus vitellius smiled master she asked how beautiful she looked naked before him in his bracelets a fine brand said thandar of ti surveying her thigh now that you know who i am she said you must free me he turned her head from side to side and pierced ears he said surely you are going to free me she said you are the daughter of a merchant he said the daughters of merchants are fit only to be the slaves of warriors you are going to free me she cried kneel to be collared he said master she cried bring a whip he said to one of his men swiftly she knelt the whip would not be necessary sabina the slave looked up at thandar of ti astonishment in her eyes and wonder and love she knew then the nature of the man and his strength who owned her bring the collar said thandar of ti to one of his men the collar from his belongings was brought i have found a slave who pleases me he said i am collaring her he cared naught for the politics of cities nor did he fear the wrath of states he was a warrior he stepped behind the girl and in the manner of ti and certain other cities thrust down her head and held ready the opened collar submit he said i submit myself totally master she said roughly he shut the collar enclosing her lovely throat in the obdurate band of slave steel he then with his foot spurned her to the floor throw me among your women master she begged i shall he said he then turned away and strode from the tavern but i had little doubt the lovely sabina would be his preferred slave one of thandar of tis men sought out busebius and made settlement of the bill he is keeping me as a slave said sabina to me elatedly how strong and marvelous he is i fear only i will not be able to love him enough i kissed her it is difficult for a girl not to esteem a man who does as he pleases even though it is to her that it be done a woman admires strength especially if it is used to dominate and control her it is it seems for men to command and women to obey for men to dominate and women to submit for men to claim and for women to yield it is it seems the way of primate nature its test is enactment its proof is joy its evidence is love if we have lost this we have lost part of ourselves i wish you well cried sabina i wish you all well i wish you well i cried the others too paga girls in the tavern wished her well thandar of tis men went to the portal of the tavern one of them turned about will it be necessary to leash you slave he asked no master cried sabina and hurried to follow them we watched them leave the tavern it is time said clitus vitellius for us to he on our way to the curulean i reached out timidly to touch him please master i begged he looked at me almost tenderly i thought him sad very well he said he indicated that i should precede him to one of the alcoves i entered the alcove and slipped away the street tunic he closed the curtain behind us many times i said lightly i pleased the customers of busebius in this very alcove he took me in his arms it startled me for he touched me gently i shall miss you dina he said there are many girls i said yes he said there are many girls you will soon forget me i said he brushed my hair with his hand your hair he said will be too short i wager until the spring doubtless i said it will lower my price he kissed me will you come to see me in the exhibition cages i asked in most markets girls are displayed publicly in exhibition cages prior to their sale this is almost always the case in the curulean no he said oh i said he kissed me again softly tenderly keep me i begged suddenly no he said i tried not to cry it is strange he said i have faced wild sleen and the steel of fierce enemies i am a warrior and am high among warriors yet you a mere girl would conquer me with a smile and a tear no master i said surely you must understand he said a slave girl requires no explanation i said it is hers only to obey you see he said angrily you make me weak then conquer me i said you are different from all the others he said angrily yet i am only a slave i said treat me as such you should be tied at the slave ring and whipped he said tie me at the ring i said whip me a warrior he said must be hard and fierce be hard and fierce with me i said you want to be conquered and enslaved dont you you slut he said yes i said i am a woman he sat up beside me how you must despise my weakness he said yes i said angrily i despise your weakness he looked at me in fury i love you i said he slapped aside my head bringing blood to my mouth lying slave he said then he seized me and well vented his anger upon me i was well used when he had finished with me he said get up we must go to the curulean i slipped the tunic on and sashed it and one by one by the five buttons closed it i wished he had torn it open and would march me through the streets as an exposed slave that other girls might see the strength of the man who owned me we left the tavern and made our way to the curulean to a back entrance i looked at the stout iron door behind which i would be sold we must enter he said to me do with me what you want i said to him i am he said are you i asked yes he said i looked up at him i am a warrior he said i cannot be weak you are weak now i said no he said i despise your weakness i said how am i weak he asked you do not want to sell me i said yet you are doing so i do want to sell you he said look at me i said he regarded me what do you see i asked a slave girl he said what now i asked do you truly want to do with me sell you he said no i said you want me in your compartments you want me at your feet you want me in your collar you want not to sell me but to master me to own me i want many things from you he said then command them take them i challenged did you trace me to ar and follow me to cos to sell me he looked angry no i said you wanted me slave naked on your chain yes he said angrily i wanted you a naked slave on my chain mine strip me i cried chain me no he said i subsided sell me i said wearily the decision is yours i am slave he pounded on the iron door i had thought clitus vitellius strong i said i had thought him of the warriors i had thought he had the power to do as he wills with a woman i see now he is too weak to do with a woman what truly he wants what pleases him he struck again on the iron door he is weak i said a slave despises him do not make me angry he said i looked away i had nothing to fear from him i heard feet approaching the iron door from the other side a small lateral panel in the door about eye level slid back your business inquired a voice the vending of a girl said clitus vitellius the panel slid shut a moment later the door swung open enter master said a man we entered and found a large room floored with cement a yellow circle in outline narrowbordered the border some six inches in width the circle itself some ten feet in width was painted on the cement a man at a small fourlegged table sat to one side remove her tunic and collar he said clitus vitellius did so we did not speak kneel in the circle slave said the man at the table the fellow who had opened the door stood to one side a coiled rawhide rope on a clip hung from his belt i went to the circle and knelt in its center on the cement the man with the rope entered the circle and loosed the rope from his belt he tied it about my neck the knot was at the side under my left ear he backed away giving me some five feet of slackthe remainder of the rope he held in long loose loops in his right hand i knew it would serve to whip me if necessary i would be put through slave paces give me whatever you think she is worth he said and send the coins to the compartments of clitus vitellius in the towers of warriors yes master said the man at the table clitus vitellius turned about and left the curulean i knelt alone in the yellow circle on the cement i felt the rope on my throat pull taut i sensed the swinging loops of leather near me the man rose from behind the table and came to the circle he looked down at me well now little beauty he said let us see what you can do yes master i said what occurred at the curulean the first time that one is sold it is the hardest yet it is i suppose never easy the hardest part is perhaps not knowing who it is among those many faces in the darkness who will buy you you are illuminated exhibited forced to perform at your side is the auctioneer with his whip you perform and perform well do not think you would not you feel the wood of the block with your feet and the sawdust upon it the block itself is smooth many girls have been sold here before you are not special you are only another slave a bit more or less pleasing than others you feel the sawdust with your feet on gor animals are commonly sold on blocks which are strewn with sawdust the slave girl is an animal you lift your head under the torchlight you hear the first bid it is hard not to tremble you have been bid upon from the voice you try to guess the nature of the master then there is another bid you smile you turn you walk you lift your arms you kneel you lie upon your back at the auctioneers feet your knee lifted your arms over your head as though braceleted you roll to your stomach you look up at him over your shoulder you respond to him instantly setting forth for the view of the buyers subtle and provocative positions and attitudes displaying yourself as you must fully and as a slave you are sweating sawdust clings to your body it clings in your hair if you falter or are in the least displeasing the auctioneers whip will sharply instruct you in your error at last breathing heavily you stand there naked perhaps you have been struck the last bid is taken it is accepted the auctioneers fist closes you have been sold many girls dream of being sold in the curulean its great block is perhaps the most famous in ar it is also the largest it is semicircular and some forty feet in width it is painted for the most part in blue and yellow the colors of the slavers and ornately carved with many intricate patterns and projections it is perhaps fifteen feet high an interesting feature of the block is that about it on the semicircular side facing the crowd tall and serene carved in whitepainted wood evenly spaced are the figures of nine slave girls they represent supposedly the first nine girls taken thousands of years ago by the men of a small village called ar in the carving it may be seen that the throats of the girls are encircled by ropelike collars presumably woven of some vegetable substance it is said that at that time the men of ar were not familiar with the working of iron it is also said the girls were forced to breed mighty sons for their captors you slave said the man yes master i said looking up in the collar with its two chains one on each side which fastened me to the girl on my left and right we were in the tunnel leading to the block another tunnel left the block are you familiar with the choreography of your display he asked yes master i said i had been well rehearsed little occurs by accident on the block of the curulean he then went to the next girl she on my right farther down the tunnel toward the pens he addressed to her the same question she too wore a collar with two chains it fastened her on her left to me and on her right to another girl yes master she assured him he then went to the next girl in the line farthest from the block each collar opens and the chains may be attached or removed this provides great flexibility there were one hundred and twenty girls in the line it would take some five or six ahn to sell us if the bidding was brisk on a slow night it could take as much as eight ahn the sales extending into the early morning hours some girls sell quickly and others slowly when it takes longer to sell a girl it usually means that she is less interesting to the buyers and that the bids are slow or that she an unusual beauty is being more elaborately displayed with the object in mind of intensifying and driving up the eventual bids yes master said the girl some two girls below me on the chain responding to the question of the slavers man we would all be ready we would all do our best or be punished terribly i looked to the girl on my left and to the one on my right how beautiful they were we had all had gorean slave cosmetics applied to us let the men beware we had all been exposed in the exhibition cages earlier stark save for perfume it was at that time that the buyers had had their opportunity to view us objectively it was their responsibility now in the bidding to be on their guard i sensed a tremor sudden subtle in the chain i leaned forward looking down the line the whisper was sped rapidly down the chain the bidding has begun said the whisper im frightened said a girl all ar bids at the curulean said another i could hear nothing but i knew the first girl had now ascended the block i sat back on the long wooden bench it was some eight inches in width it was set against the side of the tunnel it ran almost the length of the tunnel i pulled the wide bands of green silk about me more closely they would resemble initially a gown but they were not truly a gown they would be unlooped and lifted away bit by bit beginning about the head and the feet gradually cunningly revealing me toward the end i would be spun almost free of them and then in the end i would be ordered exposed save for the final silk concealing my breasts and thighs to lie supine at the auctioneers feet he would then stand over me the two bands extending from me ribbonlike in his grasp taking more bids when the crowd fierce in its impatience demanded it he would shrugging roll me free of them in two turns i finishing lying on my back again knee lifted hands over and behind my head the backs of my hands on the block the palms exposed like the rest of me helplessly i would lie there a resigned slave girl awaiting her rapetaming presumably the bids then would much increase i was to follow the commands of the auctioneer from that point presumably he would order me to my feet and sensing the crowd playing it with skill put me through what slave paces seemed suitable move down one space said the slavers man we did so the girl to my left wore a demure brief house tunic of the sort worn by a house slave she would be presented to the crowd as though since childhood she had been owned by a quiet respectable family which lately because of financial difficulties had been forced to sell her she would be reputed to know little of the lust of men or the duties of a pleasure slave still it would be suggested a master might teach her this story was not entirely a fabrication it would not be said however that she was an appetitious girl who had welcomed her sale or that she hungered for a man she hoped to be bought by a man of modest means she wanted to be the only girl in his compartments i thought she would make a wonderful slave the girl on my right who would be sold after me would be presented quite differently she was clad in a bit of virginal white fluff from her shoulders to thighs the contrast between her dark hair and her naked arms and legs and the bit of white fluff about her was quite striking she had lovely slender shoulders and wellcurved slender trim legs i thought she would bring a high price she was the one who had said i am frightened i did not blame her first she was a virgin secondly it would terrify almost any lovely girl to be presented in such a costume before gorean men we moved down another place on the bench the sales go rapidly said a girl farther down to my right that was a good sign for one thing it meant that the auctioneer would be in a good humor and that thus he would probably be less cruel with us on the block we fear the auctioneer on the block he is our master even when a girl is not sold if the sales have gone well she is less likely to be whipped move said the slavers man we moved again most girls are sold singly but sometimes they are sold in groups in matched pairs or larger sets usually with a theme such as blond hair or a given dialect sets may also he composed of girls once of complementary castes or those marked with diverse representative brands when a girl is enslaved she loses caste of course as well as citizenship rights and personhood when she is enslaved she becomes an animal subject to the whips and wills of masters most groups however are sold for field and kitchen work the curulean did not handle such latter groups we did have two pairs to be sold tonight one consisting of a singer and her lyre player and another of identical twins from the island of tabor named for its resemblance to the small gorean drum of that name i could not yet hear the calls of the auctioneer the occasional response of the crowd however carried through the tunnel the girl on my right the slender virginal girl in fluff began to cry instantly the slavers man was upon her lifting his whip she shrank back against the cement wall she must not stain or smear her makeup angrily with a small cloth he dabbed her face save your tears for the block sleek little animal he said yes master she said i was girl on the chain it was a good position the sales begin in the early evening and usually unless there is something special for sale they begin a bit slowly men are commonly still entering the market at that point often the seats are not entirely filled until the second ahn of the sale i was a bit puzzled about the apparent speed of the sales there was as far as i knew nothing special for sale this evening it was as far as i knew a normal night at the market at any rate usually it is not regarded as desirable to be among the first twenty girls on the chain sometimes these are sold to an almost halfempty house a reciprocity tends to become involved the slavers tend to put their least valuable girls up first because of the smallness of the house in the early market and many men tend to come later because normally the least interesting girls are put up first this often presents a merchandising dilemma but it was not one which hurt the slavers of the curulean very much for their merchandise tends to be generally of high quality and the reputation of their house is such that even in the early hours of the market they tend to have a sizable number of bidders on hand sometimes an extraordinary girl or girls are marketed almost immediately to encourage buyers to come early although this does tend to bring in larger early crowds the slavers feel that often they do not get on these girls what they might have had their sale taken place later in the evening in the heat and press of more determined bidding at any rate from the girls point of view any chain position after forty and before one hundred would be good the ideal of course is to be sold at the height of the sale with one hundred and twenty girls the most serious bidding would presumably come somewhere between girl and girl late in the sale of course it is not uncommon for buyers to be weary and to begin to drift away these remarks incidentally pertain to a normal long sale usually held four times a week at a large house they are not meant to apply to special sales private sales and inhouse sales sometimes special sales wellpublicized are held in which as few as fifteen or twenty girls of great quality or interest are sold all ar it is said tries to fill the house upon such occasions if a ubara of a conquered city for example were to be sold it would customarily be in such a special sale unless the victorious ubar he who had conquered her city and captured her chose to have her sold for his amusement in a common sale and from an unimportant block normally of course the conquering ubar would keep such a regal wench now collared and debased to slavery in his own pleasure gardens as a delicious memento of his victory and as a woman stand said the slavers man my group stood move to the next position he said we hurried to the next position we were now coffled in groups of ten early in the sale for the first twenty girls the chain had been intact one chain for us all with each sale we had moved one position each time we had moved one or two positions on the bench we knew that one or two of our sisters had been sold the psychological effect of this methodical and relentless tends to produce anticipation and anxiety even in an experienced girl no girl ever grows completely used to being exhibited and sold then after the first twenty girls when our nerves were keen and taut we were separated into coffles of ten we might then seem to relax but when our nerves had eased and we might seem to breathe a bit more easily the coffle as a whole would be ordered to its feet and moved ten spaces toward the end of the tunnel the effect of this being for a time relatively at ease and then being forced suddenly to move ten times closer to the block tends suddenly to whet ones fears and anticipations anew when one psychologically in spite of herself had begun to feel a little safe one is suddenly hurried even closer to her exhibition and sale and all it means the uncertainty the danger the not knowing the being sold the being owned anew by someone who can do with you what he pleases i could now hear the calls of the auctioneer quite clearly i could hear individuals too in the crowd a vendor was hawking sherbets i was now in the point coffle that at the end of the tunnel the sales were doing well the girl to my left she in the house tunic sat tense beside me her fingernails dug into the wood of the bench her makeup was inspected and touched up then she was removed from the coffle the collar and the length of chain on her right attaching her to me placed to one side a man stood near the end of the tunnel with a tablet and marking stick he indicated that she should approach him she did he inspected her chain number used in the curulean as a sales number which tiny was written under her left ear in lipstick the curulean does not use sales collars she was girl i heard a roar of approval and i knew the girl on the block had been sold another girl girl had been waiting at the foot of the block a man with a whip prodded her to climb to its height she moved carefully feeling the stairs creeping upward she wore a slave scarf as a blindfold it was all she wore the man with the tablet quickly thrust the girl in the house tunic from the tunnel to the foot of the stairs leading to the block look at me said a man i sat very still looking at him he examined my makeup deftly he improved it you are beautiful he said thank you master i whispered another man removed my collar with the chain that fastened me to the girl on my right the virginal girl in a bit of white fluff the man with the tablet indicated that i should stand near him and i did from where i stood at the end of the tunnel i could see the ceiling of the curulean and some of the buyers crowded in the higher tiers their excitement frightened me the sales were going too well the crowd roared the girl on the block naked was being forced to perform blindfolded before the men she screamed with misery when the blindfold was removed looking out upon buyers she was soon sold the girl in the house tunic was hurried to the height of the block what have we here cried the auctioneer surely there is some mistake this is only a meaningless little house slave the crowd roared with laughter the man with the tablet listened intently he did not order me immediately to the foot of the stairs those leading to the surface of the great block at the curulean he glanced back at the slender frightened girl in the bit of white fluff still in chain and collar on the bench she looked away from him frightened looking straight ahead i wished my hair was longer i listened to the sale of the girl in the house tunic it would soon be torn from her number said the man with the tablet to me i turned and put my head to the side that he might read the tiny number printed in lipstick beneath my left ear ninetyone he said he jotted it down on the sales sheets i heard the tunic torn from the girl on the block the roar of the crowd she was now being exhibited naked the man with the tablet thrust me toward the foot of the block and i stumbled to the place at the foot of its stairs i stood that i not disarrange the bands of silk so cunningly looped about me the man with the tablet had apparently decided not to alter the order of sales i think this was wise on his part the girl in the house tunic seemingly not yet broken in not yet humbled and trained to the collar of pleasure might have whetted the appetite of the buyers for an even more virginal innocent form of merchandise but on the block as i gathered from the remarks of the auctioneer and the responses of the crowd there was now little illusion left lingering of her formality or restraint or reluctance only too clearly she starved for male domination was she eager and ready for the slave ring at the foot of a mans couch then she was sold i climbed to the height of the block the block was very large i had not realized how many were in the crowd the crowd was silent this frightened me the auctioneer seemed puzzled too but only momentarily someone it seems he said has sent us a gift he indicated me with the whip its contours he said suggest that it is lovely he looked out to the crowd shall we see he asked but the crowd instead of urging him on was quiet his hand shook for a moment i was frightened i did not understand the mood of the crowd let us see he continued with feigned humor he lifted away loops of silk which concealed my head there was a murmur of admiration from the crowd i was too vain not to have been pleased a lovely face he said feminine soft vulnerable expressive it would be easy to read in order to control her he shrugged the hair of course said he is far too short but i am assured by officers of the curulean that it will grow there was no laughter from the crowd the auctioneers hand trembled he was nervous i thrust my right leg forward lifting it pointing the toes touching only the toes of my right foot to the floor my left hip was turned out i lifted and extended my left arm wrist bent palm to the left gracefully then did he unloop bit by bit the silk from my left arm a lovely limb he said the crowd seemed quiet intense watchful the auctioneer was clearly disturbed let us see if there is more of interest here he said i heard an intake of breath from the crowd but there were no bids we did not complete the choreography which had been planned much depends upon the crowd it interacts in the drama of the block in a way that it or many of its members fails to understand the auctioneer puzzled finally removed from my person the bands of silk he did not spin me from them he did not roll me from them at his feet this is the woman he said what am i bid there was no bid look cried a voice the crowd turned and i and the auctioneer looked as well at the height of the center aisle high framed in the portal of the market hail stood a warrior in full panoply of war he did not speak he carried shield and spear on his left shoulder hung the scabbard of the short sword he was helmeted master inquired the auctioneer his voice faltered the warrior did not speak the auctioneer indicated me taking his attention from the figure who had recently entered the hail this is the woman he said weakly what am i bid at this point the helmeted warrior began to descend the aisle we watched him approach in moments he stood too on the block facing the crowd he struck the butt of his great spear on the heavy wood kajira canjellne he said slave girl challenge he turned to look at me and i knelt i could not speak i feared i might faint he turned again to face the crowd i will have this woman he said for her i will stand against all ar and all the world i love you clitus vitellius i cried tears in my eyes you were not given permission to speak cried the auctioneer he lifted his whip to strike me but the point of the spear of clitus vitellius lay at his throat do not strike her said clitus vitellius yes master said the auctioneer whitefaced lowering his arm frightened hacking away clitus vitellius turned again to face the crowd of ar kajira canjellne he said slave girl challenge there was no response from the crowd then one man rose to his feet striking his left shoulder and then another rose to his feet and did the same and another and another soon the crowd was on its feet cheering and striking their left shoulders clitus vitellius stood straight on that great platform his great circular shield on his left arm his mighty spear seven feet in length headed in tapering bronze grasped in his right hand his head was high his eyes were shrewd and clear those of a warrior she is yours master said the auctioneer to clitus vitellius i knelt at his feet joyfully he would now free me and take me as his companion he put aside his shield and spear to lift me to my feet as his equal your whip said clitus vitellius to the auctioneer you did not wish her whipped he said she is mine to whip said clitus vitellius the auctioneer placed his whip in the hands of clitus vitellius master i said yes he said are you not going to free me i asked only a fool he said frees a slave girl master i cried kneel to the whip he said i obeyed i put my head down and beneath my body crossed my wrists as though they were bound my back was bowed ready for whatever punishment he might see fit to administer to me i was in consternation i trembled could i be still a slave girl could he be serious was it his intention to keep me still as a slave surely not surely not i would not wish you to take a loss on her he was saying to the auctioneer here is something which may cover the cost of the miserable little slave i heard a pouch heavy filled with metal strike heavily on the smoothed beams of the surface of the block the gratitude of the house master cried the auctioneer he untied the strings of the pouch and crying out with pleasure spilled coins of gold to the woods swiftly he sorted the coins expertly there are a hundred tarn disks of gold here he cried the crowd roared its approval i cried tears falling to the wood of the block mixing in the sawdust it was ten to a hundred times or more what i was worth i saw then the extent of the regard of clitus vitellius for me i wept with joy i had not known that a man could desire a woman so much yet he kept me as a slave perhaps it is only a slave who can be so bought and sold and so desired oh the indescribable incredible feeling of being owned literally owned by a man i knelt a slave ready for punishment master is far too generous said the auctioneer this is far more than the slave is worth you are right said clitus vitellius i shook with fury but did not break the position give me the next then too on your chain he said no i cried he turned to face me and again i swiftly lowered my head could he truly mean to keep me as a slave could he truly be that strong i could not believe it gladly cried the auctioneer ninetytwo he cried the virginal girl slender sweetly shouldered lovely legged terrified crept to the surface of the block the bit of fluff clung about her it did not much conceal her her legs were well exposed to the inspection of masters and the sweetness of her breasts was evident it but scarcely concealed in the wafting of insinuative tantalizing fluff the crowd roared its approval and she shrank back on the block i wondered what men saw in her she was herself only a bit of fluff to rape and serve come here said clitus vitellius to the girl swiftly she fled to him to stand before him position he snapped she dropped to her knees before him in the position of the pleasure slave get your back straighter he said she did so he crouched beside her and with his belt knife cut away the strings which held the fluff about her it floated to the surface of the block stirring in the slight movements of air he regarded the girl he then looked too to me i will take both he said master i cried in protest then he stood over me with the whip i looked up into his eyes then i was frightened i saw that he was a gorean master however much he might hold me in regard however much he might desire me i saw that i could be to him only a helpless slave girl whatever might be his feelings for me i saw that he would have me only at his feet as a slave i would be uncompromisingly owned he would have all fully from me i would not be permitted to hold anything back ever he would be master and i slave no longer did i dare to suggest that i might be freed no longer did i dare to think it he was gorean i put my head down kneeling to the whip forgive me master i whispered once this evening said he you a slave addressed me by my name rather than as master forgive me master i said i trembled i recalled i had cried out i love you clitus vitellius how foolish i had been it was a girls mistake it would not go unnoticed too he said more than once this evening you have spoken without permission yes master i said too said he i think you dared to protest this evening my purchase of a girl i had indeed done so do you oppose your will to mine or question my will in the least he asked no master i said do you think me an easy master he asked no master i said do you beg now to be punished he asked yes master i said i beg to be punished i saw him grip the slave whip on the long handle with two hands i put down my head further i shut my eyes i tightened my body i clenched my fists held crossed as though bound beneath my body i determined to hold position i heard the swift sound of the leather in flight never had i heard it approach so swiftly after the fourth blow i could no longer hold position tie me at the slave ring i begged put me at a post master i lay on the block on my stomach my hands over my bead there was sawdust on my lips and face i could not after the second blow scream yet he struck me only ten times i cried lying on the block punished i felt him thrust a steel collar about my throat and lock it i was collared he had not been angry with me he had only been punishing me i had deserved a whipping he had given it to me yet it is hard for a girl to grow used to the leather one can be a slave for years and still fear it the gorean master uses it unhesitantly if we are not pleasing we know that he will do so we are pleasing clitus vitellius had turned to the slender virginal girl do you wish to be in the least troublesome he asked her lifting the whip laughing no master she cried he collared her as he had done me we both wore his collar he knelt us together i submit fully master i said i submit fully master said the virginal girl quickly following my example the slave whip lay to one side we have surely delayed the sales of the curulean too long said clitus vitellius to the auctioneer the auctioneer bowed the pouch of gold in his hand come slaves said clitus vitellius to the two of us naked in his collar he lifted his shield and took up his spear and then descended the steps of the great block we followed him he ascended the long aisle leading from the hall men cried out his name and cheered and smote their left shoulders as he passed them he strode as a warrior we hurried after him his slave girls will he march us through the streets naked asked the virginal girl he will do with us as he pleases i told her he is a warrior a warriors vengeance the furs of my master we were but four bridges from the towers of the warriors when clitus vitellius turned suddenly regarding me i stopped suddenly naked behind him where i was heeling him the virginal girl too stopped suddenly but he did not look at her he approached me he stood before me his shield on his left arm the mighty spear grasped in his right hand immediately i trembled and knelt head down oh cried the virginal girl he placing the spear and shield to one side had moved to her and was tying her hands behind her back he fastened her by the wrists to a ring at the foot of the four lamps bridge such rings are common in gorean cities in public places and serve the convenience of masters in tethering their slaves the ring was mounted on a post about a yard high she stood at the post naked tethered there her hands fastened behind her back at the foot of the four lamps bridge i could see the lights of glorious ar the light of one lamp was upon her she was very beautiful master she begged he took a blunt marking stick from his pouch and wrote gorean words on her left shoulder he then to her amazement and mine removed his collar from her throat master she sobbed he replaced the collar and marking stick in his pouch can you read he asked her yes she said read then what i have inscribed upon your body said he i cannot well see it master she said but from the feel of it in my flesh i know what you have written speak it aloud said he slave you have written collar me own me she said yes he said you are leaving me here for the first stranger who passes master she asked do you object slave he asked no master she said drawing back the point of the spear which clitus vitellius had now retrieved was at her throat i then felt the point of the spear in my back on your feet slave he said swiftly i rose to my feet he then strode past me and began the crossing of the bridge of four lamps i hastened to follow him heeling him obediently i did turn on the crest of the bridge to look back at the tethered girl the area at the foot of the bridge was deserted it was late she seemed very much alone there naked the light of the lamp on her tethered waiting for the first individual who might chance by i turned away hurrying to follow clitus vitellius i remembered the look he had given me when first moments ago he had stopped and turned and approached me never had i seen such lust possessiveness and desire in a mans eyes i felt weak i wondered about the service of how many girls i would have to render to him he had cast aside the virginal girl arrogantly in a warriors gesture leaving her for whomsoever might find and desire her her slave service and mine and more he would now want from me i did not know if i could be so much a slave to him we were but a short way from the towers of warriors on the second of its approaching high bridges when again clitus vitellius turned and faced me i cannot wait he said to me yes master i said we were on a high bridge one of the highest in all ar the lights of the city were strewn beneath us above us burned the stars of gor he placed his shield upon the bridge straps down its convex surface like a bow facing the stars he indicated that i should take my position upon it and i did so my head down with the straps brought about the sides of the great shield he fastened my wrists apart one on each side about at shoulder level at the edges of the shield i lay over the shield bound upon it now i have you where i want you dina said he earth girl yes master i said swiftly he took me in his arms i yielded immediately to my master i love you master i said to him his hands were upon my shoulders he dragged me upward to his pressing mouth pulling me against the wrist straps which held my wrists at the shields edges i thought he might tear me from the shield then he flung me back arched across its surface i felt his lips at my belly and thighs i could not protect myself from the fierce ardor to which i must submit then again i cried out lost in my slaves love of him my master he unbound my wrists from the shield he thrust me from its surface i rolled to my side on the bridge i lay quietly on the bridge in his collar it is getting late he said i must get you to the love furs yes master i said get up he said he moved his foot against my body i tried to get up but could scarcely stand i sank to my hands and knees he laughed at me i sank to my side i lifted my hand to him get up earth girl he said i will try master i said but again i fell to my knees do not beat me master i begged you have made me so weak i can smell your weakness he said yes master i said i was so overcome by my love for him that i could not stand i had never known such weakness i felt i had the strength only to lie vulnerably before him perhaps holding and kissing him awaiting him it is i suppose one of natures utilities reducing the females effectiveness in selfdefense or flight putting her all the more at the mercy of the stronger beast i cannot walk master i said let me crawl to your furs he slung his shield upon his back and tied his spear too beneath the shields edge upon his back i felt myself lifted gently into his arms he carried me my head against his left shoulder over the bridge and toward the second bridge leading to the towers of the warriors i served him wine i was the only girl in his compartments i well understood the meaning of this he had chosen the perfection of one man the complete master and one woman the total slave it is called the perfect bondage each all and perfect to the other it is right for some men and not for others much depends on whether the man has met his perfect slave and the woman her perfect master clitus vitellius and i though i would not have dared tell him were so related i think he too knew this when i had served him wine he gave me too to drink of the cup this was in its way a great honor and a token of his recognition as to how i stood to him i still of course did not dare to drink from the same edge of the cup as he the master i put the cup aside at his indication i spread the love furs i did not spread them upon the couch hut at its foot i was slave only a small lamp burned in the compartment at a gesture from clitus vitellius i reclined upon the furs at the foot of the couch he slipped away his tunic and crouched beside me i could see he could scarcely restrain himself from seizing me im yours i told him i lifted my arms to him take me master i said i care for you he said i regarded him be strong with me master i whispered i do not want to challenge you i do not want to fight you i want to serve you and i want to love you i want to give you all holding back nothing ever he regarded me do you not understand master i asked if i had the choice i would choose not to be free but to be your slave a woman i had learned must choose between freedom and love both are estimable virtues let each choose which is best for her but i do not give you a choice he said of course not master i said you are gorean he looked down at the furs perhaps i will sell you he said you may do as you wish master i said i knew i was at his complete mercy only a bond girl he seemed angry bring me wine master i said he looked at me suddenly a girl is only testing her master i smiled suddenly he struck me slapping me cruelly across the mouth it hurt me i tasted a bit of blood do you think he asked that because i care for you i will not be strong with you no master i said i lay in the shadow of the slave ring a chain and heavy collar lay at the foot of the ring the chain attached to the ring he took the heavy metal collar and closed it about my throat over and about the lighter collar i wore confining me at the ring on the furs at the foot of his couch then he touched me i see you will be strong with me master i said what a fool i am he said to care for a miserable earthgirl slave i ask only to love and serve you master i said yet you are attractive he said a girl is grateful to her master should he find her pleasing i said so you would choose to be a slave he asked yes master i said slut said he yes master i said it is i who will decide he said yes master i said i decide he said yes master i begged that you are my slave yes master i cried then i writhed in his arms as he took me exploding in the deepest and most profound ecstasies a female can know those of the slave orgasm known only to the owned woman how could i love you so much he asked if i did not truly own you if you were not fully mine i do not know master i said clitus vitellius had confessed his love for a slave i hoped he would not now beat me he took me by the hair and thrust my head down to the furs a man can truly love only that woman he said who is truly his who belongs to him otherwise he is only a party to a contract a woman i said can love only that man to whom she truly belongs to whom do you truly belong slave he asked to you master i said you please me slave girl he said free me i said teasing him do you wish to feel the whip he asked no master i said quickly suddenly frightened i was his he might do to me what he wanted beg for your freedom he said please free me master i begged he laughed no he said i do not free you i will keep you as my slave i closed my eyes i had been judy thornton of earth i had been a coed at a small but prestigious college i had been an english major i had written poetry i had been popular on campus now i was only a branded slave girl dina helpless in the arms of her master i thought of elicia nevins who had been my beauty rival at the college she now too wore a collar i wondered if she were as happy in the arms of her master as i in the arms of mine she had been an anthropologist i wondered if now she truly understood perhaps for the first time the nature of the institution of slavery her master had perhaps taught her i lay blissfully in the arms of clitus vitellius owned i opened my eyes is a girl not to be permitted sometimes to speak her mind i asked perhaps upon occasion said clitus vitellius provided she does so upon her knees and at my feet you are a monster master i said then again i felt his body at mine and i cried out as my legs were thrust apart you are rough master i chided then frightened i said forgive me master he did not beat me i began to respond to him shuddering under the blows of his manhood and surrendered myself then content to the delicious brutality of my ravishment he had many ways of taking me and i must submit to them all unquestioningly we heard men later upon the bridges outside it was early morning i held clitus vitellius you are very lustful master i told him i am shamed neither by my health nor vitality he said he said this as a gorean explaining something to an ignorant earthgirl slave and you he said you must know are an exquisitely responsive shesleen does that shame you not any more master i said it is an indication of your vitality and health and emotional freedom he said it is a sign that you are vigorous and sound neither psychologically crippled nor diseased i had grown free on gor though i wore a collar strange collared i was free uncollared i had been a true slave a prisoner of a pathological culture ascetic mechanistic and twisted perhaps i am emotionally free i laughed but i scarcely am physically free true he said he pulled me by the chain at the back of the collar back to my back on the furs at the foot of his couch you keep me a slave i asked of course he said i never knew i would meet a man who could lust for me and desire me so much i said that he would keep me as a slave you never knew you would meet a man who would satisfy your deepest needs he said the hidden profound scarcely understood secret needs which you yourself scarcely recognized you are a secret dream which i scarcely dared dream come true to me master i said and you to me slave said he will you truly be hard with me master i asked yes he said will you truly though you care for me keep me as full slave yes slave he said subject even to discipline if i displease you i asked subject to discipline at my pleasure whether you displease me or not he said my bondage then will be absolute i said of course slave he said i reached out timidly to touch him i kissed him tenderly on the shoulder i love you master i said be silent slave he said irritably yes master i said he then touched me with sweetness and tenderness and i held him closely but did not speak lost in his touch for i a slave had been forbidden to speak he made gentle love to me then which i knew might become abrupt or brutal as he chose there were a thousand ways to have a slave girl and i did not doubt but what clitus vitellius was master of them all how joyful i was he was dominant over me i was subject to him i was his completely without qualification it is impossible for me to express my feelings perhaps this is why he had warned me to silence that i might not try to speak but would be content to feel what could not in any language be spoken so i did not then try to speak but rather contented myself with turning to the tasks of love
