john mortimer rumpole and the alternative society from rumpole of the bailey in some ways the coppers the fuzz old bill whatever you may care to call them are a very conservative body when they verbal up the criminal classes and report their alleged confessions in the nick they still use the sort of cockney argot that went out at the turn of the century and perfectly welleducated bank robbers who go to the ballet at covent garden and holidays in corfu are still reported as having cried its a fair cop guv or you got me bang to rights at the moment theyre apprehended in the early however when flower power flooded the country with a mass of long hair long dresses and the sweet smell of the old quarter of marrakesh the fuzz showed itself remarkably open to new ideas provincial drug squads were issued with beads afghan waistcoats headbands and guitars along with their size eleven boots and took lessons in a new language learning to say cool it man or make love not war instead of you got me bang to rights it was also a time when the figures of the establishment fell into disrepute and to be a barrister however close to the criminal fraternity was to be regarded by the young as a sort of undesirable cross between judge jeffries and mr nixon as i knew from the sullen looks of the young ladies nick who was then at oxford and reading ppe brought home in the holidays i have never felt so clearly the number of different countries all speaking private languages and with no diplomatic relations into which england is divided i cannot think for instance of a world more remote from the temple or the inns of court than that tumbledown victorian house in the west country which the community who inhabited it had christened nirvana and which contained a tortoise who looked to me heavily drugged a number of babies some surprisingly clean young men and women a painintheneck named dave and a girl called kathy trelawny whom i never met until she came to be indicted in the coldsands crown court on a charge of handling a phenomenal amount of cannabis resin valued at about ten thousand pounds coldsands is a rather unpopular resort in the west of england with a high rainfall a few regency terraces a large number of old peoples homes and a string quartet at teatime in the winter gardens on the face of it an unlikely place for crime to flourish but a number of young people did form a community there at nirvana a place which the local inhabitants regarded as the scene of numerous orgies to this house came a dealer named jack resplendent in his hippie attire to place a large order for cannabis which kathy trelawny set about fulfilling with the aid of a couple of persian law students with whom she had made contact at bristol university very soon after the deal was done and a large quantity of money handed over jack the hippie was revealed as detective sergeant jack smedley of the local force the strong arm of the law descended on nirvana the persian law students decamped to an unknown address in morocco and rumpole who had had a few notable successes with dangerous drugs was dug out of old bailey and placed upon the from paddington to coldsands enjoying the lare luxury of a quiet corner seat in the firstclass luncheon car by courtesy of the legal aid fund of great britain i could afford the firstclass luncheon and spread myself the more readily as i was staying in a little pub on the coast not five miles from coldsands kept by my old mates and companions in arms expilot officer threefingers dogherty and his wife bobby cxwaaf unchallenged beauty queen of the station at dungeness who was well known to look like betty grable from behind and phyllis dixey from the front and to have a charm a refreshing impertinence and a contempt for danger unrivalled i am sure by either of those famous pinups from reveille i have spoken of bobby already in these reminiscences and i am not ashamed to say that although i was already married to hilda when we met she captured my heart and continued to hold it fast long after the handsome pilot officer captured hers i was therefore keenly booking forward to renewing my acquaintance with bobby we had had a desultory correspondence but we hadnt met for many years i was also looking forward to a holiday at the seaside for which miss trelawnys little trouble seemed merely to provide the excuse and the financial assistance so i was as you can imagine in a good mood as we rattled past reading and cows began to be visible standing in fields chewing the cud as though there were no law courts or judges in the world you very rarely see a cow down the bailey which is one of the reasons i enjoy an occasional case on circuit circuit takes you away from chambers away from the benevolent despotism of albert the clerk above all away from the constant surveillance of she who must be obeyed i began to look forward to a good oldfashioned railway lunch i thought of a touch of brown windsor soup rapidly followed by steamed cod castle pudding mousetrap cream crackers and celery all to be washed down with a vintage bottle of chateau great western as we charged past didcot a furtivelooking man in a short offwhite jacket which showed his braces and a mournful expression looked down at me ah waiter brown windsor soup i fancy to start with were just doing the grilled platter sir i detected in the mans voice a certain gloomy satisfaction grilledwhat fried egg and brunchburger served with chips and a nice tomato a nice tomato oh very well perhaps with a suitable anaesthetic the brunchburger could be taken and to drink a reasonable railway claret no wines on this journey sir we got gin in miniatures i dont care for gin at lunchtime especially in miniatures regretfully i came to the conclusion that circuit life had deteriorated and wondered what the devil they had done with all the brown windsor soup at coldsands station a middleaged man in a neat suit and rimless glasses was there to meet me he spoke with a distinct and reassuring westcountry accent air horace rumpole im friendly thank god someone is i was warned you liked your little joke mr rumpole by london agents they recommended you as a learned counsel who has had some success with drugs oh i have had considerable success with drugs and a bit of luck with murder rape and other offences against the person im afraid we dont do much crime at friendly sanderson and friendly were mainly conveyancing by the way i think theres a couple of typing errors in the instructions to counsel mr friendly looked deeply apologetic i hastened to reassure him fear not friendly i never read the instructions to counsel i find they blur the judgtment and confuse the mind we were outside the station now and a battered taxi rattled into view youll want to see the client friendly sounded resigned she might expect it youre going to nirvana eventually arent we all no friendly i shall steer clear of the lotus eaters of no balaclava road a land i rather imagine in which it seems always afternoon bring the client for a con at my hotel after dinner nine oclock suit you youll be at the george thats where the bar put up then if its where the bar put up i shall avoid it im staying with old mates from my days in the raf they run a stately pleasuredome known as the crooked billet the little pub place out on the bay i noticed friendly smiled when he spoke of the doghertys delight a place i had no doubt of a high reputation the taxi had stopped now and i was wrestling with the door when i had it open i was in a high and holiday mood out on the bay indeed with no sound but the sea sighing and the muted love call of the lobster know what i say friendly when you get a bit of decent crime at the seaside relax and enjoy it friendly was staring after me perhaps understandably bewildered as i drove away the taxi took me out to the crooked billet and back about twentyfive years the pub was on the top of some cliffs above a sandy beach and a leaden sea from the outside it seemed an ordinary enough building offwhite battered with a neglected patch of garden but inside it was almost a museum to the great days of world war two behind the bar were sams trophies a nazi helmet a plaster mr churchill which could actually puff a cigar a model spitfire dangled from the ceiling there were framed photographs of expilot officer dogherty in his flying jacket standing by his beloved lancaster and a signed portrait of vera lynn at the height of her career even the pintable appeared to be an antique looted from some naafi there was also an old piano a string of fairy lights round the bottles and a comforting smell of stale booze someone was clanking bottles behind the bar but i could see no more than a comfortable bottom in old blue slacks i put out a red alert calling all air crew calling all air crew parade immediately at which bobby dogherty turned straightened up and smiled age had not actually withered her but it had added to the generosity of her curves her blonde hair looked more metallic than of old and the lines of laughter round her mouth and eyes had settled into permanent scars she had a tipped cigarette in her mouth and her head was tilted to keep the smoke out of her eyes she looked as always irrepressibly cheerful as if middle age like the war was a sort of joke and there to be enjoyed rumpole you old devil you look beautiful i said as i had often done in the past and meant it just as much liar drop of rum i didnt see why not and perched myself on a bar stool while she milked the rum bottle soon rumpole was in reminiscent mood takes me right back to the naafi hop new years eve sam was out bombing something and i had you entirely to myself for a couple of hours of the boompsadaisy not to mention the lambeth walk i raised my glass and gave our old salutation heres to the good old duke the good old duke bobby was on her second gin and tonic and she remembered you never took advantage i lit a small cigar it caught me in the back of the throat something i shall regret till the day i cough myself into extinction hows old sam hows expilot officer threefingers dogherty bloody doctor for the first time bobby looked less than contented doctor doctor mackay came here with a face like an undertaker she gave a passable imitation of a gloomy scottish medico mrs dogherty your husbands got to get out of the licensing trade or ill not give him more than another year get him into a small bungalow and on to soft drinks can you imagine sam in a bungalow or on soft drinks the mind boggles hell find lime juice and soda has a pleasant little kick to it thats what the doctor told me the kick of a mouse i should imagine in carpet slippers i told the quack sams not scared sam used to go out every night to kill himself he misses the war dreadfully i expect he does saturday night in the crooked billet and a bloody good pissup its the nearest he gets to the old days in the raf you want to be careful he doesnt rush out and bomb torquay i warned her and was delighted to see her laugh youre not joking the point is should i tell sam wont your doctor mackay tell him you know how sam is he wont see hide nor hair of the doctor so what should i do why ask me i looked at her having no advice to give youre the bloody lawyer darling youre meant to know everything at which point i was aware that behind us a man had come into the bar i turned and saw him scowling at us he was wearing a blazer an raf scarf in an open shirt and scuffed suede shoes i saw a goodlooking face grey hair and a grey moustache all gone slightly to seed it was none other than expilot officer sam threefingers dogherty were not open yet he seemed to have not yet completely awakened from a deep afternoon kip as he advanced on us blinking at the lights round the bar sam cant you see who it is bobby said and her husband who had at last identified the invasion roared at me my god its old grounded rumpole rumpole of the ops room he moved rapidly to behind the bar and treated himself to a large teachers which he downed rapidly what the hell brings you to this neck of the woods he wrote us a letter never read letters heres to the good old duke he was on his second whisky and considerably more relaxed what brings me a lady you might say a damsel in bloody great distress youre not still after bobby are you sam was only pretending to be suspicious of course till the day i die but your wifes not in distress exactly arent i bobby looked down into the depths of her gin and tonic and i filled them in on the nature of my mission the lady in question is a certain miss kathy trelawny one of the lotus eaters of nirvana balaclava road done for the possession of a suitcase full of cannabis resin i had put up as we used to say in the old days a black if i had asked the reverend ian paisley to pray for the pope i couldnt have invited an icier gaze of disapproval than sam gave me as he said youre defending her against your crafty constabulary come in here does she not bloody likely that crowd from balaclava road wouldnt get past the door anyway they dont drink the glass of teachers was recharged to banish the vision of the lotus eaters invading the crooked billet dear me is there no end to their decadence but you know my client never clapped eyes on her thank god no doubt shes about as glamorous as an unmade bed oh no doubt at all gloomily i thought he was almost certainly right something peering through glasses i thought out of a mop of unwashed hair sam came out from behind the bar and started to bang about straightening chairs and tables switching on more lights how can you defend that creature easy prop myself to my feet in court and do my best but you know damn well shes guilty its the one great error everyone makes about my learned profession they think we defend people who have told us they did the deed this legend doesnt add to the esteem in which barristers are held and i sighed a little as i exploded the myth for the thousandth time ah there youre wrong i dont know that at all pull the other one sam shared the usual public view of legal eagles i dont know and if she ever admitted it to me id have to make her surrender and plead guilty weve got a few rules old sweetheart we dont deceive courts not on purpose you mean you think shes innocent sam made it clear that no one who lived in a commune called nirvana could possibly be innocent of anything he told you sam hes got rules about it bobby was polishing glasses and coming to the rescue of an old friend at the moment i think shes the victim of a trick by the police thats what ill have to go on thinking until she tells me otherwise thats ridiculous the police dont trick people not in england sam clearly felt hed not delivered us from the nazi hordes for nothing never had a plain clothes copper come in here and order a large scotch after closing time i asked him the bastards but thats entirely different yes of course anyway whos paying you to defend miss slagheap thats what id like to know sam was triumphant it hurt me but i had to tell him fasten your seat belt old darling you are miss kathy trelawny is on legal aid and i am here by courtesy of the ratepayers of coldsands i lifted my rum in sams direction thank you threefingers thank you for your hospitality bloody hell sam sounded more sorrowful than angry and it gave him an excuse to turn the handle once more on the teachers we dont mind do we sam as always bobbys was the voice of tolerance we dont mind buying horace the odd drink occasionally later i sat in the residents lounge a small room which opened off the bar and tried to shut out the considerable noise made by sams regular customers middleaged men mostly in a sort of uniform of cavalry twill trousers and hacking jackets i was working on my brief and already i had a plan of campaign when the detective sergeant went to buy miss trelawnys cannabis he was disguised as a hippie and acting i was quite prepared to argue as an agent provocateur if i could establish that my client would never have committed any sort of crime unless the police had invited her to i might given a fair wind and a sympathetic judge have the whole of the police evidence excluded which would lead to the collapse of the prosecution a zen service of thanksgiving at nirvana and rumpole triumphant i had brought a number of law reports on the question of agent provocateur and was interested to discover that it was the old hanging judges who regarded these beasts with particular disfavour its odd how gentler days have somehow dimmed our passion for liberty i had worked out an argument that might appeal to a judge who still had some of the old spark left in him when the door from the bar opened to admit mr friendly and my client i had i felt known miss kathy trelawny for a long time she had floated before my eyes from my early days with the old oxford book of english verse as herricks julia or lovelaces lucasta or la belle dame sans merci or the lady of shallot as she smiled she reminded me strongly of rosalind in the forest of arden or viola comforting the lovesick duke she had a long slender neck a mass of coppercoloured hair friendly blue eyes and she was exceedingly clean as soon as i saw her i decided that my one ambition in life was to keep her out of holloway i had to take a quick gulp from the glass beside me before i could steady my nerve to read out a passage from the depositions miss trelawny was sitting quietly looking at me as if i was the one man in the world she had always wanted to meet and she hoped we would soon be finished with the boring case so we could talk about something interesting and deeply personal real cool house man i was reading out the detective sergeants evidence with disgust you cant score nothing in this hick town you dont get no trouble from the fuzz just from the way the old darling talked didnt you twig he was a sergeant from the local drug squad miss trelawny showed no particular reaction and friendly quickly filled the silence my client has never come up against the police before well have a bit of fun with this case i told them what sort of fun exactly friendly sounded doubtful as if he didnt exactly look on the coming trial as the annual dinner dance of the coldsands rotary a preliminary point in the absence of the jury we will ask the judge to rule the whole of detective sergeant jack smedley alias jack the hippies evidence inadmissable on the sole ground on what sole ground that it was obtained contrary to natural justice in that it constituted a trick that it is the testimony of an agent provocateur we dont get many of those in conveyancing friendly looked distinctly out of his depth a nasty foreign expression for a nasty foreign thing spies and infiltrators policemen in disguise who worm their way into an englishmans home and trap him into crime why should they do that mr rumpole i stood up and directed my answer at my client her warm and allembracing smile and her total silence were beginning to unnerve me so they can clap innocent citizens into chokey and notch up another conviction on their collective braces bloody unbritish like bidets and eating your pud after the cheese now i mean your average circuit judge circus judges we call them down the bailey friendly consulted a note its his honour james crispinrice tomorrow we were in luck i knew old rice crispies well at the bar he was a thoroughly decent chap who had once stood as a liberal candidate he was the product of the navy and a minor public school no doubt hed had it firmly implanted in him in the fourth form never trust a sneak they had left the door slightly open and through it i could hear the old familiar sound of bobby thumping the piano you think he might rule out the evidence i got up and shut the door blotting out some remarkable tuneless rendering of the golden oldies which had started up a cote de chez dogherty if we can implant a strong dislike of sergeant smedley in the old darling i told them disgusting behaviour your honour the police are there to detect crime not manufacture it whats the country coming to constables tricked out in beads and singing to a small guitar conning an innocent girl into making huge collections of cannabis resin from some persian pushers she met at bristol university shed never have done it if the policeman hadnt asked her wouldnt you miss trelawny friendly gave her the cue to speak she ignored it so on i went showing her my quality withdraw the evidence from the jury your honour its unenglish unethical and clearly shows that this crime was deliberately created by the police the whole business is a vile outrage to our ageold liberties wordsworth crept into my mind and i didnt send him about his business it is not to be thought of that the flood of british freedom which to the open sea i paused insecure on the words and then very quietly and for the first time miss kathy trelawny spoke with words appropriattly supplied by the old sheep of the lake district of the worlds praise from dark antiquity hath flowed with pomp of waters unwithstood should perish she looked at me i took over we must be free or die who speak the tongue that shakespeare spake i decided id had enough of wordsworth and asked her surprised you know it wordsworth a little i thought no one did nowadays whenever i come out with him in the bar mess they look amazed unusual for a client to know wordsworth i teach kids english oh yes of course you do i had learned from the brief that all the inhabitants of nirvana were in work theres one thing i wanted to ask you now she had broken the ice there seemed to be no holding her but friendly stood up as if anxious to bring the conference to an end well we shouldnt keep mr rumpole any longer ask me miss trelawny yes her smile was unwavering what do you want me to say exactly say say nothing look rely on me with a little help from wordsworth and keep your mouth firmly closed i opened the door great gusts of singing blew in on us from the bar bobbys voice was leading well meet again dont know where dont know when but were bound to meet again some sunny day i remembered my craven cowardice in not speaking to bobby on the occasion of the naafi hop and i asked miss trelawny to join me for a drink fortunately friendly remembered that his wife would be waiting up for him and i took my client alone into the bar as we sat at the counter sam came up to us swaying only slightly like a captain on the deck of his wellloved ship he looked at kathy trelawny with amazed approval where did you get this popsy rumpole he leant across the bar to chat to my client intimately you shouldnt be with the ground staff my dear youre definitely officer material whats it to be ill have a coke i dont drink really she was smiling at him the smile i thought uncomfortably of universal love bestowed on everyone regardless of age or sex ohdontyou you dont drink sam took offence theres nothing else you dont do is there quite a lot of things sam ignored this and recalled the good old days as he passed me a rum remember rumpole we used to divide the popsies into beer waafs and gin waafs he winked at kathy trelawny in my opinion youre a large pink gin she told you sam she doesnt drink i reminded sam he was getting impatient did you pick up this beautiful bit of crackling in a bloody baptist chapel he poured miss trelawny a cocacola take no notice of him my dear you can be teetotal with rumpole but lets launch our friendship on a sea of sparkling shampoo id probably sink kathy trelawny smiled at him not with me you wouldnt let me introduce myself pilot officer threefingersdogherty threefingers refers to the measures of my whisky my hands are in perfect order to demonstrate this he put a hand on hers across the bar i havent met many pilot officers kathy i feel i know her well enough to call her kathy for the rest of this narrative withdrew her hand she was still smiling well youve met me my dear sam rambled on undiscouraged one of the glamour boys one of the brylcreem brigade one of the very very few he stood himself another teachers and if i had a crate available id bloody well smuggle you up in the sky for a couple of victory rolls you see him you see groundstaff rumpole well wed leave him far below us grounded i dont think we should do that kathy protested the only time she stopped smiling was when sam made a joke why ever not sam frowned i think im going to need him as she said this i felt ridiculously honoured rumpole why ever should you need rumpole what did you say your name was i didnt now my time had come i had great pleasure in performing the introduction this is miss kathy trelawny of nirvana balaclava road and i added in a whisper to sam the wellknown unmade bed sam looked like a man who has just lifted what he imagined was a glass of vintage champagne and discovered it contained nothing but seven up he looked at kathy with pronounced distaste and said no bloody wonder you dont drink its just something i dont like doing she smiled back at him naturally naturally you wont have a pink gin like a normal girl excuse me he moved away from us shouting drink up please havent any of you lot got homes the piano stopped people started to drift out into the night was that meant to be a joke all that pilot officer business kathy asked me no joke at all sam was a great man on bombers he could find any target youd care to mention in the pitch dark on three fingers of whisky he was good sam extremely good you mean good at killing people when she put it like that i supposed that was what i did mean kathy turned to look at bobby who was sitting on the piano stool lighting a cigarette she asked me and i told her that was sams wife and i used to think she was gorgeous gorgeous for the war time anyway things were a bit utility then and now i looked at her children seem to grow up more beautiful it must be the orange juice or the peace sam gave us a crescendo version of time please and i walked my client to the bus shelter it was a still rather warm september night the sea murmured perpetually and the moonlight lit up the headland and whitened the strip of beach there were only very few words for it and i recited them to kathy as we moved away from the cars starting up round the crooked billet it is a beauteous evening calm and free the holy time is quiet as a nun breathless with adoration we read poetry at the house kathy told me its a good way to end the day someone reads a poem anything and then she shivered on that warm night and said they wont lock me up will they i told you well knock out the evidence put your trust in rumpole i tried to sound as cheerful as possible but she stood still trembling slightly her hand on my arm my brother petes locked up in turkey twelve years he was always such a scared kid he couldnt sleep with the door shut neither of us could what on earth did your brother do in turkey drugs she said and i wondered what sort of an idiot her brother must be then she asked me will it be over soon itll be over there were lights coming up the hill to take her away from me thats my bus why dont you come and see me in nirvana then the most strange thing happened she leant forward and kissed me quite carefully on the cheek then she was gone and i was saying to myself nirvana why ever not i walked back to the crooked billet in a state of ridiculous happiness flower power that year was exceedingly potent i was up early the next morning sinking a boiled egg in the residents lounge as the sun sparkled on the sea and bobby fussed around me pouring tea sam was still asleep god was in his heaven and with old rice crispies on the bench i could find nothing particularly wrong with the world after breakfast i put a drop of eaudecologne on the handkerchief ran a comb through the remaining hair and set off for the coldsands seat of justice when i got down to the shire hall and into the wig and gown i had my first view of the inhabitants of nirvana the lotus eaters of balaclava road they were out in force clean jeans mexicanlooking shawls the statutory baby one tall coloured boy whom i later discovered to be called oswald was carrying a small flute i just hoped they werent going to mistake the whole business for a bit of harmless fun round the south african embassy morning you must be rumpole welcome to the western circuit i was being addressed by a tall fellow with a rustic tan beneath his wig a gentleman farmer and gentleman barrister i looked down to discover if he had jodphur boots on under the pinstripes tooke vernon tookes my name im prosecuting you awfully decent of you i smiled at him tooke glanced disapprovingly at my supporters club i say rumpole where did you get that shower from rentahippie what a life eh gangbangs on the national assistance did i detect in farmer tookes voice a note of envy used to be a decent area he continued balaclava road until that lot got their foot in the door squatters are they theyve got a nineyear lease and theyve all got jobs the only fellows scrounging off the state tooke are you and i really rumpole tooke looked pained well theyre paying you on the rates arent they most amusing he looked as if id pointed out a bad case of foot and mouth in the herd but he offered me a cigarette from a gold case i refused and produced the remains of a small cigar from the waistcoat pocket tooke ignited it with a gold lighter is this going to take long he asked anxiously coldsands gymkhana tomorrow we tend to make it rather a day out take long i dont suppose so its quite a simple point of law law rumpole did you say law the casually dropped word seemed to fill tooke with a certain amount of dread thats right you do have law i suppose down on the western circuit i left tooke and moved towards the commune a young man with dark hair and a permanent frown who seemed to be their leader greeted me as i thought in an unfriendly fashion you her lawyer i admitted it kathy smiling as ever introduced him to me as a friend of hers named dave hawkins i speculated with a ridiculous stab of regret that the friendship was a close one this is dave oh yes will she be going in today dave wanted to be put in the picture in into the witness box i mean theres something i want her to say its pretty important i was accustomed to being the sole person in charge of my cases i put dave right patiently dave may i call you mr hawkins if i were a doctor taking out your appendix old darling you wouldnt want kathy would you telling me where to put the knife at this point the usher came out of court and called katherine trelawny youd better answer your bail as i said this kathy gave a little shiver and asked me will they lock me up now of course not trust me the usher called her again i dropped the remnants of the small cigar on the marble floor of the shire hall and ground it underfoot the lance was in the rest sir galahad rumpole was about to do battle for the damsel in distress or words to that effect halfway through the afternoon things were going pretty well rice crispies doing his job in a very decent fashion was decidedly interested in the point of agent provocateur kathy was smiling in the dock the commune were gripped by the spectacle and outside the court room the baby unaware of the solemnity of the occasion was yelling lustily in the witness box detective sergeant jack smedley was looking extremely square clean shaven and in his natty old bill uniform i see detective sergeant i had the pleasure to put to him you are no longer wearing your beads beads what beads are those the judge was puzzled i was wearing beads your honour on the occasion of my visits to balaclava road beads with the uniform his honour couldnt believe his ears no one had sported beads in the navy not with the uniform with the embroidered jeans and the waistcoat of afghan goat and the purple silk drapery knotted round your neck i pursued my advantage i was in plain clothes your honour plain clothes sergeant you were in fancy dress i rode over a titter from the commune now perhaps youll tell the court whats happened to your gaucho moustache i i shaved it off why in view of certain comments your honour passed in the station it wasnt a gaucho more a viva zapata actually a viva what was that mr rumpole the judge seemed to feel the world slipping away from him the officer was affecting the moustache your honour of a wellknown south american revolutionary this news worried the old darling on the bench deeply a south american can you tell me officer what was the purpose of this elaborate disguise the witness paused i filled the gap with my humble submission may i suggest an answer sergeant you took it into your head to pose as a drug dealer in order to trap this quite innocent young woman i had the pleasure of pointing out kathy in the dock into taking part in a filthy trade she wouldnt otherwise have dreamed of well yes but what did he say rice crispies pounced on the grudging admission your honour the witness tried to start again shorthand writer just read me that answer there was a long pause while the elderly lady shuffled through her notes but at last the passage was reproduced in order to trap this quite innocent young woman into taking part in a filthy trade well yes but the judge made a note of that i could have kissed the old darling however i pressed on but what sergeant she wasnt so innocent what reason had you to suppose that her way of life your honour what i want you to tell me officer is this the judge weighed in in support of rumpole did you have any reason to believe that this young woman was dealing in drugs before you went there in your viva what zapata your honour i helped him along thank you mr rumpole im much obliged we had received certain information the sergeant did his best to make it sound sinister and will you let us into the secret officer what was this information that miss trelawny was the type to get involved involved by you involved already tooke who seemed to feel the case was eluding his grasp rose to his feet i shall be calling the evidence your honour of the neighbour miss tigwell very well mr tooke but if the evidence shows no previous attempt to deal in drugs then you would agree the whole of this crime was a result of your fertile imagination i fired a final salvo at the witness but the judge interrupted me perfectly fairly doesnt that rather depend mr rumpole on the effect of miss tigwells evidence when we hear it if your honour pleases of course as always your honour is perfectly right i rewarded that upright fellow rice crispies with a low bow and sat down in a mood of quiet selfcongratulation i hadnt been sitting long before the man dave was at my side whispering furiously is that all youre going to ask you want to have a go i whispered back do borrow the wig old darling the evidence of kathys previous malpractices was offered to us in the person of miss tigwell who lived opposite at no balaclava road and whose idea of entertainment appeared to be gazing into the windows of nirvana in the daily hope of moral indignation i could tell exactly what they were what were they miss tigwell perverted all living higgledypiggledy men and women black and white did your supervision include the bedrooms well no but they all sat together in the front room sat together what did they talk about i couldnt hear that they were a community thats what it comes to they might well have been trappist monks for all you knew i dont know if air rumpole is suggesting his client is a trappist monk tooke made a mistake he should have left the jokes to me rice crispies didnt smile now miss tigwell apart from the fact that persons of different sex sat together did you ever observe anything suspicious from your post in the crows nest i saw a man giving her money miss tigwell was playing her king quite a lot of money it was in ten pound notes was this the first time you had ever seen money passing or any sort of dealing going on in nirvana the first time yes the judge was making a note i decided to play my ace and prayed that i wouldnt be trumped by the prosecution can you describe to his honour the man you saw passing the money dreadfullooking person a clear criminal type looked as if hed been dragged through a hedge backwards longhair and a horrible sort of moustache beads embroidered jeans afghan goats hair and purple silk fancy for the neck i saw detective sergeant exhippie smedley bow his head in shame and i knew i was home and dry disgusting i saw it all quite distinctly miss tigwell ended in triumph congratulations madam you have now given us a perfectly accurate description of detective smedley of the local force as i took off the wig in the robing room farmer tooke was looking distinctly worried i did my best to cheer him up ah tooke i have good news for you hope to get you all off in time for the gymkhana tomorrow got a daughter have you in the potato race do you think the judge is agin me tooke felt all was not well with the prosecution not you personally but i know what hes thinking do you encourage that sort of police officer and hell be out in a frock on the prom tomorrow soliciting the chairman of the bench tooke saw the point i say i suppose that sort of thing is worrying not english if you want my opinion at which tooke climbing into his burberry put the law behind him and extended an invitation what are you doing tonight rumpole i mean therell be a few of us dining at the bar hotel with the leader of the circuit roast lamb sea shanties and old jokes from quarter sessions no not tonight tooke oh well im sorry we like to give our visitors a little hospitality tonight i am dropping out dinner at nirvana was a distinct surprise id expected nut cutlets and carrot juice i got an excellent steak and kidney pud and a very drinkable claret oswald had told me he was something of a wine freak the house was clean and the big cushions and old sofas remarkably comfortable the babies were good enough to withdraw from the company the recordplayer gave us unobtrusive flute music from the andes and kathy tended to all my needs filling my glass and lighting my cigar and remained a perpetual pleasure to the eye i began to think that id rather live at balaclava road than at the gloucester road mansion flat with she who must be obeyed id rather sit back on the scatter cushions at nirvana and let my mind go a complete blank than drag myself down to the bailey on a wet monday morning to defend some overexcited pakistani accused of raping his social worker in fact i thought that for tuppence for a packet of small cigars id give up the law and spend the rest of my life in a pair of old plimsolls and grey flannel bags shrimping on the beach at coldsands the only fly in this soothing ointment was the fellow dave when i told kathy she wouldnt even have to go into the witness box if we won our agent provocateur argument dave said im not sure i agree with that i told him firmly that i wasnt sure he had to when we brought you here i thought youd understand its not just another case dave protested protesting seemed to be his main occupation every case is just another case i told him to you all right to us its a chance to say what we have to cant we put the law straight on the drug scene i mean this isnt a den of thieves is it youve seen nirvana oswald put the point more gently he was right of course i had seen nirvana nows our only chance to get through to the law dave told me i decided to instruct him on the facts of life the law you know where the law is now down in the george hotel drinking the circuit port and singing what shall we do with the drunken sailor the law is talking about the comical way the old lord chief passed a death sentence the law is in another world but it thinks its the whole world just as you lot think the worlds nothing but poetry and perhaps the occasional puff of a dangerous cigarette thats what weve got you for to put our point of view across dave had mistaken my function youve got me to get you out of trouble thats what youve got me for im not going to get up tomorrow and teach old rice crispies to sing protest songs to a small guitar youre just not taking this case seriously dave was totally wrong and i told him so oh yes i am i am seriously determined to keep kathy out of prison at which miss trelawny said it was time for their nightly poem she found a book and gave it to me open me you like this read it to us so i read to the lotus eaters quietly at first and then with more emphasis enjoying the sound of my own voice it is a beauteous evening calm and free the holy time is quiet as a nun breathless with adoration the broad sun is sinking down in its tranquillity they were all listening as though they actually enjoyed it except for dave who was whispering to kathy dear child dear girl that walkest with me here if thou appear untouched by solemn thought kathy was shushing dave making him listen to the old sheep i looked at her as i read the last lines thy nature is not therefore less divine thou liest in abrahams bosom all the year and worshippst at the temples inner shrine god being with thee when we know it not i slammed the book shut i needed to sleep before court in the morning the officer was only doing his duty active your honour in the pursuit of crime tooke was making his final speech on the point of evidence to an unenthusiastic audience or in the manufacture of a crime thats what troubles me the judge was really troubled bless him he went on if i thought this young woman only collected drugs only got in touch with any sort of supplier because of the trap set for her then would you concede mr tooke i would have to reject the evidence i think your honour would tooke was a lovely prosecutor everything was going extremely well when rice crispies adjourned for lunch so i was in festive mood when i set off for a crab sandwich and a nourishing stout in the pub opposite the shire hall looking forward to whetting my whistle and putting the final touch on my clinching argument but i was stopped by friendly who said the client wanted to see me as a matter of urgency he led me into a small room decorated with old framed leases and eighteenthcentury maps of coldsands and there clearly bursting with news to impart were miss kathy trelawny and her friend dave we want to tell the truth i closed the door carefully and looked at her dave without encouragement what truth its the only way i can get peters case across kathy said she was smiling no longer peter my brother i told you he was busted in turkey i remember well this isnt turkey and its not peters case or anyone elses i looked at kathy its yours kathy wants you to know why she did it she was about to speak and i almost shouted at her hoping it still wasnt too late shut up you see i had the conference is over got to get a bite of lunch come on friendly i moved to the door it appears we have new instructions mr rumpole friendly looked concerned not half so concerned as i was the old instructions are doing very nicely thank you dont say a word until this evening when its all over tell me what you like she wants everyone to know how else can we get petes case into the papers dave like an idiot had moved between me and the door i had no way of escaping the fusillade of truth which kathy then let fly i got the stuff last year after pete got busted in istanbul i was going to sell it anyway it was going to cost ten thousand pounds to get him out in lawyers fees and she looked at me almost accusingly bribes i suppose he got twelve years weve got to get people to care about peter so it was quite clear she was telling me that she hadnt committed her crime as the result of a request from an agent provocateur she had the stuff before detective sergeant smedley of the west country drug squad first came to nirvana that was the truth the last thing in the world i wanted to know i looked at my watch and turned to friendly what is there a back to london friendly run outside for gods sake and see if you cant whistle me up a taxi im retiring from this case friendly totally puzzled by the turn of events left us running out on us dave never made an unexpected remark why for gods sake kathy asked me and i had to tell her let me try and explain my existence is bound by a small blue volume handed down like the tablets on the day of my call to the bar by a master of my inn in a haze of port and general excitement what the hells he talking about dave couldnt resist interrupting but kathy told him to listen i went on with such calm as i could muster barristers down the ages have killed they have certainly committed adultery although that sort of thing doesnt appeal to me some may well have coveted their neighbours camels and no doubt worshipped graven images but i dont believe theres one of us who has ever gone on to fight a case after our client has told us in clear crystal ringing tones that they actually did the deed you mean you wont help me kathy looked as if it had never occurred to her i cant now but kathy wants to tell the judge the pot laws ridiculous and about pete its my duty to preside over your acquittal not your martyrdom to the dubious cause of intoxication i told her ill see the judge and tell him i cant act for you any longer personal reasons the old foolll think you fancy her i cant imagine where dave got that farfetched idea and i went on ignoring him youll get another barrister what you tell him is your business ill ask the judge to adjourn for a week or two youll still be on bail whats the matter afraid to stick your neck out or would you starve to death if they made pot legal dave was about to start on another of his political speeches but kathy silenced him she asked him to leave us alone and i told him to go and find friendly and my taxi he went he had smashed my defence and i was alone with kathy looking at the pieces i thought we got along together kathy was smiling again i couldnt help admiring her courage i mean you keep talking about clients i didnt think i was a client i thought i was more of a friend actually never have friends for clients that really ought to be one of the ten commandments i dont suppose you could forget what i told you of course i could id like nothing more than to forget it id forget it at once if i wasnt a bloody barrister and theres nothing more important than that in your life being a barrister i thought about this very carefully unfortunately there was only one answer no poetry doesnt mean a damn thing to you friendship doesnt mean anything youre just an old man with a heart full of a book about legal etiquette kathy was angry now shed stopped smiling youre saying just what i have long suspected i had to agree with her why dont you do something about it what do you suggest she moved away from me and went and looked out of the window at the sunshine and the municipal begonias at last she said i might leave coldsands and come up to london do a language course and dave would dave be coming with you daves stuck here organizing the house i want to get away have a bit of a rest from homemade muesli and debates about the geezer i thought well id get a flat in london i could come and have lunch with you sometimes when youre in the old bailey every man has his price is that mine a lunch down the old bailey not enough more than enough probably much more something to think about in the long cold nights with she who must be obeyed she suddenly turned on me she was holding on to my arm as if afraid of falling im not going to prison you wont let them send me to prison there was only one way now dave had done his damnedest i can go and see the judge he might agree to a suspended sentence i dont know i can go and see him thats right he likes you i could see you get along go and see him please go and see him she was smiling again eager i had to tell her the facts of life you know what it means if i go and see the judge for you i i plead guilty she knew i left her then and went to the door we still had our trump card dear old rice crispies was simply aching to get away to the gymkhana his honour judge crispinrice was delighted to see rumpole and the prosecuting tooke he made us nescaf with the electric kettle in his room he looked younger with his wig off and when we had settled such vital matters as how much milk and no sugar thank you he and tooke tried to make me envious of their previous nights revelry in the bar mess we had a good evening you should have been with us rumpole didnt we have a splendid evening vernon the leader gave us the floral dance tooke relived the great moment old pascoe is wonderful for he entertained us in song the judge offered us a senior service youd have enjoyed it a splendid evening we fined little moreton a dozen bottles of claret for talking shop at dinner tooke was bubbling at the memory we then started hacking away at the penalty how many bottles were left none judge as far as i remember i thought the time had come to return their thoughts to the business in hand look here judge i said at the risk of being fined for talking shop if if it so happened i could persuade my client to plead guilty his honour was stirring his cup giving me no great assistance you might be grateful for a short afternoon even this didnt hook him i went on a little desperately shes a remarkable girl so i can see old rice crispies smiled then perhaps i thought i could rope him into nirvana knows a good deal about wordsworth i didnt know if this would sway the judicial mind wordsworth is he a mitigating factor poor old sheep of the lake district he cant afford to lose admirers no well shed get the full benefit of pleading guilty he was using his judges voice i stood up like a barrister cant you tell me any more than that there are rules i thought you might indicate the tariff you know the tariff how much was it twenty pounds weight a fair wallop it was only cannabis i tried to make it sound like broken biscuits they use the stuff just like whisky it doesnt occur to them but it isnt whisky is it the judges voice again its a class b drug as defined by the dangerous drugs act but what do we know about it that its illegal isnt that all we need to know he looked at me then and gave me a charming smile my god rumpole are we going to see you turning up in court in beads shes got a good character i played my last card the judge drained his nescafe well you know about a good character everyone had a good character once i mean if we let everyone out because of their good character no one would ever go inside thatm be a scandal all those empty prisons i said it with too much feeling rice crispies looked at me as if i were coming out in a rash i say rumpole youre not getting involved in this case are you involved of course not no naturally but i was thinking possibly a suspended sentence at which his honour judge crispinrice put his wig back on and said something which was no help at all youve got your job to do rumpole and ive got mine i sweated my guts out in my speech in mitigation and the judge listened to me with perfect courtesy he then gave kathy trelawny three years in the nicest possible way and she was taken down to the cells vernon tooke came up to me in the robing room he was on his way to the gymkhana well ended nice and quick yes tooke very quickly going back to london tomorrow ill be going back tomorrow quite an attractive sort of person your client yes tooke all the same to prison she had to go when i came out into the main hall the commune was standing in a little group oswald was playing a lament on his flute and the baby was silent none of them spoke to me but i heard a voice at my elbow say it seems a shame sir a girl like that it was detective sergeant jack the hippie smedley and he added what we both knew its an evil place holloway out in the street i was nearly run over by a police car miss kathy trelawny was sitting in the back and saw me she was still smiling joviality was at its height in the crooked billet that night sam told all his old stories and bobby played the piano i stood beside her my glass of rum on the piano top and in a pause she looked across at her husband look at sam she said hes happy as a tick whats he want with a slow death on lime juice in a bungalow i made up my mind im not going to tell him are you in favour of that people not telling people things people not scattering information like bombs oh yes i told her im all in favour of that then she played roll out the barrel and we all joined in our voices floating out over the sea until sam called time please i never saw the people from nirvana again the end
