 enid blyton five get into trouble five make a holiday plan really quentin you are most difficult to cope with said aunt fanny to her husband the four children sat at the table eating breakfast and looking very interested what had uncle quentin done now julian winked at dick and anne kicked george under the table would uncle quentin explode into a temper as he sometimes did uncle quentin held a letter in his hand which his wife had just given back to him after she had read it it was the letter that was causing all the trouble uncle quentin frowned and then decided not to explode instead he spoke quite mildly well fanny dear how can i possibly be expected to remember exactly when the childrens holidays come and if they are going to be here with us or with your sister you know i have my scientific work to do and very important it is too at the moment i cant remember when the childrens schools break up or go back you could always ask me said aunt fanny exasperated really quentin have you forgotten how we discussed having julian dick and anne here these easter holidays because they all enjoy kirrin and the sea so much at this time of the year you said you would arrange to go off to your conferences after they had had their holidays not in the very middle of them but theyve broken up so late said uncle quentin i didnt know they were going to do that well but you know easter came late this year so they broke up late said aunt fanny with a sigh father wouldnt think of that said george whats the matter mother does father want to go away in the middle of our holidays or what yes said aunt fanny and she stretched out her hand for the letter again let me see he would have to go off in two days time and i must certainly go with him i cant possibly leave you children alone here with nobody in the house if joanna were not ill it would be all right but she wont be back for a week or two joanna was the cook the children were all very fond of her and had been sorry to find her missing when they had arrived for the holidays we can look after ourselves said dick anne is quite a good little cook i can help too said george her real name was georgina but everyone called her george her mother smiled oh george last time you boiled an egg you left it in the saucepan till it boiled dry i dont think the others would like your cooking very much it was just that i forgot the egg was there said george i went to fetch the clock to tune it and on the way i remembered timmy hadnt had his dinner and yes we know all about that said her mother with a laugh timmy had his dinner but your father had to go without his tea woof said timmy from under the table hearing his name mentioned he licked georges foot just to remind her he was there well lets get back to the subject said uncle quentin impatiently ive got to go to these conferences thats certain ive to read some important papers there you neednt come with me fanny you can stay and look after the children mother doesnt need to said george we can do something we badly wanted to do but thought wed have to put off till the summer hols oh yes said anne at once so we could do lets yes id like that too said dick well what is it asked aunt fanny im quite in the dark if its anything dangerous i shall say no so make up your minds about that when do we ever do anything dangerous cried george plenty of times said her mother now whats this plan of yours its nothing much said julian its only that all our bikes happen to be in firstclass order aunt fanny and you know you gave us two small tents for christmas so we just thought it would be great fun sometime to go off on our bikes taking our tents with us and do a little exploring round the countryside its grand weather now we could have fine fun said dick after all you must have meant us to use the tents aunt fanny heres our chance i meant you to use them in the garden or on the beach said aunt fanny last time you went camping you had mr luffy with you to look after you i dont think i like the idea of you going off by yourselves with tents oh fanny if julian cant look after the others he must be a pretty feeble specimen said her husband sounding impatient let them go id bank on julian any time to keep the others in order and see they were all safe and sound thanks uncle said julian who was not used to compliments from his uncle quentin he glanced round at the other children and grinned of course its easy to manage this little lot though anne sometimes is very difficult anne opened her mouth indignantly she was the smallest and the only really manageable one she caught julians grin he was teasing her of course she grinned back i promise to be easy to manage she said in an innocent voice to her uncle quentin he looked surprised well i must say i should have thought that george was the only difficult one to he began but stopped when he saw his wifes warning frown george was difficult but it didnt make her any less difficult if that fact was pointed out quentin you never know when julian is pulling your leg or not do you said his wife well if you really think julian can be put in charge and we can let them go off on a cycling tour with their new tents hurray its settled then yelled george and began to thump dick on the back in joy well go off tomorrow well george theres no need to shout and thump like that said her mother you know your father doesnt like it and now youve excited timmy too lie down timmy there hes off round the room like a mad thing uncle quentin got up to go he didnt like it when mealtimes turned into pandemonium he almost fell over the excited timmy and disappeared thankfully out of the room what a household it was when the four children and the dog were there oh aunt fanny can we really go off tomorrow asked anne her eyes shining it is such lovely april weather honestly its as hot as july we hardly need to take any thick clothes with us well if you think that you wont go said aunt fanny firmly it may be hot and sunny today but you can never trust april to be the same two days together it may be pouring tomorrow and snowing on the next day i shall have to give you money julian so that you can go to an hotel any night the weather is bad the four children immediately made up their minds that the weather would never be too bad wont it be fun said dick we can choose our own sleepingplace every night and put our tents there we can bike half the night if its moonlight and we want to ooooh biking in moonlight ive never done that said anne it sounds super well its a good thing there is something you want to do while we are away said aunt fanny dear me ive been married all these years to quentin and still he makes this kind of muddle without my knowing well well wed better get busy today and decide what youre to take everything suddenly seemed very exciting the four children rushed to do their morning jobs of making the beds and tidying their rooms talking at the tops of their voices who would have thought wed be off on our own tomorrow said dick pulling his sheets and blankets up in a heap together dick ill make your bed cried anne shocked to see it made in such a hurried way you cant possibly make it like that oh cant i cried dick you just wait and see and whats more im making julians like that too so you clear off and do your own anne tuck in every corner smooth the pillow pat the eiderdown do what you like with your own bed but leave me to make mine my own way wait till were off on our biking tour you wont want to bother about beds then youll roll up your sleepingbag and that will be that he finished his bed as he spoke dragging on the cover all crooked and stuffing his pyjamas under the pillow anne laughed and went to make her own she was excited too the days stretched before her sunny full of strange places unknown woods big and little hills chattering streams wayside picnics biking in the moonlight did dick really mean that how wizard they were all very busy that day packing up into rucksacks the things they would need folding up the tents into as small a compass as possible to tie on to their carriers ferreting in the larder for food to take looking out the maps they would want timmy knew they were going off somewhere and of course felt certain he was going too so he was as excited as they were barking and thumping his tail and generally getting into everyones way all day long but nobody minded timmy was one of them one of the five he could do almost everything but speak it was quite unthinkable to go anywhere without dear old timmy i suppose timothy can keep up with you all right when you bike for miles aunt fanny asked julian goodness yes said julian he never minds how far we go i hope you wont worry about us aunt fanny you know what a good guard timmy is yes i know said his aunt i wouldnt be letting you go off like this with such an easy mind if i didnt know timmy would be with you hes as good as any grownup at looking after you woof woof agreed timmy george laughed he says hes as good as two grownups mother she said and timmy thumped his big tail on the floor woof woof woof he said which meant not two but three away on their own they were all ready the next day everything was neatly packed and strapped to the bicycles except for the rucksacks which each child was to carry on his or her back the baskets held a variety of food for that day but when it had been eaten julian was to buy what they needed i suppose all their brakes are in order said uncle quentin thinking he ought to take some interest in the proceedings and remembering that when he was a boy and had a bicycle the brakes would never work oh uncle quentin of course theyre all right said dick wed never dream of going out on our bikes if the brakes and things werent in order the highway code is very strict about things like that you know and so are we uncle quentin looked as if he had never even heard of the highway code it was quite likely he hadnt he lived in a world of his own a world of theories and figures and diagrams and he was eager to get back to it however he waited politely for the children to make lastminute adjustments and then they were ready goodbye aunt fanny im afraid we shant be able to write to you as you wont be able to get in touch with us to let us know where you get fixed up never mind enjoy yourselves said julian goodbye mother dont worry about us well be having a jolly good time called george goodbye aunt fanny goodbye uncle quentin so long uncle aunt fanny were off and so they were cycling down the lane that led away from kirrin cottage their aunt and uncle stood at the gate waving till the little party had disappeared round the corner in the sunshine timmy was loping along beside georges bicycle on his long strong legs overjoyed at the idea of a really good run well were off said julian as they rounded the corner what a bit of luck going off like this by ourselves good old uncle quentin im glad he made that muddle dont lets ride too many miles the first day i always get so stiff if we do were not going to said dick whenever you feel tired just say so it doesnt matter where we stop the morning was very warm soon the children began to feel wet with perspiration they had sweaters on and they took them off stuffing them in their baskets george looked more like a boy than ever with her short curly hair blown up by the wind all of them wore shorts and thin jerseys except julian who had on jeans he rolled up the sleeves of his jersey and the others did the same they covered mile after mile enjoying the sun and the wind timmy galloped beside them untiring his long pink tongue hanging out he ran on the grassy edge of the road when there was one he really was a very sensible dog they stopped at a tiny village called manlingtontovey it had only one general store but it sold practically everything or seemed to hope it sells gingerbeer said julian my tongues hanging out like timmys the little shop sold lemonade orangeade lime juice grapefruit juice and gingerbeer it was really difficult to choose which to have it also sold icecreams and soon the children were sitting drinking gingerbeer and limejuice mixed and eating delicious ices timmy must have an ice said george he does so love them dont you timmy woof said timmy and gulped his ice down in two big gurgly licks its really a waste of icecreams to give them to timmy said anne he hardly has time to taste them he gobbles them so no timmy get down im going to finish up every single bit of mine and there wont be even a lick for you timmy went off to drink from a bowl of water that the shopwoman had put down for him he drank and he drank then he flopped down panting the children took a bottle of gingerbeer each with them when they went off again they meant to have it with their lunch already they were beginning to think with pleasure of eating the sandwiches put up into neat packets for them anne saw some cows pulling at the grass in a meadow as they passed it must be awful to be a cow and eat nothing but tasteless grass she called to george think what a cow misses never tastes an egg and lettuce sandwich never eats a chocolate eclair never has a boiled egg and cant even drink a glass of gingerbeer poor cows george laughed you do think of silly things anne she said now youve made me want my lunch all the more talking about egg sandwiches and gingerbeer i know mother made us egg sandwiches and sardine ones too its no good chimed in dick leading the way into a little copse his bicycle wobbling dangerously its no good we cant go another inch if you girls are going to jabber about food all the time julian what about lunch it was a lovely picnic that first one in the copse there were clumps of primroses all round and from somewhere nearby came the sweet scent of hidden violets a thrush was singing madly on a hazel tree with two chaffinches calling pinkpink every time he stopped band and decorations laid on said julian waving his hand towards the singing birds and the primroses very nice too we just want a waiter to come and present us with a menu a rabbit lolloped near its big ears standing straight up inquiringly ah the waiter said julian at once what have you to offer us today bunny a nice rabbitpie the rabbit scampered off at top speed it had caught the smell of timmy nearby and was panicstricken the children laughed because it seemed as if it was the mention of rabbitpie that had sent it away timmy stared at the disappearing rabbit but made no move to go after it well timmy thats the first time youve ever let a rabbit go off on its own said dick you must be hot and tired got anything for him to eat george of course said george i made his sandwiches myself and so she had she had bought sausage meat at the butchers and had actually made timmy twelve sandwiches with it all neatly cut and packed the others laughed george never minded taking trouble over timmy he wolfed his sandwiches eagerly and thumped his tail hard on the mossy ground they all sat and munched happily perfectly contented to be together out in the open air eating a wonderful lunch anne gave a scream george look what youre doing youre eating one of timmys sandwiches urhh said george i thought it tasted a bit strong i must have given timmy one of mine and taken his instead sorry tim woof said tim politely and accepted another of his sandwiches at the rate he eats them he wouldnt really notice if he had twenty or fifty remarked julian hes had all his now hasnt he well look out everybody hell be after ours aha the band has struck up again everyone listened to the thrush mind how you go sang the thrush mind how you go mind how you doit doit doit sounds like a safety first poster said dick and settled down with his head on a cushion of moss all right old bird well mind how we go but were going to have a bit of a snooze now so dont play the band too loudly it would be a good idea to have a bit of a rest said julian yawning weve done pretty well so far we dont want to tire ourselves out the very first day get off my legs timmy youre frightfully heavy with all those sandwiches inside you timmy removed himself he went to george and flumped himself down beside her licking her face she pushed him away dont be so licky she said sleepily just be on guard like a good dog and see that nobody comes along and steals our bikes timmy knew what on guard meant of course he sat up straight when he heard the words and looked carefully all round sniffing as he did so anyone about no not a sight sound or smell of any stranger timmy lay down again one ear cocked and one eye very slightly open george always thought it was marvellous the way he could be asleep with one ear and eye and awake with the others she was about to say this to dick and julian when she saw that they were sound asleep she fell asleep too nobody came to disturb them a small robin hopped near inquisitively and with his head on one side considered whether or not it would be a good thing to pull a few hairs out of timmys tail to line his new nest the slit in timmys awakeeye widened a little woe betide the robin if he tried any funny tricks on timmy the robin flew off the thrush sang a little more and the rabbit came out again timmys eye opened wide the rabbit fled timmy gave a tiny snore was he awake or was he asleep the rabbit wasnt going to wait and find out it was half past three when they all awoke one by one julian looked at his watch its almost teatime he said and anne gave a little squeal oh no why weve only just had lunch and im still as full as can be julian grinned its all right well go by our tummies for our meals not by our watches anne come on get up well go without you if you dont they wheeled their bicycles out of the primrose copse and mounted again the breeze was lovely to feel on their faces anne gave a little groan oh dear i feel a bit stiff already do you mean to go very many miles more ju no not many said julian i thought wed have tea somewhere when we feel like it and then do a bit of shopping for our supper and breakfast and then hunt about for a really good place to put up our tents for the night i found a little lake on the map and i thought we could have a swim in it if we can find it this all sounded very good indeed george felt she could cycle for miles if a swim in a lake was at the end of it thats a very nice plan of yours she said approvingly very nice indeed i think our whole tour ought to be planned round lakes so that we can always have a swim night and morning woof said timmy running beside georges bicycle woof timmy agrees too said george with a laugh but oh dear i dont believe he brought his bathingtowel a lovely day and a lovely night the five of them had a lovely time that evening they had tea about half past five and then bought what they wanted for supper and breakfast new rolls anchovy paste a big round jamtart in a cardboard box oranges limejuice a fat lettuce and some ham sandwiches it seemed a very nice assortment indeed lets hope we dont eat it all for supper and have no breakfast left said george packing the sandwiches into her basket get down timmy these sandwiches are not for you ive bought you a whacking big bone that will keep you busy for hours well dont let him have it when we settle down for the night said anne he makes such a row crunching and munching hed keep me awake nothing would keep me awake tonight said dick i believe i could sleep through an earthquake im already thinking kindly of my sleepingbag i dont think we need to put up our tents tonight said julian looking up at the perfectly clear sky ill ask someone what the weather forecast was on the radio at six honestly i think we could just snuggle into our sleepingbags and have the sky for a roof how smashing said anne id love to lie and look at the stars the weather forecast was good fine and clear and mild good said julian that will save us a lot of trouble we dont even need to unpack our tents come on have we got everything now does anyone feel as if we ought to buy any more food the baskets were all full nobody thought it advisable to try and get anything more into them we could get lots more in if timmy would only carry his own bones said anne half my basket is crammed with enormous bones for him why cant you rig up something so that timmy could carry his own food george im sure hes clever enough yes hes clever enough said george but hes much too greedy anne you know that hed stop and eat all his food at once if he had to carry it dogs seem to be able to eat anything at any time theyre lucky said dick wish i could but i just have to pause between my meals now for the lake said julian folding up the map which he had just been examining its only about five miles away its called the green pool but it looks a good bit bigger than a pool i could do with a bathe im so hot and sticky they came to the lake at about half past seven it was in a lovely place and had beside it a small hut which was obviously used in summertime for bathers to change into bathingsuits now it was locked and curtains were drawn across the windows i suppose we can go in for a dip if we like said dick rather doubtfully we shant be trespassing or anything shall we no it doesnt say anything about being private said julian the water wont be very warm you know because its only midapril but after all were used to cold baths every morning and i daresay the sun has taken the chill off the lake come on lets get into bathingthings they changed behind the bushes and then ran down to the lake the water was certainly very cold indeed anne skipped in and out and wouldnt do any more than that george joined the boys in a swim and they all came out glowing and laughing brrr that was cold said dick come on lets have a sharp run look at anne dressed already timmy where are you you dont mind the cold water do you they all tore up and down the little paths by the green pool like mad things anne was getting the supper ready the sun had disappeared now and although the evening was still very mild the radiant warmth of the day had gone anne was glad of her sweater good old anne said dick when at last he and the others joined her dressed again with their sweaters on for warmth look shes got the food all ready proper little housewife arent you anne i bet if we stayed here for more than one night anne would have made some kind of larder and have arranged a good place to wash everything and be looking for somewhere to keep her dusters and broom youre so silly dick said anne you ought to be glad i like messing about with the food and getting it ready for you oh timmy shoo get away look at him hes shaken millions and millions of drops of lakewater all over the food you ought to have dried him george you know how he shakes himself after a swim sorry said george tim say youre sorry why must you be so violent about everything if i shook myself like that my ears and fingers would fly off into the air it was a lovely meal sitting there in the evening light watching the first stars come out in the sky the children and timmy were all tired but happy this was the beginning of their trip and beginnings were always lovely the days stretched out before you endlessly and somehow you felt certain that the sun would shine every single day they were not long in snuggling into their sleepingbags when they had finished the meal they had set them all together in a row so that they could talk if they wanted to timmy was thrilled he walked solemnly across the whole lot and was greeted with squeals and threats timmy how dare you when ive had such a big supper too timmy you brute you put all your great big feet down on me at once george you really might stop timmy from walking all over us like that i only hope hes not going to do it all night long timmy looked surprised at the shouts he settled down beside george after a vain attempt to get into her sleepingbag with her george turned her face away from his licks oh timmy i do love you but i wish you wouldnt make my face so wet julian look at that glorious star like a little round lamp what is it its not a star really its venus one of the planets said julian sleepily but its called the evening star fancy you not knowing that george dont they teach you anything at your school george tried to kick julian through her sleepingbag but she couldnt she gave it up and yawned so loudly that she set all the others yawning too anne fell asleep first she was the smallest and was more easily tired with long walks and rides than the others though she always kept up with them valiantly george gazed unblinkingly at the bright evening star for a minute and then fell asleep suddenly julian and dick talked quietly for a few minutes timmy was quite silent he was tired out with his miles and miles of running nobody stirred at all that night not even timmy he took no notice of a horde of rabbits who played not far off he hardly pricked an ear when an owl hooted nearby he didnt even stir when a beetle ran over his head but if george had waked and spoken his name timmy would have been wide awake at once standing over george and licking her whining gently george was the centre of his world night and day the next day was fair and bright it was lovely to wake up and feel the warm sun on their cheeks and hear a thrush singing his heart out it might be the very same thrush thought dick drowsily hes saying mind how you doit doit doit just like the other one did anne sat up cautiously she wondered if she should get up and have breakfast ready for the others or would they want a bathe first julian sat up next and yawned as he wriggled himself half out of his sleepingbag he grinned at anne hallo he said had a good night i feel fine this morning i feel rather stiff said anne but it will soon wear off hallo george you awake george grunted and snuggled down farther in her sleepingbag timmy pawed at her whining he wanted her to get up and go for a run with him shut up timmy said george from the depth of her bag im asleep im going for a bathe said julian anyone else coming i wont said anne it will be too cold for me this morning george doesnt seem to want to either you two boys go by yourselves ill have breakfast ready for you when you come back sorry i shant be able to have anything hot for you to drink but we didnt bring a kettle or anything like that julian and dick went off to the green pool still looking sleepy anne got out of her sleepingbag and dressed quickly she decided to go down to the pool with her sponge and flannel and wake herself up properly with the cold water george was still in her sleepingbag the two boys were almost at the pool ah now they could see it between the trees shining a bright emerald green it looked very inviting indeed they suddenly saw a bicycle standing beside a tree they looked at it in astonishment it wasnt one of theirs it must belong to someone else then they heard splashings from the pool and they hurried down to it was someone else bathing a boy was in the pool his golden head shining wet and smooth in the morning sun he was swimming powerfully across the pool leaving long ripples behind him as he went he suddenly saw dick and julian and swam over to them hallo he said wading out of the water you come for a swim too nice pool of mine isnt it what do you mean it isnt really your pool is it said julian well it belongs to my father thurlow kent said the boy both julian and dick had heard of thurlow kent one of the richest men in the country julian looked doubtfully at the boy if its a private pool we wont use it he said oh come on cried the boy and splashed cold water all over them race you to the other side and off all three of them went cleaving the green waters with their strong brown arms what a fine beginning to a sunny day richard anne was astonished to find three boys in the green pool instead of two she stood by the water with her sponge and flannel staring who was the third boy the three came back to the side of the pool where anne stood she looked at the strange boy shyly he was not much older than she was and not as big as julian or dick but he was sturdily made and had laughing blue eyes she liked he smoothed back his dripping hair this your sister he said to julian and dick hallo there hallo said anne and smiled whats your name richard he said richard kent whats yours anne said anne were on a biking tour the boys had had no time to introduce themselves they were still panting from their swim im julian and hes dick my brother said julian out of breath i say i hope were not trespassing on your land as well as on your water richard grinned well you are as a matter of fact but i give you free permission you can borrow my pool and my land as much as you like oh thanks said anne i suppose its your fathers property it didnt say private or anything so we didnt know would you like to come and have breakfast with us if youll dress with the others theyll bring you to where we camped last night she sponged her face and washed her hands in the pool hearing the boys chattering behind the bushes where they had left their clothes then she sped back to their sleepingplace meaning to tidy up the bags they had slept in and put out breakfast neatly but george was still fast asleep in her bag her head showing at the top with its mass of short curls that made her look like a boy george do wake up somebodys coming to breakfast said anne shaking her george shrugged away crossly not believing her it was just a trick to make her get up and help with the breakfast anne left her all right let her be found in her sleepingbag if she liked she began to unpack the food and set it out neatly what a good thing they had brought two extra bottles of limejuice now they could offer richard one the three boys came up their wet hair plastered down richard spotted george in the bag as timmy came over to meet him he fondled timmy who smelling that other dogs had been round richard at home sniffed him over with great interest whos that still asleep asked richard thats george said anne too sleepy to wake up come on ive got breakfast ready would you like to start off with rolls and anchovy and lettuce and theres limejuice if you want it george heard richards voice as he sat talking with the others and was astonished who was that she sat up blinking her hair tousled and short richard honestly thought she was a boy she looked like one and she was called george top of the morning to you george he said hope im not eating your share of the breakfast who are you demanded george the boys told her i live about three miles away said the boy i biked over here this morning for a swim i say that reminds me id better bring my bike up here and put it where i can see it ive had two stolen already through not having them under my eye he shot off to get his bike george took the opportunity of getting out of her sleepingbag and rushed off to dress she was back before richard was eating her breakfast he wheeled his bicycle as he came got it all right he said and flung it down beside him dont want to have to tell my father this ones gone like the others hes pretty fierce my fathers a bit fierce too said george does he whip you asked richard giving timmy a nice little titbit of roll and anchovy paste of course not said george hes just got a temper thats all mines got tempers and rages and furies and if anyone offends him or does him a wrong hes like an elephant never forgets said richard hes made plenty of enemies in his lifetime sometimes hes had his life threatened and hes had to take a bodyguard about with him this all sounded extremely thrilling dick halfwished he had a father like that i would be nice to talk to the other boys at school about his fathers bodyguard whats his bodyguard like asked anne full of curiosity oh they vary but theyre all big hefty fellows they look like ruffians and probably are said richard enjoying the interest the others were taking in him one he had last year was awful he had the thickest lips you ever saw and such a big nose that when you saw him sideways you really thought hed put a false one on just for fun gracious said anne he sounds horrible has your father still got him no he did something that annoyed dad i dont know what and after a perfectly furious row my father chucked him out said richard that was the end of him jolly good thing too i hated him he used to kick the dogs around terribly oh what a beast said george horrified she put her arm round timmy as if she was afraid somebody might suddenly kick him around too julian and dick wondered whether to believe all this they came to the conclusion that the tales richard told were very much exaggerated and they listened with amusement but not with such horror as the two girls who hung on every word that richard said wheres your father now said anne has he got a special bodyguard this very moment rather hes in america this week but hes flying home soon plus bodyguard said richard drinking the last of his limejuice from the bottle ummm thats good i say arent you lucky to be allowed to go off alone like this on your bikes and sleep where you like my mother never will let me shes always afraid something will happen to me perhaps youd better have a bodyguard too suggested julian slyly id soon give him the slip said richard as a matter of fact i have got a kind of a bodyguard who where asked anne looking all round as if she expected some enormous ruffian suddenly to appear well hes supposed to be my holiday tutor said richard tickling timmy round the ears hes called lomax and hes pretty awful im supposed to tell him every time i go out just as if i was a kid like anne here anne was indignant i dont have to tell anybody when i want to go off on my own she said actually i dont think wed be allowed to rush off completely on our own unless we had old timmy said dick honestly hes better than any ruffianly bodyguard or holiday tutor i wonder you dont have a dog oh ive got about five said richard airily what are their names asked george disbelievingly er bunter biscuit brownie bones and er bonzo said richard with a grin silly names said george scornfully fancy calling a dog biscuit you must be cracked you shut up said richard with a sudden scowl i dont stand people telling me im cracked well youll have to stand me telling you said george i do think its cracked to call a dog a nice decent dog by a name like biscuit ill fight you then said richard surprisingly and stood up come on you stand up george leapt to her feet julian shot out a hand and pulled her down again none of that he said to richard you ought to be ashamed of yourself why flared out richard whose face had gone very red evidently he and his father shared the same fierceness of temper well you dont fight girls said julian scornfully or do you correct me if im wrong richard stared at him in amazement what do you mean he said girls of course i dont fight girls no decent boy hits a girl but its this boy here i want to fight what do you call him george to his great surprise julian dick and anne roared with laughter timmy barked madly too pleased at the sudden ending of the quarrel only george looked mutinous and cross whats up now asked richard aggressively whats all the fun and games about richard george isnt a boy shes a girl explained dick at last my goodness she was just about to accept your challenge and fight you too two fierce little foxterriers having a scrap richards mouth fell open in an even greater astonishment he blushed redder than ever he looked sheepishly at george are you really a girl he said you behave so like a boy and you look like one too sorry george is your name really george no georgina said george thawing a little at richards awkward apology and pleased that he had honestly thought her a boy she did so badly want to be a boy and not a girl good thing i didnt fight you said richard fervently i should have knocked you flat well i like that said george flaring up all over again julian pushed her back with his hand now shut up you two and dont behave like idiots wheres the map its time we had a squint at it and decided what we are going to do for today how far were going to ride and where were making for by the evening fortunately george and richard both gave in with a good grace soon all six heads timmys too were bent over the map julian made his decision well make for middlecombe woods see there they are on the map thats decided then itll be a jolly nice ride it might be a nice ride but it was going to be something very much more than that six instead of five look here said richard when they had tidied up everything buried their bits of litter and looked to see that no one had got a puncture in a tyre look here ive got an aunt who lives in the direction of those woods if i can get my mother to say i can come with you will you let me i can go and see my aunt on the way then julian looked at richard doubtfully he wasnt very sure if richard really would go and ask permission well if you arent too long about it he said of course we dont mind you coming with us we can drop you at your aunts on the way ill go straight off now and ask my mother said richard eagerly and he ran for his bicycle ill meet you at crokers corner you saw it on the map that will save time because then i shant have to come back here its not much farther than my home right said julian ive got to adjust my brakes and that will take ten minutes or so youll have time to go home and ask permission and join us later well wait for you at least well wait for ten minutes at crokers corner if you dont turn up well know you didnt get permission tell your mother well leave you safely at your aunts richard shot off on his bicycle looking excited anne began to clear up and george helped her timmy got in everyones way sniffing about for dropped crumbs anyone would think he was halfstarved said anne he had a lot more breakfast than i had timmy if you walk through my legs again ill tie you up julian adjusted his brakes with dicks help in about fifteen minutes they were ready to set off they had planned where to stop to buy food for their lunch and although the journey to middlecombe woods was a longer trip than they had made the day before they felt able to cope with more miles on the second day timmy was eager to set off too he was a big dog and enjoyed all the exercise he was getting itll take a bit of your fat off said dick to timmy we dont like fat dogs you know they waddle and they puff dick timmys never been fat said george indignantly and then stopped as she saw dicks grin he was pulling her leg as usual she kicked herself why did she always rise like that when dick teased her through timmy she gave him a friendly punch they all mounted their bicycles timmy ran ahead pleased they came to a lane and rode down it avoiding the ruts they came out into a road it was not a main road for the children didnt like those they were too full of traffic and dust they liked the shady lanes or the country roads where they met only a few carts or a farmers car now dont lets miss crokers corner said julian it should be along this way somewhere according to the map george if you get into ruts like that youll be thrown off all right i know that said george i only got into one because timmy swerved across my wheel hes after a rabbit or something timmy dont get left behind you idiot timmy bounded reluctantly after the little party exercise was wonderful but it did mean leaving a lot of marvellous wayside smells unsniffed at it was a dreadful waste of smells timmy thought they came to crokers corner sooner than they thought the signpost proclaimed the name and there leaning against the post sitting on his bicycle was richard beaming at them youve been jolly quick getting back home and then on to here said julian what did your mother say she didnt mind a bit so long as i was with you said richard i can go to my aunts for the night she said havent you brought pyjamas or anything with you asked dick there are always spare ones at my aunts explained richard hurray it will be marvellous to be out on my own all day with you no mr lomax to bother me with this and that come on they all cycled on together richard would keep trying to ride three abreast and julian had to warn him that cyclists were not allowed to do that i dont care sang richard who seemed in very high spirits who is there to stop us anyway i shall stop you said julian and richard ceased grinning at once julian could sound very stern when he liked dick winked at george and she winked back they had both come to the conclusion that richard was very spoilt and liked his own way well he wouldnt get it if he came up against old julian they stopped at eleven for icecreams and drinks richard seemed to have a lot of money he insisted on buying icecreams for all of them even timmy once again they bought food for their lunch new bread farmhouse butter cream cheese crisp lettuce fat red radishes and a bunch of spring onions richard bought a magnificent chocolate cake he saw in a firstclass cakeshop gracious that must have cost you a fortune said anne how are we going to carry it woof said timmy longingly no i certainly shant let you carry it said anne oh dear well have to cut it in half i think and two people can share the carrying its such an enormous cake on they went again getting into the real country now with villages few and far between a farm here and there showed up on the hillsides with cows and sheep and fowls it was a peaceful quiet scene with the sun spilling down over everything and the blue april sky above patched with great white cottonwool clouds this is grand said richard i say doesnt timmy ever get tired hes panting like anything now yes i think we ought to find somewhere for our lunch said julian looking at his watch weve done a very good run this morning of course a lot of the way has been downhill this afternoon well probably be slower because well be getting into hilly country they found a spot to picnic in they chose the sunny side of a hedge looking downhill into a small valley sheep and lambs were in the field they sat in the lambs were very inquisitive and one came right up to anne and bleated do you want a bit of my bread asked anne and held it out to the lamb timmy watched indignantly fancy handing out food to those silly little creatures he growled a little and george shushed him soon all the lambs were crowding round quite unafraid and one even tried to put its little front legs up on to georges shoulders that was too much for timmy he gave such a sudden fierce growl that all the lambs shot off at once oh dont be so jealous timmy said george take this sandwich and behave yourself now youve frightened away the lambs and they wont come back they all ate the food and then drank their limejuice and gingerbeer the sun was very hot soon they would all be burnt brown and it was only april how marvellous julian thought lazily that they were really lucky to have such weather it would be awful to have to bike along all day in the pouring rain once again the children snoozed in the afternoon sun richard too and the little lambs skipped nearer and nearer one actually leapt on to julian as he slept and he sat upright with a jerk timmy he began if you leap on me again like that ill but it wasnt timmy it was a lamb julian laughed to himself he sat for a few minutes and watched the little white creatures playing im king of the castle with an old coop then he lay down again are we anywhere near your aunts house julian asked richard when they once more mounted their bicycles if were anywhere near great giddings we shall soon be there said richard riding without his handlebars and almost ending up in the ditch i didnt notice it on the map julian tried to remember yes we should be at great giddings round about teatime say five oclock or thereabouts well leave you at your aunts house for tea if you like oh no thank you said richard quickly id much rather have tea with you i do wish i could come on this tour with you i suppose i couldnt possibly you could telephone my mother dont be an ass said julian you can have tea with us if you like but we drop you at your aunts as arranged see no nonsense about that they came to great giddings at about ten past five although it was called great it was really very small there was a little teaplace that said homemade cakes and jams so they went there for tea the woman who kept it was a plump cheerful soul fond of children she guessed she would make very little out of the tea she served to five healthy children but that didnt matter she set to work to cut three big plates of wellbuttered slices of bread put out apricot jam raspberry and strawberry and a selection of homemade buns that made the childrens mouths water she knew richard quite well because he had sometimes been to her cottage with his aunt i suppose youll be going to stay with her tonight she said to richard and he nodded his mouth full of ginger cake it was a lovely tea anne felt as if she wouldnt be able to eat any supper at all that night even timmy seemed to have satisfied his enormous appetite i think we ought to pay you double price for our gorgeous tea said julian but the woman wouldnt hear of it no no it was lovely to see them all enjoying her cakes she didnt want double price some people are so awfully nice and generous said anne as they mounted their bicycles to ride off again you just cant help liking them i do hope i can cook like that when i grow up if you do julian and i will always live with you and not dream of getting married said dick promptly and they all laughed now for richards aunt said julian do you know where the house is richard yes thats it over there said richard and rode up to a gate well thanks awfully for your company i hope ill see you again soon i have a feeling i shall goodbye he rode up the drive and disappeared what a sudden goodbye said george puzzled isnt he odd odd happenings they all thought it really was a little odd to disappear so suddenly like that with just a casual goodbye julian wondered if he ought to have gone with him and delivered him safely on the doorstep dont be an ass julian said dick scornfully what do you think can happen to him from the front gate to the front door nothing of course its just that i dont trust that young fellow said julian you know i really wasnt sure he had asked his mother if he could come with us to tell you the truth i thought that too said anne he did get to crokers corner so very quickly didnt he and he had quite a long way to go really and he had to find his mother and talk to her and all that yes ive half a mind to pop up to the aunts house and see if she expected him said julian but on second thoughts he didnt go he would feel so silly if the aunt was there with richard and all was well they would think that he and the others ought to be asked in so after debating the matter for a few minutes they all rode off again they wanted to get to middlecombe woods fairly soon because there were no villages between great giddings and middlecombe so they would have to find the woods and then go on to find a farmhouse somewhere to buy food for supper and breakfast they hadnt been able to buy any in the shops at great giddings because it was early closing day and they hadnt liked to ask the teashop woman to sell them anything they felt they had taken quite enough of her food already they came to middlecombe woods and found a very fine place to camp in for the night it was in a little dell set with primroses and violets a perfectly hidden place secure from all prying eyes and surely unknown even to tramps this is glorious said anne we must be miles away from anywhere i hope we can find some farmhouse or something that will sell us food though i know we dont feel hungry now but we shall i think ive got a puncture blow it said dick looking at his back tyre its a slow one fortunately but i think i wont risk coming along to look for farmhouses till ive mended it right said julian and anne neednt come either she looks a bit tired george and i will go we wont take our bikes its easier to walk through the woods we may be an hour or so but dont worry timmy will know the way back all right so we shant lose you julian and george set off on foot with timmy following timmy too was tired but nothing would have made him stay behind with anne and dick he must go with his beloved george anne put her bicycle carefully into the middle of a bush you never knew when a tramp might be about watching to steal something it didnt matter when timmy was there because he would growl if a tramp came within a mile of them dick called out that he would mend his puncture now he had found the hole already where a small nail had gone in she sat near to dick watching him she was glad to rest she wondered if the others had found a farmhouse yet dick worked steadily at mending the puncture they had been there together about half an hour when they heard sounds dick lifted his head and listened can you hear something he said to anne she nodded yes somebodys shouting i wonder why they both listened again then they distinctly heard yells help julian where are you help they shot to their feet who was calling julian for help it wasnt georges voice the yells grew louder to panicstricken shrieks julian dick why it must be richard said dick amazed what in the world does he want whats happened anne was pale she didnt like sudden happenings like this shall we shall we go and find him she said there was a crashing not far off as if somebody was making his way through the undergrowth it was rather dark among the trees and anne and dick could see nothing at first dick yelled loudly hey is that you richard were here the crashing noise redoubled im coming squealed richard wait for me wait for me they waited soon they saw richard coming stumbling as fast as he could between the trees here we are called dick whatevers the matter richard staggered towards them he looked frightened out of his life theyre after me he panted you must save me i want timmy hell bite them whos after you asked dick amazed wheres timmy wheres julian cried richard looking round in despair theyve gone to the farmhouse to get some food said dick theyll be back soon richard whatevers the matter are you mad you look awful the boy took no notice of the questions where has julian gone i want timmy tell me the way they went i cant stay here theyll catch me they went along there said dick showing richard the path you can just see the tracks of their feet richard whatever is but richard was gone he fled down the path at top speed calling at the top of his voice julian timmy anne and dick stared at one another in surprise what had happened to richard why wasnt he at his aunts house he must be mad its no good going after him said dick we shall only lose the way and not be able to find this place again and the others will miss us and go hunting and get lost too what is the matter with richard he kept saying somebody was after him they were after him said anne hes got some bee in his bonnet about something bats in the belfry said dick mad dippy daft well hell give julian and george a shock when he runs into them if he does the odds are he will miss them altogether im going to climb this tree and see if i can see anything of richard or the others said anne its tall and its easy to climb you finish mending your puncture i should just love to know what happens to richard dick went back to his bicycle puzzled anne climbed the tree she climbed well and was soon at the top she gazed out over the countryside there was an expanse of fields on one side and woods stretched away on the other she looked over the darkening fields trying to see if a farmhouse was anywhere near but she could see nothing dick was just finishing his puncture when he heard another noise in the woods was it that idiot of a richard coming back he listened the noise came nearer it wasnt a crashing noise like richard had made it was a stealthy noise as if people were gradually closing in dick didnt much like it who was coming or perhaps what was coming was it some wild animal perhaps a badger and its mate the boy stood listening a silence came no more movements no more rustling had he imagined it all he wished anne and the others were near him it was eerie standing there in the darkening wood waiting and watching he decided that he had imagined it all he thought it would be a very good idea if he lighted his bicycle lamp then the light would soon dispel his silly ideas he fumbled about for it on the front of his handlebars he switched it on and a very comforting little glow at once spread a circle of light in the little dell dick was just about to call up to anne to tell her his absurd fears when the noises came again there was absolutely no mistake about them this time a brilliant light suddenly pierced through the trees and fell on dick he blinked ah so there you are you little misery said a harsh voice and someone came striding over to the dell somebody else followed behind what do you mean asked dick amazed he could not see who the men were because of the brilliant torchlight in his eyes weve been chasing you for miles havent we and you thought youd get away but wed got you all the time said the voice i dont understand this said dick putting on a bold voice who are you you know very well who we are said the voice didnt you run away screaming as soon as you saw rooky he went one way after you and we went another and we soon got you didnt we now you come along with us my pretty all this explained one thing clearly to dick that it was richard they had been after for some reason or other and they thought he was richard im not the boy youre looking for he said youll get into trouble if you touch me whats your name then asked the first man dick told him oh so youre dick and isnt dick short for richard you cant fool us with that babytalk said the first man youre the richard we want all right richard kent see im not richard kent shouted dick as he felt the mans hand clutching his arm suddenly you take your hands off me you wait till the police hear of this they wont hear of it said the man they wont hear anything at all come on and dont struggle or shout or youll be sorry once youre at owls dene well deal properly with you anne was sitting absolutely petrified up in the tree she couldnt move or speak she tried to call out to poor dick but her tongue wouldnt say a word she had to sit there and hear her brother being dragged away by two strange ruffians she almost fell out of the tree in fright and she heard him shouting and yelling when he was dragged away she could hear the sound of crashing for a long time she began to cry she didnt dare to climb down because she was trembling so much she was afraid she would lose her hold and fall she must wait for george and julian to come back suppose they didnt suppose they had been caught too she would be all by herself in the tree all night long anne sobbed up in the treetop holding on tightly the stars came out above her head and she saw the very bright one again and then she heard the sound of footsteps and voices she stiffened up in the tree who was it this time oh let it be julian and george and timmy let it be julian george and timmy richard tells a queer tale julian and george had managed to find a little farmhouse tucked away in a hollow a trio of dogs set up a terrific barking as they drew near timmy growled and the hair rose up on his neck george put her hand on his collar i wont go any nearer with timmy she said i dont want him to be set on by three dogs at once so julian went down to the farmhouse by himself the dogs made such a noise and looked so fierce that he paused in the farmyard he was not in the least afraid of dogs but these looked most unpleasant especially one big mongrel whose teeth were bared in a very threatening manner a voice called out to him clear off you we dont want no strangers here when strangers come our eggs and hens go too good evening called julian politely we are four children camping out in the woods for the night could you let us have any food ill pay well for it there was a pause the man pulled his head in at the window he was shouting from and was evidently speaking to someone inside he stuck it out again i told you we dont hold with strangers here never did weve only got plain bread and butter and we can give you some hardboiled eggs and milk and a bit of ham thats all thatll do fine called julian cheerily just what wed like shall i come and get it not unless you want to be torn to pieces by them dogs came back the voice you wait there ill be out when the eggs is done blow said julian walking back to george that means well have to kick our heels here for a while what an unpleasant fellow i dont think much of his place do you george agreed with him it was illkept the barn was falling to bits rusty bits of machinery lay here and there in the thick grass the three dogs kept up a continual barking and howling but they did not come any nearer george still kept her hand firmly on timmy he was bristling all over what a lonely place to live in said julian no house within miles i should think no telephone i wonder what theyd do if somebody was ill or had an accident and needed help i hope theyll hurry up with that food said george getting impatient itll be dark soon im getting hungry too at last somebody came out of the tumbledown farmhouse it was a bearded man stooping and old with long untidy hair and a pronounced limp he had a grim and ugly face neither julian nor george liked him here you are he said waving his three dogs away behind him get back you he aimed a kick at the nearest dog and it yelped with pain oh dont said george you hurt him hes my dog aint he said the man angrily you mind your own business he kicked out at another dog and scowled at george what about the food said julian holding out his hand anxious to be gone before trouble came between timmy and the other dogs george take timmy back a bit hes upsetting the dogs well i like that said george its those other dogs that are upsetting him she dragged timmy back a few yards and he stood there with all his hackles up on his neck growling in a horrible way julian took the food which was done up carelessly in old brown paper thanks he said how much five pounds said the old man surprisingly dont be silly said julian he looked quickly at the food ill give you twentyfive pence for it and thats more than its worth theres hardly any ham i said five pounds said the man sullenly julian looked at him he must be mad he thought he held out the food to the ugly old fellow well take it back he said i havent got five pounds to give you for food twentyfive pence is the most i can spare good night the old man pushed the food back and held out his other hand in silence julian fished in his pocket and brought out twentyfive pence he placed them in the mans dirty hand wondering why on earth the fellow had asked him for such a ridiculous sum before the man put the money in his pocket clear off he said suddenly in a growling voice we dont want strangers here stealing our goods ill set my dogs on you if you come again julian turned to go halfafraid that the extraordinary old man would set his dogs on him the fellow stood there in the halfdark yelling abuse at julian and george as they made their way out of the farmyard well well never go there again said george furious at their treatment hes mad as a hatter yes and i dont much fancy his food either said julian still its all well get tonight they followed timmy back to the woods they were glad they had him because otherwise they might have missed the way but timmy knew it once he had been along a certain route timmy always knew it again he ran on now sniffing here and there occasionally waiting for the others to catch him up then he stiffened and growled softly george put her hand on his collar somebody must be coming somebody was coming it was richard on his way to find them he was still shouting and yelling and the noise he made had already come to timmys sharp ears it soon came to julians and georges too as they stood there waiting julian where are you wheres timmy i want timmy theyre after me i tell you theyre after me listen it sounds like richard said julian startled what in the world is he doing here and yelling like that too come on we must find out somethings happened i hope dick and anne are all right they ran up the path as fast as they could in the twilight soon they met richard who had now stopped shouting and was stumbling along halfsobbing richard whats up cried julian richard ran to him and flung himself against him timmy did not go to him but stood there in surprise george stared through the twilight puzzled what in the world had happened julian oh julian im scared stiff panted richard hanging on to julians arm pull yourself together said julian in the calm voice that had made a good effect on richard i bet youre just making a silly fuss whats happened did you find your aunt was out or something and come racing after us my aunts away said richard speaking in a calmer voice she away said julian in surprise but didnt your mother know that when she said you could i didnt ask my mothers permission to come cried richard i didnt even go back home when you thought i did i just biked straight to crokers corner and waited for you i wanted to come with you you see and i knew my mother wouldnt let me this was said with a great air of bravado julian was disgusted im ashamed of you he said telling us lies like that i didnt know my aunt was away said richard all his sudden cockiness gone when he heard julians scornful voice i thought shed be there and i was going to tell her to telephone my mother and say id gone for a trip with you then i thought id come biking after you and and and tell us your aunt was away and could you come with us finished julian still scornfully a deceitful and ridiculous plan id have sent you back at once you might have known that yes i know but i might have had a whole night camping out with you said richard in a small voice ive never done things like that i what i want to know is what were you scared of when you came rushing along yelling and crying said julian impatiently oh julian it was horrible said richard and he suddenly clutched julians arm again you see i biked down back to my aunts gate and out into the lane and i was just going along the way to middlecombe woods when a car met me and i saw who was in the car well who said julian feeling as if he could shake richard it was it was rooky said richard in a trembling voice whos he said julian and george gave an impatient click would richard never tell his story properly dont you remember i told you about him he was the fellow with thick lips and a huge nose that my father had for a bodyguard last year and he chucked him out said richard he always swore hed have his revenge on my father and on me too because i told tales about him to dad and it was because of that he was sacked so when i caught sight of him in the car i was terrified i see said julian seeing light what happened then rooky recognized me and turned the car round and chased me on my bike said richard beginning to tremble again as he remembered that alarming ride i pedalled for all i was worth and when i got to middlecombe woods i rode into the path there hoping the car couldnt follow it couldnt of course but the men leapt out there were three of them two i didnt know and they chased me on foot i pedalled and pedalled and then i ran into a tree or something and fell off i chucked my bike into a bush and ran into the thick undergrowth to hide go on said julian as richard paused what next the men split up then rooky went one way to find me and the other two went another way i waited till i thought they were gone then i crept out and tore down the path again hoping to find you i wanted timmy you see i thought hed go for the men timmy growled he certainly would have gone for them two of the men must have been hiding waiting to hear me start up again went on richard and as soon as i began to run they chased after me i put them off the trail though i dodged and hid and hid and dodged and then i came to dick he was mending a puncture but you werent with him and it was you and timmy i wanted i knew the men would soon be catching me up you see so i tore on and on and at last i found you ive never been so glad in my life it was a most extraordinary story but julian hardly paused to think about it an alarming thought had come into his head what about dick and anne what would have happened to them if the men had suddenly come across them quick he said to george we must get back to the others hurry whats the best thing to do stumbling through the dark wood julian and george hurried as best they could timmy hurried too knowing that something was worrying both his friends richard followed behind halfcrying again he really had been very much afraid they came at last to the little dell where they had planned to spend the night it was quite dark julian called loudly dick anne where are you george had made her way to where she had hidden her bicycle she fumbled for the lamp and switched it on she took it off and flashed it round the dell there was dicks bicycle with the puncture repair outfit on the ground beside it but no dick and no anne what had happened anne yelled julian in alarm dick come here were back and then a small trembling voice came down from the treetop overhead oh julian oh julian im here its anne yelled julian his heart leaping in relief anne where are you up in this tree called back anne in a stronger voice oh ju ive been so frightened i didnt dare climb down in case i fell dick where is dick demanded julian a sob came down to him two horrible men came and theyve taken him away they thought he was richard annes voice became a wail julian felt that he must get her down the tree so that she could be with them and be comforted he spoke to george shine that lamp up here im going up to fetch anne george silently shone the light of the lamp on the tree julian went up like a cat he came to anne who was still clinging tightly to a branch anne ill help you down come on now you cant fall im just below you ill guide your feet to the right branches anne was only too glad to be helped down she was cold and miserable and she longed to be with the others slowly she came down with julians help and he lifted her to the ground she clung to him and he put his arm round his young sister its all right anne im with you now and heres george too and old timmy whos that said anne suddenly seeing richard in the shadows only richard hes behaved badly said julian grimly its all because of him and his idiotic behaviour that this has happened now tell us slowly and carefully about dick and the two men anne anne told him not missing out anything at all timmy stood near her licking her hand all the time that was very comforting indeed timmy always knew when anyone was in trouble anne felt very much better when she had julians arm round her and timmys tongue licking her its quite clear whats happened said julian when anne had finished her alarming tale this man rooky recognized richard and he and the other two came after him seeing a chance to kidnap him and so get even with his father rooky was the only one who knew richard and he wasnt the man who caught dick the others got him and they didnt know he wasnt richard and of course hearing that his name was dick they jumped to the conclusion that he was richard because dick is short for richard but dick told them he wasnt richard kent said anne earnestly of course but they thought he wasnt telling the truth said julian and theyve taken him off what did you say was the name of the place they were going to it sounded like owls dene said anne can we go there julian if you told the men dick was dick and not richard theyd let him go wouldnt they oh yes said julian in any case as soon as that fellow rooky sets eyes on him hell know theres a mistake been made i think we can get old dick away all right a voice came out of the shadows nearby what about me will you take me home first i dont want to run into rooky again im certainly not going to waste time taking you home said julian coldly if it hadnt been for you and your tomfoolery we wouldnt have run into this trouble youll have to come with us im going to find dick first but i cant come with you im afraid of rooky wailed richard well stay here then said julian determined to teach richard a lesson that was even worse richard howled loudly dont leave me here dont now look here if you come with us you can always be dropped at a house somewhere or at a policestation and get yourself taken home somehow said julian exasperated youre old enough to look after yourself im fed up with you anne was sorry for richard although he had brought all this trouble on them she knew how dreadful it was to feel really frightened she put out a hand and touched him kindly richard dont be a baby julian will see that youre all right hes just feeling cross with you now but hell soon get over it dont you be too sure about that said julian to anne pretending to be sterner than he really felt what richard wants is a jolly good hiding hes untruthful and deceitful and an absolute baby give me another chance almost wept poor richard who had never in his life been spoken to like this before he tried to hate julian for saying such things to him but oddly enough he couldnt he only respected and admired him all the more julian said no more to richard he really thought the boy was too feeble for words it was a nuisance that they had him with them he would be no help at all simply a tiresome nuisance what are we going to do julian asked george who had been very silent she was fond of dick and was veryworried about him where was owls dene how could they possibly find it in the night and what about those awful men how would they treat julian if he demanded dick back at once julian was fearless and straightforward but the men wouldnt like him any the better for that well now what are we going to do repeated julian and he fell silent its no good going back to that farm and asking for help is it said george after a pause not a bit of good said julian at once that old man wouldnt help anyone and theres no telephone laid on as we saw no that farms no good what a pity wheres the map said george a sudden idea coming into her head would owls dene be named on it do you think not if its a house said julian only places are named there youd want a frightfully big map to show every house well anyway lets look at the map and see if it shows any more farms or villages said george who felt as if she must do something even if it was only looking at a map julian produced the map and unfolded it he and the girls bent over it by the light of the bicycle lamp and richard peered over their shoulders even timmy tried to look forcing his head under their arms get away tim said julian look heres where we are middlecombe woods see my word we are in a lonely spot theres not a village for miles certainly no village was marked the countryside was shown hilly and wooded with a stream here and there and thirdclass roads now and again but no village no church no bridge even was marked anywhere anne gave a sudden exclamation and pointed to the contour of a hill on the map look see what that hills called owls hill read out julian yes i see what youre getting at anne if a house was built on that hill it might be called owls dene because of the name of the hill whats more a building is marked there it hasnt a name of course it might be a farmhouse an old ruin or a big house of some kind i think its very likely thats where owls dene is said george i bet its that very house lets take our bikes and go a huge sigh from richard attracted their attention now whats the matter with you said julian nothing im hungry thats all said richard the others suddenly realized that they too were hungry in fact terribly hungry it was a long long time since tea julian remembered the food he and george had brought from the farm should they have it now or should they eat some on their way to owls hill better eat as we go said julian every minute we waste means a minute of worry for dick i wonder what theyd do with him if rooky sees him and says hes not me not the boy they want said richard suddenly set him free i should think said george ruffians like that would probably turn him loose in a deserted countryside and not care tuppence if he found his way home or not weve absolutely got to find out whats happened whether hes at owls dene or been set free or what i cant come with you suddenly wailed richard why demanded julian because i havent got my bike said richard dolefully i chucked it away you remember and goodness knows where it is id never find it again he can have dicks said anne there it is over there with the puncture mended too oh yes said richard relieved for one frightful moment i thought id have to be left behind julian secretly wished he could be left behind richard was more trouble than he was worth yes you can take dicks bike he said but no idiotic behaviour with it mind no riding without handlebars or any errand boy tricks life that its dicks bike not yours richard said nothing julian was always ticking him off he supposed he deserved it but it wasnt at all pleasant he pulled at dicks bike and found the lamp was missing dick of course had taken it off he hunted round for it and found it on the ground dick had let it fall and the switch had turned itself off when the lamp hit the ground when richard pressed the switch down the lamp lighted again good now come on said julian fetching his bicycle too ill hand out food to eat as we go we must try to find our way to owls hill as quick as ever we can moonlight adventure the four of them rode carefully down the rough woodland path they were glad when they came out into a lane julian stopped for a moment to take his bearings now according to the map we ought to go to the right here then take the left at the fork some way down and then circle a hill by the road at the bottom and then ride a mile or two in a little valley till we come to the foot of owls hill if we meet anyone we could ask them about owls dene said anne hopefully we shant meet anyone out at night in this district said julian for one thing its far from any village and there will be no farmer no policeman no traveller for miles we cant hope to meet anyone the moon was up and the sky cleared as they rode down the lane it was soon as bright as day we could switch off our lamps and save the batteries said julian we can see quite well were out of the woods and in the moonlight rather weird isnt it i always think moonlights queer because although it shines so brightly on everything you can never see much colour anywhere said anne she switched off her lamp too she glanced down at timmy switch off your headlamps timmy she said which made richard give a sudden giggle julian smiled it was nice to hear anne being cheerful again timmys eyes are rather like headlamps arent they said richard i say what about that food julian right said julian and he fished in his basket but it was very difficult to get it out with one hand and try to hand it to the others better stop for a few minutes after all he said at last ive already dropped a hardboiled egg i think come on lets stack our bikes by the side of the road for three minutes and gulp down something just to satisfy us for now richard was only too pleased the girls were so hungry that they too thought it a good idea they leapt off their bicycles in the moonlit road and went to the little copse at the side it was a pinecopse and the ground below was littered with dry brown pineneedles lets squat here for a minute or two said julian i say whats that over there everyone looked its a tumbledown hut or something said george and she went nearer to see yes thats all some old cottage fallen to bits theres only part of the walls left rather an eerie little place they went to sit down under the pinetrees julian shared out the food timmy got his bit too though not so much as he would have liked they sat there in the pine shadows munching hungrily as fast as they could i say can anyone hear what i hear said julian raising his head it sounds like a car they all listened julian was right a car was purring silently through the countryside what a bit of luck if only it comes this way said julian we could stop it and ask it for help it could take us to the nearest policestation at any rate they left their food in the little copse and went to the roadside they could see no headlights shining anywhere but they could still hear the noise of the car very quiet engine said julian probably a powerful car it hasnt got its headlights on because of the bright moonlight its coming nearer said george its coming down this lane yes it is so it was the noise of the engine came nearer and nearer the children got ready to leap out into the road to stop the car and then the noise of the engine died away suddenly the moon shone down on a big streamlined car that had stopped a little way down the lane it had no lights at all not even sidelights julian put out his hand to stop the others from rushing into the road and shouting wait he said this is just a bit queer they waited keeping in the shadows the car had stopped not far from the tumbledown hut a door opened on the offside a man got out and rushed across the road to the shadow of the hedge there he seemed to be carrying a bundle of some kind a low whistle sounded the call of an owl came back an answering signal thought julian intensely curious about all this i wonder whats happening keep absolutely quiet he breathed to the others george look after timmy dont let him growl but timmy knew when he had to be quiet he didnt even give a whine he stood like a statue ears pricked eyes watching the lane nothing happened for a while julian moved very cautiously to the shelter of another tree from where he could see better he could see the tumbledown shack he saw a shadow moving towards it from some trees beyond he saw a man waiting the man from the car probably who were they what in the world could they be doing here at this time of night the man from the trees came at last to the man from the car there was a rapid interchange of words but julian could not hear what they were he was sure that the men had no idea at all that he and the other children were near he cautiously crept to yet another tree and peered from the shadows to try and see what was happening dont be long he heard one man say dont bring your things to the car stuff them down the well julian could not see properly what the man was doing but he thought he must be changing his clothes yes now he was putting on the others probably from the bundle the first man had brought from the car julian was more and more curious what a queer business who was the second man a refugee a spy the man who had changed his clothes now picked up his discarded ones and went to the back of the shack he came back without them and followed the first man across the lane to the waiting car even before the door had closed the engine was purring and the car was away it passed by the pinecopse where the children were watching and they all shrank back as it raced by before it had gone very far it was travelling very fast indeed julian joined the others well what do you make of all that he said funny business isnt it i watched a man changing his clothes goodness knows why hes left them somewhere at the back of the shack down a well i think i heard them say shall we see yes lets said george puzzled i say did you see the number on the car i only managed to spot the letters kmf i saw the numbers said anne and it was a black bentley yes black bentley kmf said richard up to some funny business ill be bound they made their way to the ruined shack and pushed through overgrown weeds and bushes into the backyard there was a brokendown well there most of its brickwork missing it was covered by an old wooden lid julian removed it it was still heavy though rotten with age he peered down the well but there was nothing at all to be seen it was far too deep to see to the bottom by the light of a bicycle lamp not much to be seen there said julian replacing the lid i expect it was his clothes he threw down wonder why he changed them do you think he could be an escaped prisoner said anne suddenly hed have to change his prison clothes wouldnt he that would be the most important thing for him to do is there a prison near here nobody knew dont remember noticing one on the map said julian no somehow i dont think the man was an escaped prisoner more likely a spy dropped down in this desolate countryside and supplied with clothes or perhaps a deserter from the army thats even more likely well whatever it is i dont like it and im jolly glad the cars gone with the prisoner or deserter or spy whatever he is said anne what a curious thing that we should just be nearby when this happened the men would never never guess there were four children and a dog watching just a few yards away lucky for us they didnt know said julian they wouldnt have been at all pleased now come on weve wasted enough time lets get back to our food i hope timmy hasnt eaten it all we left it on the ground timmy hadnt eaten even a crumb he was sitting patiently by the food occasionally sniffing at it all that bread and ham and eggs waiting there and nobody to eat it good dog said george youre very very trustable timmy you shall have a big bit of bread and ham for your reward timmy gulped it down in one mouthful but there was no more for him to have the others only just had enough for themselves and ate every crumb they rose to their feet in a very few minutes and went to get their bicycles now for owls hill again julian and lets hope we dont come across any more queer happenings tonight weve had quite enough owls dene on owls hill off they went again cycling fast in the brilliant moonlight even when the moon went behind a cloud it was still light enough to ride without lights they rode for what seemed like miles and then came to a steep hill is this owls hill said anne as they dismounted to walk up it it was too steep to ride yes said julian at least i think so unless weve come quite wrong but i dont think we have now the thing is shall we find owls dene at the top or not and how shall we know it is owls dene we could ring the bell and ask said anne julian laughed that was so like anne maybe well have to do that he said but well scout round a bit first they pushed their bicycles up the steep road hedges bordered each side and fields lay beyond there were no animals in them that the children could see no horses sheep or cows look said anne suddenly i can see a building at least im sure i can see chimneys they looked where she pointed yes certainly they were chimneys tall brick chimneys that looked old looks like an elizabethan mansion with chimneys like that said julian he paused and took a good look it must be a big place we ought to come to a drive or something soon they pushed on with their bicycles gradually the house came into view it was more like a mansion and in the moonlight it looked old rather grand and very beautiful there are the gates said julian thankfully he was tired of pushing his bicycle up the hill theyre shut hope theyre not locked as they drew near to the great wroughtiron gates they slowly opened the children paused in surprise why were they opening not for them that was certain then they heard the sound of a car in the distance of course that was what the gates were opening for the car however was not coming up the hill it was coming down the drive on the other side of the gates get out of sight quickly said julian we dont want to be seen yet they crouched down in the ditch with their bicycles as a car came slowly out of the open gates julian gave an exclamation and nudged george see that its the black bentley again kmf how mysterious said george surprised whats it doing rushing about the country at night and picking up stray men taking them to this place too i wonder if it is owls dene the car went by and disappeared round a bend in the hill the children came out of the ditch with timmy and their bicycles lets walk cautiously up to the gates said julian theyre still open funny how they opened when the car came i never saw anyone by them they walked boldly up to the open gates look said julian pointing up to the great brick posts from which the gates were hung they all looked and exclaimed at the name shining there well so it is owls dene after all theres the name in brass letters owls dene weve found it come on said julian wheeling his bicycle through the gateway well go in and snoop round we might be lucky enough to find old dick somewhere about they all went through the gates and then anne clutched julian in fright she pointed silently behind them the gates were closing again but nobody was there to shut them they closed silently and smoothly all by themselves there was something very weird about that whos shutting them whispered anne in a scared voice i think it must be done by machinery whispered back julian probably worked from the house lets go back and see if we can find any machinery that works them they left their bicycles by the side of the drive and walked back to the gates julian looked for a handle or latch to open them but there was none he pulled at the gates they did not budge it was quite impossible to open them they had been shut and locked by some kind of machinery and nothing and nobody could open them but that special machinery blow said julian and he sounded so angry that the others looked at him in surprise well dont you see were locked in were as much prisoners here as dick is if hes here too we cant get out through the gates and if you take a look youll see a high wall running round the property from the gates and i dont mind betting it goes the whole way round we cant get out even if we want to they went back thoughtfully to their bicycles better wheel them a little way into the trees and leave them said julian they hinder us too much now well leave them and go snooping quietly round the house hope there are no dogs they left their bicycles well hidden among the trees at the side of the wide drive the drive was not at all wellkept it was mossy and weeds grew all over it it was bare only where the wheels of cars had passed shall we walk up the drive or keep to the side asked george keep to the side said julian we should easily be seen in the moonlight walking up the drive so they kept to the side in the shadows of the trees they followed the curves of the long drive until the house itself came into sight it really was very big indeed it was built in the shape of the letter e with the middle stroke missing e there was a courtyard in front overgrown with weeds a low wall about knee high ran round the courtyard there was a light in a room on the top floor and another one on the ground floor otherwise from that side the house was dark lets walk quietly round it said julian in a low voice goodness whats that it was a weird and terrible screech that made them all jump in alarm anne clutched julian in fright they stood and listened something came down silently and brushed georges hair she almost screamed but before she could that terrible screech came again and she put out her hand to quieten timmy who was amazed and scared what is it ju whispered george something touched me then before i could see what it was it was gone listen its all right whispered back julian its only an owl a screech owl good gracious so it was breathed back george in great relief what an ass i was not to think of it its a barnowl a screech owl out hunting anne were you scared i should just think i was said anne letting go her hold on julians arm so was i said richard whose teeth were still chattering with fear i nearly ran for my life i would have too if i could have got my legs to work but they were glued to the ground the owl screeched again a little farther away and another one answered it a third one screeched and the night was really made hideous with the unearthly calls id rather have a brown owl any day calling towhooooooo said george thats a nice noise but this screeching is frightful no wonder its called owls hill said julian perhaps its always been a haunt of the screechowls the four children and timmy began to walk quietly round the house keeping to the shadows as much as they could everywhere was dark at the back except two long windows they were leaded windows and curtains were pulled across them julian tried to see through the cracks he found a place where two curtains didnt quite meet he put his eye to the crack and looked in its the kitchen he told the others an enormous place lighted with one big oillamp all the rest of the room is in shadow theres a great fireplace at the end with a few logs burning in it anyone there asked george trying to see through the crack too julian moved aside and let her take her turn no one that i can see he said george gave an exclamation as she looked and julian pushed her aside to look in again he saw a man walking into the room a queer dwarflike fellow with a hunched back that seemed to force his head on one side he had a very evil face behind him came a woman thin drab and the picture of misery the man flung himself into a chair and began to fill a pipe the woman took a kettle off the fire and went to fill hotwater bottles in a corner she must be the cook thought julian what a misery she looks i wonder what the man is manofallwork i suppose what an evil face hes got the woman spoke timidly to the man in the chair julian of course could not hear a word from outside the window the man answered her roughly banging on the arm of the chair as he spoke the woman seemed to be pleading with him about something the man flew into a rage picked up a poker and threatened the woman with it julian watched in horror poor woman no wonder she looked miserable if that was the sort of thing that kept happening however the man did nothing with the poker except brandish it in temper and he soon replaced it and settled down in his chair again the woman said no more at all but went on filling the bottles julian wondered who they were for he told the others what he had seen they didnt like it at all if the people in the kitchen behaved like that whatever would those in the other part of the house be like they left the kitchen windows and went on round the house they came to a lower room lighted inside but here the curtains were tightly drawn and there was no crack to look through they looked up to the one room high up that was lighted surely dick must be there perhaps he was locked up in the attic all by himself how they wished they knew dared they throw up a stone they wondered if they should try there didnt seem any way at all of getting into the house the front door was well and truly shut there was a side door also tightly shut and locked because they had tried it not a single window seemed to be open i think i will throw up a stone said julian at last i feel sure dicks up there if he has been taken here and youre certain you heard the men say owls dene arent you anne quite certain said anne do throw a stone julian im getting so worried about poor dick julian felt about on the ground for a stone he found one embedded in the moss that was everywhere he balanced it in his hand then up went the stone but fell just short of the window julian got another up it went and hit the glass of the window with a sharp crack somebody came to the pane at once was it dick everyone strained their eyes to see but the window was too far up julian threw up another stone and that hit the window too i think it is dick said anne oh dear no it isnt after all cant you see julian but the person at the window whoever he was had now disappeared the children felt a bit uncomfortable suppose it hadnt been dick suppose it had been someone else who had now disappeared from the room to go and look for them lets get away from this part of the house whispered julian get round to the other side they made their way round quietly and richard suddenly pulled at julians arm look he said theres a window open cant we get in there trapped julian looked at the casement window the moonlight shone on it it certainly was a little ajar how did we miss that when we went round before he wondered he hesitated a little should they try to get in or not wouldnt it be better to rap on the back door and get that miserablelooking woman to answer it and tell them what they wanted to know on the other hand there was that evillooking hunchback there julian didnt like the look of him at all no on the whole it might be better to creep in at the window see if it was dick upstairs set him free and then all escape through the same open window nobody would know the bird would have flown and everything would be all right julian went to the window he put a leg up and there he was astride the window he held out a hand to anne come on ill give you a hand he said and pulled her up beside him he lifted her down on the floor inside then george came and then richard george was just leaning out to encourage timmy to jump in through the window too when something happened a powerful torchlight went on and its beam shone right across the room into the dazzled eyes of the four children they stood there blinking in alarm what was this then anne heard the voice of one of the men who had captured dick well well well a crowd of young burglars the voice changed suddenly to anger how dare you break in here ill hand you over to the police from outside timmy growled fiercely he jumped up at the window and almost succeeded in leaping through the man grasped what was happening at once and went to the open window he shut it with a bang now timmy couldnt get in let my dog in said george angrily and stupidly tried to open the window again the man brought his torch down sharply on her hand and she cried out in pain thats what happens to boys who go against my wishes said the man whilst poor george nursed her bruised hand look here began julian fiercely what do you think youre doing were not burglars and whats more wed be very very glad if youd hand us over to the police oh you would would you said the man he went to the door of the room and yelled out in a tremendous voice aggie aggie bring a lamp here at once there was an answering shout from the kitchen and almost immediately the light of a lamp appeared shining down the passage outside it grew brighter and the miserablelooking woman came in with a big oillamp she stared in amazement at the little group of children she seemed about to say something when the man gave her a rough push get out and keep your mouth shut do you hear me the woman scuttled out like a frightened hen the man looked round at the children in the light of the lamp the room was very barely furnished and appeared to be a sittingroom of some kind so you dont mind being given up to the police said the man thats very interesting you think theyd approve of you breaking into my house i tell you we didnt break in said julian determined to get that clear at any rate we came here because we had reason to believe that youve got my brother locked up somewhere in this house and its all a mistake youve got the wrong boy richard didnt like this at all he was terribly afraid of being locked up in the place of dick he kept behind the others as much as possible the man looked hard at julian he seemed to be thinking we havent a boy here at all he said at last i really dont know what you mean you dont suggest that i go about the countryside picking boys up and making them prisoners do you i dont know what you do said julian all i know is this you captured dick my brother this evening in middlecombe woods thinking he was richard kent well hes not hes my brother dick and if you dont set him free at once ill tell the police what we know and dear me how do you know all this asked the man were you there when he was captured as you call it one of us was said julian bluntly in the tree overhead thats how we know there was a silence the man took out a cigarette and lighted it well youre quite mistaken he said weve no boy held prisoner here the thing is ridiculous now its very very late would you like to bed down here for the night and get off in the morning i dont like to send a parcel of kids out into the middle of the night theres no telephone here or id ring your home julian hesitated he felt certain dick was in the house if he said he would stay for the night he might be able to find out if dick was really there or not he could quite well see that the man didnt want them tearing off to the police there was something at owls dene that was secret and sinister ill stay he said at last our people are away they wont worry he had forgotten about richard for the moment his people certainly would worry still there was nothing to do about it the first thing was to find dick surely the men would be mad to hold him a prisoner once they were certain he wasnt the boy perhaps rooky the ruffian who knew richard hadnt yet arrived hadnt seen dick that must be the reason that this man wanted them to stay the night of course hed wait till rooky came and when rooky said no hes not the boy we want theyd let dick go theyd have to the man called for aggie again she came at once these kids are lost said the man to her ive said ill put them up for the night get one of the rooms ready just put down mattresses and blankets thats all give them some food if they want it aggie was evidently tremendously astonished julian guessed that she was not used to this man being kind to lost children he shouted at her well dont stand dithering there get on with the job take these kids with you aggie beckoned to the four children george hung back what about my dog she said hes still outside whining i cant go to bed without him youll have to said the man roughly i wont have him in the house at any price and thats flat hell attack anyone he meets said george he wont meet anyone out there said the man by the way how did you get in through the gates a car came out just as we got there and we slipped in before the gates closed said julian how do the gates shut by machinery mind your own business said the man and went down the passage in the opposite direction pleasant kindly fellow said julian to george oh a sweet nature answered george the woman stared at them both in surprise she didnt seem to realize that they meant the opposite to what they said she led the way upstairs she came to a big room with a carpet on the floor a small bed in a corner and one or two chairs there was no other furniture ill get some mattresses and put them down for you she said ill help you offered julian thinking it would be a good idea to see round a bit all right said the woman you others stay here she went off with julian they went to a cupboard and the woman tugged at two big mattresses julian helped her she seemed rather touched by this help well thank you she said theyre pretty heavy dont expect you have many children here to stay do you asked julian well its funny that you should come just after the woman began then she stopped and bit her lip looking anxiously up and down the passage just after what asked julian just after the other boy came do you mean sh said the woman looking scared to death whatever do you know about that you shouldnt have said that mr perton will skin me alive if he knew youd said that hed be sure id told you forget about it thats the boy whos locked up in one of the attics at the top of the house isnt it said julian helping her to carry one of the mattresses to the big bedroom she dropped her end in the greatest alarm now do you want to get me into terrible trouble and yourselves too do you want mr perton to tell old hunchy to whip you all you dont know that man hes wicked whens rooky coming asked julian bent on astonishing the woman hoping to scare her into one admission after another this was too much for her altogether she stood there shaking at the knees staring at julian as if she couldnt believe her ears what do you know about rooky she whispered is he coming here dont tell me hes coming here why dont you like him asked julian he put a hand on her shoulder why are you so frightened and upset whats the matter tell me i might be able to help you rookys bad said the woman i thought he was in prison dont tell me hes out again dont tell me hes coming here she was so frightened that she wouldnt say a word more she began to cry and julian hadnt the heart to press her with any more questions in silence he helped her to drag the mattresses into the other room ill get you some food said the poor woman sniffing miserably youll find blankets in that cupboard over there if you want to lie down she disappeared julian told the others in whispers what he had been able to find out well see if we can find dick as soon as things are quiet in the house he said this is a bad house a house of secrets of queer comings and goings i shall slip out of our room and see what i can find out later on i think that man mr perton is his name is really waiting for rooky to come and see if dick is richard or not when he finds he isnt ive no doubt hell set him free and us too what about me said richard once he sees me im done for im the boy he wants he hates my father and he hates me too hell kidnap me take me somewhere and ask an enormous ransom for me just to punish us well we must do something to prevent him seeing you said julian but i dont see why he should see you its only dick hell want to see he wont be interested in what he thinks are dicks brothers and sisters now for goodness sake dont start to howl again or honestly ill give you up to rooky myself you really are a frightful little coward havent you any courage at all all this has come about because of your silly lies and deceit said george quiet fiercely its all because of you that our trip is spoilt that dicks locked up and poor timmys outside without me richard looked quite taken aback he shrank into a corner and didnt say another word he was very miserable nobody liked him nobody believed him nobody trusted him richard felt very very small indeed julian looks round the woman brought them some food it was only bread and butter and jam with some hot coffee to drink the four children were not really hungry but they were very thirsty and they drank the coffee eagerly george opened the window and called softly down to timmy tim heres something for you timmy was down there all right watching and waiting he knew where george was he had howled and whined for some time but now he was quiet george was quite determined to get him indoors if she could she gave him all her bread and jam dropping it down bit by bit and listening to him wolfing it up anyway old timmy would know she was thinking of him listen said julian coming in from the passage outside where he had stood listening for a while i think it would be a good idea if we put out this light and settled down on the mattresses but i shall make up a lump on mine to look like me so that if anyone comes theyll think im there on the mattress but i shant be where will you be then asked anne dont leave us i shall be hiding outside in that cupboard said julian ive a sort of feeling that our pleasant host mr perton will come along presently to lock us in and ive no intention of being locked in i think hell flash a torch into the room see that were all four safely asleep on the mattresses and then quietly lock the door well i shall be able to unlock it when i come back from the cupboard outside and we shant be prisoners at all oh that really is a good idea said anne cuddling herself up in a blanket youd better go and get into the cupboard now julian before were locked up for the night julian blew out the lamp he tiptoed to the door and opened it he left it ajar he went into the passage and fumbled his way to where he knew the cupboard should be ah there it was he pulled at the handle and the door opened silently he slipped inside and left the door open just a crack so that he would be able to see if anyone came along the wide passage he waited there about twenty minutes the cupboard smelt musty and it was very boring standing there doing absolutely nothing then through the crack in the door he suddenly noticed that a light was coming ah somebody was about he peered through the crack he saw mr perton coming quietly along the corridor with a little oillamp held in his hand he went to the door of the childrens bedroom and pushed it a little julian watched him hardly daring to breathe would he notice that the figure on one of the mattresses was only a lump made of a blanket rolled up and covered by another blanket julian fervently hoped that he wouldnt all his plans would be spoilt if so mr perton held the lamp high in his hand and looked cautiously into the room he saw four huddledup shapes lying on the mattresses four children he thought they were obviously asleep softly mr perton closed the door and just as softly locked it julian watched anxiously to see if he pocketed the key or not no he hadnt he had left it in the lock oh good the man went away again treading softly he did not go downstairs but disappeared into a room some way down on the right julian heard the door shut with a click then he heard another click the man evidently believed in locking himself in perhaps he didnt trust his other comrade wherever he was or hunchy or the woman julian waited a while and then crept out of the cupboard he stole up to mr pertons room and looked through the keyhole to see if the room was in darkness or not it was was mr perton snoring not that julian could hear however julian was not going to wait till he heard mr perton snore he was going to find dick and he was pretty certain that the first place to look was in that attic upstairs i bet mr perton was up there with dick and heard me throwing stones at the window thought julian then he slipped down and opened that window to trap us into getting in there and we fell neatly into the trap he must have been waiting inside the room for us i dont like mr perton too full of bright ideas he was halfway up the flight of stairs that led to the attics now going very carefully and slowly afraid of making the stairs creak loudly they did creak and at every creak poor julian stopped and listened to see if anyone had heard there was a long passage at the top turning at both ends into the sidewings julian stood still and debated now which way ought he to go where exactly was that lighted window it was somewhere along this long passage he was certain well hed go along the doors and see if a light shone out through the keyhole or under the door anywhere door after door was ajar julian peeped round each making out bare dark attics or boxrooms with rubbish in then he came to a door that was closed he peered through the keyhole no light came from inside the room julian knocked gently a voice came at once dicks voice whos there sh its me julian whispered julian are you all right dick there came the creak of a bed then the pattering of feet across a bare floor dicks voice came through the door muffled and cautious julian how did you get here this is marvellous can you unlock the door and let me out julian had already felt for a key but there was none mr perton had taken that key at any rate no the keys gone he said dick what did they do to you nothing much they dragged me off to the car and shoved me in said dick through the door the man called rooky wasnt there the others waited for him for some time then drove off they thought he might have gone off to see someone they meant to visit so i havent seen him hes coming tomorrow morning what a shock for him when he finds im not richard richards here too whispered julian i wish he wasnt because if rooky happens to see him hell be kidnapped im sure the only hope is that rooky will only see you and as the other men think were all one family they may let us all go did you come straight here in the car dick yes said dick the gates opened like magic when we got here but i couldnt see anybody i was shoved up here and locked in one of the men came to tell me all the things rooky was going to do to me when he saw me and then he suddenly went downstairs and hasnt come back again oh i bet that was when we chucked stones up at your window said julian at once didnt you hear them yes so that was the crack i heard the man with me went across to the window at once and he must have seen you now what about you ju how on earth did you get here are you all really here i suppose that was timmy i heard howling outside julian quickly told him all his tale from the time he and george had met the howling richard to the moment he had slipped up the stairs to find dick there was a silence when he had finished his tale then dicks voice came through the crack not much good making any plans julian if things go all right well be out of here by the morning when rooky finds im not the boy he wants if things go wrong at least were all together and we can make plans then i wonder what his mother will think when richard doesnt get home tonight probably think hes gone off to the aunts said julian i should think hes a very unreliable person blow him it was all because of him we got into this fix i expect the men will have some cockandbull story tomorrow morning about why they got hold of you when they find youre not richard went on julian theyll probably say you threw stones at their car or something and they took you in hand or found your hurt and brought you here to help you anyway whatever they say we wont make much fuss about it well go quietly and then well get things moving i dont know whats going on here but its something queer the police ought to look into it im certain listen thats timmy again said dick howling like anything for george i suppose youd better go julian in case he wakes up one of the men and they come out and find you here goodnight im awfully glad youre near thanks awfully for coming to find me goodnight said julian and went back along the corridor walking over the patches of moonlight looking fearfully into the dark shadows in case mr perton or somebody else was waiting for him but nobody was about timmys howling died down there was a deep silence in the house julian went down the stairs to the floor on which the bedroom was where the others lay asleep he paused outside it should he do any further exploring it really was such a chance he decided that he would mr perton was fast asleep he hoped he thought probably hunchy and the woman had gone to bed too he wondered where the other man was who had brought dick to owls dene he hadnt seen him at all perhaps he had gone out in that black bentley they had seen going out of the gate julian went down to the ground floor a brilliant thought had just occurred to him couldnt he undo the front door and get the others down and send them out free he himself couldnt escape because it would mean leaving dick alone then he gave up the idea no he thought for one thing george and anne would refuse to go without me and even if they agreed to get out of the front door and go down the drive to the gates how would they undo them theyre worked by some machinery from the house so his brilliant idea came to nothing he decided to look into all the rooms on the ground floor he looked into the kitchen first the fire was almost out the moonlight came through the cracks of the curtains and lighted up the dark silent room hunchy and the woman had evidently retired somewhere there was nothing of interest in the kitchen julian went into the room opposite it was a diningroom with a long polished table candlesticks on the walls and mantelpiece and the remains of a wood fire nothing of interest there either the boy went into another room was it a workroom or what there was a radiogram there and a big desk there was a stand with a curious instrument of some kind that had a stout wheellike handle julian suddenly wondered if it would open the gates yes that was what it was for he saw a label attached to it left gate right gate both gates thats what it is the machinery for opening either or both of the gates if only i could get dick out of that room id get us all out of this place in no time said julian he twisted the handle what would happen strange secret a curious groaning whining noise began as some kind of strong machinery was set working julian hurriedly turned the handle back if it was going to make all that noise he wasnt going to try his hand at opening the gates it would bring mr perton out of his room in a rush most ingenious whatever it is thought the boy examining it as well as he could in the moonlight that streamed through the window he looked round the room again a noise came to his ears and he stood still its somebody snoring he thought id better not mess about here any more where are they sleeping somewhere not far from here thats certain he tiptoed cautiously into the next room and looked inside it it was a lounge but there was nobody there at all he couldnt hear the snoring there either he was puzzled there didnt seem to be any other room nearby where people could sleep he went back to the workroom or study yes now he could hear that noise again and it was somebody snoring somebody quite near and yet not near enough to hear properly or to see most peculiar julian walked softly round the room trying to find a place where the snoring sounded loudest of all yes by this bookcase that reached to the ceiling that was where the snoring sounded most of all was there a room behind this wall next to the workroom julian went out to investigate but there was no room behind the study at all only the wall of the corridor as far as he could see it was more and more mysterious he went back to the study again and over to the bookcase yes there it was again somebody was asleep and snoring not far off but where julian began to examine the bookcase it was full of books jammed tightly together novels biographies reference books all higgledypiggledy he removed some from a shelf and examined the bookcase behind it was of solid wood he put back the books and examined the big bookcase again it was a very solid affair julian looked carefully at the books shining in the moonlight one shelf of books looked different from the others less tidy the books not so jammed together why should just one shelf be different julian quietly took the books from that shelf behind them was the solid wood again julian put his hand at the back and felt about a knob was hidden in a corner a knob whatever was that there for cautiously julian turned the knob this way and that nothing happened then he pressed it still nothing happened he pulled it and it slid out a good six inches then the whole of the back of that particular shelf slid quietly downwards and left an opening big enough for somebody to squeeze through julian held his breath a sliding panel what was behind it a dim flickering light came from the space behind julian waited till his eyes were used to it after the bright moonlight he was trembling with excitement the snoring now sounded so loud that julian felt as if the snorer must be almost within hands reach then gradually he made out a tiny room with a small narrow bed a table and a shelf on which a few articles could dimly be made out a candle was burning in a corner on the bed was the snorer julian could not see what he was like except that he looked big and burly as he lay there snoring peacefully what a find thought julian a secret hidingplace a place to hide all kinds of people i suppose who have enough money to pay for such a safe hole this fellow ought to have been warned not to snore he gave himself away the body did not dare to stay there any longer looking into that curious secret room it must be built in a space between the wall of the study and the wall of the corridor probably a very old hidingplace made when the house was built julian felt for the knob he pushed it back into place and the panel slid up again as noiselessly as before it was evidently kept in good working order the snoring was muffled again now julian replaced the books hoping that they were more or less as he had found them he felt very thrilled he had found one of the secrets of owls dene at any rate the police would be very interested to hear about that secret hole and perhaps they would be even more interested to hear about the person inside it it was absolutely essential now that he and the others should escape would it be all right if he went without dick no if the men suspected any dirty work on his part discovered that he knew of the secret hole for instance they might harm dick regretfully julian decided that there must be no escape for him unless everyone including dick could come too he didnt explore any more he suddenly felt very tired indeed and crept softly upstairs he felt as if he simply must lie down and think he was too tired to do anything else he went to the bedroom the key was still in the lock outside he went into the room and shut the door mr perton would find the door unlocked the next morning but probably he would think he hadnt turned the key properly julian lay down on the mattress beside richard all the others were fast asleep he meant to think out all his problems but no sooner had he closed his eyes than he was fast asleep he didnt hear timmy howling outside once more he didnt hear the screech owl that made the night hideous on the hill he didnt see the moon slide down the sky it was not mr perton who awoke the children next morning but the woman she came into the room and called to them if you want breakfast youd better come down and have it they all sat up in a hurry wondering where in the world they were hallo said julian blinking sleepily breakfast did you say it sounds good is there anywhere we can wash you can wash down in the kitchen said the woman sullenly im not cleaning any bathroom up after you leave the door unlocked for us to get out said julian innocently mr perton locked it last night so he said answered the woman but he hadnt locked it it wasnt locked when i tried the door this morning aha you didnt know that did you youd have been wandering all over the house i suppose if youd guessed that probably we should agreed julian winking at the others they knew that he had meant to go and find dick in the night and snoop round a bit but they didnt know all he had discovered he hadnt had the heart to wake them and tell them the night before dont you be too long said the woman and went out of the door leaving it open i hope shes taken some breakfast up to poor old dick said julian in a low voice the others came close to him ju did you find dick last night whispered anne he nodded then very quickly and quietly he told them all he had discovered where dick was and then how he had heard the snoring and discovered the secret panel the hidden room and the man who slept so soundly there not knowing that julian had seen him julian how thrilling said george whoever would have thought of all that oh yes and i discovered the machinery that opens the gates too said julian its in the same room but come on if we dont go down to the kitchen that woman will be after us again i hope hunchy wont be there i dont like him hunchy however was there finishing his breakfast at a small table he scowled at the children but they took absolutely no notice of him youve been a long time grumbled the woman theres the sink over there if you want to wash and ive put a towel out for you you look pretty dirty all of you we are said julian cheerfully we could have done with a bath last night but we didnt exactly get much of a welcome you know when they had washed they went to a big scrubbed table there was no cloth on it the woman had put out some bread and butter and some boiled eggs and a jug of steaming hot cocoa they all sat down and began to help themselves julian talked cheerfully winking at the others to make them do the same he wasnt going to let the hunchback think they were scared or worried in any way shut up you said hunchy suddenly julian took no notice he went on talking and george backed him up valiantly though anne and richard were too scared after hearing the hunchbacks furious voice did you hear what i said suddenly yelled hunchy and got up from the little table where he had been sitting hold your tongues all of you coming into my kitchen and making all that row hold your tongues julian rose too i dont take orders from you whoever you are he said and he sounded just like a grownup you hold your tongue or else be civil oh dont talk to him like that dont begged the woman anxiously hes got such a temper hell take a stick to you id take a stick to him except that i dont hit fellows smaller than myself said julian what would have happened if mr perton hadnt appeared in the kitchen at that moment nobody knew he stalked in and glared round sensing that there was a row going on you losing your temper again hunchy he said keep it till its needed ill ask you to produce it sometime today possibly if these kids dont behave themselves he looked round at the children with a grim expression then he glanced at the woman rookys coming soon he told her and one or two others get a meal a good one keep these children in here hunchy and keep an eye on them i may want them later he went out the woman was trembling rookys coming she halfwhispered to hunchy get on with your work woman said the dwarf go out and get the vegetables in yourself ive got to keep an eye on these kids the poor woman scuttled about anne was sorry for her she went over to her shall i clear away and wash up for you she asked youre going to be busy and ive nothing to do well all help said julian the woman gave him an astonished and grateful glance it was plain that she was not used to good manners or politeness of any sort yah said hunchy sneeringly you wont get round me with your smarmy ways nobody took the slightest notice of him all the children began to clear away the breakfast things and anne and george stacked them in the sink and began to wash them yah said hunchy again and yah to you said julian pleasantly which made the others laugh and hunchy scowl till his eyes disappeared under his brows rooky is very angry about an hour later there was a curious grinding groaning noise that turned to a whining richard anne and george jumped violently but julian knew what it was the gates are being opened he told them and they remembered how he had described the machinery that opened the gates the curious wheellike handle labelled left gate right gate both gates how do you know that asked hunchy at once surprised and suspicious oh im a good guesser replied julian airily correct me if im wrong but i couldnt help thinking the gates were being opened and im guessing its rooky thats coming through them youre so sharp youll cut yourself one day grumbled hunchy going to the door so my mother told me when i was two years old said julian and the others giggled if there was any answering back to be done julian could always do it they all went to the window george opened it timmy was there sitting just outside george had begged the woman to let him in but she wouldnt she had thrown him some scraps and told george there was a pond he could drink from but beyond that she wouldnt go timmy called george as she heard the sound of a car purring quietly up the drive timmy stay there dont move she was afraid that timmy might perhaps run round to the front door and go for anyone who jumped out of the car timmy looked up at her inquiringly he was puzzled about this whole affair why wasnt he allowed inside the house with george he knew there were some people who didnt welcome dogs into their houses but george never went to those houses it was a puzzle to him too to understand why she didnt come out to him still she was there leaning out of the window he could hear her voice he could even lick her hand if he stood up on his hind legs against the wall you shut that window and come inside said hunchy maliciously he took quite a pleasure in seeing that george was upset at being separated from timmy here comes the car said julian they all looked at it and then glanced at each other kmf of course the black bentley swept by the kitchen windows and up to the front door three men got out richard crouched back his face going pale julian glanced round at him raising his eyebrows mutely asking him if he recognized one of the men as rooky richard nodded miserably he was very frightened now the whining groaning noise came again the gates were being shut voices came from the hall then the men went into one of the rooms and there was the sound of a door being shut julian wondered if he could slip out of the room unnoticed and go up to see if dick was all right he sidled to the door thinking that hunchy was engrossed in cleaning an array of dirty shoes but his grating voice sounded at once where you going if you dont obey orders ill tell mr perton and wont you be sorry theres quite a lot of people in his house going to be sorry for themselves soon said julian in an irritatingly cheerful voice you be careful hunchy hunchy lost his temper suddenly and threw the shoebrush he was using straight at julian julian caught it deftly and threw it up on the high mantelpiece thanks he said like to throw another oh dont said the woman beseechingly you dont know what hes like when hes in a real temper dont the door of the room that the men had gone into opened and somebody went upstairs to fetch dick thought julian at once he stood and listened hunchy got another shoebrush and went on polishing muttering angrily under his breath the woman went on preparing some food the others listened with julian they too guessed that the man had gone to fetch dick to show him to rooky footsteps came down the stairs again two lots this time yes dick must be with the man they could hear his voice let go my arm i can come without being dragged they heard him say indignantly good old dick he wasnt going to be dragged about without making a strong protest he was taken into the room where the other three men were waiting then a loud voice was heard hes not the boy fools youve got the wrong boy hunchy and the woman heard the words too they gaped at one another something had gone wrong they went to the door and stood there silently the children just stood behind them julian edged richard away very gradually rub some soot over your hair he whispered make it as black as you can richard if the men come out here to see us theyre not likely to recognize you so easily if your hairs black go on quick while the others arent paying attention julian was pointing to the inside of the grate where black soot hung richard put his trembling hands into it and covered them with it then he rubbed the soot over his yellow hair more whispered julian much more go on ill stand in front of you so that the others cant see what youre doing richard rubbed soot even more wildly over his hair julian nodded yes it looked black enough now richard looked quite different julian hoped anne and george would be sensible enough not to exclaim when they saw him there was evidently some sharp argument going on in the room off the hall voices were raised but not many words could be made out from where the children stood at the kitchen door dicks voice could be heard too it suddenly sounded quite clearly i told you youd made a mistake now you just let me go see hunchy suddenly pushed everyone roughly away from the door except poor richard who was standing over in a dark corner shaking with fright theyre coming he hissed get away from the door everyone obeyed hunchy took up a shoebrush again the woman went to peel potatoes the children turned over the pages of some old magazines they had found footsteps came to the kitchen door it was flung open mr perton was there and behind him another man no mistaking who he was thicklipped with an enormous nose yes he was the ruffian rooky once bodyguard to richards father the man who hated richard because he had told tales of him and who had been sent off in disgrace by the boys father richard cowered back in his corner hiding behind the others anne and george had given him astonished stares when they had noticed his hair but neither of them had said a word hunchy and the woman didnt seem to have noticed any change in him dick was with the two men he waved to the others julian grinned good old dick rooky glanced at all four children his eye rested for a moment on richard and then glanced away he hadnt recognized him well mr perton said julian im glad to see youve got my brother down from the room you locked him up in last night i imagine that means he can come with us now why you brought him here as you did and made him a prisoner last night i cant imagine now look here said mr perton in quite a different voice from the one he had used to them before now look here quite frankly we made a mistake you dont need to know why or how thats none of your business this isnt the boy we wanted we told you he was our brother said anne quite said mr perton politely i am sorry i disbelieved you these things happen now we want to make you all a handsome present for any inconvenience you have suffered er ten pounds for you to spend on icecreams and so on you can go whenever you like and dont try and tell any fairy stories to anyone said rooky suddenly in a threatening voice see we made a mistake but were not having it talked about if you say anything silly we shall say that we found this boy lost in the woods took pity on him and brought him here for the night and that you kids were found trespassing in the grounds you understand i understand perfectly said julian in a cool rather scornful voice well i take it we can all go now then yes said mr perton he put his hand into his pocket and took out some pound notes he handed two to each of the children they glanced at julian to see if they were to take them or not not one of them felt willing to accept mr pertons money but they knew they must take them if julian did julian accepted the two notes handed to him and pocketed them without a word of thanks the others did the same richard kept his head down well all the time hoping that the two men would not notice how his knees were shaking he was really terrified of rooky now clear out said rooky when the ten pounds had been divided forget all this or youll be very sorry he opened the door that led into the garden the children trooped out silently richard well in their midst timmy was waiting for them he gave a loud bark of welcome and flung himself on george fawning on her licking every bit of her he could reach he looked back at the kitchen door and gave a questioning growl as if to say do you want me to go for anyone in there no said george you come with us timmy well get out of here as quickly as we can give me your pound notes quick said julian in a low voice when they had rounded a corner and were out of sight of the windows they all handed them to him wonderingly what was he going to do with them the woman had come out to watch them go julian beckoned to her she came hesitatingly down the garden for you said julian putting the notes into her hand we dont want them the woman took them amazed her eyes filled with tears why its a fortune no no you take them back youre kind though so kind julian turned away leaving the astonished and delighted woman standing staring after them he hurried after the others that was a very very good idea of yours said anne warmly and the others agreed all of them had been sorry for the poor woman come on said julian we dont want to miss the opening of the gates listen can you hear the groaning noise back at the house somebody has set the machinery working that opens the gates thank goodness were free and richard too that was a bit of luck yes i was so scared rooky would recognize me even though my hair was sooted black said richard who was now looking much more cheerful oh look we can see the end of the drive now and the gates are wide open were free well get our bikes said julian i know where we left them you can ride on my crossbar richard because were a bike short dick must have his bike back now you remember you borrowed it look here they are they mounted their bicycles and began to cycle down the drive and then anne gave a scream julian look look the gates are closing again quick quick well be left inside everyone saw in horror that the gates were actually closing very slowly they pedalled as fast as they could but it was no use by the time they got there the two great gates were fast shut no amount of shaking would open them and just as they were so very nearly out prisoners they all flung themselves down on the grass verge and groaned what have they done that for just as we were going out said dick was it a mistake do you think i mean did they think wed had time to go out or what well if it was a mistake its easy to put right said julian ill just cycle back to the house and tell them they shut the gates too soon yes you do that said george well wait here but before julian could even mount his bicycle there came the sound of the car purring down the long drive all the children jumped to their feet richard ran behind a bush in panic he was terrified of having to face rooky again the car drew up by the children and stopped yes theyre still here said mr pertons voice as he got out of the car rooky got out too they came over to the children rooky ran his eyes over them wheres that other boy he asked quickly i cant imagine said julian coolly dear me i wonder if he had time to cycle out of the gateway why did you shut the gates so soon mr perton rooky had caught sight of richards shivering figure behind the bush he strode over to him and yanked him out he looked at him closely then he pulled him over to mr perton yes i thought so this is the boy we want hes sooted his hair or something and thats why i didnt recognize him but when hed gone i felt sure there was something familiar about him thats why i wanted another look he shook poor richard like a dog shaking a rat well what do you want to do about it asked mr perton rather gloomily hold him of course said rooky ill get back at his father now hell have to pay a very large sum of money for his horrible son thatll be useful wont it and i can pay this kid out for some of the lies he told his father about me nasty little rat he shook richard again julian stepped forward white and furious now you stop that he said let the boy go havent you done enough already keeping my brother locked up for nothing holding us all for the night and now you talk about kidnapping havent you just come out of prison do you want to go back there rooky dropped richard and lunged out at julian with a snarl timmy flung himself between them and bit the mans hand rooky let out a howl of rage and nursed his injured hand he yelled at julian call that dog to heel do you hear ill call him to heel all right if you talk sense said julian still white with rage youre going to let us all go here and now go back and open these gates timmy growled terrifyingly and both rooky and mr perton took some hurried steps backwards rooky picked up a very big stone if you dare to throw that ill set my dog on you again shouted george in sudden fear mr perton knocked the stone out of rookys hand dont be a fool he said that dog could make mincemeat of us great ugly brute look at his teeth for goodness sake let the kids go rooky not till weve finished our plans said rooky fiercely still nursing his hand keep em all prisoners here we shant be long before our jobs are done and whats more im going to take that little rat there off with me when i go ha ill teach him a few things and his father too timmy growled again he was straining at georges hand she had him firmly by the collar richard trembled when he heard rookys threats about him tears ran down his face yes you can howl all you like said rooky scowling at him you wait till i get you miserable little coward you never did have any spunk you just ran round telling tales and misbehaving yourself whenever you could look rooky youd better come up to the house and have that hand seen to said mr perton its bleeding badly you ought to wash it and put some stuff on it you know a dogs bite is dangerous come on you can deal with these kids afterwards rooky allowed himself to be led back to the car he shook his unhurt fist at the children as they watched silently interfering brats little but the rest of his pleasant words were lost in the purring of the cars engine mr perton backed a little turned the car and it disappeared up the drive the five children sat themselves down on the grass verge richard began to sob out loud do shut up richard said george rooky was right when he said you were a little coward with no spunk so you are annes much pluckier than you are i wish to goodness we had never met you richard rubbed his hands over his eyes they were sooty and made his face look most peculiar with streaks of black soot mixed with his tears he tooked very woebegone indeed im sorry he sniffed i know you dont believe me but i really am ive always been a bit of a coward i cant help it yes you can said julian scornfully anybody can help being a coward cowardice is just thinking of your own miserable skin instead of somebody elses why even little anne is more worried about us than she is about herself and that makes her brave she couldnt be a coward if she tried this was a completely new idea to richard he tried to wipe his face dry ill try to be like you he said in a muffled voice youre all so decent ive never had friends like you before honestly i wont let you down again well well see said julian doubtfully it would certainly be a surprise if you turned into a hero all of a sudden a very nice surprise of course but in the meantime it would be a help if you stopped howling for a bit and let us talk richard subsided he really looked very peculiar with his sootstreaked face julian turned to the others this is maddening he said just as we so nearly got out i suppose theyll shut us up in some room and keep us there till theyve finished whatever this job is i imagine the job consists of getting that hidden fellow away in safety the one i saw in the secret room wont richards people report his disappearance to the police said george fondling timmy who wouldnt stop licking her now he had got her again yes they will but what good will that do the police wont have the faintest notion where he is said julian nobody knows where we are either come to that but aunt fanny wont worry yet because she knows were off on a cycling tour and wouldnt be writing to her anyway do you think those men will really take me off with them when they go asked richard well well hope we shall have managed to escape before that said julian not liking to say yes certainly richard would be whisked away how can we escape asked anne wed never get over those high walls and i dont expect anyone ever comes by here right at the top of this deserted hill no tradesman would ever call what about the postman asked anne they probably arrange to fetch their post each day said julian i dont expect they want anyone coming here at all or there may be a letterbox outside the gate i never thought of that they went to see but although they craned their necks to see each side there didnt seem to be any letterbox at all for the postman to slip letters in so the faint hope that had risen in their minds that they might catch the postman and give him a message vanished at once hallo heres the woman aggie or whatever he name is said george suddenly as timmy growled they all turned their heads yes aggie was coming down the drive in a hurry could she be going out would the gates open for her their hopes died as she came near oh there you are ive come with a message you can do one of two things you can stay out in the grounds all day and not put foot into the house at all or you can come into the house and be locked up in one of the rooms she looked round cautiously and lowered her voice im sorry you didnt get out right down upset i am its bad enough for an old woman like me being cooped up here with hunchy but its not right to keep children in this place youre nice children too thanks said julian now seeing that you think were so nice tell us is there any way we can get out besides going through these gates no no way at all said the woman its like a prison once those gates are shut nobodys allowed in and youre only allowed out if it suits mr perton and the others so dont try to escape its hopeless nobody said anything to that aggie glanced over her shoulder as if she feared somebody might be listening hunchy perhaps and went on in a low voice mr perton said i wasnt to give you much food and he said hunchys to put down food for the dog with poison in it so dont you let him eat any but what i give you myself the brute cried george and she held timmy close against her did you hear that timmy its a pity you didnt bite mr perton too sh said the woman afraid i didnt ought to tell you all this you know that but youre kind and you gave me all that money right down nice you are now you listen to me youd better say youd rather keep out here in the grounds because if youre locked up i wouldnt dare to bring you much food in case rooky came in and saw it but if you stay out here its easier i can give you plenty thank you very much said julian and the others nodded too in any case wed rather be out here i suppose mr perton is afraid wed stumble on some of his queer secrets in the house if we had the free run there all right tell him well be in the grounds what about our food how shall we manage about that we dont want to get you into trouble but were very hungry for our meals and we really could do with a good dinner today ill manage it for you said aggie and she actually smiled but mind what i say now dont you let that dog eat anything hunchy puts down for him itll be poisoned a voice shouted from the house aggie jerked her head up and listened thats hunchy she said i must go she hurried back up the drive well well well said julian so they thought theyd poison old timmy did they theyll have to think again old fellow wont they woof said timmy gravely and didnt even wag his tail aggie and hunchy i feel as if i want some exercise said george when aggie had gone lets explore the grounds you never know what we might find they got up glad of something to do to take their minds off their surprising problems really who would have thought yesterday when they were happily cycling along sunny country roads that they would be held prisoner like this today you just never knew what would happen it made life exciting of course but it did spoil a cycling tour they found absolutely nothing of interest in the grounds except a couple of cows a large number of hens and a brood of young ducklings evidently even the milkman didnt need to call at owls dene it was quite selfcontained i expect that black bentley goes down each day to some town or other to collect letters and to buy meat or fish said george otherwise owls dene could keep itself going for months on end if necessary without any contact with the outside world i expect theyve got stacks and stacks of tinned food its weird to find a place like this tucked away on a deserted hill forgotten by everyone guarding goodness knows what secrets said dick id love to know who that man was you saw in the secret room julian the snorer someone who doesnt want to be seen even by hunchy or aggie said julian someone the police would dearly love to see i expect i wish we could get out of here said george longingly i hate the place its got such a nasty feel about it and i hate the thought of somebody trying to poison timmy dont worry he wont be poisoned said dick we wont let him be he can have half our food cant you timmy old fellow timmy agreed he woofed and wagged his tail he wouldnt leave georges side that morning but stuck to her like a leech well weve been all round the grounds and theres nothing much to see said julian when they had come back near the house i suppose hunchy sees to the milking and feeds the poultry and brings in the vegetables aggie has to manage the house i say look theres hunchy now hes putting down food for timmy hunchy was making signs to them heres the dogs dinner he yelled dont say a word george said julian in a low voice well pretend to let timmy eat it but well really throw it away somewhere and hell be frightfully astonished when timmy is still allaliveo tomorrow morning hunchy disappeared in the direction of the cowshed carrying a pail anne gave a little giggle i know what well pretend well pretend that timmy ate half and didnt like the rest so we gave it to the hens and ducks and hunchy will be frightfully upset because hell think theyll die and hell get into a row said george serve him right come on lets get the food now she ran to pick up the big bowl of food timmy sniffed at it and turned away it was obvious that he wouldnt have fancied it much even if george had allowed him to have it timmy was a very sensible dog quick get that spade ju and dig a hole before hunchy comes back said george and julian set to work grinning it didnt take him more than a minute to dig a large hole in the soft earth of a bed george emptied all the food into the hole wiped the bowl round with a handful of leaves and watched julian filling in the earth now no animals could get at the poisoned food lets go to the henrun now and when we see hunchy well wave to him said julian hell ask us what weve been doing come on he deserves to have a shock they went to the henhouse and stood looking through the wire surrounding the henrun as hunchy came along they turned and waved to him george pretended to scrape some scraps out of the dogs bowl into the run hunchy stared hard then he ran towards her shouting dont do that dont do that whats the matter asked george innocently pretending to push some scraps through the wire cant i give the hens some scraps is that the bowl i put the dogs food down in asked hunchy sharply yes said george and he didnt eat all the food so youre giving it to my hens shouted hunchy in a rage and snatched the bowl out of georges hands she pretended to be very angry dont why shouldnt your hens have scraps from the dogs bowl the food you gave timmy looked very nice cant the hens have some hunchy looked into the henrun with a groan the hens were pecking about near the children for all the world as if they were eating something just thrown to them hunchy felt sure they would all be dead by the next day and then what trouble he would get into he glared at george idiot of a boy giving my hens that food you deserve a good whipping he thought george was a boy of course the others looked on with interest it served hunchy right to get into a panic over his hens after trying to poison dear old timmy hunchy didnt seem to know what to do eventually he took a stiff brush from a nearby shed and went into the henrun he had evidently decided to sweep the whole place in case any poisoned bits of food were still left about he swept laboriously and the children watched him pleased that he should punish himself in this way ive never seen anyone bother to sweep a henrun before said dick in a loud and interested voice nor have i said george at once he must be very anxious to bring his hens up properly its jolly hard work i should think said julian glad i havent got to do it pity to sweep up all the bits of food though an awful waste everyone agreed heartily to this funny he should be so upset about my giving the hens any scraps of the food he put down for timmy said george i mean it seems a bit suspicious it does rather agreed dick but then perhaps hes a suspicious character hunchy could hear all this quite plainly the children meant him to of course he stopped his sweeping and scowled evilly at them clear off you little pests he said and raised his broom as if to rush at the children with it he looks like an angry hen said anne joining in hes just going to cluck put in richard and the others laughed hunchy ran to open the gate of the henrun red with anger of course its just struck me he might have put poison into timmys bowl of food said julian loudly thats why hes so upset about his hens dear dear how true the old proverb is he that digs a pit shall fall into it himself the mention of poison stopped hunchys rush at once he flung the broom into the shed and made off for the house without another word well we gave him a bit more than he bargained for said julian and you neednt worry hens said anne putting her face to the wirenetting of the run youre not poisoned and we wouldnt dream of harming you aggies calling us said richard look perhaps shes got some food for us i hope so said dick im getting very hungry its funny that grownups never seem to get as hungry as children i do pity them why do you like being hungry said anne as they walked over to the house yes if i know theres a good meal in the offing said dick otherwise it wouldnt be at all funny oh goodness is this all that aggie has provided on the windowsill was a loaf of stalelooking bread and a piece of very hard yellow cheese nothing else at all hunchy was there grinning aggie says thats your dinner he said and sat himself down at the table to spoon out enormous helpings of a very savoury stew a little revenge for our behaviour by the henrun murmured julian softly well well i thought better than this of aggie i wonder where she is she came out of the kitchen door at that moment carrying a washingbasket that appeared to be full of clothes ill just hang these out hunchy and ill be back she called to him she turned to the children and gave them a broad wink theres your dinner on the windowsill she said get it and take it somewhere to eat hunchy and me dont want you round the kitchen she suddenly smiled and nodded her head down towards the washingbasket the children understood immediately their real dinner was in there they snatched the bread and cheese from the sill and followed her she set down the basket under a tree where it was wellhidden from the house a clothesline stretched there ill be out afterwards to hang my washing she said and with another smile that changed her whole face she went back to the house good old aggie said julian lifting up the top cloth in the basket my word just look here julian has a bright idea aggie had managed to pack knives forks spoons plates and mugs into the bottom of the basket there were two big bottles of milk there was a large meatpie with delicious looking pastry on top and a collection of buns biscuits and oranges there were also some homemade sweets aggie had certainly been very generous all the things were quickly whipped out of the basket the children carried them behind the bushes sat down and proceeded to eat a firstrate dinner timmy got his share of the meatpie and biscuits he also gobbled up a large part of the hard yellow cheese now wed better rinse everything under that garden tap over there and then pack them neatly into the bottom of the basket again said julian we dont want to get aggie into any sort of trouble for her kindness the dishes were soon rinsed and packed back into the basket the clothes were drawn over them nothing could be seen aggie came outside to them in about half an hour the children went to her and spoke in low voices thanks aggie that was super you are a brick we did enjoy it i bet hunchy didnt enjoy his dinner as much as we did sh said aggie halfpleased and halfscared you never know when hunchys listening hes got ears like a hare listen ill be coming out to get the eggs from the henrun at teatime ill have a basket with me for the eggs and i shall have your tea in it ill leave your tea in the henhouse when i get the eggs you can fetch it when ive gone youre a wonder aggie said julian admiringly you really are aggie looked pleased it was plain that nobody had said a kind or admiring word to her for years and years she was a poor miserable scared old woman but she was quite enjoying this little secret she was pleased at getting the better of hunchy too perhaps she felt it was some slight revenge for all the years he had illtreated her she hung out some of the clothes in the basket left one in to cover the dinnerthings and then went back into the house poor old thing said dick what a life yes i shouldnt like to be cooped up here for years and years with ruffians like perton and rooky said julian it looks as if we shall be if we dont hurry up and think of some plan of escape said dick yes wed better think hard again said julian come over to those trees there we can sit on the grass under them and talk without being overheard anywhere look hunchy is polishing the black bentley said george ill just pass near him with timmy and let timmy growl hell see timmys all alive and kicking then so she took timmy near the bentley and of course he growled horribly when he came upon hunchy hunchy promptly got into the car and shut the door george grinned hallo she said going off for a ride can timmy and i come with you she made as if she was going to open the door and hunchy yelled loudly dont you let that dog in here ive seen rookys hand one fingers very bad indeed i dont want that dog going for me do take me for a ride with you hunchy persisted george timmy loves cars go away said hunchy hanging on to the doorhandle for dear life ive got to get this car cleaned up for mr perton this evening you let me get out and finish the job george laughed and went off to join the others well he can see timmys allaliveo said dick with a grin good thing too wed find ourselves in a much bigger fix if we hadnt got old timmy to protect us they went over to the clump of trees and sat down what was it that hunchy said about the car asked julian george told him julian looked thoughtful anne knew that look it meant that julian was thinking of a plan she prodded him ju youve got a plan havent you what is it well im only just wondering about something said julian slowly that car and the fact that mr perton is going out in it tonight which means he will go out through those gates what of it said dick thinking of going with him well yes i was said julian surprisingly you see if hes not going till dark i think i could probably get into the boot and hide there till the car stops somewhere and then i could open the boot get out and go off for help everyone looked at him in silence annes eyes gleamed oh julian its a wizard plan it sounds jolly good said dick the only thing is i dont like being left here without julian said anne suddenly feeling scared everythings all right if julians here i could go said dick or i could said george only there wouldnt be room for timmy too the boot looks pretty big from outside said julian i wish i could take anne with me then id know she was safe you others would be all right so long as you had timmy they discussed the matter thoroughly they dropped it towards teatime when they saw aggie coming out with a basket to collect the eggs she made a sign to them not to come over to her possibly someone was watching they stayed where they were and watched her go into the henhouse she remained there a short time and then came out with a basketful of newlaid eggs she walked to the house without looking at the children again ill go and see if shes left anything in the henhouse said dick and went over to it he soon appeared again grinning his pockets bulged aggie had left about two dozen pottedmeat sandwiches a big slab of cherry cake and a bottle of milk the children went under the bushes and dick unloaded his pockets she even left a bone for old tim he said i suppose its all right said george doubtfully julian smelt it perfectly fresh he said no poison here at all anyway aggie wouldnt play a dirty trick like that come on lets tuck in they were very bored after tea so julian arranged some races and some jumping competitions timmy of course would have won them all if he had been counted as a proper competitor but he wasnt he went in for everything though and barked so excitedly that mr perton came to a window and yelled to him to stop sorry yelled back george timmys so full of beans today you see mr perton will be wondering why said julian with a grin hell be rowing hunchy for not getting on with the poison job when it began to grow dark the children went cautiously to the car hunchy had finished working on it quietly julian opened the boot and looked inside he gave an exclamation of disappointment its only a small one i cant get in there im afraid nor can you dick ill go then said anne in a small voice certainly not said julian well ill go said richard surprisingly i could just about squash in there you said dick youd be scared stiff richard was silent for a moment yes i should he admitted but im still ready to go ill do my very best if youd like me to try after all its me or nobody you wont let anne go and theres not enough room for george and timmy and not enough for either you or julian dick everyone was astonished it didnt seem a bit like richard to offer to do an unselfish or courageous action julian felt very doubtful well this is a serious thing you know richard he said i mean if youre going to do it youve got to do it properly go right through with it not get frightened in the middle and begin howling so that the men hear you and examine the boot i know said richard i think i can do it all right i do wish youd trust me a bit i cant understand your offering to do a difficult thing like that said julian it doesnt seem a bit like you youve not shown yourself to be at all plucky so far julian i think i understand said anne suddenly and she pulled at her brothers sleeve hes thinking of our skins this time not of his own or at least hes trying to lets give him a chance to show hes got a bit of courage i only just want a chance said richard in a small voice all right said julian you shall have it itll be a very pleasant surprise if you take your chance and do something helpful tell me exactly what ive got to do said richard trying to keep his voice from trembling well once youre in the boot well have to shut you in goodness knows how long youll have to wait there in the dark said julian i warn you it will be jolly stuffy and uncomfortable when the car goes off it will be more uncomfortable still poor richard said anne as soon as the car stops anywhere and you hear the men get out wait a minute to give them time to get out of sight and hearing and then scramble out of the boot yourself and go straight to the nearest policestation said julian tell your story quickly give this address owls dene owls hill some miles from middlecombe woods and the police will do the rest got all that yes said richard do you still want to go now you know what youre in for asked dick yes said richard again he was surprised by a warm hug from anne richard youre nice and i didnt think you were said anne he then got a thump on the back from julian well richard pull this off and youll wipe out all the silly things youve done now what about getting into the boot immediately we dont know when the men will be coming out yes ill get in now said richard feeling remarkably brave after annes hug and julians thump julian opened the boot he examined the inside of the bootcover i dont believe richard could open it from the inside he said no he couldnt we mustnt close it tight then ill have to wedge it a bit open with a stick or something that will give him a little air and hell be able to push the boot open when he wants to wheres a stick dick found one richard got into the boot and curled himself up there wasnt very much room even for him he looked extremely cramped julian shut the boot and wedged it with a stick so that there was a crack of half an inch all round dick gave him a sharp nudge quick someones coming hunt for richard mr perton could be seen standing at the front door outlined in the light from the lamp in the hall he was talking to rooky who apparently was not going out it seemed as if only mr perton was leaving in the car good luck richard julian whispered as he and the others melted into the shadows on the other side of the drive they stood there in the darkness watching mr perton walk over to the car he got in and slammed the door thank goodness he hadnt wanted to put anything in the boot the engine started up and the car purred away down the drive at the same time there came the grating sound of the gate machinery being used gates are opening for him muttered dick they heard the car go right down the drive and out of the gateway without stopping it hooted as it went evidently a signal to the house the gates had been opened just at the right moment they were now being shut judging by the grinding noise going on the front door closed the children stood in silence for a minute or two thinking of richard shut up in the boot id never have thought it of him said george no but you just simply never know what is in anybody said julian thoughtfully i suppose even the worst coward the most despicable crook the most dishonest rogue can find some good thing in himself if he wants to badly enough yes its the wantingto that must be so rare though said dick look theres aggie at the kitchendoor shes calling us in they went to her you can come in now she said i cant give you much supper im afraid because hunchy will be here but ill put some cake up in your room under the blankets they went into the kitchen it was pleasant with a logfire and the mellow light from an oillamp hunchy was at the far end doing something with a rag and polish he gave the children one of his familiar scowls take that dog out and leave him out he ordered no said george then ill tell rooky said hunchy neither he nor aggie seemed to notice that there were only four children not five well if rooky comes here ive no doubt timmy will bite his other hand said george anyway wont he be surprised to find timmy still alive and kicking nothing more was said about timmy aggie silently put the remains of a plumpie on the table theres your supper she said there was a very small piece each as they were finishing hunchy went out aggie spoke in a whisper i heard the wireless at six oclock there was a police message about one of you called richard his mother reported him missing and the police put it out on the wireless did they really said dick i say theyll soon be here then but do they know where you are asked aggie surprised dick shook his head not yet but i expect well soon be traced here aggie looked doubtful nobodys ever been traced here yet nor ever will be its my belief the police did come once looking for somebody and mr perton let them in all politelike they hunted everywhere for the person they said they wanted but they couldnt find him julian nudged dick he thought he knew where the police might have found him in the little secret room behind that sliding panel funny thing said julian i havent seen a telephone here dont they have one no said aggie no phone no gas no electricity no water laid on no nothing only just secrets and signs and comings and goings and threats and she broke off as hunchy came back and went to the big fireplace where a kettle was slung over the burning logs hunchy looked round at the children rooky wants the one of you thats called richard he said with a horrible smile says he wants to learn him a few lessons all the four felt extremely thankful that richard was not there they felt sure he wouldnt have liked the lessons that rooky wanted to teach him they looked round at one another and then all round the room richard where is richard what do you mean wheres richard said hunchy in a snarling voice that made timmy growl one of you is richard thats all i know why there were five children now theres only four said aggie in sudden astonishment ive only just noticed is richard the missing one dear me wheres richard gone said julian pretending to be surprised he called him richard hey richard where are you hunchy looked angry now none of your tricks one of yous richard which one not one of us is answered dick gracious where can richard be do you suppose weve left him in the grounds ju must have said julian he went to the kitchen window and swung it wide open richard he roared youre wanted richard but no richard answered or appeared of course he was miles away in the boot of the black bentley there came the sound of angry footsteps in the hall and the kitchen door was flung open rooky stood there scowling his hand done up in a big bandage with a delighted bark timmy leapt forward george caught him just in time that dog didnt i say he was to be poisoned shouted rooky furiously why havent you brought that boy to me hunchy hunchy looked afraid he dont seem to be here he answered sullenly unless one of these here children is him sir rooky glanced over them no hes not one of them where is richard he demanded of julian ive just been yelling for him said julian with an air of amazement funny thing he was out in the grounds all day with us and now were indoors he just isnt here shall i go and hunt in the grounds ill shout for him again said dick going to the window richard shut up said rooky ill go and find him wheres my torch get it aggie and when i find him hell be sorry for himself very very sorry ill come too said hunchy you go one way and ill go another get ben and fred too ordered rooky hunchy departed to fetch ben and fred whoever they were the children supposed they must be the other men who had arrived with rooky the night before rooky went out of the kitchen door with his powerful torch anne shivered she was very very glad that richard couldnt be found however hard the men looked for him soon there came the sound of other voices in the grounds as the four men separated into two parties and began to search every yard where is he the poor boy whispered aggie i dont know said julian truthfully he wasnt going to give any secrets away to aggie even though she seemed really friendly to them she went out of the room and the children clustered together speaking in low voices i say what a blessing it was richard that went off in the bentley and not one of us whispered george my word yes i didnt like the look on rookys face when he came into the kitchen just now said julian well richards got a little reward for trying to be brave said anne hes missed some illtreatment from rooky julian glanced at a clock in the kitchen look its almost nine theres a wireless on that shelf lets put it on and see if theres a message about richard he switched it on and twiddled the knob till he got the right station after a minute or two of news there came the message they wanted to hear missing from home since wednesday richard thurlow kent a boy of twelve wellbuilt fair hair blue eyes wearing grey shorts and grey jersey probably on a bicycle so the message went on ending with a police telephone number that could be called there was of course no message about julian and the others they were relieved that means that mother wont be worrying said george but it also means that unless richard can get help nobody can possibly find out were here if were not missed we cant be searched for and i dont really want to be here much longer nobody did of course all their hopes were now on richard he seemed rather a broken reed to rely on but you never knew he just might be successful in escaping unseen from the boot and getting to a police station after about an hour rooky and the others came in all in a furious temper rooky turned on julian whats happened to that boy you must know grrrrr said timmy at once rooky beckoned to julian to come into the hall he shut the kitchen door and shouted at julian again well you heard what i said wheres that boy isnt he out in the grounds said julian putting on a very perturbed look good gracious what can have happened to him i assure you he was with us all day aggie will tell you that and hunchy too theyve already told me said rooky hes not in the grounds weve gone over every inch where is he well would he be somewhere in the house then suggested julian innocently how can he be raged rooky the front doors been closed and locked all day except when perton went out and hunchy and aggie swear he didnt come into the kitchen its an absolute mystery said julian shall i hunt all over the house the others can help me maybe the dog will smell him out im not having that dog out of the kitchen said rooky or any of you either i believe that boys about somewhere laughing up his sleeve at us all and i believe you know where he is too i dont said julian and thats the truth when i do find him ill ill rooky broke off quite unable to think of anything bad enough to do to poor richard he went to join the others still muttering julian went thankfully back to the kitchen he was very glad richard was well out of the way it was pure chance that he had gone but what a very good thing where was richard now what was he doing was he still in the boot of the car how julian wished he knew richard has his own adventure richard had been having a much too exciting time he had gone with the car of course crouching in the boot at the back with a box of tools digging into him and a can of petrol smelling horribly nearby making him feel sick through the gates went the car and down the hill it went at a good pace and once stopped very suddenly it had gone round a corner and almost collided with a stationary lorry so that mr perton had put the brake on in a hurry poor richard was terrified he bumped his head hard on the back of the boot and gave a groan he sat curled up feeling sick and scared he began to wish he had not tried to be a hero and get help being any kind of a hero was difficult but this was a dreadful way of being heroic the car went on for some miles richard had no idea where it was going at first he heard no other traffic at all then he heard the sound of many wheels on the road and knew he must be getting near a town once they must have gone by a railway station or railway line because richard could distinctly hear the noise of a train and then a loud hooting the car stopped at last richard listened intently was it stopping just for traffic lights or was mr perton getting out if so that was his chance to escape he heard the car door slam ah mr perton was out of the car then richard pressed hard at the cover of the boot julian had wedged it rather tightly but it gave at last and the lid of the boot opened it fell back with rather a noise richard looked out cautiously he was in a dark street a few people were walking on the pavement opposite a lamppost was some way away could he get out now or would mr perton be about and see him he stretched out a leg to slide from the boot and jump to the ground but he had been huddled up in an awkward position for so long that he was too stiff to move cramp caught him and he felt miserably uncomfortable as he tried to straighten himself out instead of jumping out and taking to his heels at once poor richard had to go very slowly indeed his legs and arms would not move quickly he sat for a halfminute on the open bootlid trying to make up his mind to jump down and then he heard mr pertons voice he was running down the steps of the house outside which he had parked the car richard was horrified it hadnt dawned on him that he would come back so quickly he tried to jump from the bootcover and fell sprawling to the ground mr perton heard him and thinking someone was trying to steal something from his car he rushed up to the boot richard scrambled up just in time to get away from his outstretched hand he ran to the other side of the road as fast as he could hoping that his stiff cramped legs wouldnt let him down mr perton tore after him hey you stop what are you doing in my car shouted mr perton richard dodged a passerby and tore on panicstricken he mustnt be caught he mustnt be caught mr perton caught up with him just under the lamppost he grabbed richards collar and swung him round roughly you let me go yelled richard and kicked mr pertons ankles so hard that he almost fell over mr perton recognized him good gracious its you he cried the boy rooky wants what are you doing here how did you but with a last despairing struggle richard was off again leaving his coat in mr pertons hands his legs were feeling better now and he could run faster he tore round the corner colliding with another boy he was off and away before the boy could even call out mr perton also tore round the corner and collided with the same boy who however was a bit quicker than before and clutched mr perton by the coat in a real rage at being so nearly knocked over again by the time mr perton had got himself free from the angry boy richard was out of sight mr perton raced to the corner of the road and looked up and down the poorly lighted road he gave an exclamation of anger lost him little pest how did he get here could he have been at the back of the car ah surely thats him over there it was richard had hidden in a garden but was now being driven out by the barking of a dog in despair he tore out of the gate and began running again mr perton tore after him round another corner panting hard round yet another hoping that no passerby would clutch at him and stop him poor richard he didnt feel at all heroic and didnt enjoy it a bit either he stumbled round the next corner and came into the main street of the town and there opposite was a lamp that had a very welcome word shining on the glass police thankfully richard stumbled up the steps and pushed open the police station door he almost fell inside there was a kind of waitingroom there with a policeman sitting at a table he looked up in astonishment as richard came in in such a hurry now then whats all this he asked the boy richard looked fearfully back at the door expecting mr perton to come in at any moment but he didnt the door remained shut mr perton was not going to visit any police station if he could help it especially with richard pouring out a most peculiar story richard was panting so much that he couldnt say a word at first then it all came out the policeman listened in amazement and very soon stopped richards tale and called a big burly man in who proved to be a most important police inspector he made richard tell his tale slowly and as clearly as he could the boy was now feeling much better in fact he was feeling quite proud of himself to think hed done it escaped in the boot of the car got out managed to get away from mr perton and arrive safely at the police station marvellous wheres this owls dene demanded the inspector and the constable near by answered must be that old place on owls hill sir you remember we once went there on some kind of police business but it seemed to be all right run by a hunchback and his sister for some man who is often away abroad perton i think the name was thats right cried richard it was mr pertons car i came here in a black bentley know the number said the inspector sharply kmf said richard at once good lad said the inspector he picked up a telephone and gave a few curt instructions for a police car to try to trace the bentley immediately so youre richard thurlow kent he said your mother is very upset and anxious about you ill see that she is telephoned to straight away youd better be taken home now in a police car oh but sir cant i go with you to owls dene when you drive up there said richard deeply disappointed youll be going there wont you because of all the others anne dick george and julian well be going all right said the inspector grimly but you wont be with us youve had enough adventures you can go home and go to bed youve done well to escape and come here quite the hero richard couldnt help feeling pleased but how he wished he could race off to owls dene with the police what a marvellous thing it would be to march in with them and show julian how well he had managed his part of the affair perhaps julian would think better of him then the inspector however was not having any boys in the cars that were to go to owls dene and richard was taken off by the young constable and told to wait till a car came to take him home the telephone rang and the inspector answered it no trace of the bentley right thanks he spoke to the young constable didnt think theyd get him hes probably raced back to owls dene to warn the others well get there soon after said the constable with a grin our wolseleys pretty well as fast as a bentley mr perton had indeed raced off as soon as he saw richard stumbling up the police station steps he had gone back to his car at top speed jumped in slammed the door and raced away as fast as he could feeling certain that the police would be on the lookout for kmf immediately he tore dangerously round the corners and hooted madly making everyone leap out of the way he was soon out in the country and there he put on terrific speed his powerful headlights picking out the dark country lanes for half a mile ahead as he came to the hill on which owls dene stood he hooted loudly he wanted the gates opened quickly just as he got up to them they opened someone had heard his hooting signal good he raced up the drive and stopped at the front door it opened as he jumped out rooky stood there and two other men with him all looking anxious whats up perton why are you back so quickly called rooky anything wrong mr perton ran up the steps shut the door and faced the three men in the hall do you know whats happened that boy richard kent was in the car when i went out see hidden in the back or in the boot or somewhere didnt you miss him yes said rooky of course we missed him did you let him get away perton well seeing that i didnt know he was in hiding and had to leave the car to go in and see ted it was easy for him to get away said mr perton he ran like a hare i nearly grabbed him once but he wriggled out of his coat and as he ended up finally in the police station i decided to give up the chase and come back to warn you the police will be out here then before you can say jack robinson shouted rooky youre a fool perton you ought to have got that boy theres our ransom gone west and i was so glad to be able to get my hands on the little brute its no good crying over spilt milk said perton what about weston suppose the police find him theyre looking for him all right the papers have been full of only two things the last couple of days disappearance of richard thurlow kent and escape from prison of solomon weston and were mixed up with both these do you want to be shoved back into prison again rooky youve only just come out you know what are we going to do we must think said rooky in a panicstricken voice come in this room here we must think the secret room the four children had heard the car come racing up the drive and had heard mr pertons arrival julian went to the kitchen door eager to find out what he could if mr perton was back then either richard had played his part well and had escaped or he had been discovered and had been brought back he heard every word of the excited talk out in the hall good good good richard had got away and was even now telling his tale to the police it surely wouldnt be very long before the police arrived at owls dene then and what surprising things they would find there he tiptoed out into the hall when he heard the men go into the room near by what were their plans he hoped they would not vent their rage on him or the others it was true they had timmy but in a real emergency rooky would probably think nothing of shooting the dog straightaway julian didnt at all like what he heard from the room where the men talked over their plans im going to bang all those kids heads together as hard as i can to start with growled rooky that big boy whats his name julian or something must have planned richard kents escape ill give him a real good thrashing the interfering little beast what about the sparklers rooky said another mans voice wed better put them in a safe hiding place before the police arrive well have to hurry oh itll be some time before they find they cant open that gate said rooky and itll take a little more time before they climb that wall well have time to put the sparklers into the room with weston if hes safe there theyll be safe too sparklers thought julian excited those are diamonds so theyve got a haul of diamonds hidden somewhere whatever next get them ordered mr perton take them to the secret room and be quick about it rooky the police may be here at any minute now well spin some tale about that kid richard and his friends said the voice of a fourth man well say they were caught trespassing the lot of them and kept here as a little punishment actually if theres time i think it would be best to let the rest of them go after all they dont know anything they cant give away any secrets rooky didnt want to let them go he had grim plans for them but the others argued him over all right he said sullenly let them go then if theres time you take them down to the gate perton and shove them out before the police arrive theyll probably set off thankfully and get lost in the dark so much the better you get the sparklers then and see to them said mr perton and julian heard him getting up from his chair the boy darted back to the kitchen it looked as if there would be nothing for it but to let themselves be led down to the gates and shoved out and julian decided that if that happened they would wait at the gateway till the police arrived they wouldnt get lost in the dark as rooky hoped mr perton came into the kitchen his eyes swept over the four children timmy growled so you made a little plan did you and hid richard in the car he said well for that were going to turn you all out into the night and youll probably lose yourselves for days in the deserted countryside round here and i hope you do nobody said anything mr perton aimed a blow at julian who ducked timmy sprang at the man but george had hold of his collar and he just missed snapping mr pertons arm in two if that dog had stayed here a day longer id have shot him said mr perton fiercely come on all of you get a move on goodbye aggie said anne aggie and hunchy watched them go out of the kitchen door into the dark garden aggie looked very scared indeed hunchy spat after them and said something rude but when they were halfway down the drive there came the sound of cars roaring at top speed up the hill to the gates of owls dene two cars fast and powerful with brilliant headlights police cars without a doubt mr perton stopped then he shoved the children roughly back towards the house it was too late to set them free and hope they would lose themselves you look out for rooky he said to them he goes mad when hes frightened and hes going to be frightened now with the police hammering at the gates julian and the others cautiously edged into the kitchen they werent going to risk meeting rooky if they could help it nobody was there at all not even hunchy or aggie mr perton went through to the hall have you put those sparklers away he called and a voice answered him yes westons got them with him theyre ok did you get the kids out in time no and the police are at the gates already growled mr perton a howl came from someone probably rooky the police already if i had that kid richard here id skin him alive wait till ive burnt a few letters i dont want found then ill go and get hold of the other kids im going to put somebody through it for this and i dont care who dont be foolish rooky said mr pertons voice do you want to get yourself into trouble again through your violent temper leave the kids alone julian listened to all this and felt very uneasy indeed he ought to hide the others even timmy would be no protection if rooky had a gun but where could he hide them rooky will search the whole house from top to bottom if he loses his temper much more and really makes up his mind to revenge himself on us thought julian what a pity there isnt another secret room we could hide there and be safe but even if there was one he didnt know of it he heard rooky go upstairs with the others now if he and the other children were going to hide somewhere in safety this was their chance but where could they hide an idea came to julian was it a brilliant one or wasnt it he couldnt make up his mind at first then he decided that brilliant or not they had got to try it he spoke to the others weve got to hide rooky isnt safe when hes in a temper where shall we hide said anne fearfully in the secret room said julian they all gaped at him in amazement but but somebody else is already hidden there you told us you saw him last night said george at last i know that cant be helped hes the last person to give us away if we share his hidingplace he wouldnt want to be found himself said julian it will be a frightful squash because the secret room is very very small but its the safest place i can think of timmy will have to come too said george firmly julian nodded of course we may need him to protect us against the hidden man he said he may be pretty wild at us all invading his hidingplace we dont want to have him calling rooky well be all right once were in the room because timmy will keep him quiet and once were in he wont call out because well tell him the police are here fine said dick lets go is the coast clear yes theyre all upstairs for some reason or other said julian probably destroying things they dont want found come on hunchy and aggie were still not to be seen they had probably heard what the scare was about and were hidden away themselves julian led the way quietly to the little study they stared at the big solid wooden bookcase that stretched from floor to ceiling julian went quickly to one shelf and emptied out the books he felt for the knob there it was he pulled it out and the back panel of the shelf slid noiselessly downwards leaving the large hole there like a window into the secret room the children gasped how queer how very extraordinary they blinked through the hole and saw the small room behind lit by a little candle they saw the hidden man too and he saw them he looked at them in the very greatest astonishment who are you he said in a threatening voice who told you to open that panel wheres rooky and perton were coming through to join you said julian quietly dont make a noise he shoved george up first she slid through the narrow opening sideways and landed feetfirst on the floor timmy followed immediately pushed through by julian the man was up on his feet now angry and surprised he was a big burly fellow with very small closeset eyes and a cruel mouth now look here he began in a loud voice i wont have this wheres perton hey per if you say another word ill set my dog on you said george at a sign from julian timmy growled so ferociously that the man shrank back at once i i he began timmy growled again and bared all his magnificent teeth in a snarl the man climbed up on the narrow bed and subsided looking astonished and furious dick went through the opening next then anne by that time the small room was uncomfortably crowded i say said julian suddenly remembering something i shall have to stay outside the room because the books have got to be put back otherwise rooky will notice the shelf is empty and guess were hiding in the secret room then well be at his mercy oh ju you must come in with us said anne frightened i cant anne i must shut the panel and put the books back said julian i cant risk your being discovered till the police have safely caught that madman rooky i shall be all right dont you worry the police whispered the man in the secret room his eyes almost falling out of his head are the police here at the gates answered julian so keep quiet if you dont want them on top of you at once he pushed the knob the panel slid back into place without a sound julian replaced the books on the shelf as fast as he could then he darted out of the study so that the men would not even guess what he had been up to he was very thankful that rooky had kept away long enough for him to carry out his plan where should he hide himself how long would it take the police to get over the wall or break down the great gates surely they would soon be here there came the sound of footsteps running down the stairs it was rooky he caught sight of julian at once ah there you are where are the others ill show you what happens to children who upset my plans ill show you what rooky carried a whip in his hand and looked quite crazy julian was afraid he darted back into the study and locked the door rooky began to hammer at it then such a crash came on the door that julian guessed he was smashing it down with one of the hall chairs the door would be down in a moment a very exciting finish julian was a courageous boy but just at that minute he felt very scared indeed and what must the children hidden in the secret room beyond be thinking poor anne must be feeling terrified at rookys shouts and the crashing on the door and then a really marvellous idea came to julian why oh why hadnt he thought of it before he could open the gates himself for the police to come in he knew how to do it and there was the wheel nearby in the corner that set the gate machinery working once he had the gates open it would not be more than a few minutes surely before the police were hammering at the front door julian ran to the wheellike handle he turned it strongly a grinding whining noise came at once as the machinery went into action rooky was still crashing at the door with the heavy chair already he had broken in one panel of it but when he suddenly heard the groaning of the machinery that opened the gates he stopped in panic the gates were being opened the police would soon be there he would be caught he forgot the beautiful stories he had arranged to tell forgot the plans that he and the others had made forgot everything except that he must hide he flung down the chair and fled julian sat down in the nearest chair his heart beating as if he had just been running a race the gates were open rooky had fled the police would soon be there and even as he sat thinking this there came the sound of powerful cars roaring up the wide drive then the engines stopped and car doors were thrown open someone began to hammer at the front door open in the name of the law cried a loud voice and then came another hammering nobody opened the door julian unlocked the halfbroken door of the study he was in and peered cautiously into the hall no one seemed to be about he raced to the front door pulled back the bolts and undid the heavy chain afraid each moment that some of the men would come to punch him away but they didnt the door was pushed open by the police who swarmed in immediately there were eight of them and they looked surprised to see a boy there which boys this said the inspector julian sir said julian im glad youve come things were getting pretty hot where are the men asked the inspector walking right in i dont know said julian find them ordered the inspector and his men fanned out up the hall but before they could go into any room a cool voice called to them from the end of the corridor may i ask what all this is it was mr perton looking as calm as could be smoking a cigarette he stood at the door of his sittingroom seeming quite unperturbed since when has a mans house been broken into for no reason at all where are the rest of you demanded the inspector in here inspector drawled mr perton we were having a little conference and heard the hammering at the door apparently you got in somehow im afraid youll get into trouble for this the inspector advanced to the room where mr perton stood he glanced into it aha our friend rooky i see he said genially only a day or two out of prison rooky and youre mixed up in trouble again wheres weston i dont know what you mean said rooky sullenly how should i know where he is he was in prison last time i knew anything about him yes but he escaped said the inspector somebody helped him rooky somebody planned his escape for him friends of yours and somebody knows where the diamonds are that he stole and hid ive a guess that youre going to share them with him in return for getting your friends to help him where is weston rooky i tell you i dont know repeated rooky not here if thats what youre getting at you can search the whole house from top to bottom if you like perton wont mind will you perton look for the sparklers too if you want to i dont know anything about them perton weve suspected you for a long time said the inspector turning to mr perton who was still calmly smoking his cigarette we think youre at the bottom of all these prison escapes thats why you bought this lonely old house isnt it so that you could work from it undisturbed you arrange the escapes you arrange for a change of clothes you arrange for a safe hidingplace till the man can get out of the country utter nonsense said mr perton and you only help criminals who have been known to do a clever robbery and hide the stuff before theyre caught went on the inspector in a grim voice so you know youll make plenty of profit on your deals perton weston is here all right and so are the diamonds where are they theyre not here said perton youre at liberty to look and see you wont get anything out of me inspector im innocent julian had listened to all this in amazement why they had fallen into the very middle of a nest of thieves and rogues well he knew where weston was and the diamonds too he stepped forward tell your story later son said the inspector weve things to do now well sir i can save you a lot of time said julian i know where the hidden prisoner is and the diamonds too rooky leapt to his feet with a howl mr perton looked at julian hard the other men glanced uneasily at one another you dont know anything shouted rooky you only came here yesterday the inspector regarded julian gravely he liked this boy with the quiet manners and honest eyes do you mean what you say he asked oh yes said julian come with me sir he turned and went out of the room everyone crowded after him police rooky and the others but three of the policemen quietly placed themselves at the back julian led them to the study rookys face went purple but perton gave him a sharp nudge and he said nothing julian went to the bookcase and swept a whole shelf of books out at once rooky gave a terrific yell and leapt at julian stop that what are you doing two policemen were on the infuriated rooky at once they dragged him back julian pulled out the knob and the panel slid noiselessly downwards leaving a wide space in the wall behind from the secret room four faces gazed out the faces of three children and a man timmy was there too but he was on the floor for a few moments nobody said a single word the ones in the hidden room were so surprised to see such a crowd of policemen looking in at them and the ones in the study were filled with amazement to see so many children in the tiny room well said the inspector well im blessed and if that isnt weston himself large as life and twice as natural rooky began to struggle with the policemen he seemed absolutely infuriated with julian that boy he muttered let me get at him that boy got the diamonds there weston asked the inspector cheerfully may as well hand them over weston was very pale indeed he made no move at all dick reached under the narrow bed and pulled out a bag here they are he said with a grin jolly good lot they feel heavy as anything can we come out now ju all three were helped out by policemen weston was handcuffed before he was brought out rooky found that he also had handcuffs on all of a sudden and to mr pertons angry surprise he heard a click at his own wrists too a very very nice little haul said the inspector in his most genial voice as he looked inside the bag what happened to your prison clothes weston thats a nice suit youve got on but you werent wearing that when you left prison i can tell you where they are said julian remembering everyone stared in amazement except george and anne who also knew of course theyre stuffed down a well belonging to an old tumbledown shack on a lane between here and middlecombe woods said julian i could easily find it for you any time mr perton stared at julian as if he couldnt believe his ears how do you know that he asked roughly you cant know a thing like that i do know it said julian and whats more you took him a new suit of clothes and arrived at the shack in your black bentley didnt you kmf i saw it thats got you perton said the inspector with a pleased smile thats put you on the spot hasnt it good boy this notices a whole lot of interesting things i shouldnt be surprised if he joins the police force someday we could do with people like him perton spat out his cigarette and stamped on it viciously as if he wished he was stamping on julian those children if that idiot rooky hadnt spotted richard kent and gone after him none of this would have happened weston would have been safely hidden the diamonds sold weston could have been sent abroad and he perton would have made a fortune now a pack of children had spoilt everything any other people in the house the inspector asked julian you appear to be the one who knows more than anybody else my boy so perhaps you can tell me that yes aggie and hunchy said julian promptly but dont be hard on aggie sir she was awfully good to us and shes terrified of hunchy well remember what you say promised the inspector search the house men bring along aggie and hunchy too well want them for witnesses anyway leave two men on guard here the rest of us will go it needed the black bentley as well as the two police cars to take everyone down the drive and on to the next town the childrens bicycles had to be left behind as they could not be got on the cars anywhere as it was it was a terrific squash you going home tonight the inspector asked julian well run you back what about your people wont they be worried by all this theyre away explained julian and we were on a cycling tour so they dont know theres really nowhere we can go for the night but there was there was a message awaiting the inspector to say that mrs thurlow kent would be very pleased indeed if julian and the others would spend the night with richard she wanted to hear about their extraordinary adventures right said julian that settles that well go there and anyway i want to bang old richard on the back he turned out quite a hero after all youll have to keep around for a few days said the inspector well want you i expect youve a very fine tale to tell and youve been a great help well keep around then said julian and if you could manage to have our bikes collected sir id be very grateful richard was at the front door to meet them all although by now it was very late indeed he was dressed in clean clothes and looked very spruce beside the dirty bedraggled company of children that he went to greet i wish id been in at the last he cried i was sent off home and i was wild mother and dad here are the children i went off with mr thurlow kent had just come back from america he shook hands with all of them come along in he said weve got a fine spread for you you must be ravenous tell me what happened tell me at once demanded richard we simply must have a bath first protested julian were filthy well you can tell me while youre having a bath said richard i cant wait to hear it was lovely to have hot baths and to be given clean clothes george was solemnly handed out shorts like the boys and the others grinned to see that both mr and mrs kent thought she was a boy george of course grinned too and didnt say a word i was very angry with richard when i heard what he had done said mr kent when they were all sitting at table eating hungrily im ashamed of him richard looked downcast at once he gazed beseechingly at julian yes richard made a fool of himself said julian and landed us all into trouble he wants taking in hand sir richard looked even more downcast he went very red and looked at the tablecloth but said julian he more than made up for his silliness sir he offered to squash himself into the boot of the car and escape that way and go and warn the police that took some doing believe me i think quite a bit of richard now he leaned over and gave the boy a pat on the back dick and the others followed it up with thumps and timmy woofed in his deepest voice richard was now red with pleasure thanks he said awkwardly ill remember this see you do my boy said his father it might all have ended very differently but it didnt said anne happily it ended like this we can all breathe again till the next time said dick with a grin what do you say timmy old boy woof said timmy of course and thumped his tail on the floor woof
