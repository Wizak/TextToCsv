 chapter one revolution in ramat about two months earlier certain events took place that would greatly affect the famous girls school in the palace of ramat two young men sat smoking one man was dark with large sad looking eyes he was prince ali yusuf the sheikh of ramat a small but very rich country in the middle east the other young man bob rawlinson had light hair and freckles and was the princes private pilot the two men had been at school together and were very close friends they shot at us bob said prince ali unable to believe it they wanted to shoot down our plane yes they did said bob grimly you should have left the country two weeks ago ali now its too late perhaps you can go to the british embassy shall i talk to my friend who works there ali yusufs face reddened with anger i will never hide in your embassy the rebels would probably drag me from the building he sighed i dont understand he said sadly my grandfather was a cruel man who killed his enemies without pity and yet he is still admired and respected and i i have built hospitals schools and houses all the things people want so why are they rebelling against me bob rawlinson sighed lets not talk about that now the most important thing is to get you safely out of the country is there anybody in the army you can trust slowly prince ali yusuf shook his head i do not know he said i cannot be sure there are secret agents everywhere they hear everything they know everything even at the airstrip bob stopped but we can trust achmed he caught someone trying to sabotage the plane someone we thought we could trust so if you want to leave the country ali we must go soon i know i know i am quite certain now that if i stay i will be killed ali spoke without emotion as if his future was only of slight interest to him we may be killed anyway bob warned him well have to fly north over the mountains at this time of year its very dangerous ali yusuf looked worried i dont want anything to happen to you bob dont worry about me ali im not important no its you i dont want to make you leave if some people in the army are loyal i dont want to run away said ali simply but nor do i want to be killed by a crowd of angry people after a moments thought he made his decision very well he said with a sigh we will try to leave when this afternoon said bob go and inspect that new road and stop at the airstrip ill have the plane ready to go we cant take anything with us there is only one thing i wish to take with me said ali yusuf he took out a small leather bag from under his shirt and poured its contents on the table bob held his breath for a moment before him was a pile of beautiful precious jewels my goodness are they real ali looked amused of course they are real they are worth about a million pounds a million pounds bob picked up the jewels and let them fall through his fingers its fantastic like a fairy story yes the dark young man nodded such jewels have a strange effect on people death and violence follow them around and women beautiful jewels make women go mad i would not trust any woman with these jewels but i will trust you me bob stared yes replied his friend i do not want these jewels to be taken by my enemies i do not know when the rebellion will take place but i may not live to reach the airstrip this afternoon take the jewels and do the best you can but i dont understand said bob what do you want me to do with them take them out of the country somehow ali said calmly you will think of a plan but ali i dont know how to do that ali sat back in his chair and smiled you are sensible bob and you are honest when we were at school you always had clever ideas i will give you the name and address of a man who deals with such things for me in case i do not survive do not look so worried bob do the best you can that is all i ask i shall not blame you if you fail it is as allah wills youre crazy exclaimed bob no i believe in fate that is all but ali a million pounds arent you afraid that ill keep the jewels for myself ali yusuf smiled at his friend no bob he said i am not afraid of that chapter two the woman on the balcony bob rawlinson was very unhappy as he walked along the crowded main street outside the palace he felt that everyone knew he was carrying a million pounds in his pocket as he walked along he tried to think where was he going what was he planning to do he had no idea and not much time he went into a local cafe and ordered some lemon tea as he drank it he slowly began to feel better the atmosphere of the cafe was calming at a nearby table an elderly arab was peacefully sitting and drinking his hot tea and behind him two men played a game of dice it was a good place to sit and think and he had to think hed been given jewels worth a million pounds and he had to get them out of the country as soon as possible what was he going to do he couldnt involve his friend at the british embassy what he needed was an ordinary person who was leaving the country a businessman or a tourist would be best then suddenly bob thought of his sister joan sutcliffe of course joan had been in ramat for two months with her daughter jennifer who was recovering from an illness they were going back to england by ship in a few days time joan was the ideal person bob thought yes he could trust joan even with jewels but wait a minute could he really trust joan joan was honest yes but she would talk talk about the jewels it would be safer if she didnt know what she was carrying bob looked at his watch stood up and left the cafe outside everything seemed so normal there was nothing to show that rebels were planning a revolution bob walked to ramats leading hotel the hotel clerk behind the desk knew bob well and smiled at him good morning sir do you want your sister im afraid she and your niece have gone to visit the temple bob swore quietly to himself joan wouldnt be home for hours ill go up to her room he said and the clerk gave him the key inside his sisters room it was very untidy golf clubs lay across a chair and tennis racquets had been thrown on the bed clothes were lying around and the table was covered with rolls of film postcards books and souvenirs bob now had a problem he wouldnt see joan before he flew ali out that afternoon and he couldnt just leave her a package of jewels and a note because hed probably been watched and followed to the hotel he hadnt noticed anyone but that just meant they were good at their job there was nothing suspicious in coming to see his sister but if he left her a package and a note the package would be opened and the note would be read if only he had more time he looked around the room and then he had an idea with a smile he took from his pocket the little tool kit he always carried he saw that his niece jennifer had some plasticine that would help he worked quickly once he looked up at the open window he felt that someone was watching him but no there was no balcony outside this room when he finished he nodded in approval he was sure that nobody not even joan or jennifer would notice what hed done when he had cleared up he wrote an ordinary note to his sister he would leave a message with someone else to give to joan in england he wrote quickly dear joan i came to ask if youd like to play golf this evening hut if youve been to the temple youll probably be too tired what about tomorrow five oclock at the club yours bob next he telephoned the british embassy and was connected to his friend john edmundson john its bob rawlinson can you meet me somewhere when you finish work or earlier if you can its important well actually its about a girl he gave an embarrassed cough shes wonderful really wonderful but its a bit difficult because all the telephones in ramat were tapped and listened to bob and john edmundson had their own secret code a wonderful girl meant something urgent and important really bob you and your girls said edmundson with disapproval all right ill meet you at two oclock bob heard a click as the person who had been listening to their conversation put down the phone he would meet edmundson outside the main bank at two oclock and tell him about the secret hiding place joan and jennifer were travelling on a slow boat back to england which would take six weeks by that time the revolution in ramat would have either succeeded or failed and ali yusuf might be safely in europe or they might both be dead bob looked carefully around the room before he left it looked exactly the same peaceful and untidy his harmless note to joan was on the table there was no one in the corridor when bob left the room the woman in the room next door to joan sutcliffes stepped back from the balcony there was a mirror in her hand she had gone out on the balcony to look at her face closely in the clear sunlight then she saw something else she was holding her mirror so that it reflected the mirror of the wardrobe in the room next to hers and in the wardrobe mirror she saw a man doing something very strange and unexpected she stood still watching the man he could not see her from where he was and she could only see him because of the double reflection in the two mirrors once the man did look up suddenly towards the window but since there was no one there he lowered his head again when he had finished what he was doing he wrote a note which he left on the table then the woman heard him make a telephone call and though she didnt hear the words he sounded cheerful and relaxed then she heard the door close the woman waited a few minutes and then opened her door the door of the next room was locked but she opened the lock quickly and expertly with a small knife she went in closing the door behind her and picked up and read the note just as she put the note down she heard voices and ran to the window below joan sutcliffe was complaining in a loud voice to a young man from the british embassy leave ramat now i never heard such nonsense everythings perfectly quiet here her daughter jennifer a pale girl of fifteen stood next to her were going home by boat in a few days anyway continued mrs sutcliffe the doctor said that travelling by sea will be good for jennifers health i refuse to change my plans and fly back to england in this silly hurry you dont have to fly to england said the young man persuasively you can both fly out of ramat and get on your boat at the next port with all our luggage asked joan sutcliffe we have a lot of luggage yes yes i can arrange that ive got a big car waiting outside we can load everything and leave right away oh very well said mrs sutcliffe i suppose wed better pack at once if you dont mind the woman in the bedroom stepped away from the window she looked at the address on one of the luggage labels and then went quickly back to her own room a few moments later joan sutcliffe arrived at the door of her room followed by the hotel clerk your brother went up to your room mrs sutcliffe he said but i think you have just missed him how annoying said mrs sutcliffe and thanked the clerk i suppose bobs fussing too she said to jennifer i cant see any sign of a revolution in the streets myself this doors unlocked how careless people are perhaps it was uncle bob said jennifer i wish id seen him oh hes left me a note she read it quickly bob isnt worried she said he obviously doesnt know anything about a revolution its all a big fuss about nothing i hate packing when its so hot come on jennifer get your things ready quickly ive never been in a revolution said jennifer thoughtfully and you wont be in one now said her mother sharply nothing will happen jennifer looked disappointed chapter three introducing mr robinson six weeks later a young man entered a small office in london behind a desk sat colonel pikeaway a fat middleaged man wearing an untidy suit the colonel always looked half asleep and he smoked a lot of cigars oh said colonel pikeaway as the young man entered your names edmundson isnt it you were at the british embassy in ramat at the time of the revolution thats right sir said the young man john edmundson they said you r wanted to see me sit down said colonel pikeaway you were a friend of bob rawlinsons werent you i knew him fairly well yes said edmundson so you know hes dead then said colonel pikeaway bob rawlinson flew ali yusuf out of ramat on the day of the revolution the plane crashed into a mountain and the wreckage has only just been found with two bodies he paused and looked at edmundson some people very important people have asked us to investigate this case he continued youve heard perhaps that nothing valuable was found on the bodies or in the wreckage we know that bob rawlinson and ali yusuf were great friends did rawlinson say anything to you before he flew out of ramat i think bob did want to tell me something important sir said edmundson cautiously we knew that all the telephones in ramat were tapped so bob and i used a simple code about a wonderful girl bob rang me and used the code on the day the revolution started i arranged to meet him outside the main bank but i never got there because there was fighting and the police closed the road bob flew prince ali out the same afternoon i see said pikeaway and thought for a moment do you know mrs sutcliffe bob rawlinsons sister said edmundson yes i did meet her and her daughter in ramat she was much older than bob mrs sutcliffe and her daughter arrive back in england tomorrow do you think that bob rawlinson would have told his sister an important secret its difficult to say but no i dont think so colonel pikeaway sighed and was silent for a moment before he said goodbye to edmundson thank you for coming im sorry i havent been able to help sir when john edmundson left colonel pikeaway picked up the phone send agent r in to see me he said ive got a job for him colonel pikeaway looked up as a good looking young man tall dark and muscular entered the room the colonel grinned im sending you to a girls school he said to meadowbank meadowbank said the young man in surprise are the girls making bombs in chemistry class dont ask silly questions said the colonel and listen im sure youve heard about the recent death of prince ali yusuf of ramat his closest living relative is his cousin princess shaista who starts at meadowbank in the summer term i want you to watch her closely and report to me if anyone seems interested in her the young man nodded and what will i be doing teaching all the teachers there are women colonel pikeaway looked at him thoughtfully no youre going to be the gardener good gardeners are hard to find at the moment and i know you have a lot of experience ill write you some good references to make sure they give you a job and you need to hurry summer term starts soon so i do the gardening and keep my eyes open is that right thats right said the colonel and dont get too involved with those teenage girls i dont want you to be thrown out before youve done your job he started writing your new name is adam goodman go and invent a new past history for yourself and then get to meadowbank as soon as possible he looked at his watch im expecting mr robinson now a buzzer went on the colonels desk there he is now mr robinson is always on time tell me said adam curiously who is he really whats his real name his name said colonel pikeaway is mr robinson thats all i know and thats all anybody knows mr robinson was fat and well dressed with a yellow face sad dark eyes and large very white teeth he and colonel pikeaway greeted each other politely its very good of you to help us said the colonel i hear things you know said mr robinson i know a lot of people and they tell me things did you know that prince ali yusufs plane has been found asked colonel pikeaway yes said mr robinson and i can tell you that it wasnt bob rawlinsons fault the plane crashed the plane was sabotaged by a man called achmed the senior mechanic rawlinson trusted him but achmed now has a wellpaid job with the new ramat government so it was sabotage we didnt know that for sure and now we know that prince ali yusuf is dead continued mr robinson we would like to find the package he left behind the jewels they werent found on ali yusufs body as far as we know no because he gave them to bob rawlinson are you sure of that asked pikeaway sharply they werent on young rawlinsons body either in that case said mr robinson rawlinson must have got them out of the country some other way have you any idea how asked pikeaway rawlinson went up to his sisters hotel room to write her a note and stayed there for about twenty minutes he could have written his note in three minutes what did he do the rest of the time so you think that he hid the jewels in his sisters luggage it seems likely does it not agreed mr robinson mrs sutcliffe and her daughter left ramat that same day and they arrive back in england by boat tomorrow i believe pikeaway nodded weve arranged to look after them he said if she has the jewels she will be in danger mr robinson closed his eyes there are other people interested in them colonel pikeaway asked carefully and what is your er interest in the jewels i represent a certain group of people said mr robinson prince ali yusuf bought some of the jewels from us and so we are interested in finding the jewels now im sure the prince would have approved i will not say any more these matters are private he paused do you know who was staying in the hotel rooms on either side of mrs sutcliffes room on the left hand side was senora angelica de toredo said colonel pikeaway shes a spanish er dancer though i dont think she was spanish or a very good dancer on the other side was a schoolteacher i believe mr robinson smiled you always know everything he said i hope that together we know enough chapter four return of a traveller oh dear said mrs sutcliffe as she looked out of her hotel window its always raining in england its lovely to be back said jennifer i love hearing everyone speak english in the streets and im looking forward to having a really good afternoon tea with lots of cakes now let me make sure we have all our luggage said her mother people are so dishonest these days im sure that man on the boat was trying to steal my green bag and there was another man on the train mrs sutcliffe counted yes yes thats all right all fourteen pieces of luggage are here can we have tea now said jennifer im very hungry all right but i really need to rest so you must go down by yourself i dont know why your father couldnt leave work and meet us especially as he hasnt seen us for three months she gave jennifer some money for tea and watched her daughter leave the room after a few minutes there was a knock at the door it was a young man in a dark blue uniform carrying a tool bag electrician he said ive come to repair the lights in the bathroom mrs sutcliffe had just shown the electrician the bathroom when the telephone rang hello yes mrs sutcliffe speaking my name is derek oconnor i work for the government can i come up to your room mrs sutcliffe its about your brother bob do you have any news im afraid so yes oh oh i see yes come up my rooms on the third floor number mrs sutcliffe sat down on the bed she knew what the news must be soon there was a knock on the door and mrs sutcliffe let in another young man please tell me said mrs sutcliffe bobs dead isnt he yes mrs sutcliffe im afraid so said oconnor your brother was flying prince ali yusuf out from ramat and they crashed in the mountains there was no definite news until a few days ago but now the wreckage of the plane has been found he and prince ali must have died immediately im not at all surprised said mrs sutcliffe her voice shook a little but she was in control of herself i knew bob would die young he was always doing such dangerous things a tear fell down her cheek its such a shock i know im very sorry thank you for coming to tell me mrs sutcliffe said theres something i have to ask you said oconnor did your brother give you anything a package to bring back to england she shook her head no why do you think that your brother had a rather important package and we dont know where it is he came to your hotel the day the revolution started i know said mrs sutcliffe but all he left me was a note asking me to play golf the next day another tear fell down her cheek oh dear i need a handkerchief wheres my bag perhaps i left it in the other room ill get it for you said oconnor he went through the bedroom door and stopped as he saw a young man bending over a suitcase electrician said the young man hurriedly theres something wrong with the lights oconnor pressed the light switch they seem all right to me he said pleasantly i must be in the wrong room said the electrician he quickly picked up his tool bag and left oconnor frowned as he took mrs sutcliffes bag back to her excuse me he said and picked up the phone room here have you just sent up an electrician he waited no no i thought you hadnt no theres nothing wrong he put down the phone and turned to mrs sutcliffe the office didnt send up an electrician he told her i think that man was a thief mrs sutcliffe looked hurriedly in her bag he hasnt taken anything i still have all my money if your brother didnt give you a package said oconnor he might have hidden it in your luggage instead but why would bob do such a thing asked mrs sutcliffe it sounds very unlikely would you mind if we searched your luggage now asked oconnor it might be very important i can help he added persuasively im very good at packing oh well said mrs sutcliffe i suppose so if its really important mummy why have you been unpacking jennifer asked in surprise when she returned dont ask me why said her mother its possible that your uncle bob put something in my luggage to bring home he didnt give you anything jennifer did he no he didnt said jennifer have you been unpacking my things too weve unpacked everything said derek oconnor cheerfully and we havent found anything can i order you a drink mrs sutcliffe while i pack up again i wouldnt mind a cup of tea said mrs sutcliffe oconnor ordered the tea then packed up mrs sutcliffes things again quickly and neatly theres just one thing more mrs sutcliffe he said id like you to be very careful are you staying in london long were going back home to the country tomorrow with my husband thats all right then but if anything strange happens call the police straight away from a local newspaper a man named andrew ball appeared in court yesterday charged with breaking into the house of mr henry sutcliffe police arrested him as he tried to escape from the house and nothing was taken ball admitted that he was guilty of trying to steal saying that he had no work and was looking for money i told you to have the lock on that side door repaired said mr sutcliffe to his wife my dear henry said mrs sutcliffe ive been abroad for the last three months and burglars can always find a way in if they really want to i dont understand said jennifer how did the police know the house was being burgled and get here in time to catch him it seems extraordinary that he didnt take anything commented her mother are you quite sure nothings missing joan demanded her husband mrs sutcliffe sighed its very hard to know she said there was such a mess in my bedroom can i have some more pudding asked jennifer i suppose so said her mother though i do hope they wont think youre too greedy at school meadowbank isnt an ordinary school remember i dont think i really want to go to meadowbank said jennifer i know a girl whose cousin said it was awful thats enough jennifer said mrs sutcliffe youre very lucky to be going to meadowbank its a very good school when andrew ball had been sent to prison for three months derek oconnor rang colonel pikeaway we let ball have plenty of time to search the house before we arrested him he told the colonel in case he knew where the jewels were but he didnt find anything and neither did you replied colonel pikeaway perhaps were wrong and rawlinson didnt hide the jewels in his sisters luggage are there any other possibilities asked oconnor oh yes said the colonel they may still be in ramat hidden in the hotel or near the airstrip or maybe mrs sutcliffe had the package of jewels without knowing and threw them into the sea on her way home and that he added thoughtfully might be the best place for them chapter five letters from meadowhank school letter from julia upjohn to her mother dear mummy ive settled in now and i like it here very much theres another new girl called jennifer and she and i do things together we both like tennis and jennifer is rather good she was in ramat when that revolution started but she missed it because they were taken away by someone from the embassy i like miss bulstrode but she can be frightening ive heard that shes going to retire soon and that miss vansittart will be the new head teacher but im sure it isnt true miss rich our english teacher is wonderful when she reads shakespeare it all seems different and real someone told me she wasnt here last term we do french with mademoiselle blanche who seems to be bored a lot of the time our games teacher miss springer is awful shes got red hair and smells when shes hot there are a lot of foreign girls here and a princess who says she was going to marry prince ali yusuf if he hadnt been killed in that plane crash jennifer says that isnt true and that prince ali liked someone else jennifer knows a lot of interesting things i know youre leaving on your trip soon dont forget your passport like you did last time

same as usual the summer term is always nice the garden is looking beautiful and weve got a new gardener to help old briggs hes young strong and good looking which is a pity girls are so silly miss bulstrode hasnt said anything more about retiring so hope shes changed her mind if miss vansittart became head teacher i really think id have to leave give my love to richard and the children elspeth letter from miss vansittart to a friend dear gloria the summer term has started and all the new girls are settling in well but the new games teacher miss springer is not a success and the girls dont like her she is also rather rude and very nosey and asks far too many personal questions mademoiselle blanche the new french teacher is quite nice but is not a very good teacher miss bulstrode has not yet talked to me about the future but i think she has decided what to do i will be proud to carry on her fine work at meadowbank yours ever eleanor letter from adam goodman to colonel pikeaway sent in the usual way princess shaista arrived in a huge luxury car i hardly recognized her the next day in her school uniform i am already on friendly terms with her and she was asking me about the flowers until the games teacher miss springer took her away and told me not to talk to pupils an old teacher called miss chadwick keeps an eye on me so im being careful no sign so far of anything strange but i hope something will happen soon chapter six early days the teachers were all talking together discussing their holidays the sports pavilion and the new girls then attention turned to the new teachers mademoiselle blanche answered some polite questions about france and miss springer began to talk about herself miss springer had a high opinion of herself she talked loudly about how much she had been valued at other schools and how her colleagues and head teachers had welcomed her advice though of course some people were ungrateful and refused to face the truth she said im not like that and im good at finding things out several times ive discovered a nasty scandal and told everyone about it you shouldnt teach in a school if you have something to hide she laughed loudly youd be surprised if i told you some of the things ive found out about people but i was just doing my duty miss springer laughed again she didnt notice that nobody else was amused miss bulstrode was trying not to smile as miss johnson complained about shaistas brassiere its not the ordinary kind said miss johnson it er pushes her up but i want to look bigger explained shaista helpfully i want to look like a woman youre only fifteen said miss johnson fifteen that is a woman said shaista and i look like a woman do i not miss bulstrode nodded seriously i understand your point of view shaista she said but i suggest that you wear your brassiere when you go to london or to a party not every day when shaista had gone miss bulstrode smiled at miss johnson its true shaista does look fully grown up physically shes totally different to julia upjohn for example its good to have a school full of girls who are different miss bulstrode went back to correcting homework and thought about her school she had worked hard and taken risks to make meadowbank a success and miss chadwick had always been there to help her now miss bulstrode had decided to retire while she was still successful she didnt know what miss chadwick would do perhaps she would prefer to carry on teaching miss bulstrode rang for ann shapland and began to dictate letters ann was a very good secretary thought miss bulstrode better than the one before who had left so suddenly when the letters were done miss bulstrode sighed with relief writing to parents is very dull she said to ann tell me why did you become a secretary i dont really know said ann it just happened but ive had lots of interesting jobs and i cant stay in one job for very long because of my mother i have to go and look after her at times i like change its never dull my job teaching is never dull said miss bulstrode ill miss it when i retire are you going to retire asked ann in surprise why because ive done all i can for meadowbank its someone elses turn miss vansittart i suppose said ann shell carry on your work but is that what i want thought miss bulstrode as ann left the room to start typing do i want eleanor vansittart just to carry on my work or do i want someone with personality like eileen rich to bring new and fresh ideas to meadowbank she looked up as miss chadwick came in whats wrong chaddy nothing said miss chadwick with a frown nothing really i just have a feeling that something isnt quite right but i dont know why and i dont like mademoiselle blanche very much or miss springer having new teachers is always upsetting said miss bulstrode yes agreed miss chadwick that must be it and we must keep an eye on that new gardener its a pity hes so young and good looking both women nodded they knew what damage a good looking young man could do to the hearts of teenage girls chapter seven straws in the wind were you talking to one of the young ladies just now briggs asked his new gardener just for a few minutes said adam sulkily i didnt say anything wrong i dont say you did boy but youd better be careful briggs told him all these girls together with no men to distract them miss bulstrode wouldnt like it ah here she comes now miss bulstrode was approaching good morning she said id like one of you to repair the wire netting round the tennis court as soon as possible she walked off again she just comes along giving orders said briggs annoyed but i suppose you should go and repair that netting when youve finished here oh all right said adam still sounding sulky as she walked back to the school miss bulstrode met miss vansittart coming in the opposite direction what a hot afternoon said miss vansittart yes it is agreed miss bulstrode then she frowned have you noticed that young man the young gardener hes very good looking the girls notice him well have to keep an eye on them she laughed theres never a dull moment running a school do you ever find life dull here eleanor no indeed said miss vansittart i find the work here very exciting and satisfying you must feel very proud of the great success youve achieved tell me eleanor said miss bulstrode if you were running the school instead of me what changes would you make i dont think i would change anything said eleanor vansittart i think meadowbank is perfect the way it is now was the time thought miss bulstrode to ask eleanor vansittart to be the next head teacher but something was stopping her a bell sounded in the distance its time for my german class said miss vansittart i must go she hurried towards the school and miss bulstrode followed her slowly and almost bumped into eileen rich hurrying from a side path oh im sorry said eileen rich i didnt see you i was going to my english class her hair as usual was very untidy you enjoy teaching dont you said miss bulstrode why exactly do you like it eileen rich ran a hand through her hair and thought for a moment because you dont know what youre going to get she said or how the girls will answer its so incredibly exciting miss bulstrode nodded in agreement and do you have your own ideas about running a school she asked oh yes replied eileen rich im sure some of them wouldnt work but you have to take risks in life dont you if you feel strongly enough about something so you dont mind leading a dangerous life smiled miss bulstrode a dark look passed over eileen richs face i suppose not she said i must go now the girls will be waiting she hurried off miss bulstrode was still looking after her when miss chadwick came to find her you look worried honoria said miss chadwick yes i am worried i cant decide what to do said miss bulstrode are you still thinking about retiring you really shouldnt meadowbank needs you you love meadowbank dont you chaddy its the best school in england said miss chadwick we can be proud of ourselves for starting it i cant play with this tennis racquet said jennifer throwing it down in despair its been restrung but the balance is all wrong its much better than mine said julia comparing the two racquets the strings on mine are really loose id still rather have your racquet said jennifer picking it up and swinging it well id rather have yours said julia shall we swap all right then jennifer agreed and the two girls took off their name labels and put them on each others racquet adam was mending the netting round the tennis court when the door of the sports pavilion opened and mademoiselle blanche the little mouselike french teacher looked out she seemed surprised to see adam and went back inside with a guilty look that made adam immediately suspicious soon mademoiselle blanche came out again and closed the door it is a very fine sports pavilion she said to adam as she passed today is the first time i have been inside i wish to write home to my friends in france who keep a school adam was curious mademoiselle blanche could go anywhere in the school that she liked why was she explaining herself to a gardener what had she been doing in the sports pavilion he waited until she was out of sight then left his work and looked inside the sports pavilion himself he couldnt see anything unusual all the same he thought she was doing something in there as he came out again he bumped into ann shapland have you seen miss bulstrode she asked she was talking to briggs just now miss but i think shes gone back to the house replied adam ann frowned what were you doing in the sports pavilion she asked i was just looking adam said rudely im allowed to look arent i i think you should get on with your work said ann and walked back towards the school when she turned round adam was busy repairing the wire netting chapter eight murder one night the telephone rang at the local police station the sergeant who answered quickly wrote down some details and then hurried off to find his colleagues a murder at meadowbank school said detective inspector kelsey greatly surprised whos been murdered the games teacher sir said the sergeant her names miss springer shes been found shot dead in the schools sports pavilion did they find the gun asked kelsey no sir interesting said detective inspector kelsey he called his team together and they left quickly to do their job at meadowbank inspector kelsey was met by miss bulstrode what would you like to do first inspector she asked visit the sports pavilion or hear the full details if someone could show the doctor and my two sergeants where the body is replied kelsey id like a few words with you first certainly miss bulstrode arranged everything without fuss come with me who found the body asked kelsey as he followed miss bulstrode into her sitting room miss johnson the matron said miss bulstrode ill talk to her in a minute kelsey said first can you tell me about the murdered woman her name is grace springer she was new this term and what do you know about her i hadnt met her before this term but her references were excellent said miss bulstrode have you got any idea at all why this happened was she unhappy was she seeing anyone a man perhaps miss bulstrode shook her head not that i know of she replied and it seems very unlikely she was not that kind of woman was there any reason why miss springer should be in the sports pavilion at night continued kelsey no reason at all said miss bulstrode very well miss bulstrode ill talk to miss johnson now miss johnson had been given a lot of brandy to drink after her discovery of the body which made her very talkative such an awful thing to happen she said to inspector kelsey i cant believe it miss springer was so well so sure of herself the sort of woman who could deal with a burglar all by herself a burglar said inspector kelsey was there anything to steal in the sports pavilion well no not really just swimsuits and sports equipment were there any signs of a breakin asked the inspector i dont really know said miss johnson the door was open when we got there and there were no signs of a breakin interrupted miss bulstrode i see said kelsey someone used a key he looked at miss johnson did people like miss springer he asked i dont think so said miss johnson slowly she was very sure of herself sometimes quite rude and was quite nosey now miss johnson said kelsey tell me exactly what happened it was late and i was up with one of our pupils who was ill i looked out of the window and saw a light in the sports pavilion it was moving about so it was a torch yes it must have been i didnt think of burglars i thought it was one of our pupils meeting a boy perhaps i didnt want to disturb miss bulstrode so i went to ask miss chadwick to come with me and see what was going on we went out by the side door and were standing on the path when we heard a shot from the sports pavilion we ran there as fast as we could the door was open and we switched on the light and kelsey interrupted so the sports pavilion was dark when you got there yes we switched on the light and there she was she thats all right said inspector kelsey kindly ill go and see for myself did you meet anyone or hear anyone running away no we didnt said miss johnson well thank you said inspector kelsey thats very clear ill go out to the sports pavilion now ill come with you said miss bulstrode and led inspector kelsey out to the sports pavilion where the police were busy as the inspector entered the pavilion he could see the girls lockers a stand for tennis racquets and hockey sticks and a door that led off to the showers and changing rooms the police photographer and the officer testing for fingerprints had just finished the police doctor was kneeling by the body and looked up as kelsey approached she was shot from about four feet away said the doctor the bullet went through the heart and killed her immediately how long ago about an hour ago replied the doctor kelsey nodded and went to talk to miss chadwick who was standing against the wall she was very calm miss chadwick he said you and miss johnson discovered the body do you know what time it was it was ten minutes to one when miss johnson woke me kelsey nodded he looked down at the dead woman her bright red hair was short and she had a thin athletic body she was wearing a dark heavy skirt and sweater have you found the gun asked kelsey no sir said one of his men but there is a torch with the dead womans fingerprints on it so miss springer had the torch said kelsey thoughtfully any idea why she was here he asked miss chadwick no replied miss chadwick shaking her head no idea at all perhaps she came to find something shed forgotten though it seems rather late to do that kelsey looked around him nothing seemed disturbed except the stand of tennis racquets several of which were lying around on the floor perhaps continued miss chadwick miss springer saw a light and came to investigate like we did she was confident enough to do that on her own was the side door of the house unlocked yes said miss chadwick miss springer probably unlocked it inspector kelsey turned back to miss bulstrode who was standing by the door so miss springer saw a light in the sports pavilion and came to investigate and then she was shot but why would someone shoot her said miss bulstrode surely they would just run away theres nothing here worth stealing and certainly nothing worth murdering for so do you think that miss springer interrupted a meeting of some kind a local boy perhaps that seems more likely said miss bulstrode except local boys and the girls in my school dont have guns chapter nine cat among the pigeons letter from jennifer sutcliffe to her mother dear mummy we had a murder last night miss springer the games teacher it happened in the middle of the night and the police came and this morning theyre asking everybody questions we were told not to talk about it but i thought youd like to know with love jennifer miss bulstrode knew some important people so very little about miss springers murder appeared in the newspapers ann shapland was busy sending letters to the girls parents telling them what happened and miss bulstrode had a meeting with inspector kelsey well search the school to try to find the gun inspector kelsey told her and well need to interview the staff and the pupils until were finished you cant use the sports pavilion im afraid ill ask the girls if they know anything about miss springers death said miss bulstrode ill let you know if they tell me anything ive looked through all the lockers in the sports pavilion sir said the sergeant none of them were locked but i didnt find anything important kelsey looked around thoughtfully the hockey sticks and tennis racquets had been replaced tidily on their stands oh well he said im going up to the house now to have a talk with the staff do you think it was one of them sir it could have been said kelsey nobodys got an alibi except miss chadwick and miss johnson everyone has separate rooms so if they say they were asleep in bed we dont know if theyre lying anyone could have met miss springer or followed her to the sports pavilion after shooting her they could easily come back to the house without being seen but we need a motive why was miss springer shot kelsey walked slowly back to the house old briggs the gardener stopped working as the inspector approached youre working late kelsey said to him smiling but i can see you do a good job the gardens here are very well looked after its hard work said briggs but its easier now ive got a strong young man to help me have you got a new gardener kelsey asked yes i have said briggs adam goodman his name is came and asked for a job hes been here since the start of term hes not on my list of people who work here replied kelsey sharply you can talk to him tomorrow said briggs but im sure he cant tell you anything that evening miss bulstrode spoke to the girls about miss springers death please come and tell me she said if miss springer said anything to you that could be important i wish we did know something said julia upjohn sadly as she and jennifer sutcliffe went back to their rooms but miss springer always seemed so ordinary inspector kelsey was interviewing the teachers he started with miss vansittart but she hadnt seen or noticed anything miss springer had been good at her job but she was rude and people didnt like her very much the next teacher was eileen rich who said that she hadnt heard or noticed miss springer say anything important but when kelsey asked if there was anyone who didnt like or even hated miss springer he got an answer he didnt expect oh no said eileen rich she just wasnt important enough to hate she annoyed people but nothing she did really mattered i think she knew that and thats why she was so rude and eager to find out peoples secrets she tried to make herself important but she just wasnt im sure she wasnt killed for herself she probably was in the wrong place at the wrong time i see said inspector kelsey did you like her miss rich i never really thought about her i know its a horrible thing to say but she was just the games teacher kelsey looked at her curiously she was a strange young woman he thought how long have you been at meadowbank he asked just over a year and a half has there ever been any trouble here before oh no everythings been all right until this term what else has been wrong this term kelsey asked quickly i dont know if i can explain eileen rich said slowly but i do feel that theres someone here whos wrong someone who doesnt belong she looked at him theres a cat among the pigeons were the pigeons all of us and the cats among us but we dont know who the cat is chapter ten fantastic story inspector kelsey next talked to mademoiselle angele blanche she was about thirtyfive with neat brown hair and she wore a plain coat and skirt it was her first term at meadowbank she explained she had been a teacher in france but this was her first time in england she didnt think she would stay at meadowbank for another term it is not nice to be in a school where murders take place she said did you know miss springer well inspector kelsey asked no said mademoiselle blanche she had bad manners and a loud voice and she was rude to me she did not like it when i went to the sports pavilion i was looking around and she told me that i should not be there she spoke to me as if i was a pupil not a teacher that must have been annoying said kelsey and then she shouts at me continued mademoiselle blanche i had picked up the key to the door and forgot to put it back did she think i was going to steal it she had the manners of a pig the other teachers at least they are polite after answering a few more questions mademoiselle blanche left the room so miss springer didnt like people visiting the sports pavilion said kelsey i wonder why was she hiding something there oh well lets see the rest of the staff miss blake was young and serious with a round goodnatured face she had nothing to say that could help she had seen very little of miss springer and had no idea of what could have led to her death all miss rowan said was that miss springer was very rude and had hinted that in other schools she had discovered peoples secrets next inspector kelsey saw ann shapland he approved of her neat and businesslike appearance well miss shapland he said can you tell me anything about miss springers death im afraid not said ann i have my own sitting room and i dont see much of the other staff and even now i still cant believe what happened why would anyone want to break into the sports pavilion and shoot miss springer why didnt they just run away thinking of what mademoiselle blanche had said kelsey asked ive been told that miss springer didnt like people visiting the sports pavilion did she say anything to you no said ann shapland but ive only been to the pavilion once or twice though i did hear that miss springer was quite rude to mademoiselle blanche about it do you know anything about miss springers private life no replied ann i dont think anyone did and is there anything else perhaps about the sports pavilion that you can tell me well ann hesitated i did see the new gardener coming out of there once he shouldnt have been in there he was supposed to be working she frowned and he was rude to me kelsey made a note of this after ann left then he questioned the school servants but learned nothing helpful before he was interrupted by miss bulstrode princess shaista one of our foreign pupils would like to speak to you inspector she said shes the niece of the emir ibrahim and thinks shes quite an important person a slim dark girl of medium height came in you are the police she asked yes thats right said kelsey smiling please tell me what you know about miss springer i will tell you said shaista there are people here watching this place she lowered her voice dramatically they want to kidnap me then they will ask my uncle for a lot of money a ransom before they let me go this was not what kelsey had expected er well perhaps he said doubtfully but even if this is true what has it got to do with the death of miss springer she must have found out about them said shaista she sounded as if she was enjoying herself perhaps she asked them for money to keep silent they meet at the sports pavilion but instead of giving her money they shoot her well er said inspector kelsey i dont know what to say he paused is this your own idea he asked or did miss springer say something about it the only thing miss springer ever said to me was run faster said shaista sulkily so its possible that youre imagining all this kelsey suggested gently shaista was very annoyed you do not understand my cousin was prince ali yusuf of ramat he was killed in the revolution i was going to marry him when i was older so i am an important person perhaps these people think i know where the jewels are what jewels said kelsey with surprise my cousin prince ali had many jewels worth much money shaista said calmly they disappeared in the revolution i was alis nearest relation and now he is dead the jewels belong to me inspector kelsey wasnt sure what to believe has anyone said anything to you about these jewels he asked no admitted shaista inspector kelsey made adecision i think he said pleasantly that youre talking nonsense shaista looked at him angrily i am just telling you what i know she said standing up and walking out of the door kidnapping and fabulous jewels said kelsey to himself what next chapter eleven conference when inspector kelsey returned to the police station adam goodman was waiting for him the young gardener looked sulky and rude but when he was alone with inspector kelsey his behaviour changed he was quiet and polite as he showed the inspector his identification so thats who you are said kelsey what are you doing working at a girls school adam explained that he was here to watch princess shaista and see if anyone contacted her kelsey listened with interest so the girl was telling the truth he said with surprise i didnt believe her but you say that there are jewels jewels worth a million pounds you must admit its hard to believe he paused so who do these jewels belong to the lawyers would argue about that for years said adam they may belong to prince ali yusufs family or he may have left them to someone else the truth is whoever finds the jewels will just keep them and there are a lot of people looking for them but why is meadowbank involved because of princess shaista thats right said adam princess shaista is ali yusufs cousin someone may try to contact her or give her the jewels we know theres a wellknown secret agent staying in a local hotel she just finds out useful information nothing against the law but weve been told that theres another woman in the area a woman who was a dancer in ramat when the revolution started she works for a foreign government but we dont know where she is or even what she looks like kelsey shook his head this all sounds unbelievable he said secret agents jewels murder they dont happen in real life i know what you mean said adam it doesnt seem possible but it is happening and its happening here there was a silence and then inspector kelsey asked what do you think happened last night i dont know adam said slowly why was miss springer in the sports pavilion at night did she go there to meet someone did she follow someone there or did she see a light and go and investigate everyone says that miss springer was very sure of herself said kelsey and that she was nosey i think that she either went to investigate or to meet someone from the school miss rich one of the teachers says that theres someone here who doesnt belong a cat among the pigeons a cat among the pigeons repeated adam thats a good description if there is a cat among the pigeons said kelsey its more likely to be one of the three new staff miss springer is dead so that leaves either miss shapland or mademoiselle blanche he looked towards adam any ideas i saw mademoiselle blanche coming out of the sports pavilion one day said adam she looked guilty but i think its more likely to be miss shapland shes cool and intelligent kelsey smiled ann shapland was suspicious of you he said she saw you coming out of the sports pavilion and said you were rude to her he paused we need to find out whats happening at meadowbank he said i think ill tell miss bulstrode who you are shes an impressive woman and she wont tell anyone adam nodded yes he said tell her who i am chapter twelve new lamps for old miss bulstrode listened carefully to inspector kelsey and adam as they explained the whole story very interesting she said calmly when they had finished and will you still be my gardener she asked adam if you dont mind he replied then i can keep an eye on things i hope youre not expecting another murder said miss bulstrode i dont think meadowbank could survive two murders in one term no no said inspector kelsey and we dont want any news about this in the papers well say that miss springer went to catch some burglars who then shot her by accident and have you finished with the sports pavilion miss bulstrode asked wed like to use it again if we can youll be able to use it again soon weve searched the place and found nothing he paused theres only one more thing i have to ask you has anything happened this term thats made you worried or uneasy miss bulstrode was silent for a moment i have had a feeling that something is wrong she said slowly but i dont know exactly what it is she paused i think that i missed something important on the first day of term she explained about mrs upjohn and the drunken lady veronica carlton adam was interested so mrs upjohn looked out of the front window and recognized someone he said then later she was talking about her work during the war and secret agents yes thats right said miss bulstrode we need to talk to mrs upjohn said kelsey as soon as possible i think shes travelling abroad at the moment said miss bulstrode let me ask her daughter julia she pressed the buzzer on her desk when there was no answer she stepped out of her room for a moment and asked a passing girl to get julia upjohn i should go before she gets here adam said im only the gardener he stood up and miss bulstrode he added will it be all right if i become very friendly with some of your staff mademoiselle blanche for example miss bulstrode looked unhappy but agreed i suppose you must do everything you can and if i meet some of the girls in the garden im only trying to get information adam said before he left they may know something soon julia upjohn knocked at the door come in julia said miss bulstrode i just wanted to ask for your mothers address i need to contact her but mothers gone to anatolia in turkey julia explained on a bus on a bus said miss bulstrode with surprise julia nodded mother likes travelling like that she said its uncomfortable but cheap shell probably arrive in the city of van in about three weeks i see said miss bulstrode tell me julia did your mother ever say that shed seen someone here at meadowbank who she knew during the war no miss bulstrode im sure she didnt well thank you julia thats all jennifer sutcliffe walked away from the tennis courts swinging her racquet she was annoyed that she had played badly she was very serious about tennis excuse me jennifer looked up surprised to see a welldressed blonde woman wearing a blue dress and a big hat standing on the path the woman was holding a long flat package it was as if she had just stepped out from behind the hedge but jennifer didnt think of that the woman spoke with an american accent i wonder if you can tell me where i can find a girl called she looked at a piece of paper jennifer sutcliffe im jennifer sutcliffe said jennifer with surprise well isnt that extraordinary the woman said youre just the girl i want to see let me explain i was at lunch yesterday with your aunt or was it your godmother im afraid i cant remember her name but anyway she knew i was coming to meadowbank and asked me to give you this new tennis racquet she said youd been asking for one jennifer was delighted it must have been my aunt aunt gina mrs campbell yes i remember now that was the name campbell the woman gave jennifer the package jennifer opened it quickly oh its wonderful she exclaimed as she saw the brand new tennis racquet thank you so much for bringing it it was no trouble the woman said and your aunt asked me to bring your old racquet back with me for restringing she picked up the racquet that jennifer had dropped i dont think its really worth restringing said jennifer but without paying much attention she was swinging her new racquet and wanted to try it but an extra racquet is always useful said the woman oh dear she said looking at her watch its much later than i thought i must go now it was nice to meet you she ran along the path towards the gate thank you very much jennifer called out after her before going inside to find julia look at my new tennis racquet she said to her friend aunt gina sent it to me she showed it to julia isnt it lovely julia admired the new racquet what have you done with the old one oh the woman took it she met aunt gina at lunch aunt gina wanted the old racquet so she can restring it julia frowned but your racquet didnt need restringing oh it did julia the strings were very loose but it was my racquet that needed restringing said julia you said your racquet the one i have now had already been restrung yes thats true said jennifer in surprise perhaps aunt gina just thought that if i wanted a new racquet it was because the old one needed restringing what does it matter i suppose it doesnt really matter said julia slowly but i do think its strange its like the story of aladdin you know like new lamps for old chapter thirteen catastrophe it was the third weekend of term there were only about twenty girls left behind at meadowbank because this weekend parents were allowed to come and take their daughters out for the day some of the staff were also away for the weekend miss bulstrode herself had decided to go and stay with the duchess of welsham at her house in the country on saturday morning before she left miss bulstrode was dictating some final letters to ann shapland when the phone rang ann answered its the emir ibrahims secretary she told miss bulstrode the emirs arrived in london and would like to take shaista out tomorrow miss bulstrode took the phone and spoke to the emirs secretary shaista would be ready at eleventhirty on sunday morning she said the girl must be back at the school by pm she put down the phone and thats the last letter she said to ann type them up and send them and then youre free for the weekend thank you miss bulstrode ann said enjoy yourself my dear i will said ann are you meeting a young man well yes anns face reddened a little but its not serious only an old friend miss chadwick hurried in and ann went back to her office the emir ibrahim shaistas uncle is taking her out tomorrow miss bulstrode told her friend he probably wont come himself but if he does tell him shaista is doing well shes not very clever said miss chadwick not in some ways said miss bulstrode but in other ways shes very grown up sometimes she sounds like a woman of twentyfive shes led such a varied life and visited so many different countries perhaps in this country we keep our children young for too long ill go and tell shaista about her uncle said miss chadwick go and enjoy your weekend and dont worry about anything oh i wont worry said miss bulstrode eleanor vansittart is in charge and with you here too chaddy nothing will go wrong by ten oclock on sunday morning only miss vansittart miss chadwick miss rowan and mademoiselle blanche were left at meadowbank miss bulstrode and ann shapland had left on saturday and miss johnson miss rich and miss blake had left earlier that morning at about halfpast eleven cars began to arrive at the school as parents came to take their daughters out for the day miss vansittart greeted the mothers with a smile and answered their questions about the recent tragedy it was terrible quite terrible she said but we dont talk about it too much we dont want the girls to worry julia upjohn and jennifer sutcliffe were looking out the window i wish someone was coming to take me out said julia as they watched people come and go mummy couldnt come today said jennifer daddys got some important visitors but shes taking me out next weekend you can come too if you like i told mummy id like to bring a friend id love to said julia she looked out the window again look at shaista she said shes all dressed up for london and look how high the heels of her shoes are a driver wearing a smart uniform was opening the door of a large luxury car shaista got in and the car drove away so what shall we do this afternoon asked jennifer i dont need to write a letter to mummy because ill see her next week and i cant really think of anything to say she got quite upset when i told her about the murder i can always think of lots to say said julia but i dont have anyone to write to what about your mother i told you shes gone to anatolia on a bus shes left me a list of places to write to but she wont get my letters for a while she paused i wonder why miss bulstrode wanted to contact her perhaps its about miss springer i think there are a lot of things they havent told us about miss springer julia added thoughtfully there are definitely strange things happening here like your new tennis racquet oh i meant to tell you said jennifer i wrote and thanked aunt gina and this morning i got a letter from her saying she was glad id got a new racquet but that she never sent it to me i told you it was strange said julia and your house was burgled too wasnt it yes but they didnt take anything that just makes it even more interesting said julia i think she added thoughtfully that well probably have a second murder soon oh julia why should we have a second murder said jennifer well theres usually a second murder in books said julia you must be careful jennifer that youre not murdered next me said jennifer surprised why should anyone murder me because you seem to be involved in whatevers happening julia said we must ask your mother some questions next week perhaps she was given something in ramat wheres shaista miss rowan asked miss vansittart and miss chadwick i cant find her anywhere the emirs car has just arrived to take her to london what miss chadwick looked up surprised but the emirs car collected shaista at eleventhirty i saw her leave myself eleanor vansittart went out to speak to the driver there must be a mistake she said the young lady has already left for london perhaps the car was ordered twice the driver didnt seem very surprised it does happen he admitted sometimes two different people ring up and both book a car by mistake miss vansittart looked a little doubtful as she watched him drive away but she decided there was nothing to worry about the afternoon was peaceful and the girls who were left went swimming and played tennis miss vansittart sat outside under a tree and wrote some letters at halfpast four the telephone rang and miss chadwick answered this is the emirs secretary speaking from london a mans voice said oh yes said miss chadwick is it about shaista yes said the secretary the emir is annoyed he was not told that shaista was not coming today wasnt coming said miss chadwick what do you mean hasnt shaista arrived no she hasnt but a car collected her this morning at eleventhirty thats very strange said the secretary ill ring up the car company at once and see whats happened oh dear said miss chadwick i do hope there hasnt been an accident oh dont worry said the secretary cheerfully wed know by now i suppose he hesitated yes said miss chadwick well i was going to ask if shaista had gone to meet a boyfriend certainly not said miss chadwick its quite impossible but as she put the phone down she wondered was it impossible you never really knew what girls would do she went to find miss vansittart and told her what had happened do you think we should call the police miss chadwick asked shaista did say that someone might try to kidnap her kidnap her nonsense said miss vansittart sharply miss bulstrode left me in charge and i certainly wont call the police miss chadwick looked at her slowly she thought miss vansittart was being very stupid she went to the phone and tried to call miss bulstrode at the duchess of welshams country house unfortunately everyone was out chapter fourteen miss chadwick lies awake shaista had not returned by eight oclock and there was no news of her miss chadwick had rung inspector kelsey who said he would deal with it he didnt sound worried but miss chadwick was worried that night she lay in bed unable to sleep she kept thinking about kidnapping and murder it was terrible that such things could happen at her beloved meadowbank she loved the school dearly she didnt want miss bulstrode to retire when everything was going so well though after the murder perhaps parents would take their children away with a sigh miss chadwick sat up switched on the light and looked at her watch it was just after a quarter to one just about the time that poor miss springer no she wouldnt think about that she got out of bed and went to get a drink of water on her way back to bed she lifted the curtain and looked out of the window there was a light in the sports pavilion miss chadwick quickly got dressed and picked up a torch she rushed down the stairs and out towards the sports pavilion she didnt stop to wake anyone else all she wanted to do was find out who was there she did however stop to pick up a weapon she walked quietly to the open door of the sports pavilion pushed it fully open and looked in at the same time as miss chadwick got out of bed ann shapland looking very attractive in a black evening dress was sitting at a table in a fashionable london restaurant she smiled at the young man sitting opposite her dear dennis she thought hes always the same hows your new job dennis asked im rather enjoying it actually said ann i didnt think youd like working in a school dennis said id hate to be a teacher ann said but i like being a secretary at meadowbank miss bulstrode is a very impressive woman i dont dare make any mistakes i wish youd stop working ann and marry me instead im not ready to do that yet ann replied and of course i have to think about my mother sometimes when she gets really bad i have to leave my job and go and look after her i think its wonderful said dennis that you take such good care of your mother of course ive never met her but wouldnt she be better living in an old peoples home no said ann firmly mothers happy most of the time but sometimes she forgets who she is and where she is she has a nice woman who looks after her and when mother gets too difficult i go and help but dont you mind giving up your jobs no not really replied ann i like doing different things and i dont like to stay in one job for too long im sure you wont stay too long at meadowbank said dennis youll get tired of all those women theres a very good looking gardener said ann she laughed when she saw denniss expression dont worry im only trying to make you jealous tell me about the murder dennis said it was the games teacher wasnt it yes ann became serious it was all very strange she said thoughtfully ive been thinking about it and i do know one piece of information thats rather interesting ann oh dont worry ann said it doesnt seem to fit in with anything properly perhaps therell be a second murder she added cheerfully that might help me understand better at exactly that moment back at meadowbank miss chadwick pushed open the door of the sports pavilion chapter fifteen murder repeats itself come along said inspector kelsey entering the room with a grim face theres been another murder he and adam goodman had been having a drink and talking about the case when the telephone rang who is it asked adam as he followed inspector kelsey down the stairs another teacher miss vansittart in the sports pavilion the sports pavilion again said adam why is that place so important it was like a bad dream repeating itself thought kelsey as he entered the sports pavilion and saw the doctor kneeling next to a dead body she was killed about half an hour ago the doctor told him who found her said kelsey miss chadwick sir said his sergeant she saw a light came out to investigate and found her dead shes very upset it was the matron miss johnson who rang us and how was miss vansittart killed kelsey asked the doctor was she shot too the doctor shook his head no she was hit on the back of the head she was probably kneeling down and someone hit her with something heavy no that wasnt the weapon he added as inspector kelsey looked at a golf club lying near the door she was hit with something like a sandbag so she was kneeling in front of this locker said kelsey he looked at it closely this is princess shaistas locker the girl whos missing do we know anything about her yet no sir said his sergeant the car hasnt been found but the police in london have been told why has this girl been kidnapped asked the doctor i dont know said kelsey gloomily when she told me she was afraid of being kidnapped i didnt believe her he looked around well he said carry on with the photographs and the fingerprints im going to the house he was met by miss johnson the matron who was upset but in control of herself this is terrible inspector she said two of our teachers killed poor miss chadwick is very upset the doctor gave her something to calm her down before i talk to her can you tell me the last time you saw miss vansittart i havent seen her at all today said miss johnson ive been away all day i arrived back at eleven and went straight up to my room did you look out of your window towards the sports pavilion kelsey asked no im afraid not said miss johnson i had a bath and went to bed i was asleep when miss chadwick came in she looked as white as a ghost and was shaking all over was miss vansittart here all day today yes i think so miss bulstrode is away and left her in charge and who else was here miss johnson thought for a moment miss vansittart miss chadwick mademoiselle blanche and miss rowan i see said inspector kelsey well id like to talk to miss chadwick now miss chadwick was sitting in a chair with her legs covered up to keep her warm she looked shocked white and ill is she really dead is there any chance that that she might recover kelsey shook his head slowly its so awful said miss chadwick she burst into tears this will ruin the school she said this will ruin meadowbank i cant bear it i cant bear it i know this has been a terrible shock for you miss chadwick said kelsey but i want you to be brave and tell me what happened i i went to bed early but i couldnt sleep i was worried about shaista shes still missing eventually it was about quarter to one i got up for a glass of water and looked out of the window and i saw a light moving like a torch in the sports pavilion yes and then and then said miss chadwick i was determined to see who was there and what they were doing so i got dressed and hurried out before they could get away the door wasnt shut and i pushed it open and there she was dead she began to shake all over yes yes miss chadwick its all right said kelsey just one more question did you take a golf club with you or did miss vansittart take it a golf club said miss chadwick vaguely i cant remember oh yes i think i picked it up in the hall i took it out with me as a weapon i must have dropped it when i saw eleanor i somehow got back to the house and woke miss johnson oh i cant bear it i cant bear it this will be the end of meadowbank inspector kelsey left miss chadwick to the care of miss johnson as he went downstairs he noticed a pile of sandbags by the side door and thought that one of them could easily have been used to kill miss vansittart perhaps someone in the house had picked up the sandbag murdered miss vansittart and put it back afterwards chapter sixteen the riddle of the sports pavilion miss bulstrode sat calmly at her desk as the telephone rang over and over again each time it was a parent ringing to say they were taking their daughter away from meadowbank finally miss bulstrode made her decision she told ann shapland that meadowbank was closing until the end of term any girls were welcome to stay if it wasnt possible for them to go home start ringing up all the parents she said to ann and send them a letter yes miss bulstrode ann shapland paused before she went out excuse me she said i know its none of my business but are you sure youre doing the right thing i am said miss bulstrode firmly if i tell parents to take their children away many of them will want the girls to stay its human nature i just hope they send them back next term if there is a next term she looked up as inspector kelsey came in thats your job she said to him if you catch the murderer then the school will survive inspector kelsey looked unhappy were doing our best he said ann shapland went out to start typing do you have any idea who killed my two teachers asked miss bulstrode and shaista is still missing is there any news not about the murders said kelsey but i do have news about shaista the emir received a ransom note this morning to get shaista back safely he must leave twenty thousand pounds at the side of a local road by two oclock tomorrow morning he shook his head it doesnt sound very professional he stood up what about my teachers asked miss bulstrode is there anyone i can trust we have checked them all said the inspector especially the new staff mademoiselle blanche miss springer and your secretary miss shapland miss shaplands previous employers have confirmed that she definitely worked for them and she has an alibi for last night when miss vansittart was killed miss shapland was having dinner at a london restaurant with a man called dennis rathbone the staff at the restaurant know them both weve also checked mademoiselle blanche shes worked in schools in france and is said to be a very good teacher shes not good enough for meadowbank said miss bulstrode she could have done both murders continued kelsey but we have no evidence that she did she says she was in bed he paused the problem is its hard to believe that the killer is one of your staff miss johnson was with her sister last night and has worked here seven years miss chadwick helped you start the school both of them anyway are clear of miss springers death miss rich has been here over a year and last night was staying at a hotel twenty miles away miss blake was with friends and miss rowan has been with you for a year and has a good background miss bulstrode nodded i quite agree with you she said so she paused and looked at adam it must be you adams mouth opened in astonishment you have a good reason for being here said miss bulstrode thoughtfully and you could be working for someone else miss bulstrode said adam with admiration you think of everything my goodness exclaimed mrs sutcliffe at the breakfast table henry she was looking at the newspaper whats the matter joan theres been another murder at meadowbank at jennifers school what let me see mr sutcliffe took the paper from his wifes hands miss eleanor vansittart sports pavilion same place where miss springer the games teacher hmm i cant believe it said mrs sutcliffe meadowbank is such a good school you must go there immediately and take jennifer away said her husband firmly do you think thats the right thing to do yes i do said mr sutcliffe go and take jennifer away from that school you wont be the only one adam was alone in the sports pavilion looking carefully in all the lockers in case the police had missed something suddenly he heard footsteps and he quickly stepped away from the lockers and lit a cigarette julia upjohn appeared in the doorway she hesitated i just wanted to get my tennis racquet she said im sure thats all right miss said adam the police sergeant left me here to keep an eye on things he lied while he went back to the police station in case the murderer comes back asked julia i heard that murderers always return to the scene of the crime i dont know said adam he looked at the rows of tennis racquets which ones yours its at the end said julia we have our names on them she explained pointing to the name labels adam handed julia her racquet can i have jennifer sutcliffes racquet too asked julia this looks new said adam as he handed it to her yes said julia her aunt sent it to her the other day jennifers very good at tennis she looked round do you think he will come back the murderer i dont think so said adam it would be a big risk perhaps he left something behind a clue said julia that would be interesting she walked out holding the two racquets julia look said jennifer as they were playing tennis theres mummy the two girls turned to stare at mrs sutcliffe who was walking quickly towards them guided by miss rich more fuss i suppose said jennifer gloomily you must pack your things at once jennifer said her mother im taking you home but do you mean forever yes i do but you cant said jennifer my tennis is really improving and i like it here dont argue with me jennifer said mrs sutcliffe just do as youre told but mummy mother and daughter went towards the house still arguing suddenly jennifer ran back to the tennis court goodbye julia mummy seems to be quite upset about these murders im afraid i have to go ill write to you ill write to you too and tell you what happens i hope they dont kill chaddy next id prefer it to be mademoiselle blanche wouldnt you yes i wouldnt miss her very much said julia did you see how angry miss rich looked she hasnt said anything said jennifer but shes angry with mummy for taking me away miss rich is strange isnt she ive never met anyone like her before she reminds me of someone said jennifer i dont think shes like anybody else she always seems to be quite unique oh yes she is unique i mean to look at but the person i saw was quite fat jennifer called mrs sutcliffe parents can be very annoying said jennifer fuss fuss fuss she said goodbye to julia and left with her mother julia walked slowly towards the sports pavilion lost in thought as the school bell rang for lunch suddenly she stopped and frowned staring down at the tennis racquet she was holding and then walked back to the house running upstairs to her small bedroom she looked around quickly lifted up the mattress on her bed and put the racquet underneath it then she went downstairs for lunch chapter seventeen aladdins cave it was quiet at meadowbank that night lots of girls had been taken home but those who were left were quieter and more thoughtful than usual as they went upstairs to bed julia went into her bedroom and closed the door she listened as the voices footsteps and laughter gradually stopped and all was silent there was no lock on her door so julia put a chair underneath the door handle so she would hear if anyone tried to come in but the girls werent allowed in each others rooms and miss johnson the matron only came in if someone was ill julia lifted her mattress and took out the tennis racquet she decided to examine it now while the lights were still on rather than later when a light under her door would be noticed there must be something hidden in the handle thought julia jennifers house was burgled and then there was the silly story about the new racquet only jennifer would believe that but jennifer and julia had never told anyone that they had swapped racquets so this was the racquet that everyone was looking for in the sports pavilion she looked at it carefully there was nothing unusual about it she used a small knife to remove the leather covering from the handle and took off the end there was some plasticine there which she took out carefully and several other things came out with it julia gasped and stared at the beautiful coloured red green and blue jewels and the dazzling white diamonds she looked in wonder as she picked up the stones and let them fall through her fingers and then suddenly she heard a slight noise outside her door julia sat there thinking trying to decide what to do she quickly picked up the jewels and put them in her wash bag covering them with her sponge and soap then she repaired the tennis racquet so that it looked just the same as it did before she threw it casually down on her chair and sat on her bed listening suddenly julia was afraid two people had been killed if anyone knew what she had found she would be killed too she managed to move a heavy desk in front of the door and then she locked the window at half past ten julia turned off her light just as usual if anyone tries to come in she thought ill knock on the wall and scream as loud as i can she sat on her bed fully dressed for a long time and at last she heard a soft footstep outside her door as julia watched the door handle slowly turned but the door wouldnt open because of the desk in front there was a pause and then a quiet knock on the door julia held her breath the knock came again still quiet for a long time julia sat there nervous and wide awake but no one knocked again she finally fell asleep and was woken early in the morning by the school bell after breakfast when the girls went to different classrooms for their lessons julia managed to reach the wall surrounding the school without being seen she climbed a large tree sat on top of the wall and then dropped down the other side she knew that a bus was coming soon and when it arrived she got on and went to the train station there she got on the train to london because so many girls had gone home and two teachers were dead julia thought it would be a while before anyone noticed she was gone but just in case they were worried she left a note in her bedroom for miss bulstrode saying that she hadnt been kidnapped hercule poirot was sitting in a room of his very modern flat when his personal servant georges came to tell him he had a visitor its a young lady a schoolgirl who wants to see you urgently sir said georges about some murders and a robbery poirot raised his eyebrows in surprise some murders and a robbery that is interesting show the young lady in julia came into the room and said politely how do you do monsieur poirot my name is julia upjohn a friend of my mothers has talked about you and said how clever you are so when i couldnt decide what to do i thought of you i am honoured said poirot seriously he brought julia a chair and she sat down now tell me he said about this robbery and these murders miss springer and miss vansittart have been murdered explained julia and theres the kidnapping too but i dont think thats really my business you confuse me said poirot where have all these things occurred at my school meadowbank ah poirot exclaimed at meadowbank he picked up that days newspaper and looked at the front page i begin to understand he said now tell me everything mademoiselle julia from the beginning julia told him it was a long story but she told it very clearly at the end she described how she had looked inside the handle of the tennis racquet and what was inside poirot asked julia lifted up her skirt and quickly pulled off several pieces of sticky tape that held a small plastic wash bag to her leg she opened the wash bag and suddenly poured the sparkling stones on to the table my goodness exclaimed poirot in great surprise he picked up the jewels letting them fall through his fingers but they are real genuine julia nodded i think they are thats why people have been killed she looked again at the jewels but monsieur poirot who do they belong to it is very difficult to know but they do not belong to either you or to me we must now decide what to do next hercule poirot closed his eyes in thought after a while he sat up it seems that in this case i cannot remain in my chair there must be order and method but in what you tell me there is no order and method that is because we have here many different things that have been happening but they all meet at meadowbank so i too go to meadowbank and as for you mademoiselle julia where is your mother mummys gone on a bus to anatolia i see said poirot so instead we must tell your good head teacher that you are safe and that i will bring you back to meadowbank miss bulstrode knows im all right i left a note saying i hadnt been kidnapped she will like to know for sure said poirot picking up the phone soon he was talking to miss bulstrode ah miss bulstrode my name is hercule poirot i have with me here your pupil julia upjohn i am bringing her back in my car immediately and will tell the local police that a certain valuable package is now safely in the bank when he put down the phone julia said but the jewels arent in the bank they will be in a very short time said poirot but if anyone at meadowbank was listening or knows about the jewels they now know that you do not have them any more i said that to keep you safe my child i will admit that i have formed a high opinion of your courage and your intelligence julia looked pleased but embarrassed chapter eighteen consultation miss bulstrode had heard of hercule poirot and greeted him warmly it was kind of you monsieur poirot to ring about julia she said especially since with all the confusion here we hadnt noticed she had gone perhaps it would have been better julia to tell me what you were planning to do i didnt want to said julia in case someone heard me im not annoyed said miss bulstrode but i would like to know exactly whats going on you permit said hercule poirot he walked to the door opened it and looked out before shutting it very obviously he returned smiling widely we are alone he said mysteriously we can begin miss bulstrode looked at the door and her eyebrows rose in surprise she looked at poirot and then slowly nodded her head now then julia she said tell me whats happened julia told her story again when she finished hercule poirot said what mademoiselle julia found is now safely in the bank it is hoped that no more unpleasant events will occur at meadowbank he looked again towards the door i think i understand said miss bulstrode but it is important mademoiselle julia that you do not say anything about what you found even to your friends added poirot can you do that yes said julia i wont tell anyone miss bulstrode smiled i hope your mother will be home soon she said inspector kelsey tells me that they are trying hard to contact her but buses in anatolia are often delayed i can tell mummy cant i said julia of course well thank you julia miss bulstrode said youd better go to your class now julia left closing the door behind her miss bulstrode looked at poirot i think i understand she said again you only pretended to shut the door in fact you left it slightly open poirot nodded yes he said if there was anyone who wanted to overhear they now know that what mademoiselle julia found is in the bank she should now be safe here hercule poirot was in a meeting with inspector kelsey and adam goodman now the jewels have been found kelsey was saying this is a very sensitive situation some very important people dont want any stories about the jewels in the newspapers officially its best that we know nothing about them yes agreed hercule poirot slowly it is best to say nothing about the jewels it is possible after all that they may still be hidden somewhere in ramat inspector kelsey sighed with relief thank you monsieur poirot unofficially these important people would like to leave the jewels with you i do not object said poirot let us leave it at that we have more serious things to think about have we not the jewels are valuable but i say that human life is worth more youre right monsieur poirot said inspector kelsey we must catch this murderer wed be very interested to know what you think then tell me if you please said poirot all that is known so far he settled down to listen when inspector kelsey and adam goodman had told him everything hercule poirot closed his eyes and slowly nodded his head let us start with the kidnapping of princess shaista he said from what you have said inspector it does not make much sense thats what i thought said kelsey slowly and though there have been ransom demands they arent genuine no one has collected the ransom money so princess shaista was not kidnapped for ransom money and it is clear that she did not know where the jewels were hidden so there must be some other reason he sat in silence frowning for a moment or two then he sat up and asked a question her knees he said did you ever notice princess shaistas knees adam stared at him in astonishment no he said why should i the girls wear skirts most of the time which cover their knees in the swimming pool perhaps suggested poirot hopefully i never saw shaista go swimming said adam i expect it was too cold for her so what do you mean does she have a scar or something like that no no that is not it at all ah well instead i will contact my old friend the chief of police in switzerland he may be able to help us shaista was at school in switzerland said kelsey did anything happen there it is possible yes said poirot he paused but now we pass from kidnapping to something more serious murder chapter nineteen consultation continued two murders at meadowbank said poirot thoughtfully in the sports pavilion now we know why because in the sports pavilion there was a tennis racquet containing a fortune in jewels someone knew about that racquet who was it was it miss springer herself she did not like people going to the sports pavilion she was angry with mademoiselle blanche poirot turned to adam and you say that mademoiselle blanche behaved strangely when she came out of the sports pavilion yes said adam she didnt need to explain to me why she was there but she told me anyway poirot nodded thoughtfully and miss springer why was she in the sports pavilion so late at night he turned to kelsey where was miss springer before she came to meadowbank we dont know said the inspector she left her previous job last summer and we dont know where shes been since then she has no close relatives or friends we can talk to so she could have been in ramat said poirot thoughtfully i believe there were some schoolteachers in ramat when the revolution started said adam let us say then suggested poirot that miss springer was in ramat and somehow learned that the jewels were in the tennis racquet she waits until she knows the routine at meadowbank and then one night she goes to the sports pavilion to remove the jewels he paused someone else had been watching her followed her and shot her but they had no time to get the jewels or take the tennis racquet because the shot was heard and people were quickly approaching the sports pavilion do you think thats what happened asked inspector kelsey i do not know said poirot it is one possibility the other is that the person with the gun was already there and was surprised by miss springer miss springer was a nosey woman perhaps she was suspicious of someone and who was the other person asked adam i do not know poirot said again you say you have checked most carefully everyone staying nearby so it must be someone at meadowbank kelsey sighed yes he agreed almost anyone could have killed miss springer except miss johnson and miss chadwick but the second murder narrows things down miss rich miss blake and miss shapland have good alibis and miss bulstrode poirot asked adam smiled she was staying with the duchess of welsham said kelsey so she too has an alibi that leaves us with miss rowan and mademoiselle blanche miss rowan has been here over a year and we have no reason to suspect her so we come back to mademoiselle blanche said poirot there was a silence theres no evidence against her said kelsey her references seem genuine they would have to be said poirot wait a minute said kelsey i remember that mademoiselle blanche said something about a key she picked up the key to the sports pavilion and forgot to put it back miss springer shouted at her to visit the sports pavilion at night you would need a key said poirot for that it would have been necessary to make a copy of the key but why then would she tell you about the key asked adam in case miss springer had talked about it said kelsey but that doesnt help us much he looked gloomily at poirot but we must not forget said poirot that julia upjohns mother recognized someone here at meadowbank a possible secret agent yes but we cant find mrs upjohn said inspector kelsey shes not on a proper tour shes travelling on local buses she could be anywhere anatolia is a big place so until we find her we cant do anything and mademoiselle blanche might walk out of meadowbank at any time poirot shook his head she will not do that he said if you have committed murder you do not draw attention to yourself i hope youre right kelsey said i am sure i am right said poirot and remember the person whom mrs upjohn saw does not know that mrs upjohn saw her the surprise when it comes will be complete it still doesnt help us much kelsey sighed there are other things poirot added conversation for example sooner or later a person with something to hide says too much innocent people also know things without knowing they are important and that reminds me poirot stood up excuse me he said i must go and find someone who can draw well said adam after poirot went out first girls knees and now drawing i hope he knows what hes doing miss rich could draw well and she sat down next to poirot with a pencil and paper please can you draw for me miss springer poirot asked thats difficult said miss rich i didnt know her for very long but ill try she frowned for a moment and then began to draw quickly bien said poirot taking the drawing good and now if you please can you draw miss bulstrode miss rowan mademoiselle blanche and the gardener adam eileen rich looked at him doubtfully but then began to draw poirot nodded you are good he said you can draw a good likeness with a few lines of the pencil now can you change miss bulstrodes hair and the shape of her eyebrows eileen stared at him for a while and then did as he asked excellent said poirot now do the same for mademoiselle blanche and miss rowan when she had finished he put the three drawings together now i will show you something he said miss bulstrode even with the changes you have made still looks like miss bulstrode but the other two because they do not have miss bulstrodes strong personality they appear almost different people do they not i see what you mean said eileen rich she watched poirot put away the drawings carefully what are you going to do with them use them said poirot chapter twenty conversation well said mrs sutcliffe doubtfully i dont really know what to say she looked at hercule poirot its been very upsetting she continued and im glad to have jennifer safely at home with me two murders and a girl kidnapped i would not worry too much about the kidnapping madame said poirot if i may tell you a secret i suspect a romance do you mean the girl just ran away to marry somebody i can say no more said hercule poirot and i am sure that you too will say nothing of this of course not said mrs sutcliffe very pleased she looked down at the letter that poirot had brought from inspector kelsey so monsieur er poirot you want to talk to jennifer im afraid shes not a girl who notices things she called her daughter into the room how do you do said poirot i am a friend of julia upjohn she came to london to see me and ask my advice she is now back at meadowbank poirot added jennifer looked at her mother annoyed so she hasnt been taken away mrs sutcliffe decided to leave the room rather than argue again with her daughter all this fuss said jennifer i told mummy it was silly no pupils have been killed i wish i was back there i have come to ask mademoiselle jennifer said poirot about the woman who came and gave you the new tennis racquet what did she look like i dont really know said jennifer i didnt look at her much she had blonde hair and was wearing a blue dress and a big hat i think she was american had you ever seen her before asked poirot oh no said jennifer are you sure said poirot she was not perhaps one of the girls dressed up or one of the teachers jennifer looked puzzled dressed up poirot showed her the picture of mademoiselle blanche that eileen rich had drawn was this the woman its a bit like her said jennifer but i dont think so i didnt really look at her face she obviously didnt realize that the drawing was of mademoiselle blanche i was looking at my new racquet i see said poirot after a pause he asked did you ever see anyone at meadowbank who youd seen in ramat in ramat jennifer thought oh no at least i dont think so but you are not sure mademoiselle jennifer well jennifer looked worried i often see people who look like other people she explained perhaps you recognized princess shaista suggested poirot you may have seen her in ramat i dont think so said jennifer frowning of course i think most people do look alike i only notice if someone has a strange sort of face like miss rich have you seen miss rich somewhere before poirot asked no said jennifer i think i saw someone who just looked like miss rich this person was much fatter than she is someone much fatter said poirot thoughtfully and miss rich was away ill last term added jennifer so she couldnt have been in ramat and the other girls asked poirot had you seen any of the girls before only the ones i knew already said jennifer but i dont really notice people very much chapter twenty one gathering threads i want to talk to you eileen said miss bulstrode eileen rich followed miss bulstrode into the sitting room meadowbank was strangely quiet there werent many pupils left and the teachers didnt have much to do miss johnson didnt like having so much free time miss chadwick wandered round looking very unhappy while ann shapland did a lot of gardening working closely with adam i want to talk to you about meadowbank said miss bulstrode the school may be ruined perhaps no one will come back no interrupted eileen rich you mustnt let that happen it would be wrong she almost shouted with passion meadowbank is a great school and it must be saved i promise that ill do all i can said miss bulstrode but what i want to say is this if meadowbank survives i want you to be the next head teacher me eileen rich stared at her me yes my dear said miss bulstrode you i cant said eileen rich im too young i dont have enough experience you are the person i want to run this school when i retire said miss bulstrode firmly but i thought we all thought that miss vansittart i did consider her very carefully for a long time admitted miss bulstrode im sure everyone else thought miss vansittart would be the next head teacher but i never said anything definite to her and finally i decided she was not the person i wanted i want someone with new ideas who will think about the future thats why i want you it would have been wonderful said eileen rich wonderful but i really dont think i can now perhaps i can think about it miss bulstrode i dont really know what to say miss richs hair is always so untidy remarked ann shapland looking up from her gardening as the teacher walked by why doesnt she cut it all off you should suggest it to her said adam i dont know her that well said ann shapland she paused do you think that meadowbank will be able to continue i dont know said adam will you come back next term if it does no said ann firmly ive had enough of schools and working with women and i dont like murder i think ill marry dennis and settle down dennis said adam you told me about him i think you can do better are you making me an offer said ann certainly not said adam and you wouldnt like to marry a gardener i was wondering about marrying a secret agent said ann im not a secret agent said adam no no of course not said ann youre not a secret agent shaista wasnt kidnapped everythings fine ive heard that shaista has been found in switzerland she added how did she get there ive no idea said adam it was monsieur hercule poirot who found her is he the funny little man who brought julia upjohn back from london asked ann yes thats him said adam he went to see my mother he added and jennifer sutcliffes mother he seems to be fascinated with peoples mothers did he go and see miss richs mother and chaddys said ann poor miss chadwick look here she comes now she watched miss chadwicks approach she looks much older since miss vansittarts death she really loves meadowbank ill go and talk to her ann went to meet miss chadwick and together they walked back to the house its so quiet here now said ann looking round its awful said miss chadwick awful i cant get over it i cant sleep at night meadowbank is ruined after all those years of work it may be all right said ann people will soon forget about the murders but not quickly enough said miss chadwick grimly not quickly enough mademoiselle blanche came out of the classroom at the end of her french lesson she looked at her watch yes she did have enough time she went upstairs to her room and got ready to go out as she looked at herself in the mirror she smiled sometimes it was good to be a person who no one noticed it made it easy for her to use her sister angeles references and even her passport angele was dead but she had enjoyed teaching and was very good at it she herself found it very boring but she wasnt going to be a teacher for much longer she was going to have money mademoiselle blanche picked up her handbag and went out of the house through the front gate to the bus stop when the bus arrived she got on and a quarter of an hour later she got out in the nearest big town she went to a large department store and began to look at dresses after a while she went upstairs to the ladies rest room and found a telephone no one was near enough to overhear her she called a number and waited to hear if the right voice answered it did you know who i am she said yes i am speaking of some money that you owe you have until tomorrow evening to pay this money into this bank account she gave the details if not i will tell the police what i saw on the night that miss springer died she put down the phone after doing a little shopping mademoiselle blanche took the bus back to meadowbank she smiled to herself she had asked for money but not too much the money would last for a while and then she would ask for more life was going to be very pleasant in the future back at meadowbank mademoiselle blanche walked past the swimming pool and watched eileen rich and ann shapland swimming and diving with the girls in the pool she was in time for her afternoon classes during her lesson the girls talked and didnt listen to her but she hardly noticed she wasnt going to be a teacher for much longer when the bell rang mademoiselle blanche went upstairs to her room to tidy her hair before dinner but as she looked in the mirror she saw a sudden movement behind her so quick that she was completely surprised as mademoiselle blanche opened her mouth to scream a sandbag hit her silently on the back of her neck chapter twenty two incident in anatolia mrs upjohn was sitting by the side of a road somewhere in anatolia she and a large turkish woman were talking partly in french and partly by using their hands the other passengers were sitting nearby watching the bus driver trying to start the brokendown bus mrs upjohns journey had also been delayed by heavy rain and blocked roads mrs upjohn said a very british voice which didnt sound as if it belonged in anatolia mrs upjohn looked up she hadnt noticed that a car had arrived and an obviously british man had got out mrs upjohn the man said again my names derek oconnor from the british government weve been trying to contact you for days contact me why is it julia mrs upjohn said sharply has something happened to julia no no said oconnor julia is all right no theres been some trouble at meadowbank and we want to take you there as soon as possible ill drive you back to the nearest airport and you can get on a plane in a few hours mrs upjohn opened her mouth and then shut it again she stood up collected her luggage and said goodbye to the turkish woman she followed oconnor to his car without asking any questions oconnor thought that mrs upjohn was a very sensible woman chapter twenty three showdown miss bulstrode looked around at her staff who were all sitting together in one of the school classrooms miss chadwick was there and miss johnson miss rich miss rowan and miss blake ann shapland sat with her notebook and pencil ready to take notes hercule poirot and detective inspector kelsey sat beside miss bulstrode while adam goodman sat slightly behind them miss bulstrode stood up as you all work here she said i thought youd like to know exactly what is known about the recent unfortunate events at meadowbank detective inspector kelsey is not allowed to give us any official police information but monsieur hercule poirot the wellknown detective will now tell you what he has discovered hercule poirot rose to his feet smiled widely at his audience and carefully smoothed his moustache i know that this has been a difficult time for you all he began you have lost three of your colleagues miss springer miss vansittart and mademoiselle blanche this is because meadowbank has become the centre of certain events and also because there is someone here who does not belong he looked around the room there is a cat among the pigeons but before i talk about the murders i will deal first with the kidnapping he took a photograph from his pocket and passed it round so all the people in the room saw it do you recognize the girl in this photograph poirot asked everyone shook their heads ah but you should said poirot since this is a photograph from switzerland of princess shaista but thats not shaista said miss chadwick exactly said poirot this story starts in ramat where three months ago there was a revolution the ruler prince ali yusuf died trying to escape but some very valuable jewels that he owned were not found in the wreckage of his plane several groups of people wanted to find them they thought that the jewels might be brought to princess shaista the princes cousin and only close relative it was known that princess shaista was coming to school at meadowbank however the girls uncle the emir ibrahim was abroad and miss bulstrode did not know shaista personally shaista was indeed kidnapped but not from meadowbank she was in fact kidnapped before she even arrived here it was a simple plan explained poirot the real shaista is in fact still in switzerland and has now been found instead it was a secret agent hoping to hear news of the jewels who arrived in london and was brought to meadowbank but the false shaista a young french actress was obviously older than the real shaista i did ask said hercule poirot thoughtfully if anyone had noticed shaistas knees the knees of a woman of twentyfour can never really be mistaken for the knees of a girl of fifteen nobody alas had noticed her knees but nobody tried to contact the false shaista about the jewels and when miss springer was murdered it was feared that shaistas uncle the emir ibrahim would come to england the false shaista began to talk about kidnapping and when the emir did arrive she was indeed kidnapped in fact the car that came early to collect her left her in the nearest town and she simply went back to using her own identity a false ransom note was sent to make the kidnapping story appear real it does not occur to anyone that the kidnapping really occurred earlier in switzerland poirot meant of course that it had not occurred to anyone but himself we pass now he continued to something far more serious murder the false shaista was at meadowbank just to hear about the jewels she had no motive for murder and although she could have killed miss springer she could not have killed miss vansittart or mademoiselle blanche let us go back now to ramat where all this started prince ali yusuf gave the jewels to his pilot bob rawlinson bob rawlinson visited his sister mrs sutcliffe in her hotel in ramat and stayed in her room for twenty minutes even though she was not there several different groups of people guessed that bob rawlinson had hidden the jewels somewhere in his sisters luggage one group of people did not know where and searched mrs sutcliffes luggage and burgled her house but someone else definitely knew where the jewels were hidden in the handle of the tennis racquet belonging to mrs sutcliffes daughter jennifer this person went out to the sports pavilion one night having previously made a copy of the key to look at the tennis racquets but miss springer saw a light in the sports pavilion and went out to investigate discovered and recognized by miss springer the killer did not hesitate miss springer was shot dead but the shot had been heard and the crime was discovered almost immediately the murderer had to escape quickly leaving the tennis racquet behind a few days later a strange woman with an american accent spoke to jennifer sutcliffe and gave her a new tennis racquet taking the old one away but the woman did not know that jennifer sutcliffe and julia upjohn had swapped racquets so the racquet that she took away was really julia upjohns old racquet we come now to the second murder continued poirot miss vansittart was looking at shaistas locker probably looking for a clue to the girls disappearance someone followed her and killed her with a sandbag again the crime was discovered almost immediately by miss chadwick the police again took charge of the sports pavilion and again the killer had no opportunity to look at the tennis racquets but by now julia upjohn an intelligent child had realized that her racquet which had belonged to jennifer was important she looked inside the handle and found the jewels these she brought to me and they are now safely in the bank poirot paused as to the third murder mademoiselle blanche knew we do not know how who the murderer was she did not tell the police but instead she asked the murderer for money to keep silent blackmail but there is nothing more dangerous than blackmailing a person who has killed perhaps twice already and mademoiselle blanche too was killed hercule poirot paused again so that he said looking around is the account of this whole affair they were all staring at him and their faces now showed no emotion though of course added poirot inspector kelsey adam goodman and i have been making inquiries we have to know you see if there is still a cat among the pigeons i am happy to say that everyone here is indeed who they say they are so we are not looking for someone pretending to be someone else the murderer is someone using their real identity everyone was very still now there was a feeling of danger in the air we are looking continued poirot for someone who was in ramat three months ago and who saw bob rawlinson hide the jewels in the tennis racquet miss chadwick was here at meadowbank miss johnson was here and so were miss rowan and miss blake he pointed his finger but miss rich miss rich was not here last term was she i no i was ill she spoke quickly i was away for a term so you could have been in ramat said poirot i think you were we can look at your passport there was a moments silence then eileen rich looked up yes she said quietly i was in ramat i was ill and my doctor advised me to go abroad to rest that is true said miss bulstrode i received a doctors certificate saying that miss rich needed to rest for a term so you went to ramat said hercule poirot why shouldnt i go to ramat eileen richs voice shook a little i wanted a rest and sunshine i was there for two months there you were recognized said poirot by jennifer sutcliffe she thought she saw you in ramat but said that the person she saw was fat not thin what are you trying to say said miss rich that i murdered these people it isnt true i tell you it isnt true inspector kelsey poirot turned his head inspector kelsey nodded he went to the door opened it and mrs upjohn walked into the room mrs upjohn said hercule poirot into the silence we would like to ask you something when you brought your daughter julia to meadowbank you looked out of the window of miss bulstrodes sitting room and recognized someone did you not mrs upjohn stared at him yes i did see someone she said someone i hadnt seen for years i wondered what she was doing here mrs upjohn said inspector kelsey will you look round this room and tell me if you see that person here now yes of course said mrs upjohn i saw her as soon as i came in thats her she pointed her finger inspector kelsey was quick and so was adam but they were not quick enough ann shapland had jumped up and was pointing a gun straight at mrs upjohn miss bulstrode moved forward quickly and stood in front of mrs upjohn but miss chadwick was even quicker no you wont cried miss chadwick and threw her body in front of miss bulstrode just as the gun was fired miss chadwick slowly fell to the floor as adam and kelsey took hold of the struggling ann shapland and took the gun away from her they said then that she was a killer said mrs upjohn breathlessly she was one of the most dangerous young agents they had you liar ann shapland shouted angrily she does not lie said hercule poirot you are dangerous until now you have never been suspected when you have used your own identity you have taken real jobs using your own name all to gain information you have worked at an oil company with an archaeologist whose work took him all around the world and an important government minister ever since you were seventeen you have worked as a secret agent for many different people and for a great deal of money in most of your jobs you have used your own name though for others you used a different identity at those times you said you went home to look after your mother but i strongly suspect miss shapland that the elderly woman i visited is not your real mother this genuine mental patient with a confused mind is your excuse for leaving your jobs you did not spend three months this year with your mother instead you went to ramat not as ann shapland but as angelica de toredo a spanish dancer from your hotel room you somehow saw bob rawlinson hide the jewels in the tennis racquet you could not take them then because the british people left ramat suddenly because of the revolution instead you read the luggage labels and found out that jennifer sutcliffe was going to school at meadowbank i have discovered that you paid miss bulstrodes secretary a large amount of money to leave her job and you took her place one night you went to the sports pavilion to find the jewels poirot said but miss springer saw you and followed you and you shot her later mademoiselle blanche tried to blackmail you and you killed her too it comes naturally to you does it not to kill he stopped inspector kelsey stepped forward and officially arrested ann shapland who swore and struggled wildly as she was taken out of the room miss johnson was kneeling by miss chadwick im afraid shes badly hurt she said we need a doctor immediately chapter twenty four poirot explains you did it very well monsieur poirot said inspector kelsey you made ann shapland think that we were going to arrest miss rich and mrs upjohns sudden appearance completely surprised her if the bullet in that gun matches the one that killed miss springer it will my friend it will said poirot then well have definite evidence that ann shapland murdered miss springer and of course she shot miss chadwick but i still dont understand how she killed miss vansittart its impossible she has a perfect alibi it is true poirot said that ann shapland killed miss springer and mademoiselle blanche but miss vansittart he hesitated for a moment and looked at miss bulstrode miss vansittart was killed by miss chadwick miss chadwick exclaimed miss bulstrode and kelsey together poirot nodded i am sure of it but but why said miss bulstrode i think explained poirot that miss chadwick loved meadowbank too much when you retired she wanted to be the next head teacher but shes much too old said miss bulstrode yes said poirot but she didnt think so then she found out that you were thinking of making eleanor vansittart head teacher miss chadwick loved meadowbank and she did not like eleanor vansittart i think in the end she hated her she was jealous i see said miss bulstrode slowly yes yes i see i should have known and when you went away for the weekend you chose eleanor vansittart to be in charge said poirot gently this is what i think happened just as she said miss chadwick saw the light in the sports pavilion and went out to investigate but it was miss vansittart who took a golf club with her not miss chadwick miss chadwick took a sandbag and when she saw eleanor vansittart kneeling down she lifted the sandbag and hit her miss chadwick was horrified by what she had done she had killed miss vansittart because of jealousy but now she was sure she would be the next head teacher so she told the police that she had taken the golf club not the sandbag which she put back but why did ann shapland kill mademoiselle blanche with a sandbag asked miss bulstrode because she could not use her gun as the shot would be heard explained poirot and she cleverly wanted to connect the third murder with the second one because for the second murder she had an alibi and why did you ask eileen rich to draw various members of my staff i wanted to see if jennifer sutcliffe would recognize a face but she did not recognize mademoiselle blanche with a different hairstyle so it is doubtful that she would have recognized ann shapland so was ann shapland the woman with the racquet asked miss bulstrode yes said poirot all this time she has been working alone to get the jewels for herself that day you rang your buzzer to ask for mademoiselle julia ann shapland did not answer she put on a blonde wig and a blue dress and was away from her desk for only twenty minutes and miss rich miss bulstrode looked thoughtful hercule poirot and inspector kelsey looked at each other talk to her said poirot as the two men left the room that is the best thing to do when eileen rich appeared her face was white so you want to know what i was doing in ramat i think i know said miss bulstrode jennifer said you were fat she didnt realize you were pregnant yes said eileen rich i was going to have a baby i didnt want to lose my job here so when i couldnt hide it any longer i said i was ill and went abroad to ramat but my baby my baby was born dead i came back this term and hoped that no one would ever know thats why i had to say no when you asked me to be the next head teacher she paused and said calmly would you like me to leave now or wait until the end of term i want you to stay and come back next term said miss bulstrode if there is one come back said eileen rich do you mean you still want me of course i do said miss bulstrode you havent murdered anyone have you you had a love affair and a baby but i think the real passion of your life is teaching oh yes agreed eileen rich i love teaching more than anything else youre a fine teacher said miss bulstrode together well work hard to make meadowbank successful again and well do it itll be the best school in england said eileen rich with excitement yes ill stay good said miss bulstrode and eileen please go and get your hair cut properly but now she said her voice changing i must go to chaddy miss chadwick was lying in bed very white and still miss johnson and a policeman with a notebook sat nearby hallo chaddy said miss bulstrode taking her hand miss chadwicks eyes opened i want to tell you she said eleanor it was it was me yes dear i know said miss bulstrode tears fell slowly down miss chadwicks cheeks its so awful i didnt mean to do it i was jealous ill never forgive myself but you saved my life said miss bulstrode and you saved mrs upjohn that matters too doesnt it i only wish said miss chadwick i could give my life for you both then it would be all right miss bulstrode looked at her with great pity miss chadwick took a deep breath and smiled her head moved slightly to one side and she died you did give your life my dear said miss bulstrode softly i hope you realize that now chapter twenty five legacy mr robinson is here to see you sir said georges ah said hercule poirot he had received a letter from his friend colonel pikeaway about mr robinson show him in georges mr robinson came into the room bowed and shook hands politely when he sat down he wiped his large yellow face with a handkerchief i was interested to hear monsieur poirot said mr robinson of your involvement in the affairs of a girls school meadowbank i hear too that three murders were committed by an unfortunate young woman a young woman who had a violent hatred of schoolteachers no doubt said poirot dryly that is what her defence lawyer will say she was good at her job i believe sighed mr robinson young but very useful to many different people but it was a mistake for her to work alone and try to take the jewels for herself poirot nodded mr robinson leaned forward i have come to ask where the jewels are now monsieur poirot he asked and what are you going to do with them i have been waiting for suggestions said poirot they do not belong to me and i would like to give them to their true owner and i am here to suggest that you give the jewels to me said mr robinson ah said poirot and why should i do that because they were the personal property of the late prince ali yusuf who told his friend bob rawlinson to get them out of ramat if he succeeded he was supposed to give the jewels to me have you proof of that certainly mr robinson handed him a large envelope and poirot read the papers inside very carefully it seems to be as you say he said may i ask what you personally get for doing this mr robinson looked surprised money of course he said a large amount of money there are many people like me in the world we arrange financial matters for important people kings presidents princes we charge a lot of money for our services but we are honest i see said poirot eh bien i agree to what you ask but i am curious what are you going to do with the jewels mr robinson looked at hercule poirot his large face smiled as he told poirot his plans children were playing and running in the street one of them bumped into mr robinson as he stepped out of his expensive car mr robinson opened the gate to number and knocked on the door of the neat little house the door was opened by a fair pleasant looking girl of about twentyfive mr robinson she said with a smile i got your letter please come in she led him into a small sitting room would you like some tea she asked thank you but no i can only stay a short time as i said in my letter i have come to bring you something from ali yes so there isnt any hope i mean its true hes really dead im afraid so said mr robinson gently i didnt really expect to see him again when he went back to ramat said the girl i knew he had to stay there and marry one of his own people mr robinson took out a package and put it on the table open it please she opened the package and breathed in quickly as she saw the beautiful bright jewels inside are they are they real they are real said mr robinson they are worth about one million pounds i cant believe it she wrapped the jewels up again just as the door burst open and a small boy rushed in mum look look at this i he stopped staring at mr robinson the boy had dark hair and dark skin go in the kitchen allen said his mother your dinners ready oh good he hurried out again you call him allen said mr robinson it was the nearest name to ali it would have been difficult for him to be named after his father she paused what am i going to do first i need to see your marriage certificate said mr robinson hmm yes he said when she gave it to him ali yusuf married to alice calder yes this is all perfectly legal no one knew who he was said alice i was pregnant with allen and ali said we should be married it was all he could do for me he did love me we always knew he would have to leave but he did love me yes said mr robinson im sure he did now he continued i can sell these jewels for you and get you a good lawyer to take care of your affairs youre going to be a very rich woman yes all right she said giving him the jewels take them but id like to give one to the schoolgirl who found them a green one perhaps an excellent idea said mr robinson he stood up i shall charge you a lot of money he said but i wont cheat you she looked at him calmly no i dont think you will and i need someone who knows about business you seem to be a very sensible woman said mr robinson now i will take the jewels are you sure you dont want to keep one for yourself no said alice slowly i wont keep even one i dont need jewels to remember ali i have allen a most unusual woman said mr robinson to himself as he walked out to his car yes a most unusual woman the end
