city of the beast michael kane book by michale moorcock chapter one my debt to m clarchet the matter transmitter is both villain and hero of this story for it took me to a world where i felt more at home than i shall ever feel here it brought me to a wonderful girl whom i loved and who loved meand then took it all away again but i had better begin nearer the beginning i was born as i told you in ohioin wynns villea small pleasant town that never changed much its only unusual feature was in the person of m clarchet a frenchman who had settled there shortly after the first world war he lived in a large place on the outskirts of town m clarchet was a cosmopolitan a frenchman of the old schoolshort very straightbacked with a typically french waxed moustache and a rather military way of walking to be honest m clarchet was something of a caricature to us and seemed to illustrate everything we had learned about the french in our dime novels and comic books yet i owe my life to m clarchet though i wasnt to realize it until many years after the old gentleman had passed on and when i found myself suddenly transported to mars but again i am getting ahead of myself clarchet was an enigma even to me though as boy and youth i probably knew him better than anyone else he had been he said a fencing mas ter at the court of the tsar of russia before the revolution and had had to leave in a hurry when the bolsheviks took over he had settled in wynnsville directly because of this experience it had seemed to him at the time that the whole world was in chaos and was being turned upside down he had found a small town that was never likely to change muchand he liked it the way of life he led now was radically differ ent from the one he had been used to and it seemed to suit him we first met when i had accepted a dare by my young pals to climb the fence of his house and see if i could observe what m clarchet was up to at that time we were all convinced he was a spy of some description he had caught me but instead of shooting me as i halfexpected he had laughed goodnaturedly and sent me on my way i liked him at once soon after that we kids had a phase which was a sequel to seeing ronald colman in the prisoner of zenda we all became ruperts and rudolfs for a time with long canes for swords we fenced one another to exhaustionnot very skilfully but with a lot of enthusiasm on a sunny afternoon in early summer it so hap pened that i and another boy johnny bulmer were duelling for the throne of ruritania just out side m clarchets house suddenly there came a great shout from the house and we wheeled in as tonishment non non non the frenchman was plainly exasperated that ees wrong wrong wrong that ees not how a gentleman fences he rushed from his garden and seized my cane adopting a graceful fencing stance and facing a startled johnny who just stood there with his mouth open now he said to johnny you do ze same oui johnny inelegantly copied his posture now you thrustso the cane darted out in a flicker of movement and stopped just short of johnnys chest johnny copied himand was parried with equal swiftness we were amazed and delighted by this time here was a man who would have been a good match for rupert of hentzau after a while m clarchet stopped and shook his head it ees no good with thees slickswe must have real foils non come we followed him into the house it was well fur nished though not lavishly in a special room at the top we found more to make us gasp here was an array of blades such as wed never even imagined now i know them to be foils and epees and sabres plus a collection of fine antique weaponsclaymores scimitars samurai swords broadswords roman short swordsthe gladius and many many more m clarchet waved a hand at the fascinating dis play of weapons zere my collection zey are sweet ze little swords non he took down a small rapier and handed it to me handing a similar sword to johnny it felt really good holding that wellbalanced sword in my hand i flexed my wrist not quite able to get the balance m clarchet took my hand and showed me the correct way of grasp ing it how would you like to learn properly said m clarchet with a wink i could teach you much was it possible we were going to be allowed to wield these swordstaught how to swordfight like the best i was amazed and delighteduntil a thought struck me and i frowned ohwe dont have any money sir we couldnt pay you and our moms and pops arent likely to theyre mean enough as it is i do not wish for payment the skill you ac quire from me will be reward enough herei will show you zee simple parry first and so he taught us not only did we learn how to fence with the modern conventional weapons foils epees and sabresbut also with the antique and foreign weapons of all shapes weights sizes and balances he taught us the whole of his mar vellous art whenever we could johnny and i attended m clarchets special sword room he seemed grate ful to us in his way for the opportunity to pass on his skill just as we were to him for giving us the chance to learn by the time we were around fif teen we were both pretty good and i think i prob ably had the edge on johnny though i say it myself johnnys parents moved to chicago about that time so i became m clarchets only pupil when i wasnt studying physics at high school and later at university i was to be found at m clarchets learning all i could and at last the day came when he cried with joy i had beaten him in a long and complicated duel you are zee best mike better zan any i have known it was the highest praise i have ever received at university i went in for fencing of course and was picked for the american team in the olympics but it was a crucial time in my studies and i had to drop out at the last moment that was how i learned to fence anyway i thought of it in my more depressed moments as rather a purposeless sportarchaic and only in directly useful in that it gave me excellently sharp reactions strengthened my muscles and so on it was useful in the army too for the physical disci pline essential in army training was already built in to me i was lucky i did well in my studies and sur vived my military service part of which was spent fighting the communist guerrillas in the jungles of vietnam by the time i was thirty i was known as a bright boy in the world of physics i joined the chicago special research institute and because of my ideas on matter transmission was appointed director of the department responsible for de veloping the machine i remember we were working late on it enlarg ing its capacity so that it could take a man the neon lights in the lab ceiling illuminated the shining steel and plastic cabinet the great trans lator cone directed down at it and all the other equipment and instruments that filled the place al most to capacity there were five of us working three technicians and doctor logon my chief assistant i checked all the instruments while logan and the men worked on the equipment soon all the gauges were reading what they should read and we were ready i turned to doctor logan and looked at him he said nothing as he looked back at me then we shook hands that was all i climbed into the machine they had tried to talk me out of it earlier but had given up by this time logan reached for the phone and contacted the team handling the receiver this was situated in a lab on the other side of the building logan told the team we were ready and checked with them they were ready too logan walked to the main switch through the little glass panel in the cabinet i saw him switch it on gravely my body began to tingle pleasantly that was all at first it is difficult to describe the weird sensation i experienced as soon as the transmitter began to work it was literally true that every atom of my body was being torn apartand it felt like it i be gan to get lightheaded then came the sensation of frightful pressures building up inside me followed by the feeling that i was exploding outwards everything went green and i felt as though i was spreading gently in all directions then came a riot of colors blossoming around mereds yellows purples blues there was an increasing sense of weightless nessmasslessness even i felt i was streaming through blackness and my mind began to blank out altogether i felt i was hurtling over vast distances beyond time and spacecovering an incredible area of the universe in every direction in a few sec onds then i knew nothing more i came to my sensesif senses they wereunder a lemoncolored sun blazing down on me from out of a deep blue nearpurple sky it was a color more intense than any i had ever seen before had my experience enabled me to see color with greater sharpness but when i looked around i realized that it was more than intensity which had changed i was ly ing in a field of gently swaying sweetsmelling ferns but they were ferns unlike any i had ever seen these ferns were an impossible shade of crim son i rubbed my eyes had the transmitteror rather the receivergone wrong and put me together slightly mixed up with my color sense in a muddle i got up and looked across the sea of crimson ferns i gasped my whole sight must somehow have been al tered cropping at the ferns with a line of yellowish hills in the background was a beast as large as an elephant and of roughly the same proportions as a horse yet here the similarly to any beast i knew ended this creature was a mottled shade of mauve and light green it had three long white horns curling from its flat almost catlike head it had twin somewhat reptilian tails spreading to the ground behind it and it had one huge eye covering at least half the area of its face this was a faceted eye that shone and glinted in the sunlight the beast looked rather curiously at me and lifted its head then began to move towards me with i suspect a wild yell i ran i felt con vinced i was experiencing some sort of nightmare or paranoiac delusion as a result of a fault in the transmitter or receiver i heard the beast thundering on behind me giv ing out a strange mooing sound and increased my pace as best i could i found i could run very eas ily indeed and seemed to be lighter than normal then to one side of me i heard musical laughter at once merry and sympathetic a lilting voice called something in what was to me a strange unearthly language trilling and melodic in fact the sound of the language was so beautiful that it did not seem to need words kahsaaa manherra vosu i slowed my pace and looked towards the source of the voice it was a girlthe most wonderful girl i have ever seen in my life her hair was long free and golden her face was oval her white skin clear and fresh she was naked apart from a wispy cloak which curled round her shoulders and a broad leather belt around her waist the belt held a short sword and a holster from which jutted the butt of a pistol of some kind she was tall and her figure was exqui site somehow her nakedness was not obvious and i accepted it at once she too was totally unself conscious about it i stopped still not caring about the beast behind me so long as i could have a few seconds glimpse of her again she threw back her head and laughed that merry laugh suddenly i felt something wet tickling my neck thinking it must be an insect of some sort i put up my hand but it was too large for an insect i turned that strange mauve and green beast that mon ster with the flylike cyclops eye two tails and three horns was gently licking me was it tasting me i wondered vaguely still con centrating on the girl judging by the way she was laughing i thought not wherever i wasin dream or lost worldi knew that i had fled in panic from a tame friendly do mestic animal i blushed and then joined in the girls laughter after a moment i said if its not a rude ques tion i wonder maam if you could tell me where i am she wrinkled her perfect brow when she heard me and shook her head slowly uhoi merrash civinnee norshasa i tried again in french but without any luck then in germanagain no success spanish was equally ineffective at producing communication be tween us my latin and greek were limited but i tried those too i am something of a linguist pick ing up foreign tongues quickly i tried to remem ber the little sioux and apache i had learned during a brief study of the red indians at college but nothing worked she spoke a few more words in her language which seemed to me when i listened very care fully to have certain faint similarities to classical sanskrit we are both it seems at a loss i remarked standing there with the beast still licking me lov ingly she stretched out a hand for me to take my heart pounded and i could hardly make myself move phoresha she said she seemed to want me to go somewhere with her and pointed towards the distant hills i shrugged took her hand and went along with her so that was how hand in hand with its loveliest resident i came to varnal city of the green mistsmost splendid of the splendid martian cities oh how many thousands upon thousands of years ago chapter two the astounding truth varnal is more real to me even in my memories than ever chicago or new york can be it lies in a gentle valley in the hills which the martians term the calling hills green and golden they are cov ered with slender trees and when the wind passes through them they sound like sweet distant call ing voices as one walks past the valley itself is wide and shallow and con tains a fairly large hot lake the city is built around the lake from which rises a greenish steam a delicate green that sends tendrils curling around the spires of varnal most of varnals graceful buildings are tall and white though some are built of the unique blue marble which is mined close by others have traceries of gold in them making them glitter in the sunlight the city is walled by the same blue marble which also has golden traceries in it from its towers fly pennants gay and multicolored and its terraces are crowded with its handsome inhabitants the plainest of whom would be a soughtafter beau or belle in wynnsville ohioor indeed chicago or any other great city of our world when i first came upon the city of varnal led by that wonderful girl i gasped in awed admira tion she seemed to accept my gasp as the compli ment it was and she smiled proudly saying something in her then incomprehensible language i decided that i could not be dreaming for my own imagination was simply not capable of creating such a vision of splendor and loveliness but where was i i did not know then how had i got there that i still cannot answer fully i puzzled over the second question evidently the matter transmitter had had a fault instead of sending me to the receiver on the other side of the lab building it had sent me hurtling through spaceperhaps through time tooto another world it could not be earthnot at least the earth of my own age somehow i could not be lieve it was any earth of the past or the future yet it could not be the only other obvious planet in our solar systemmarsfor mars was a dead arid planet of red dust and lichen yet the size of the sun and the fact that gravity was less here than on earth seemed to indicate mars it was in a daze of speculation that i allowed the girl to lead me through the golden gates of the city through its treelined streets towards a palace of shining white stone people men and women dressedif dressed is the wordsimilarly to the girl glanced in polite curiosity at my white lab coat and grey pants which i was still wearing we mounted the steps of the palace and entered a great hall hung with banners of many colors on which were embroidered strange emblems myth ical beasts and words traced out in a peculiar script which also reminded me of sanskrit five galleries rose around the hall and in the centre a fountain played the few simplydressed people who stood conversing in the hall waved cheerfully to the girl and gave me that same look of polite curiosity i had received in the streets we walked through the hall through another doorway and up a spiral staircase of white marble here she paused on the landing and opened a door that at first looked like metal but on closer observa tion proved to be wood of incredible hardness and polish the room in which i found myself was quite small it was barely furnished with a few rugs of brightly dyed animal skins scattered about and a series of cupboards around the walls the girl went to one of these cupboards opened it and took out two metal circlets in which were set radiant gems of a kind completely unknown to me she placed one of these on her head and indicated that i should imitate her with the second i took the circlet and fitted it over my own head suddenly a voice spoke inside my skull i was as tonished for a second until i realized that here was some kind of telepathic communicator which we physicists had only speculated about greetings stranger said the voice and i could see the girls lips move framing those lovely alien syllables from where do you come i come from chicago illinois i said more to test the device than to convey information which i guessed would be meaningless to her she frowned soft sounds and very pleasant but i do not know that place where in vashu is that vashu is this city in a land called vashu novashu is the whole planet this city is called varnal capital of the nation of the karnala my people do you have astronomy i asked do you study the stars we do why do you ask which planet is this in relation to the sun it is the fourth from the sun mars it is mars i cried i do not follow you i am sorry somehow i have arrived here from the third planet which we call earth that is where chicago is but there are no men on negalu the third planet only steamy jungles and monstrous beasts how do you know so much about the planet our ethercraft have visited it and brought back pictures you have spaceshipsbut i was at a loss this was too incredible for me to accept all at once i questioned her more closely and soon learned that the earth her people knew was not the earth i bad left it seemed to be an earth that had existed millions of years ago during the age of reptiles somehow both space and time had been crossed that matter transmitter had more to it than wed guessed another thing puzzled me the people did not appear to have a great deal of technology visible in the cityyet they had spaceships how could this be i asked her we did not build the ethercraft they were a gift from the sheevas were these mindcrowns we have a science of our own but it cannot com pare to the great wisdom and knowledge of the sheev who are the sheev they are very great and few of them still live they are remote and of an older race than any on vashu our philosophers speculate on their origin but we know little about them i let that go for the time being and decided it was about the moment to introduce myself i am called michael kane i said i am shizala bradhinaka of the kanala and ruler in the absence of the bradhi i learned that the bradhi was about the equiva lent of our kang although the title did not suggest that the man who held it possessed absolute power perhaps guide would be a better oneor protec tor bradhinaka meant roughly princessdaugh ter of the king and where is the bradhi i asked i saw her face become sad and she glanced at the ground my father disappeared two years agoon a punitive expedition against the argzoon he must have been killed or if he was captured killed him self it is better to die than become a prisoner of the blue giants i expressed my sympathy and did not feel the time right to ask what the argzoon or blue giants were she was evidently deeply moved by the memory of the loss of her father but showed great selfcontrol in refusing to burden someone else with her grief i felt immediately like trying to offer her some comfort but considering i knew nothing of the moral code and customs of her people that might perhaps have been disastrous she touched her circlet we only need to wear these for the time being the sheev have given us another machine which should be able to teach you our spoken language we conversed a little longer and i learned much of marsor vashu as i was already beginning to think of it there were many nations on mars some friendly towards the kanala some not they all spoke rec ognizable versions of the same root language this is supposedly true of earththat our language was originally a common one but in our case the changes have been extreme this was not the case i learned on vashu marss seas still existed shizala told me though apparently they were not so vast as earths varnal capital of the karnala nation was one of a number of countries with rather hazily defined borders which existed on a large landmass bigger but in roughly the same geographical position than the whole of the american continent travel was effected in two main ways most or dinary travel relied on the dahara a riding and carriage beast of great strength and endurance but many nations had a few aircraft as far as i could make out these relied on atomicswhich none of the vashu peoples understood these had not been gifts of the sheev i learned but must once have belonged to the sheev they were incredibly an cient by all accounts and could not be replaced when destroyed thus they were only used in emergencies there were also ships incorporating some sort of atomic engine and sailing ships of various kinds these plied the few rivers of vashurivers which were shrinking with almost every year that passed for arms the vashu warriors relied primarily on the sword they had gunsshizala showed me hers it was a longbarreled finely made weapon with a comfortable grip i could not quite see what it fired or on what principle it worked but as shizala tried to explain haltingly i concluded that it was some sort of laser gun what an incredible amount of power i thought was packed into its chambers for we scientists had always argued that a laser handgun was out of the question since the power required to produce the laser raytightly fo cused light which could cut through steelrelied on a very big generator wonderingly i handed the gun back to her these guns not gifts of the sheev but probably looted from their now lost or completely ruined cities by shizalas remote ances tors were also used infrequently since once the charge was finally expended it could not be replaced their akashasardor ethercraftapparently num bered five in all three of these belonged to the karnala and one each to friendly neighbouring na tionsthe iridala and the walavala although there were pilots who could operate them none of the folk of vashu had any idea how they worked other benefits which a few chosen nations had received from the mysterious sheev included a lon gevity serum which once taken did not need to be taken again everyone was allowed to use it and it gave up to two thousand years of life because of this very few children were born so the population of vashu remained comparatively small no bad thing i reflected i could have listened to shizala for hours but at length she stopped my questions with a smile first we must eat the evening meal will be served soon come i followed shizala as she led me from the little room and down into the main hall which was now furnished with several large tables at which sat men and women of kanala all handsome and beautiful and chatting gaily they all rose politely though not servilely as shizala took her place at the head of one of the tables she indicated the chair on her left and i sat down the food looked strange but smelled good opposite me on shizalas right sat a darkhaired young man superbly muscled he wore a simple gold bangle on his right wrist and he put his arm on the table in such a way as to show it off evidently he was proud of it for he wanted me to see it i guessed it to be a decoration of some kind and thought no more of it shizala introduced the man as bradhinakor prince telem fas ogdai the name did not sound like a karnala name and it soon transpired that bradhinak telem fas ogdai was from the city of mishim tep a friendly nation some two thousand miles to the south he was so it seemed a witty talker though of course i could not understand what he said only a person wearing a circlet could communicate with me on my left was a pleasantfaced young man with long almost white fair hair he seemed to be mak ing a special effort to make me feel at home offer ing food and drink asking polite questions through shizala who translated for us this was darnad shizalas younger brother apparently the succes sion to the throne of varnal was determined by sex and not by age darnad was apparently chief pukannara of varnal a pukan i learned was a warrior and a pukannara a warrior leader the chief pukan nara was elected by popular voteby civilians and warriors alike i assumed from this that darnads position was therefore no honorary one and that he had earned it through prowess and intelligence though he was personable and charming the people of varnal did not judge a man merely on his appearance but on his merit and record i was already beginning to pick up a few words of the vashu tongue by the time the meal was over and we adjourned into an anteroom to drink a beverage called basu a sweetish drink i found quite palatable but which frankly did not at that time seem as good to me as good oldfashioned coffee later i was to discover that basu grew on one and then i preferred it to coffee like coffee it is a mild stimulant in spite of the basu i began to feel quite sleepy and always alert to her guests needs shizala sensed this i have had a room prepared for you she tele pathed perhaps you would like to retire now i admitted that the days surprising experiences had taken a lot out of me a servant was called and shizala went with us up the stairs to the sec ond floor of the palace a dim bulb burned in the room giving adequate light shizala showed me a bellrope very like oldfash ioned bellropes on earth it was close to the bed and was used to summon a servant she left her circlet behind when she left before she did so she told me that anyone could use the circlet and the servant would know how the bed consisted of a wide hard bench on which was a thin mattress a large fur rug was laid over this and it seemed rather too heavy since the day had been very warm to some perhaps the bed would have been too austere but as it hap pened it was the kind i preferred i fell asleep immediately having shed my clothes and i awoke only once in the middle of the martian nightwhich is of course longer than oursfeeling very cold i had not realized how much the temperature could change i pulled the rug about me and was soon asleep again chapter three the invaders a female servant entered in the morning after knocking lightly on the door i was standing at the window looking out over the beautiful streets and houses of varnal at first i felt embarrassed by my nakedness but then i realized that there was no need since it was abnormal here to wear many clothes and then it seemed only for decoration what did continue to embarrass me however was the look of open admiration she gave me as she handed me my breakfast tray of fruit and basu after she had gone i sat down to eat the fruita large one very similar to grapefruit but with a slightly less bitter tasteand drink the basu i was just finishing when there was another knock on the door i called come in in english thinking that this would do the trick it did in walked shizala smiling seeing her again it seemed that i had dreamed of her all night for she was as beautifulif not more soas i remembered her her blonde hair was swept back from her shoulders and back she had on a black gauzy cloak and at her waist was the wide belt containing holstered gun and short sword these i gathered were ceremonial weapons of office for i could not imagine such a graceful girl having much familiarity with the arti facts of war on her feet she wore sandals laced up the calf almost to the knee that was all she was wearingbut it was enough she picked up the circlet she had worn the day before and put it on i thought you might wish to ride around the city and see everything i heard her voice say in my head would you like that very much i replied if you can spare the time it would please me to do so she gave me a warm smile i could not make up my mind whether she felt as attracted to me as i was to her or whether she was just being normally polite it was a puzzle which was already beginning to fill a great deal of my thoughts first she continued it would be better if you spent a couple of hours with the sheev teaching machine after that you will be able to converse in our language without recourse to these rather clumsy things as she led me down corridors and staircases i asked her why if the tongue of vashu were com mon there should be such a thing as a language teaching machine she replied that it had been designed for use on other planets but since the other planets in the solar system only appeared to be inhabited by animals it had never been used she led me below ground the cellars of the palace seemed to go down many levels but at last we reached a place lighted by the same sort of dim bulb as the one in my room these bulbs were also of sheev manufacture shizala told me and had once burned much brighter than they did now the room was small and contained a single piece of equipment it was large and made of metal i did not recognizeprobably an alloy it glowed a little adding to the light in the room it seemed to con sist of a cabinet with an alcove moulded to accom modate the form of a seated human being i could see no other machinery and i would dearly have loved to strip the cabinet down to see what was insidebut curbed my impatience please sit there said shizala indicating the cabinet according to what i have been told the cabinet will be activated immediately you do so you may feel yourself black out but do not be dis turbed i did as she asked and sure enough as soon as i was seated the cabinet began to hum softly a cap came down from above and fitted itself over my head then i began to feel dizzy and soon became unconscious i did not know how much time had passed until i came to finding myself still seated in the now no longer activated cabinet i looked at shizala a little dazedly my head was aching slightly how do you feel she asked fine i said getting up but i had not said fine at all i realized i had said vrazhathe martian word that was its nearest equivalent i had spoken martian it works i cried what sort of machine is it that can achieve that so swiftly i do not know we are content simply to use the things of the sheev we were warned in the far past never to tamper with their gifts since it might result in disaster for us their mighty civilization once suffered a disaster but we have only a few legends which speak of it and they are bound up in talk of supernatural entities in whom we no longer believe respecting what was evidently a deeply rooted custom never to question the sheev inventions i remained silent though every instinct made me want to get at the languageteaching machine probably a highly sophisticated computer contain ing an hypnotic device of some kind my headache had gone by the time we reached the upper levels of the palace and walked through the great hall out into the city at the bottom of the wide white steps two strange beasts were wait ing they were about the same size as shire horses the famous english great horse which had once borne knights into battle but horses they were not their origin seemed to stem from the same basic root as man they were apelike creatures with wide kangaroo tails their hind legs larger than the forelegs they were on all fours now and saddles were on their backs their great heads placid and intelligent turned to look at us as we came down the steps i had a few qualms about mounting mine since it did bear certain affinities to my own race but once aboard it seemed natural that i should ride it its back was wider than that of a horse and in volved stretching ones legs out in front and cup ping the feet in the stirrups attached to another part of the harness up ahead the saddle had a solid support allowing the rider to stretch back wards at ease it was rather like being seated in a sports car and was very comfortable in a kind of holster on my right were several lances though i had no idea of their purpose i found that by gentle tugs on the reins the dahara would respond quickly to any command i made with shizala leading the way we trotted off through the plaza and down the main street of varnal the city was as exquisite as ever under the deep yellow sun the sky was cloudless and i began to relax feeling that i could spend the rest of my life in varnal and its surrounds here a dome caught the light and flashed brightly there a little white house nestled between an impressive ziggurat on one side and a slender tower on the other people moved about in a leisurely yet purposeful way a fruit market was busy but there was none of the noise and bustle of a similar earthly marketplace as we rode around the city shizala told me much about it the karnala as a race had always been primarily traders their origins were the same as many racesthey had started off as barbarian raiders and finally settled on one part of the country they had liked but instead of turning to farming they had continued to travel as traders instead of raiders because of daring expeditions to far parts of vashu they had become very rich trading south ern artifacts for northern precious metals and so on the karnala were also great artists musicians andwhat was highly worthwhile in terms of trade as well as everything elsethe finest book producers in their world the printing presses of karnala i learned were of a flatbed type not so fast as the rotary machines on earth but produc ing what appeared to my eye much sharper print ing the sanskritlike lettering i still could not read but as shizala took me round a small press showing me some of the beautifully made books it produced i soon learned to recognize many words as she pointed them out to me these books were in great demand across the whole continent and were a great asset to the kar nala as were their artists and writers who pro duced the raw material other industries thrived in varnal their sword smiths were also renowned throughout the world i learned the smiths still worked by the old methods using furnace and anvil much as smiths on earth workedan earth that was yet to come i realized some farming was done now but on a big scale and not by private landowners square miles of cereals were sown i was told and harvested all at once by volunteers from all over the karnala na tion what was not used was stored in case of hard times for the karnala were well aware that a na tion based on trade and industry cannot buy food in famine and will only survive if it can produce its own the absence of any places of worship was notice able and i asked shizala about this she replied that there was no official religion of any kind but for those who wanted to believe in a higher being it was better to look for him in their own minds and hearts not to seek him in the words of others on the other hand there were public schools li braries clinics social centers hotels and the like and no one seemed underprivileged or unhappy in varnal the karnala political philosophy seemed to be one of armed neutrality they were a strong nation and prepared for any attack besides this an old fashioned martial code still seemed to exist be cause an aggressor never attacked without good warning after telling me this shizala added apart from the more savage tribes and they are no threat thoseand the blue giants who are the blue giants i asked the argzoon they are fierce and without code or conscience they dwell in the far north and only venture out on raids they have only once come this far south and then my fathers army drove them away she bowed her head and tightened her grip of the reins and never returned i said sympathetically feeling i had to say something just so she jostled the reins and the dahara began to trot faster i imitated her and we were soon gal loping along the wide streets through which the delicate green mist wound and up towards the golden hillsthe calling hills we were soon out of the city and rushing through the strange trees which seemed to be call ing for us as we moved among them after a while shizala slowed her steed and i did likewise she turned to me with a smile i acted wilfullyi hope you will forgive me i could forgive you anything i said almost without thinking she gave me a quizzical intelligent look which again i could not interpret perhaps she said i should mention again i spoke on impulse let us not talkwe are interrupting the voices of the trees let us just ride and listen she smiled very well as we rode i suddenly began to wonder how i was going to live on mars i had accepted that i would like to stay in the idyllic city of varnal i would never willingly leave a place which shel tered such a graceful beauty as the girl riding beside me at that momentbut how was i going to earn my living as a scientist i could probably contribute some thing to the industries it struck me that shizala might be interested if i suggested that she elect me as some sort of court scientific adviser this would allow me to serve a useful function in the community and at the same time enable me to be close to her and see a great deal of her at that time of course i was acting almost intui tively i had not as yet wondered if the customs of the karnala would even permit me to propose mar riage to shizalaand anyway there was a very good chance that shizala would want nothing to do with me why should she although she had not questioned what i had told her about where i had come from and how i had arrived on her planet for all she knew i might be a lunatic my mind was confused as i rode along at length we decided we had best return to the city and the palace and i directed my strange steed back with some reluctance the visiting prince of mishim tep telem fas ogdai was waiting on the steps of the palace when we arrived he had one foot on a higher step and his hand rested on the hilt of his long broad bladed sword he wore soft boots and a heavy cloak of dark material he looked both angry and impatient and twice as i dismounted and walked up the steps towards him removed his hand from his swordhilt to finger the plain gold bangle on bis wrist he ignored me but flashed a glance at shizala and then turned his back on both of us rumbling up the steps into the palace shizala looked at me apologetically i am sorry michael kanebut i had better speak to the bradhinak will you excuse me you will find food in the hall i bowed of course i hope to see you again later she gave me a quick halfnervous smile and then she was tripping up the steps after bradhinak some diplomatic problem i guessed since the prince was evidently an emissary of some kind and was here on diplomatic business as well as a friendly visit perhaps karnalas strength had been sapped in the battle and the following expedition which had lost them their king perhaps they were forced to rely on stronger allies while they built up their strength againand perhaps mishim tep was one of these allies all this speculation seemed likely and much of it was subsequently proved correct i entered the great hall a kind off buffet meal had been laid out on the table by servants cold meat fruit the inevitable basu sweetmeats and so forth i sampled a little of everything and found al most all of it to my liking i exchanged small talk with some of the men and women around the table they were evidently very curious about me but too polite to ask too many direct questions which i did not feel in any mood to answer at that moment as i munched on a particularly tasty piece of meat wrapped in a green lettucelike leaf i sud denly heard an odd sound i was not sure what it was but i listened carefully so that i should hear it again if it came the courtiers had fallen silent and were also lis tening then the sound came again a muffled cry the courtiers looked at one another in apparent consternation but made no move towards the source of the cry it came a third time and now i was sure i recog nized the voice it was shizalas although there were guards at intervals around the hall none of them moved and no orders were given to go to shizalas assistance desperately i looked round at the courtiers that is your bradhinakas voicewhy dont you help her where is she one of the courtiers looked very disturbed and pointed to a door leading off the hall she is therewe cannot help her unless she summons us it is a very delicate matter involving the bradhinak telem fas ogdai you mean he is causing her pain i will not al low it i thought you were people of characterbut you just stand here i told youthe situation is delicate we feel very deeply but etiquette to hell with etiquette i said in english this is no time for nicetiesshizala may be in danger and with that i strode towards the door he had pointed to it was not locked and i flung it open telem fas ogdai was holding shizalas wrists in a cruel grip and she was struggling he was speak ing to her in a low urgent tone when she saw me she gasped no michael kanego from here it will mean more trouble i will not leave while i know this boor is trou bling you i said flicking him a look of scorn he frowned then he grinned evilly and his teeth flashed he still held her wrists let her go i warned stepping forward no michael kane she said telem fas ogdai means me no harm we are having an argument that is all it will end but i had put my hand on the princes shoulder now and i let it lie there heavily release her i ordered he released her all rightand at the same time swung both his fists round to catch me on the head sending me reeling that was it my temper got the better of me and i surged back in a punch on the chest winded him and a following punch on the jaw knocked him back he tried to retaliate so i punched him on the jaw again he went down with a clatter and stayed down oh cried shizala michael kane what have you done i have dealt with a brute who was hurting a very beautiful and sweet young lady i said rub bing my fists i am sorry that it had to happen but he deserved it he has a bad temper sometimes but he is not evil i am sure you did what you thought was best michael kane but now you have made things even worse for me if he is here on diplomatic business he should behave like a diplomat and with dignity i re minded her diplomat he is no emissary from mishim tep he is my betrotheddid you not see the armlet on his wrist armletso thats what it is your betrothed butbut he cant be why would you consent to marry such a man i was horrified and bewil dered there was no chance of making her mine you could not love him now she frowned and it sent a shudder through me to see that i had angered her she drew herself up and pulled a bellcord you do not behave as befits a stranger and a guest she said coldly you presume too much i am sorrydeeply sorry i was impulsive but in the same emotionless voice she said it was my fathers wish that when he died and i succeeded him i should marry the son of his old ally thus making sure of the karnalas security i intend to respect my fathers wish you are pre sumptuous to make any comment concerning my relationship with the bradhinak of mishim tep this was a side of shizala i had not seen be forethe regal side i must have offended her deeply for her to adopt this manner and tone for i knew it was not natural ii am very sorry i accept your apology you will not interfere again now please leave in confusion i turned and left the room bewildered i walked straight from the great hall down the steps of the palace to where a ser vant was just leading away the dahara i had been riding earlier with a muttered word to the servant i mounted the beast and shook its reins making it gallop away down the main street towards one of the gates of the city i had to go right away from varnal for the time being had to go somewhere where i could be alone to collect my thoughts and pull myself to gether shizala betrothed a girl whom i knew now i had loved from the moment i saw her it was too much to bear my heart beating much more rapidly than nor mal and my thoughts racing my whole being seething with anguish i rode blindly from the city past the green lake and out into the calling hills oh shizala shizala i thought i could have made you so happy i believe that i was close to crying then i michael kane who had always prided himself on his selfcontrol it was some time before i slowed my pace and began to make myself think levelly i did not know how far i had ridden many many miles i suspected my surroundings were un familiar there was no landmarks i could recog nize it was then that i saw a movement to the north at first i thought i was looking at a distant herd of beasts galloping towards me but shading my eyes from the sun i soon realized that these were riders mounted on some sort of beast similar to my da hara many riders a horde knowing so little of martian geography or for that matter politics i did not know whether these riders threatened danger or not i sat my beast watching them advance at a tremendous pace even so far away from them i could feel the ground faintly trembling reverber ating to the sound of the thundering animals something seemed a little strange as they ap proached closer i guessed they still could not see meone solitary figurebut i could see them the scale was wrong that was it judging the average height of man and mount against the average height of trees and shrubs i knew that these riders and their steeds were gigan tic not one of their daharas was less than twice the height of mine not one rider was under eight feet tall my memory worked swiftly and came up with only one answer these were invaders morei thought i knew them they could only be those fierce northern raiders shizala had mentioned the blue giantsthe argzoon why had the city had no warning of the hordes approach how had they managed to come this far unde tected these questions rose in my mind as i watched but i dismissed them as useless the fact was that a mounted force of warriorsthousands of them it seemedwere riding towards varnal quickly i turned my beast all thoughts of my grief now forgotten i was obsessed by the emergency i must warn the city at least they would have a little time i checked my position from the sun and guided the swiftlymoving dahara back the way i had come but i had not reckoned with the argzoon outriders though i had observed the main horde the scouts sent ahead had evidently observed me as i ducked low to avoid the low branches of the slim trees and emerged into a wide glade i heard a huge snort and a strange wild gusty laugh then i was staring at a mounted giant towering above me on his great beast in one hand he held an enormous sword and in the other an oval headed mace of some land i was unarmedsave for the slender lances that still reposed in the holster at my side chapter four the attack my mind raced for a moment i felt completely overwhelmed staring up into the face of a being that was to me as impossible as the unicorn or the hippogriff his skin was a dark mottled blue like the folk of varnal he did not wear what we should think of as clothing his body was a mass of padded leather armor and on his seemingly hairless head was a tough cap also of padded leather but reinforced with metal his face was broad yet tapering with slitted eyes and a great gash of a mouth that was open now in laughing anticipation of my rapid demise a mouth full of black teeth uneven and jagged the ears were pointed and large sweeping back from the skull the arms were bare save for wrist guards and strongly muscled on a fantastic scale the fingers were coveredencrusted would be a better descriptionwith crudelycut precious stones his dahara was not the quiet beast that i rode it seemed as fierce as its rider pawing at the deli cate green moss of the glade its head sporting a metal spike and its body partially protected by the same dark brown padded leather armor the argzoon warrior uttered a few guttural words which i could not understand though they were clearly in the same language that i now spoke so fluently fatalistically feeling that if i must die i would die fighting i reached for one of the lances in the holster the warrior laughed again jeeringly and waved his sword clapping his massive legs to his mounts side and goading it forward now my reactions came to my rescue swiftly i plucked one of the lances from tie hol ster and almost in the same motion got its balance then flung it at the giants face he roared as it hurtled towards him but with in credible speed for one so huge he struck it aside with his sword but by that time i had another lance in my hand and turned my jittery mount away as the warrior advanced his sword swooping down towards me i ducked and felt it pass within an inch of my scalp then he had thundered past carried on by the weight of his own momentum i wheeled my beast and flung another lance at him as he tried to turn his mount which was evidently less well trained than mine the lance caught him in the arm he yelled in pain and rage and this time his speed was even faster as he bore down on me again i had only two lances left i flung the third as he came in with his sword held out in front of him like a cavalryman on earth might once have held his sword in a charge the third lance missed but at least my second had wounded his macearm and i only had the sword to contend with i could not duck this one but what could i do there were split seconds in which to decide grabbing the remaining lance i flung myself off the beast and fell to the ground just as the sword met air where i would have been bruised i picked myself up i still gripped the last lance i would have to use it with certainty if i were to win this duel i crouched waiting as he turned poised on the balls of my feet watching the gigantic snorting brute as he fought his dahara turning it round again then he paused laughing that gusty animal laughter his blue head flung back and his vast chest heaving beneath its armor it was his mistake thanking providence for this opportunity i hurled the lance with all my force and skill straight at the momentarily exposed neck it went in some inches and for a brief instant the laughter still came from his mortally wounded throat the noise changed to a shocked gurgle a high sigh and then my opponent pitched back ward off his dahara and lay dead on the ground as soon as it was relieved of its ride the dahara galloped away into the forest i was left panting and dazed but grateful for the fortuitous opportunity i had been given i should have been dead instead i was aliveand still whole i had expected to die i had not counted on the incredible stupidity of an adversary who had been so sure of victory he had exposed a vital spot which could only have been reached by the very weapon i happened to possess i stood over the great hulk it lay spread out on the moss the sword and mace still attached by wristthongs to its arms there was a stink about it not of death but of general uncleanliness the slitted eyes stared the mouth still a grinning gash though now it grinned in death i looked at his sword it was of course a great weapon such as only a ninefoot giant would use yet proportionately it was almost a short swordjust over five feet long fastidiously i bent down and unhooked the thong from the creatures wrist i picked the sword up it was very heavy but finely balanced i could not use it in one hand as the argzoon scout had done but i could use it as a broadsword in two hands the grips were just right i hefted it feeling better thanking heaven for m clarchet my old fencing master who had taught me how to get the most out of any blade no matter how strange or crude it at first seemed holding it by its thong i remounted my beast and lay the sword across my legs as i rode in that still peculiar riding position back towards the city there was a long way to go and i had to hurryeven more so nowto warn the city of the imminent attack but as i rode up hill and down dale for what seemed hours i was to be threatened once again by an argzoon giant who came riding at me from my right flank as i rode down one of the last hill sides before varnal he did not laugh indeed he uttered no sound at all as he came at me evidently so near the city he did not wish to alert anyone who might be close by he had no macejust a sword i met his first swing with my own recently ac quired weapon he looked at it in surprise clearly recognizing it as one forged by his own folk his surprise served me well these argzoon were swift movers for their size but poor think ersthat had already been made quite plain while he was staring at my sword and at the same time bringing his own round for another blow i did not swing up to protect myself but drove the sword towards where i hoped his heart would be i also prayed it would pierce the armor it did though not as swiftly as i had hoped and as the blade struck through leather and then flesh bone and sinew his sword came down in a convul sive movement and grazed my right arm it was not a bad wound but within a moment it was painful his sword dropped from inert fingers dangling by its thong as he sat in his saddle rocking dazedly and looking at me groggily i could see that he was badly wounded though not mortally i guessed as he began to topple from his saddle i reached out and tried to take his weight to stop him from falling with my own wounded arm it was difficult but i managed to hold him there while i inspected the injury i had inflicted turned slightly by the padded armor the sword had gone in just below the heart i managed somehow to dismount still holding him and lifted him down and laid him out on the moss he spoke to me then he seemed very puzzled what he said in his thick brutish accent i am in a hurry there i have stopped the bleeding it doesnt look fatal your own folk must look after you youyou do not kill me it is not my way to kill if i do not have to but i have failedthe warriors of the argzoon will torture me to death for that slay me my van quisher it is not my way i insisted then he struggled up reaching towards a knife in his belt i forced the huge hand away and he sank back exhausted i will help you to that undergrowth i pointed to some thick shrubbery nearby you can hide there and they will not find you i realized i was showing him more mercy than he expected even from the folk of varnal and in helping him i was slowing myself up yet a man is a man i thoughthe cannot do what is contrary to his own feelings and principles if he has a code of honor he must adhere to it the moment he forgets that code then all is lost for even though he for gets on one occasion it is the beginning of the end bit by bit the code will be qualified any break with it justified until the man is no longer a man in truth at all that is why i helped the odd being i had van quished i could do nothing less as i had told himit was my way such emotions may sound old fashioned even prudish in this modern age where values are changingmany think for the worseor things are losing their values altogether but though i realize i may sound stiff arid peculiar to many of my contemporaries i am afraid that then in that gentle valley on ancient mars just as now on earth i had a set of principlescall it what you willthat i knew i must abide by as soon as i had hauled the creature to cover i sent his dahara galloping away and mounted my own within a few minutes i had reached the gates of the city and was riding desperately through them shouting my warning attack attack it is the hordes of argzoon the men looked startled but evidently they too recognized the type of sword i was carrying the gates began to close behind me straight to the palace steps i rode and flung my self from the exhausted dahara running up the steps half staggering with pain exhaustion and the weight of the swordproof of what i had to tell shizala came running into the main hall she looked disheveled and her face bore traces of her earlier anger what is it michael kane what means this dis turbance the argzoon i blurted out the blue giants your enemiesa great horde of them attacks the city impossible why have we not heard we have our mirror posts that signal messages from hill to hill we should have heard yet she frowned thoughtfully what is it i asked the mirrors have had no messages for some time perhaps the stations were destroyed by the wily argzoon if they have reached this far before they will have known roughly what to expect but from where comes their strength we had thought them beaten and quiescent for at least an other ten years they were all but wiped out by my fathers army and its allies my father headed the army which hunted down the survivors well the horde he defeated must have been only a fraction of the argzoon strength perhaps this raid is part of a consistent strategy of surprise meant to weaken you if that is their plan she sighed squaring her beautiful creamy shoulders then it was a good one for in truth we are unprepared no time for selfrecrimination now i pointed out where is your brother darnad as chief pukannara of varnal it is up to him to direct preparations for defense what of the other war riors of karnala they patrol borders keep the peace against roaming bandit bands our army is scattered but even if it were all assembled in varnal it might not suffice to meet an argzoon horde it seems impossible that you received no warn ing at allnot even a runner from another city how have the argzoon been able to get this far south without you knowing i cannot think as you say it could be that they have been planning this for years that they have had spies not of their own race working for them travelling in small groups under cover at night and in disguise assembling in some nearby remote quarter of our landand now ride on the city with none of our allies knowing our fate the walls will resist heavy siege i pointed out you say you have some aircraft you can bombard them from the air using your sheevguns that is one advantage our three aircraft will not achieve much against so large a force then you must send one of them to your nearest ally send youryour i paused as memory flooded back send the bradhinak of mishim tep to summon his fathers aidand seek help from your other weaker allies on the way she frowned thoughtfully and then looked up at me with a strange halfpuzzled look she pursed her lips i will do as you suggest she said at length but even at their fastest our aircraft will take several days to reach mishim tepand an army will take even longer getting here we will have difficulty resisting so long a siege but outlast it and resist it we mustfor varnal and for the security of your neighboring states i told her if the argzoon conquer the karnala then they will sweep on across other nations they must be stopped at varnalor your entire civilization could go under you have a clearer idea of what is at stake than i she smiled slightly and you have only been with us a short time warfare i said quietly thinking of my own experiences does not seem to change much anywhere the basic issues remain much the samethe strategy the aims i have already en countered two of your blue giants and hate to think of this lovely city being ruled by them i did not add that it was not only the city i feared for but shizala too try as i might i could not make myself forget the emotion i felt for her i knew now she was betrothed to another and that whatever she or i felt it was impossible that any thing could come of it evidently her code was quite as strong as mine and would not let her weaken just as i did not intend to weaken for a long moment we looked into each others eyes and all this was therethe pain the knowledge the resolution or did i simply imagine that she was to some degree attracted to me i must not think such thoughts in any case it was overand varnal must be protected have you more suitable arms for me than this i said indicating the argzoon sword of course i will call a guard he will take you to the arms room where you can select whatever weapons you wish at her command one of the guards stepped for ward and she ordered him to take me to tie arms room he led me down several flights of steps until we were deeper below the palace than i had been be fore at last he stopped at two huge metalstudded doors and cried guard of the tenth watchit is inopukan hara with the guest of the bradhinak please open an inopakan i now knew was a warrior with a rank about equivalent to sergeant the doors moved slowly open and i stood in a long hall of great size dimly lit by the waning blue bulbs in the roof the guard who admitted us was an old man with a long beard at his belt were twin pistols he carried no other weapons he looked at me quizzically the inopukan said the bradhinaka wishes her guest to arm himself as he pleases the argzoon attack again but i thought them finished not so said the inopukan sadly according to our guest here they are almost upon us so the bradhi died in vainwe are still to be vanquished the old mans voice sounded hopeless as he let me wander up the hall admiring the great assortment of weapons we are not defeated yet i reminded him star ing at rack upon rack of fine swords i took several down testing them for length weight and balance at last i selected a long fairly slim sword rather like a straight sabre with a blade as long as the sword i had taken from my argzoon opponent it had a beautiful balance it had a basket hilt and as with swords on earth of the same kind one curled two fingers the index and the one next to it around the crosspiece gripping it with the thumb along the top of the hilt with the remaining two fingers curled under that may seem an awkward grip to some but it is actually quite comfortable and also has the advantage of making sure that the sword is not easily knocked from the grasp i found a broad belt equipped at the side with a wide swordloop of leather it seemed traditional in varnal that swords were carried naked and not scabbardedsome old custom from less peaceful times internally i gathered there were also guns that seemed operated by a combination of spring and air i took one of these from its place and turned to the old keeper of the arms room do many use these i asked some our guest he took the gun from my hand and showed me how it loaded a magazine of steel darts was exposed these in the manner of airgun darts could be slid automatically into the breech the air was automatically repressured after a shotthis was done by means of the spring at tachment a very fine piece of craftsmanship but as the old man demonstrated the accuracy was all but nil the gun bucked so much as it shot its mis sile that the target had to be very close indeed if one was to have much success in hitting him still my arms belt had a place for a gunan other leather loopso i slipped the airgun in now with the gun and sword i felt better and was eager to rejoin shizala to see how the preparations were progressing i thanked the old man and accompanied by the inopukan strode back up to the ground level of the palace shizala was not in the hall but another guard led me up many flights of stairs that grew increasingly narrower until we were standing out side a room that obviously was in one of the circu lar towers rising from the main building of the palace the guard knocked shizalas voice called for us to enter we did so and shizala stood there with telem fas ogdai and her brother the bradhinak darnad darnad darted me a quick smile of acknowledg ment shizalas welcome was a gracious movement of the head but telem fas ogdais smile was stiff and frosty he evidently had not forgotten our ear lier encounter that day i couldnt blame him now though i still disliked him greatly i put my feelings about him down to the situation and made an effort to dismiss them as best i could darnad had spread out a map it was a little strange to me this method of mapmaking the symbols for cities forests and so on were not picto rial as ours tend to be but at last i had some idea of where we were in relation to the rest of that mighty continentand to mishim tep and our other allies i could also point out where i had seen the argzoon and at what speed they had been travelling and so on little time darnad murmured thoughtfully running his fingers through his long nearwhite hair his other hand gripped his swordhilt he seemed very young just thenprobably little more than seventeen a boy playing at soldiers one would have thought at first glance then i noted the look of responsibility he wore the confident way he carried himself the unselfconscious un studied mannerisms he began to speak rapidly to us suggesting where the weakest points would be in the city walls and how they would best be defended having had some training in warfare i was able to make some suggestions which he found useful he looked at me with something like admiration and i accepted the look as a compliment for i might have been doing much the same his essen tial manliness and clearheaded objective attitude to the task ahead made me feel that he was ideal as a military leader and i felt that to fight beside him would be reassuring to say the least it would also be in its way a pleasure shizala turned to telem fas ogdai and now telem you have seen what we shall try to do and will have some idea of what our chances are of holding off the argzoon an aircraft awaits you at the hangars lucidly its motor has been prepared since we planned to show it to our guest go swiftly and make sure that rein forcements are sent at once from all cities allied to varnal and tell them if varnal falls their chances of withstanding the argzoon are lessened telem bowed slightly formally looked deep into her eyes darted me another of his looks and left the chamber we returned to the study of the map from the balcony of the tower it was possible to see the whole lovely city laid out beneath usand we could see the surrounding countryside after a while we took the map out on to the bal cony it was as if we felt something was immi nentas indeed something was a short time later darnad pointed telem leaves he said to his sister although there had been talk of aircraft i had not expected the sight which greeted me the aircraft was of metal but it rose and navi gated like an old fashioned airshipgracefully slowly it was oval in shape and had portholes dotted along its length it gleamed like richly bur nished gold and was heavily ornamented with pic tures of strange beasts and symbols it swung in the air as if defying the very laws of gravity and then began to move towards tie south travelling rapidly by my standards but with a stately dignity which could not be matched by any aircraft ever known to earth it was not out of sight before darnad pointed againthis time to our northeast look the argzoon gasped shizala the horde was coming we could see the first wave clearly looking like an army of marching ants from where we stood yet the menace implicit in its steady progress could not be ignored we all felt it you did not exaggerate michael kane darnad said softly i could see his knuckles whiten on his swordhilt the air was still and very faintly we could hear their shouts thin shouts nowbut having already had some experience of the sounds that the argzoon warriors could make i imagined what the noise must be like at source darnad stepped back into the room and came out on to the balcony again clutching what was obviously a megaphone he leaned over the balcony peering down into a courtyard where a group of guards stood ready he put the megaphone to his mouth and shouted to them commanders of the wallto your posts the argzoon come he then relayed specific orders based on what we had discussed a short time be fore as the commanders marched away to take charge of their men and position them we watched in awful fascination as the horde ap proached rapidlytoo rapidly for usthey began to near the walls we saw movement from within the city saw warriors taking up their posts they stood still awaiting the first attack there were too few of them i thoughtfar too few chapter five a desperate plan at least we held the wall against the first wave the whole city seemed to shake at their on slaught the air was ripped by their great roaring shouts polluted by the stink of their incendiary bombs launched from catapults and by the odor of their very bodies flame licked here crackled thereand the women and children of varnal struggled valiantly to extinguish it the sounds of clashing steel of dying or victorious warcries the swish of missilesblazing balls of some pitchlike substanceas they hurtled overhead and dropped in streets and on roofs shizala and i still watched from the balcony but i felt impatient anxious to join the brave warriors defending the city darnad had already gone to rally his men i turned to shizala feeling moved in spite of myself at her closeness what of your remaining aircraft where are they we are keeping them in reserve she told me they will be of better use as a surprise later i understand i told her but what can i do how can i help help it is not for youa guestto concern yourself with our problems i was thoughtlessi should have sent you away with telem fas ogdai i am not a coward i reminded her i am a skilled swordsman and have been shown great kindness and hospitality by you and your folk i would regard it as an honor to fight for you she smiled then you are a noble stranger michael kane i know not how you came to vashubut i feel it is good that you should be here now go thenfind darnad and he will tell you how you can help i bowed briefly and left running down the stairs of the tower until i had reached the main hall now in confusion with men and women rushing this way and that i made my way through them asking a warrior if he knew where i might find the bradhinak dar nad i heard that the east wall is weakest you will probably find him there i thanked the warrior and left the palace head ing for the east wall the main buildings of the city sturdily built of stone as they were were not damaged by the firebombs hurled by the argzoon catapults but here and there bundles of fabric and dry sticks had caught and single pumps were being operated by women in an effort to put them out thick smoke burnt my lungs and made my eyes water my ears were assailed by cries and shouts from all sides and outsideoutside the mighty hordes of blue giants battered against the city walls an invinci ble force i did not let my thoughts dwell on that idea at last i saw darnad through the smoke near the wall he was in consultation with two of his of ficers who were pointing up at the walls evidently showing him the weakest points he was frowning thoughtfully his mouth set in a grim line how can i assist you i asked clapping him on the shoulder he looked up wearily i do not know michael kane could you magi cally bring half a million men to our aid no i said but i can use a sword he deliberated plainly he was unsure of me and i could not blame him for wondering about one who was after all untried just then there came an exultant shout from the walla shout that did not issue from a karnala throat it was one of those roaring triumphant shouts i had heard earlier all eyes turned upward zar the devils have breached a section of our defense we could see them only a few of the blue war riors had gained the top of the wall but unless they were halted i knew that soon hundreds would be stepping over scarcely stopping to think i drew my blade from my belt and leapt for the nearest ramp lead ing to the walltop i ran up it faster than i had ever thought possible a blue argzoon warrior towering above me turned as i shouted a challenge from behind again he voiced that deep maniacal laugh i lunged with my blade and he parried the thrust with a swift movement of his own thick sword i danced and saw a slight chance as his arm came round i darted my sword at the exposed upper arm and was fortunate enough to draw blood he yelled an oath and swung at me with his other weapon a shorthafted battleaxe again my faster speed saved me and i ducked in under his clumsy guard to take him high in the belly the sword flashed into his flesh and came out again his eyes seemed to widen and then with a dy ing growl he toppled from the wall another came at me more cautiously than his comrade again i took the attack to the towering monster twice i lunged twice he parried then he lunged at me i blocked his thrust and saw that my blade was only an inch from his face i pressed the blade forward and took him in the eye i had now got the feel of my sworda mar vellous weapon better even than the best i had used on earth now reinforcements had come to my aid i glanced down on the other side of the wall at what seemed to be a great tide of turbulent blue flesh leathern armor and flashing steel a scaling ladder had been raised more of the argzoon were scaling it that ladder had to be destroyed i made it my objective although the scene was so confused and i could hardly tell what the general situation was i felt a peculiar calmness sweep over me i knew the feeling i had experienced it before in the jungles of vietnamhad even experienced something like it in a particularly difficult en gagement while fencing for sport now that i had a few comrades at least i felt even better i stumbled on something and looked down one of my assailants had lost his battleaxe i picked it up in my left hand testing its weighty and found it was not too badly balanced for me if i held it fairly close to the blade both weapons ready i moved forward in a half crouched position towards the next blue invader he was leading his fellows along the wall towards the ramp the wall was wide enough to take three of us and two warriors ranged them selves on either side of me i felt rather like horatius holding the bridge at that moment but the blue giants were unlike lars porsenas men in that none of them was crying back they all seemed to have the same ob sessionto press forward at all costs their huge bodies came towards us lumbering powerful their slitted eyes stared black hatred at us and i shuddered as for an instant i stared directly into one face there was something less than human something primeval about that gaze something so primitive that i felt i had a vision of hell then they were upon us i remember only a fury of fighting the rapid cut and thrust of the duel the desperate sense of having to hang on having to win having to bring out every ounce of energy and skill if we were to drive them back to the ladderand destroy it yet it seemed at first as if the most we could do was hold the wall against these huge beastmen looming above us with their great corded muscles rolling under blue skins their hatefilled slitted eyes their teethfilled gashes of mouths and their heavy weapons the weight of which alone could sweep us from the wall to our doom i remember that my wrists my arms my back my legsmy whole bodywere aching then the aching seemed to stop and i felt only a strange numbness as we fought on i remember the killing also we fought against their superior strength and numbersand we killed more than halfadozen blue giants fell beneath our blades we had more to fight for than just a city we had an ideal and this gave us a moral strength which the argzoon lacked we began to advance driving the giants back towards their ladder this advantage gave us extra strength and we redoubled our attack fighting shoulder to shoulder like old comradesthough i was a stranger from another planet another time even and as the sun began to sink staining the sky a deep purple shot with veins of scarlet and yellow we had reached their ladder holding the ladder we were able to stop the giants as they attempted to climb up while the others concentrated on stopping any more of the argzoon gaining the wall i chopped at the ladder as far down as i could shortening it so that it no longer topped the wall spears clattered around me but i worked on desperately at length my task was as finished as i could make it i stood up ignoring the missiles that flew about my body took careful aim with the axe aim ing at the middle section of the ladder then i flung it it hit a main strut about halfway down and it went in deep several argzoon warriors were above the place where i had hit the ladder their weight completed my work for methe ladder cracked splintered and then broke with horrible screams the argzoon fell upon the heads of their comrades crowding the ground be low luckily it was the only ladder they had man aged to raise and only because the halberdtype weapons the defenders used to push the ladders back had not been available on this section this was rectified as two halberdiers took up their positions i was feeling somewhat shaky after my efforts and turned to grin at my comrades one of them was a boy even younger than darnada red headed youngster with freckles and a snub nose i gripped his hand and shook it though he was not familiar with the custom nonetheless he respond ed in the right spirit guessing the meaning of the gesture i reached out my hand to grasp that of the other man he gave me a glazed look tried to stretch out his own arm and then pitched forward towards me i knelt beside him and examined his wound a blade had gone right through him by rights he should have been dead an hour before head bowed i paid my silent respects to such a brave fighter then i was up again looking around for dar nad wondering how the battle went night soon fell and flares were lighted it seemed we were to have some relief for the argzoon horde retreated some distance from the walls and began to pitch tents i staggered along the wall and down a ramp i learned from a wall commander that darnad had been called to the south wall but would be return ing to the palace soon rather than seek him along the wall i went wearily back to the palace in the anteroom of the main hall i found shizala the guard who had brought me here left and i was again uncomfortably alone with her even in my exhausted condition i could not help admiring her tall beauty at her silent indication i sank upon cushions that had been heaped on the floor she brought me a flask of basu thankfully i drank it down almost in a single draught then i handed the flask back to her feeling a little better i have heard what you did she said softly not looking directly at me it was a heroic deed your action may have saved the cityor at least a large number of our warriors it was necessary that is all i replied you are a modest hero she still did not look my way but raised her eyebrows a little ironically merely truthful i replied in the same manner how goes the defense she sighed satisfactorily considering our short age of men and the size of the argzoon horde those argzoon they are fighting well and cun ninglywith more cunning than i had suspected they possessed they must have a clever leader i did not think cleverness was an argzoon qual ity i said from what i have experienced myself neither did i if only we could reach their leaderto destroy him would probably defeat the entire plan of attack and the argzoon leaderless might disperse you think so i said i think it likely the argzoon can rarely be per suaded to fight with overall strategy of the sort they are applying now they pride themselves on their individualityrefuse to fight as an army or under any commander they enjoy fighting but not the discipline demanded for ambitious fighting involving armies and planned strategy they must have a superior kind of leader if he has persuaded them to fight as they are doing now how could we reach the leader i enquired we cannot disguise ourselves as argzoonwe could dye ourselves blue but could not add eight or ten kilodas to our heighta kiloda is about a third of a footso an attempt to reach his tent would be impossible yes she spoke tiredly unlessa thought had suddenly struck me unless we could attack him from the air the airyes her eyes gleamed but even then we do not know who their leader is they seem to be one great tide of warriorsi saw no ob vious commanders did you i shook my head and yet he must be out there somewhere it was too confused today let us wait until dawn when we will be able to see their camp before they resume the attack very well you had better go to your room and sleep nowyou have exhausted yourself and will need all your strength for tomorrow i will have a guard wake you just before dawn i got up bowed and left her i went up to my room and stood for a moment at the window the sweet smell of the martian nightcool somehow nostalgicwas tinged now by the stink of war how i hated those blue giants someone had left some meat and fruit on the table next to my bed i did not feel hungry but common sense told me to eat i did i washed the dried blood dirt and sweat of the days warfare from me climbed beneath that heavy fur and was asleep immediately i lay down next morning the same girl servant awakened me i received glances from her which were even more overtly admiring than before it seemed i was something of a talking point in varnal i felt flattered but a little bewildered after all i had only done what anyone else would have done i knew i had done my chosen task well but that was all i felt myself grow a trifle red with embarrass ment as i accepted the food she brought me it was not yet dawn but would be in a very short timeless than two shatis i guessed a shati is roughly an eighth of an earth hour just as i was buckling on my swordbelt a light knock sounded on the door i opened it and faced a guard the bradhinaka awaits you in the tower he told me i thanked him and made my way up to the towerchamber where we had met the previous day shizala and darnad were both there already on the balcony tense and waiting for the sun to rise it began to rise as i joined them they said noth ing as we exchanged nods soon the sun was flooding golden light over the scene it struck the lovely walls of varnal gleamed on water and illuminated the dark camp of the argzoon surrounding our city i say our city be cause that is how i was already thinking of it more so now the argzoon tents were affairs of skin stretched on wooden framesoval in shape mainly though a few were circular or even square most of the com mon warriors seemed to be sleeping on the ground and were beginning to stir as light pervaded the scene but from one tentno larger than the othersa banner flew all the others were undecorated and tended to surround that solitary oval tent sitting in their centre there was no doubt in my mind that the cunning argzoon leader slept there so now we know where their leader is i said staring hard at the waving argzoon banner it seemed to depict some sort of writhing snakelike creature with eyes not unlike those of the argzoon themselves the naal beast shizala explained with a shudder when i asked her what it symbolized yes it is the naal beast what i broke off as darnad pointed look he cried they are already preparing to attack he rushed back into the room and came out bearing a long curling trumpet he blew on this with all his might and a high melancholy note echoed through the city other trumpetcalls sounded in reply the warriors of varnalmany of whom had slept at their postsbegan to make ready for another days fighting it could well be their last shizala said although it will take telem fas ogdai another day before he reaches mishim tep he will have stopped off at nearer cities on the way and relief might come by tonight or tomorrow morning if we can hold out until then we may not need to if i can borrow one of your aircraft i said it only needs one man to drop from the air on to the argzoon commander and despatch him she smiled you are very brave but the aircraft motors take the best part of a day to warm up even if we switched them on now they would not be ready before evening then i suggest that you order them to be switched on at once i said disappointedly for the opportunity might still arise and be welcomed by you when it does i will do as you say but you would perish in a venture such as you contemplate it would be worth it i said simply she turned away from me then and i wondered why perhaps she thought me stupidan unintelli gent boor who only knew how to die after all i had offended her earlier by behaving tactlessly and unsubtly again i controlled my thoughts it did not matter what she thought i told myself i sighed knowing nothing of the science that had developed the aircraft i could not suggest any way of getting their motors ready faster obvi ously i thought it was some sort of slow reaction systemprobably very safe and foolproof but at a time like that i would have preferred something faster even if more dangerous i felt as if shizala were deliberately hampering me for some reason as if she did not want me to put my plan into operation i wondered why darnad now put down the trumpet and clapped me on the shoulder do you want to come with me willingly i said you must tell me how i can be most useful i was unsure of you yesterday he said with a smile but that is not true today im glad farewell shizala farewell sister said darnad she replied to neither of us as we left i won dered if i had offended her in some way after all i was unfamiliar with the customs of vashu and might have done so unknowingly but there was no time for such speculation soon the walls of the city were shaking again to another argzoon attack i helped with the siege weapons tipping cylinders of flaring fat down on the attackers hurling stones on them flinging their own javelins back into their ranks they seemed to care little for their own lives and even less for the lives of their comrades as shizala had pointed out they were individualistic warriors and though they were taking part in an organized mass attack you could still see that they were having to control their own instincts once or twice i saw a couple of them fighting between themselves while their fellows milled around them and our missiles rained down by midday little had been gained or lost save that whilst the defenders were weary almost to the point of dropping the attackers could bring in fresh reserves i learned that the system of reserves was alien to the argzoon normally and this was another puzzling factor of their attack though fierce and feared the argzoon had never been a really important threat since they could not be organized into one mass for long enough also this monstrous attack so far from their homeland an attack without warningspoke of fantastic plan ning and ingenuity it might also speak of treachery i thought privatelyan ally letting the horde through his land by pretending to ignore it but i still did not know enough of vashu politics to make any fair guesses in the afternoon i helped the members of an en gineering squad force up special barriers in places where the wall had been badly weakened by argzoon rams and catapults turning and wiping sweat from my brow after a particularly difficult piece of manipulating i dis covered shizala at my side you seem able to turn your hand to anything she smiled the test of a good scientistthe test of a good soldier i replied returning her smile i suppose it is how is the aircraft coming along it will be ready just before dusk good you are sure you want to make the attempt certain you will need a specially trained pilot then i hope youll supply one she dropped her gaze that will be arranged meanwhile i said have you stopped to think that the argzoon may have been able to arrive un detected here through the connivance of one of your allies impossible none of our allies would stoop to such treachery forgive me i said but though i am impressed by the code of honor possessed by the karnala i am not sure that all the races of vashu possess itparticularly since i have seen another vashuvian race almost as unlike the karnala as it could possibly be she pursed her lips you must be wrong perhaps but my explanation seems the likeliest what if mishim tep were her eyes blazed so that is the foundation of your suspicionjealousy of telem fas ogdai well let me point out that the bradhi of mishim tep is my fathers oldest friend and ally they have fought many a battle together the bonds of mu tual help that exist between the two nations are centuries old what you suggest is not only imper tinentit is base i was only going to say say no more michael kane she turned on her heel and left i may tell you i had little stomach for further fighting just then yet scarcely three shatis later i was part of a small body of warriors defending a breach that the argzoon had made in the wall steel clashed blood spilled the stench of death was everywhere we stood on the broken masonry and fought off ten times our number of blue giants brave and ferocious as they were the blue giants lacked our intelligence and speedas well as our burning ideal to hold the city at all costs these three advantages just seemed to balance the savage attacks which we somehow managed to withstand at one time i was engaging an argzoon even larger than most of his kind around his huge throat he wore a necklace of human bones and his helmet seemed constructed of several large wild beast skulls he was evidently some sort of local commander he carried two large swords one in each hand and he whirled them before him so that facing him was rather like facing a propellerdriven plane i stumbled before the force of his attack and my foot slipped on a bloodwet stone i fell backwards and lay there while grinning jubilantly he prepared to finish me he raised both swords to hack at my prone fig ure and then somehow i swivelled my body and cut at his calves deliberately slashing at the muscles just behind his knees one leg bent and he opened his mouth wide in a great roar of pain then the other leg bent and suddenly he was falling towards me hastily i scrambled up and flung myself out of his path with a tremendous crash he fell to the broken stones and i turned and finished him with a single swordthrust luck providenceperhaps justicewere on our side that day i cannot explain how else we man aged to hold the city against the invaders but we did then just four shatis before sunset i left the wall and headed for the aircraft hangars that had been pointed out to me the day before the hangars were domed buildings near the cen tral square of the city there were three of them side by side the domes were not of stone but of some metallic substance another alloy with which i was unfamiliar the entrances were small barely wide enough or high enough for a man of my size to squeeze through i thought this strange and wondered how the aircraft could get out shizala was in the first hangar i tried supervis ing some male servants who were swinging one of the heavy aircraft round on davits it was cradled in the davits which swung slightly as they moved it the strange oval ship was even more beautiful at close view it was evidently incredibly ancient there was the aura of millennia of existence about it i looked at it in fascination shizala tightlipped did not welcome me as i entered i gave her a slight bow feeling uncomfortable a low thrum of power came from the ship it looked more like a piece of sculpture in bronzelike substance than a vehicle the complicated raised designs spoke of a creative intelligence superior to any in my experience a simple ropeladder led to the entrance i walked up to this in silence and tested it i darted a look of enquiry at shizala at first she refused to meet my glance but at length she did and said with a gesture at the ship go aboard your pilot will join you in a moment there is not much time i reminded her this should be accomplished before nightfall i am aware of that she replied coldly i began to climb the swaying ladder reached the top and entered the ship it was richly furnished with padded couches of some deep green and gold material at the far end were controls as beautifully made and as finely decorated as the rest of the ship with levers of brassperhaps even goldinstruments encased in crystal there was a small screen in a cabinet some kind of television equipment which gave a wider view of what lay outside the ship than could be obtained through one of the rather small port holes after inspecting the interior of the ship i sat on one of the couches to work out my plan of assas sinationfor that in essence was what it wasand wait impatiently for my pilot to join me in a while i heard him climbing the ropeladder my back was to the entrance so i did not see him as he entered hurry i said we have very little time i am aware of that came shizalas voice as she walked towards the controls and seated herself at them shizala this is dangerous it is no job for a woman no then who else do you suggest only a few pilots exist for the shipsand i am the only one available i was not sure that she spoke the truth but there was no time to waste then be very careful i said your people need you more than i dodo not forget your re sponsibility to them that i could never do she said for some rea son i thought she spoke bitterly though i could not determine why at that time now she operated the controls and the ship be gan to rise light as a feather towards the roof as the roof slid open i realized how the ships left the hangars the dark blue sky of late evening was above us the ships motors began to murmur with greater intensity soon we were winging over the city towards the camp of the argzoon we noticed that they were beginning to retreat again as was their nighttime custom our plan was simple the ship would swoop down over the tent of the argzoon commander i would drop swiftly down the rope ladder the oval tent had holes at the top covered with thin gauzepresumably for better ventilation the hole would just take a man i had to drop through it and thus surprise the commander engage him quickly and despatch him with expediency a simple planbut one that would require swift reactions excellent timing and absolute accuracy as we began to move over the enemy camp their great catapults sent huge stones hurtling into the air towards us we had expected this but we had also expected what happened nextthe falling stones of course landed back in the argzoon camp and the warriors naturally objected to being crushed by the artillery of their own forces soon the barrage ceased within a short time our objective was reached at a signal from shizala i went to the entrance and began to pay out more of the ropeladder from the drum near the door i darted a glance at her but she did not turn to look at me i gazed down i could see the banner of the naal beast stirring in the faint breeze that was beginning to blow the faces of hundreds of argzoon were watching me of course for they had expected some sort of attack from us i hoped they didnt realize what form it would take looking down at them i felt like a fly dropping into a nest of giant spiders i gathered my courage made sure of my sword drawing it in a single ges ture shouted once to shizala and swung down the ropeladder until i was directly over the gauzecov ered opening of the leaders tent argzoon were shouting and milling about several spears flashed past me more then ten feet over the opening i decided it was now or never i let myself go and dropped towards the tent chapter six salvation and disaster there was a momentary roaring in my ears and then i was plummeting through the opening drag ging the gauze cover with me i landed on my feet but staggered as the air was forced from my lungs then i whirled to confront the occupants of the tent there were two of thema large battered argzoon warrior resplendent in rudelybeaten bangles and roughhewn gemsand a woman she was blackhaired darkcomplexioned and had a haughty bearing she was wrapped in a thick black cloak of some velvetlike material she stared at me in surprise she was as far as i could tell an ordinary human woman what was she doing here outside came yells from the argzoon warriors ignoring the woman i gestured to the battered argzoon to draw his sword he did so with a sharp grin and came at me suddenly he was an excellent swordsman and still recov ering from my drop into his tent i was forced to fight a defensive duel for a few moments i had little time to do what i had come to ac complish i met his thrusts with the fastest parries i have ever made returned them with thrusts and lunges of my own our swords crossed perhaps a score of times before i saw a break in his guard and moved in swiftly catching him in the heart and running him through at that moment several more argzoon rushed into the tent i turned to meet them but before we could engage the woman cried imperiously enough do not kill him yet i wish to question him i remained on guard suspecting a ruse of some sort but the warriors seemed to be in the habit of obeying the womans orders they stood their ground cautiously i turned to look at her she was exoti cally beautiful in her wild dark way and her eyes smouldered mockingly you are not of the karnala she said how do you know that your skin is the wrong texture your hair is shortthere is something about the set of your shoulders i have never seen a man like you where are you from you would not believe me if i told you tell me she spoke fiercely i shrugged i come from negalu i said using the martian name for earth that is impossible there are no men on ne galu not now there will be she frowned you seem to speak truthfully but in some sort of riddle you are perhaps aa she seemed to regret what she was about to say and stopped a what what do you know of raharumara nothing this seemed to satisfy her she put her knuckles to her mouth and seemed to gnaw them suddenly she looked up at me again if you are not of the karnala why do you fight with them why did you jump into this tent and kill ranak mard she indicated the fallen argzoon why do you think she shook her head why risk your life just to kill one argzoon captain is that all i did she smiled suddenly aha i think i know yes that is all you did my spirits sank so i had been wrong the tent did not hold some great argzoon battleleader per haps it was a deliberate blind and the leader was elsewhere what of you i said are you a prisoner of these folka prisoner with some power call me a prisoner if you like i am horguhl of the vladnyar nation where lies vladnyar you do not know it lies to the north of kar nala beyond narvaash the vladnyar are ancient enemies of the karnala so vladnyar has struck up an alliance with argzoon think what you like she smiled secretively and now i think you will d she broke off as there came a great sound of fighting outside the tent what is that i could not think it was impossible that the small force of karnala warriors in the city had at tacked the argzoonthat would have been folly but what else as horguhl and the blue giants turned towards the sound i seized my opportunity stepped for ward and ran one of the argzoon through the throat i fought my way through the others and found myself outside the tent staring into the darkness as the remaining warriors came after me i ran in the general direction of the noise of battle i darted a quick glance back above the tent looking to see if shizala had made good her es cape the ship was still therehovering above the tent why hadnt she left i stopped uncertain what to do and in a second found myself engaging several of the gigantic warriors it was all i could do to protect my own life but as i fought i got the impression that something was happening close by and suddenly out of the corner of my eye i saw a group of splendidlyarmored warriors of about my own height break through a mass of blue swords men the warriors were not from the city that was plain they wore helmets for one thinghelmets from which nodded brightlycolored plumes pho bos and deimos coursing across the heavens gave illumination to the scene around me the new war riors also had lances and some carried what looked like metal crossbows soon their foreguard had pressed forward until i found myself with several allies helping me to en gage the argzoon who were attacking me greetings friend said one of them in an ac cent only slightly different from the one i was familiar with greetings your presence here has saved my life i replied in relieved gratitude who are you we are from srinai did telem fas ogdai send you here no the mans voice sounded a trifle surprised we were originally on our way to deal with a large force of bandits who fled into karnala that is why there are so many of us a detachment of your border patrol were about to help us when a messenger came with news that the argzoon were attacking varnalso we left the bandits and rode to varnal as fast as we could i am glad you did what do you think our chances are of defeating them i doubt that we cannot completely but we might be able to drive them away from varnal and give your reinforcements time to come to your aid this conversation was carried on while fighting argzoon warriors but the argzoon were becoming increasingly few and it seemed we were winning in that particular area anyway at last we had them on the run and the com bined force of srinai and karnala chased the re treating argzoon towards the calling hills from whence they had come the argzoon stood their ground on the crest of the first range of hills and then we withdrew to count our strength and plan fresh strategy it was soon obvious that the argzoon still out numbered us and that the srinai and karnala who had attacked them from behind had had the ad vantage of being fresh and able to take the argzoon by surprise but i felt much better now i decided we could withstand the next attack and hold the argzoon off until help came then i remembered the ship and shizala i re turned to the now ruined argzoon camp the tent with the banner was still standing unlike most of the others and rather strangely the ship still hovered above it it seemed to me peering through the moonlit darkness that the ship was now lower above the roof the ropeladder brushing the top of the tent i called her name but silence greeted me with a feeling of foreboding i climbed up the yielding sides of the tent it was a hard climb but i made it rapidly almost in panic sure enough the ropelad der was closer the ship lower i grabbed the lad der and began to clamber up it soon i was inside the ship a brief glance showed me that it was empty shizala had gone how where what had happened to her what had she done why had she left the slip what reason was there for doing such a thing all these thoughts raced through my brain and then i was dropping down the ropeladder again hand over hand until i was above the now uncov ered roofopening i dropped through it as i had done earlier save for the corpse of ranak mard the tent was empty yet there were signs of a struggle and i no ticed that ranak mards sword had been removed from his dead grasp and now lay on the other side of the tent something else lay beside it a gun a gun of the sheev it could only be shizalas gun the mysterious darkhaired woman horguhl and the argzoon warriors must have taken part in a struggle soon after i had left for some reason best known to herself shizala had decided to follow me into the tent she had found me gone of course and confronted horguhl and the argzoon there had probably been a fight and shizala had been overpowered and captured she had not been killedthat was a mercyor i should have found her corpse abducted then my misguided plan to kill the absent master mind behind the argzoon had been worthless all my plan had succeeded in doing was putting a hostage in the hands of the argzoon the best hostage they could ever hope for the ruler of varnal i began to curse myself as i would never curse another even my greatest enemy chapter seven the pursuit then i was running from the tent blind with re morse and anger i rushed through the corpse strewn field towards the calling hills bent on shizalas rescue i ran past startled warriors of the srinai and the karnala who called after me enquiringly i began to run up the hill towards the spot where the argzoon had taken their stand i heard more shouts behind me the sound of fastmoving feet i refused to pay them any atten tion ahead and above the argzoon stirred evidently thinking that we were launching another surprise attack on them instead of holding their ground as i expected they began to turn and run in twos and threes i yelled at them to stop and fight i called them cowards they did not stop soon it seemed that the whole argzoon force was in full flightpursued by one man with a sword suddenly i felt something grapple my legs i turned to meet this new adversary wondering where he had come from i raised my sword striv ing to keep my balance more men jumped on me i growled in fury try ing to fight them off then my head cleared for a moment and i realized that the one who had grappled me was none other than darnad shizalas brother i could not understand why he should be attack ing me i cried out darnadit is michael kane shizalashizala they have then came a blow on my head and i knew no more i awoke with a throbbing headache i was in my room in the palace at varnal that much i could understand but why why had darnad attacked me i fought to think clearly i sat up rubbing my head the door suddenly opened and my attacker en tered looking worried darnad why did you how do you feel worse than i would if your comrade had not knocked me out dont you realize that you are still excited i see we had to stop you even though your madness resulted in the argzoon fleeing in complete disorganization as far as we can tell they are now scattered your plan to slay their leader must have worked they seem to have broken up completely they no longer represent a threat to varnal but i slew the wrong man i i paused what do you mean my madness it sometimes happens that a warrior who has fought long and hard as you did is gripped by a kind of battlerage in whichno matter how tired he might behe cannot stop fighting we thought this was what happened to you there is another thing that concerns me shizala dont you realize what you have done i spoke in a low angry voice you speak of shizala is she here is she safe nowe cannot find her she piloted the ship that took you to the argzoon camp but the ship was empty when we recovered it we think that i know what has happened to her you know then why did you not tell us why i was seized by no battlerage darnad i dis covered that shizala had been abducted i was on my way to try to rescue her when you set upon me how long ago was this last nightabout thirtysix shatis ago thirtysix i got up giving an involuntary groan not only my head ached the exertions of the previous two days had taken their toll of my body it seemed a mass of bruises and minor wounds my worst woundthe one on my arm was throbbing painfully thirtysix shatismore than four hours ago as quickly as i could i told darnad all the de tails of what i had learned he was as surprised as i had been to learn of horguhl the vladnyar woman i wonder what part she plays in this he said with a frown i have no idea her answers were ambiguous to say the least i am sorry that i made that mistake michael kane he said i was a fool i heard you shouting something i should have listened with luck we should have rescued shizala and all would be over the argzoon are scattered we and our allies will soon have cleansed karnala of them we will be able to question prisoners and discover how they managed to reach varnal undetected but while we are doing this shizala could be taken anywhere northsoutheastwest how are you to know where they will carry her darnad dropped his eyes and stared at the floor you are right but if you think shizala is with this vladnyar girl then we must hope that some of our prisoners will have seen which way they went there is also the chance that in our general routing and capturing of the argzoon we will manage to rescue shizala there is no time for recriminations of any kind i said so let us forget the errors of judgment we have both made the heat of the battle must be held to account what do you intend to do now i shall be leading a force with the specific in tention of capturing argzoon and questioning them on the whereabouts of shizala then i shall accompany you i told him that is what i hoped you would say he said patting my shoulder rest while the last prepara tions are being made i will call for you when we are ready to leavethere is nothing else you can do until then and you had better regain as much strength as possibleyou are going to need it i will have food sent thank you i said gratefully he was right i must make myself relaxfor shizalas sake as i lay back on the couch i again wondered just why she had risked such danger by going into the argzoon tent there had been no need for it and as ruler of her folk she should have returned at once to varnal i decided that the sooner we found her the sooner we should have answers to these and other questions i slept until a servant entered with food then i ate the food and on receiving a message that dar nad and his warriors were ready washed hastily and went down to join them the day should have been grim and stark and full of stormclouds it was not it was a lovely clear day with the pale sun brightening the streets of the city and obscuring most traces of the strife that had so recently ended at the foot of the palace steps was a company of warriors mounted on dahara darnad was at their head holding the reins of a dahara that was evi dently meant for me i mounted the beast stretching my legs out along it then the whole company turned into the street leading towards the main gate we were soon riding across the calling hills tracking our fleeing enemy it was still a mystery why the argzoon had fled so precipitatelyparticularly in the face of such a small force but we did not ask ourselves these questions as we rode grimly after our quarry even though it seemed that ranak mard had indeed been the mastermind behind the argzoon attackfor it was plain that he was dead and the argzoon were now in confusion yet why had horguhl told me otherwise no questions not yet find the argzoonthey will answer our ques tions on we rode it was not until late in the afternoon that we managed to surprise a group of some ten weary argzoon who had camped in a shallow valley far far from the calling hills they rose up at our approach and stood ready to fight for once we outnumbered them normally this would not please me but i felt that in this case it made a pleasant change to have the advantage over the argzoon they put up a token fight as we attacked them about half were killed and then the others lay down their arms the argzoon have no code of loyalty such as we understand it and little sense of comradeship with one another this made it easier to question them in one waybut harder in another they did not stay silent because they did not wish to betray their fellows they stayed silent out of stubbornness it was not until darnad significantly fingered his long dagger and hinted that since they were no use to us it would be as well to dispose of the argzoon that one of them broke we were lucky he knew a great deal more than we had expected one simple warrior to know they had not crossed from argzoon to karnala by land at all but had spent over a year travelling by sea and river they had gone round the coast thousands of miles out of their wayfor varnal lay many thousands of miles inlandand then sailed down the haal river the largest of the rivers on the continent they had assembled in a place called the crimson plain and then gone in small groups from there moving at night all the time until they reached karnala undetected we learned that one or two parties of karnala warriors had dis covered detachments of argzoon but the karnala had been wiped out simple darnad mused after hearing this and yet we never credited the argzoon with such inge nuity or patience it just isnt in their nature to spend so much time and thought on a raid it is good that you slew ranak mard michael kane he must have been a strange sort of argzoon now i said let us try to discover where shizala has been taken but the argzoon could not help beyond telling us that as far as he knew all the argzoon were fleeing north it seemed instinctive for them to go north back to their mountains in defeat i think he is right said darnad our best chance would be to try the north north i saidthat takes in a lot of territory darnad sighed truebut he looked at me directly and there was a misery in his eyes that was only half hidden i reached out and grasped his shoulder but all we can do is search on i said we will make more prisoners soon and with luck we shall be able to get a better indication of where they have taken shizala our prisoners were tied securely and one of our number undertook to escort them back to varnal now we rode across a vast plateau of short wav ing crimson fern it was the crimson plain it was like a great sea of bright blood stretching in all directions and i began to feel hopeless of ever finding shizala night fell and we camped building no fires for fear of ambush from argzoon or from the maraud ing bandits who apparently roamed these plains nomadic bands made up from the riffraff of all the nearby nations the crimson plain was a kind of nomans land hardly touched by law of any sort save the savage dogeatdog weakesttothewall law of the lawless i slept little i was beginning to feel frustrated wanting to find more argzoon to question we moved off early almost before dawn it was no longer fine and the sky was full of grey clouds a light drizzle falling we saw nothing of bandits or argzoon until the next afternoon when suddenly in front of us some fifty blue giants rose up in our path they looked ready for a fightready for vengeance on us for their defeat we scarcely paused as we drew lances and swords and goaded our mounts towards them yell ing as fiercely as they did then we clashed and the fight was on i found myself engaged with a blue warrior who wore around his waist a girdle of grisly spoils from the earlier encountersevered human hands i decided to claim some recompense for those hands being mounted i was more at an advantage than i had been for the argzoon were not apart from the advance guard i had originally seen there seemed to be few mounts among them and i concluded that their need for secrecy had made them wary of using too many the warrior struck at me lefthanded catching me by surprise the weapon was a battleaxe and it took all my skill to block the blow and at the same time avoid the lunge of his sword he pressed down on my sword with both weapons and we remained in that position for several moments testing each others strength and reflexes then he tried to raise the sword to aim a blow at my head but i whipped my own blade out from under his axe and he was unbalanced for a second i used that second to pierce him in the throat meanwhile there was general confusion around me though it seemed we were beating the argzoon we had many casualties it seemed we had only about half our original strength left i saw darnad having trouble with a couple of blue warriors and rode in to help him together we quickly despatched our opponents from the fifty argzoon we had fought only two had surrendered we used the same technique on them as we had used with the previous prisoners at last they be gan to answer our questions surlily did you see any of your comrades take a kar nala woman with them perhaps darnad fingered his knife yes said the argzoon in which direction were they riding i said north but where did you think they were going maybe towards narlet where is that i asked darnad about three days ridea brigand town near the borders of the crimson plain a brigand towndangerous for us eh it could be darnad admitted but i doubt it if we dont make trouble they prefer not to antag onize us if we make it plain we are not seeking any of their number in fact darnad laughed i have a friend or two in narlet rogues but pleasant company if you forget that they are thieves and murderers many times over again we put the prisoners in charge of one man and our somewhat depleted force moved on towards narlet at least we had some definite information and our spirits rose as we rode full speed towards the city of thieves twice more en route we were forced to stop and engage argzoon and the prisoners we took con firmed that in all likelihood shizala had been taken to narlet less than three days later we saw a range of hills in the far distance marking the end of the crimson plain then we saw a small walled cityits wall seem ing to be built of logs covered with dried mud the buildings were square and seemed solid enough but they had little beauty we had reached narlet city of thieves but would we find shizala chapter eight the city of thieves it would not be true to say that we received a joy ous welcome in narlet but as darnad had said they did not immediately set upon us though they gave us looks of intense suspicion and tended to avoid us as we entered the citys only gate and made our way through the narrow streets well get no information from most of them darnad told me but i think i know where i can find someone who will help usif old belet vor still lives belet vor i said questioningly one of those friends i mentioned our little party emerged into a market square of some sort and darnad pointed to a small house sandwiched between two ramshackle buildings when i used to patrol these parts he saved my life once i had the good fortune to return the favor and somehow we struck up a strong friendship one of those things we dismounted outside the house and from it an old man emerged he was toothless and wrinkled and incredibly ugly yet there was a jaunty appear ance about him which made one forget his un wholesome visage ah the bradhinak darnadan honor an honor his eyes twinkled belying his servile words he spoke ironically i could see why dar nad had liked him greetings you old scoundrel how many chil dren have you robbed today only a dozen or so bradhinak would this friend of yours like to see my spoilssome of the sweetmeats are only halfeaten hehheh spare us the temptation i smiled as he ush ered us into his hovel it was surprisingly clean and orderly and we sat on benches while he brought us basu drinking the sweet beverage darnad said seri ously we are in haste belet vor have any war riors of the argzoon been seen in narlet recentlycoming here perhaps a day or so before us the old rogue cocked his head to one side why yestwo argzoon warriors looked as if theyd taken a beating and were scampering back to their mountain lairs just two warriors belet vor chuckled and two prisoners by the look of them im thinking they wouldnt have chosen such company of their own free will two prisoners women both of them one fair one dark shizala and horguhl i cried are they still here darnad asked urgently im not sure they could have left early this morning but i think not where are they staying ahthere you have it if you seek the prisoners the argzoon warriors seem to be of high rank they are guests of our citys noble bradhi your bradhinot chinod sai yes he has now chosen to call himself the bradhi chinod sai narlet is becoming respectable eh he is one of your peers now bradhinak dar nadnot so the scoundrel he gives himself airs perhaps said old belet vor musingly but i seem to remember that many of the established na tions in these parts had origins similar to our darnad laughed shortly you have me there belet vorbut thats for posterity i know chinod sai for a bloodthirsty slayer of women and chil dren you do him an injustice belet vor grinned he has killed at least one youth in a fair fight darnad turned to me speaking seriously if these argzoon have chinod sais protection then we will have greater difficulty getting shizalaand this other womanout of their power we are in a bad position i have a suggestion if you will hear it belet vor insinuated ill listen to anything reasonable said darnad welli would say that the argzoon and their ladies are guesting in the special chambers set aside for sudden visitors of some standing what of it i said a trifle tersely those chambers are conveniently placed on the ground floor they have large windows perhaps you could help your friends withouteractually disturbing our royal bradhi i frowned but arent they guarded oh there are guards surrounding the great bradhis palace at intervals he fears possibly that there may be robbers in these partssuch little faith does he have in his subjects how would we enter the guest rooms without the guards seeing us i rubbed my chin you would have to dispose of themthey are very alert after all some of the best thieves of the crimson plain have tried to help themselves to chinod sais booty from time to time a few have even succeeded most have helped decorate the city wallsor at least their heads have but how could we silence the guards easily that said belet vor with a wink is where i can help you excuse me he got up and hobbled from the room i think hes a likeable old bandit dont you darnad said when belet vor had left i nodded but he puts himself in danger surely by helping us if we are successful this chinod sais men are bound to suspect that he had a hand in it true but i doubt whether chinod sai would do anything about it belet vor knows many secrets and some of them concern chinod sai also belet vor is very popular and chinod sai sits on his selfmade throne rather uncertainly there are many who would usurp him if they could gain a popular following if anything happened to belet vor it would be just the excuse needed by some wouldbe bradhi of thieves chinod sai knows that well enough good i replied but nonetheless i think he risks more than he needs for our sake i told you michael kanethere is a bond be tween us that simple statement meant a great deal to darnad evidently and i think i knew how he felt such virtues as loyalty selfdiscipline temperance moderation truthfulness fortitude and honorable conduct to women are apparently outmoded in the societies of new york london and parisbut on mars my vashu they were still strong is it any wonder i should prefer the red planet to my own soon belet vor returned carrying a long tube and a small handsomely worked box these will silence your guards he said flour ishing the box and morethey will not actually kill them he opened the box carefully and displayed the contents about a score of tiny feathered slivers lay there at once i guessed that the tube was a blowpipe and these were its ammunition the slivers must be tipped with some poison that would knock the guards out in silence we accepted the weapon there are some eight shatis until nightfall be let vor said time to exchange reminiscences eh how many men came with you there are six left i said then there is room enough in here for them in vite them in for a cup of basu darnad went outside to extend belet vors invi tation to his men they came in and accepted the cups gratefully belet vor also brought food the eight shatis passed with incredible slowness and i spent them for the most part in thoughtful silence soon if providence were on our side i would see shizala again my heart pounded in spite of myself i knew she could never be mine but just to be near her would be enough to know that she was safe to know that i would always be nearby to protect her when it was dark belet vor glanced at me eight is a good number he said not too small a force if you run into trouble not so large as to be easily detected we rose our warharness creaking our ac coutrements jingling we rose in silence save for those small sounds farewell darnad belet vor grasped the young bradhinaks shoulder and darnad grasped the old mans there seemed to be something final about that parting as if belet vor knew they would never meet again farewell belet vor he said softly their eyes met for an instant and then darnad was striding for the door thank you belet vor i said good luck he murmured as we left and fol lowed darnad towards chinod sais palace the building we finally came upon was situated in the centre of the city it was only two stories high and while it had some stone in its construc tion it was mainly of wood it stood in an open square from which several narrow streets radiated we hugged the shadows of the streets and watched the guards as they pa trolled the grounds of the palace belet vor had told darnad exactly where the guest rooms were and when the argzoon were likely to retire we assumed that shizala and hor guhl would not be dining with chinod sai at this time it was likely that the argzoon were eating in the main hall of the building this meant we might be able to rescue the two women without arousing the suspicion of those inside and thus avoid a noisy fight after we had ascertained the exact movements of the patrolling guards darnad placed the first dart carefully in the blowpipe and took aim his aim was accurate the dart winged its way towards the guard i saw him clutch his neck and then fall almost soundlessly to the ground the next guardthere were four we needed to attend to in allsaw his comrade fall and rushed towards him we heard him lean over him and speak casually get up akar or the bradhi will have your head i told you not to drink so much before we went on guard i held my breath as darnad aimed another dart expelled it softlyand the second guard fell the third guard turned a corner and paused in astonishment on seeing the bodies of his fallen comrades hey whats this he would never fully know for darnads third dart took him in his naked shoulder the drug was quick the guard fell darnad grinned at mewe seemed near to success the fourth guard was disposed of even before he saw his fellows then the eight of us moved in catfooting it towards the guest rooms soon soon i thought all this would be over and we could return to varnal to live in peace i could study the sciences of the mysterious sheev in crease the inventions that the karnala would be able to use with my help the karnala need never fear attack again they had the basic technology necessary for building internal combustion engines electric power generators radiosi could accom plish all that for them those were the thoughtsinapt perhaps for the momentthat coursed through my brain as we crept towards the guest room windows the windows were not glazed only shuttered and one of these was drawn back luck seemed to be on our side that night cautiously i peered into the room it was richly furnished though somewhat vulgarly floors heaped with furs carved chests and benches in a bracket a torch flared illuminating the room it was empty i swung my leg over the low sill and entered the room as quietly as i could darnad and the others followed me then we all stood there staring at one another listening intently for some sound that might indi cate where the women were imprisoned it came at lasta low tone that could have been anything all we could be sure of was that it issued from a human throat it came from a room on our left darnad and i went towards the room with the warriors following we paused at the door which surprisingly was unbarred now from within came a sound that seemed like a soft laugha womans laugh but it could not be a laugh i must have misheard the next sound was a voice pitched low and impossible to make sense of darnad looked at me our eyes met and then with a concerted movement we flung open the door torchlight showed us the two within one was horguhl standing close to the window the other was shizalamy shizala shizala was bound hand and foot but horguhl was unfettered she stood with hands on hips smiling down at shizala who glared back at her horguhls smile froze when she saw us shizala gave a glad cry michael kane darnad oh thank zar you have come horguhl stood there expressionlessly saying nothing i stepped forward to untie shizala as i worked at her bonds i kept a suspicious eye on the vladnyar girl uncertain of her part in this was she or was she not a prisoner it did not seem likely now yet horguhl suddenly laughed in my face i finished untying shizalas bonds why do you laugh i asked i thought you were dead she replied not an swering my question and then she lifted her head and let out a piercing shriek silence darnad said in a fierce whisper you will alert the whole palace we intend you no harm i am sure you do not she said as darnad stepped towards her but i mean you harm my friends again she shrieked there was a disturbance outside in the corridor shizalas eyes glistened with tearsbut with gladness alsoas she stared up into my face oh michael kanesomehow i knew you would save me i thought they had killed youand yet no time for conversation i said brusquely try ing to hide the emotion that her closeness brought to my breast we must escape darnad had his hand over horguhls mouth he looked unhappy not used to treating a woman so horguhl is no prisoner shizala said she i can see that now i said comewe must hurry we turned and left the room darnad released his hold on horguhl and followed us but before we could reach the window a score of men led by the two argzoon giants and another who wore a bright circlet on his matted greasy hair burst into the room darnad myself and our six warriors turned to face them forming a barrier between them and shizala leave quickly shizala i said softly go to the house of belet vor i gave her brief instructions how to find the old man i cannot leave you i cannot you mustit will serve us better if we know you at least are safe please do as i say i was staring at the argzoon and the others waiting for them to attack they were moving in cautiously she seemed to understand my reasoning and it was with relief that i saw her from the corner of my eye clamber over the sill and disappear into the night horguhl emerged from the other room pointing an imperious finger at us her face was flushed with anger these men sought to abduct me and the other woman she said to the greasyhaired man who stood there with drawn sword sodid you not know he said addressing us with a leer that chinod sai values the safety of his guests and resents the intrusion of riffraff such as you riffraff murderer of children said darnad i know you upstartyou who calls himself bradhi of a collection of cutthroats and pilferers chinod sai sneered you speak bravelybut your words are hollow you are all about to die then he and his unholy allies were on us his guards supporting them the duel began i found myself fighting not only chinod sai but one of the argzoon and it was all i could do to de fend myself even though i knew i outmatched them both in swordsmanship however they tended to crowd each other and this at least was to my advantage i held them off as best i could until i saw my chance rapidly i flung my sword from my right hand to my left this foxed them for a second then i lunged at the argzoon who was slower than chinod sai and caught him in the breast he fell back groaning that left the selfstyled bradhi of narlet but seeing the great blue warrior fall chinod sai evidently lost his stomach for battle and backed away letting his hired guards take his place it was my turn to sneer one by one our own warriors went down until only darnad and myself were left standing i hardly cared if i died so long as shizala were safeand i knew that the wily old belet vor would see to thati was prepared to die but i did not die there were so many warriors pressing in towards us that we could hardly move our sword arms soon we were hot so much swordfighting as wrestling their weight of numbers was too great after a short time we were engulfed and for the second time in the space of a week i received a blow on the headand this second blow was not meant in kindness as the first had been my senses fled blackness engulfed me and i knew no more chapter nine buried alive i opened my eyes but saw nothing i smelt much my nostrils were assailed by a foul damp chilly smell that seemed to indicate i was somewhere be low ground i flexed my arms and legs they were unbound at least i tried to get up but bumped my head i could only crouch on the damp messy ground i was horrified had i been incarcerated in some tomb was i to die slowly of hunger or have my senses leave me with an effort i controlled my self then i heard a slight sound to my left cautiously i felt about me and my hand touched something warm someone groaned i had touched a limb it stirred then a voice murmured who is there where am i darnad yes it is michael kane we seem to be in some sort of dungeonwith a very low ceiling indeed what i heard darnad move and sit up per haps reaching with his hands above him no do you know the place i believe i have heard of it what is it the old heating system that sounds very innocuous whats that narlet is built on the ancient ruins of one of the sheev cities hardly anything of it exists save the foundations of one particular building those foundations now make up chinod sais foundations for his palace apparently the slabs forming the floor of the palace lie over an ancient sunken pool which could be filled with hot water and made to heat the ground floor of the palaceperhaps the whole of itby means of pipes from what i hear the sheev abandoned this particular city well be fore their decline for they later discovered better methods of heating and so we are buried under the floor of chinod sais palace ive heard it gives him pleasure to imprison his enemies herehaving them permanently at his feet as it were i did not laugh though i admired the fortitude of my friend in jesting at a time like this i put my hands up and felt the smooth damp slabs over my head pressing on them they did not budge if he can raise the slabs why cant we there are only a few loose ones ive heardbe let vor told me all thisand very heavy furniture is placed over those when prisoners have been in carcerated so we have been buried alive i said sup pressing a shudder of terror i admit that i was horrified i think any manno matter how brave would have been at the thought of such a fate yes darnads voice was a thin mutter it seemed that he too had no liking for what had happened to us at least we have saved shizala i reminded him belet vor will see that she returns safely to varnal yes the voice sounded slightly less strained silence for a while later i made up my mind if you will stay where you are darnad i said so that i may keep some sort of bearing i will ex plore our prison very well he agreed i had to crawl of coursethere was no other way i counted the number of paces as i moved across that horribly wet and foulsmelling floor by the time i had counted to sixtyone i had reached a wall i then began to crawl round this still counting something obstructed me i could not tell at first what it was thin objects like sticks i felt them carefully and then withdrew my hand suddenly as i realized what they were bones one of chinod sais earlier victims i encountered several more skeletons on my cir cuit of the walls from where i had started the first wall measured ninetyseven paces the second only fiftyfour the third was in all a hundred and twentysix i began to wonder why i was doing this save to keep my mind occupied the fourth wall one pace two three on the seventeenth pace along the fourth wall my hand touchednothing surely this could not be a means of escape by touch i discovered that some sort of circular hole led off from the fourth wallperhaps a pipe that had once brought water into the chamber it was just wide enough to take a man i put my head inside and reached my arms along it it was wet and slimy but nothing stopped me before i raised darnads hopes i decided to see whether the pipe really offered a chance of escape i squeezed my whole body into it and began to lever myself forward wriggling like a snake i began to feel elated when nothing obstructed me soon my whole body was in the pipe i wriggled on i hate being so confined normally but if the pipe meant escape it was worth suffering my claustrophobia but then came disappointment my questing hands found somethingand i knew at once what they touched it was another human skeleton evidently some other poor soulperhaps many had sought this means of escape and been disap pointedand not had the energy or inclination to return i sighed deeply and began to wriggle back down but as i did so i suddenly heard something from behind me i paused it was the sound of grating stone a little light filtered up the pipe and i heard someone chuckle i did not move i waited then came chinod sais jeering voice greet ings bradhinakhow are you enjoying your stay darnad did not reply come up come upi wish to show my men what a real bradhinak of the karnala looks like a little befouled perhapsi am sorry my accom modation is not quite what you are accustomed to id rather stay here than be subjected to your insults you scum darnad replied levelly and what of your friendthe strange one per haps he would like a little respite where is he i do not know you do not know but he was put down there with you do not lie boywhere is your compan ion i do not know the light increased probably because chinod sai was peering into his horrible crypt using a torch for illumination his voice rose querulously he must be down there darnads tone seemed lighter now you can see he is notunless one of these skeletons is his impossible guards i heard the faint sound of feet above me chinod sai continued take up some more of these stonessee if the other prisoner is hiding in a corner he is down here somewhere meanwhile bring up the karnala more sounds and i gathered that darnad had been escorted away then i heard the guards beginning to tear up other slabs and i grinned to myself hoping that they would not think of looking in the pipe then something occurred to me it was not a pleasant thought but it might save me and give me in turn a chance to save darnad i wriggled up the pipe again and reached up to take hold of some of the bones of the unfortunate who had been there before me he had not been lucky but even though dead some years he might be able to help me nowand help me avenge him if and when the opportunity came squeezing myself up against one section of the pipe as tightly as i could i began to pass bones down in front of me until quite a heap lay below my feet i did this as soundlessly as possible and any noise i did make was probably drowned by the racket the desperate guards were making pull ing up flagstones and crawling around in the semi darkness trying to find me he isnt here i heard one of them say you are a fool answered another he must be here well i tell you he isnt come and look for yourself another guard joined the first and i heard him stumbling around too i dont understandthere is no way out of here weve put enough of them down here one time or another heywhats this the guard had found the pipe the light in creased could he have gone up here if he did it wont do him any good its blocked at the other end then the guard found the bones ugh he didnt go up but someone else tried to these bones are old what are we going to tell the bradhi the first guard spoke nervously this smacks of magic theres no such thing so were told these days but my grandfather says there are stories shut your mouth magicghosts nonsense still i must admit that he had a strange look about him he seemed to belong to no nation ive ever seen and i have heard that beyond the ocean lies another land where men have powers greater than normal and then there are the sheev the sheev thats it hold your tongue chinod sai will tear it out if he hears such language spoken in his palace what do we tell him only the facts the man was herebut he is no longer here but will he believe us we must hope that he does i heard the guards clamber up and march away the instant they had gone i slipped down the pipe as fast as i could and was soon standing up in what had been my prison my head just above the level of the floor flagstones had been ripped out and the whole floor was in a mess i was glad of that at least no one was in the room which seemed to be some sort of throne room judging by the huge or nately carved preciousmetal gilded chair at one end i heaved myself up and stood in the room as swiftly and as silently as i could i ran towards the door and stood by it listening it was half open angry voices came from the other side there were more sounds coming from outside the palace itselfshouts cries they sounded angry somewhere in the distance several pairs of fists began to beat on a door then i stepped back as suddenly someone came into the room it was chinod sai he stared at me in horror for a moment that moment was all i needed in a flash i had darted forward and snatched his own sword from his belt i pressed the point gently against his throat and said with a grim smile on my lips call for your guards chinod saiand you call for death he paled and gurgled something i gestured for him to come into the room and shut the door i had been lucky everyone had been too busy with whatever else they were concerned with to notice what had happened to their bradhi speak in a low voice i ordered tell me what is happening and where my comrade is howhow did you escape i am asking the questions my friend nowan swer he grunted what do you mean answer the scum are attacking my palace he said some petty daharathief seeks to replace me i hope he makes a better chief than you and where is my comrade he waved a hand behind him in there suddenly someone entered i had expected the guards to knock and had intended that chinod sal should tell them not to enter but this was not a guard it was the surviving argzoon he looked aston ished to see me he turned giving a roar of warn ing to the men in the room they came in and i backed away looking around for a means of escape but all the windows in this room were barred kill him screamed chinod sai pointing a shaking finger at me kill him led by the blue argzoon the guards came at me i knew that i faced deaththey would not take me a prisoner a second time chapter ten into the caves of darkness somehow i managed to keep them at bay though i will never know how then i saw darnad appear behind them waving a sword he had got from somewhere together one on each side we took on chinod sai and his men but we knew we must be beaten eventually then there came a sudden elated roar and bursting into the throne room came a wild mob waving swords spears and halberds they were led by a goodlooking young man and by the gleam in his eyesat once calculating and triumphanti guessed him to be the next con tender for the paltry throne of the city of thieves now while the others helped darnad deal with the argzoon and the guards i concentrated on chinod sai this time i promised myself he would not retreat chinod sai realized my intention and this seemed to improve his skill back and forth across the broken floor of the throne room over the bones of the wretches he had incarcerated for his own perverted pleasure we fought lunging parrying thrusting the steel of our blades rang through the hall while to one side the mob fought a thick mass of struggling men then came disaster for meor so i thought i tripped over one of the flagstones and fell back wards into the pit i saw chinod sai raise his arm for the thrust that would finish me as sprawled out on the slime i stared up at him then as the sword came towards my heart i rolled away under part of the floor that was still intact i heard him curse and saw him drop down after me he saw me and lunged raising myself on my left arm i returned his lunge and caught him exactly in the heart i pushed home my thrust and he fell back with a groan i climbed from the pit a fitting burial place chinod sai i said lie with the bones of those you have slain so horribly you had a swifter death than you deserved i was just in time to see darnad dispose of the last argzoon the fight was over and the young leader of the mob raised his right hand high shouting chinod sai is defeatedthe tyrant dies the mob replied exultantly salute morda kohn bradhi of narlet morda kohn swung round and grinned at me enemies of chinod sai are friends of mine in directly you helped me gain the throne but where is chinod sai i pointed at the floor i slew him i said simply morda kohn laughed good good you are even more of a friend for that little service it was no service to you i said but something i had promised myself the pleasure of accomplish ing quite so i was truly sorry about the death of your friend my friend i said as darnad joined us he had a flesh wound on his right shoulder but otherwise seemed all right belet vordid you not know what has happened to belet vor darnad asked urgently i must admit i was not only thinking of belet vorbut of the girl i had sent to him shizala why that is what enabled me to arouse the people against chinod sai morda kohn said chinod sai and his blue friend learned that you had been seen in the house of belet vor they went there and they ordered him to be beheaded on the spot belet vor dead beheadedoh no darnads face turned pale with horror i am afraid so but the girl we rescuedthe one we sent to him i spoke in some trepidation almost afraid to hear the answer girl i do not knowi heard nothing of a girl perhaps she is still at his house hiding some where i relaxed that was probably true there is still another missing darnad said the vladnyar womanhorguhl where is she together we searched the palace but there was ho sign of her night was falling as we borrowed mounts from the new bradhi and rushed to belet vors house inside it had been torn apart we called shizalas name but she did not answer shizala had gonebut where and how we stumbled out of the house had we fought and risked so much only to fail now back to the palace to see if morda kohn could help us the new bradhi was supervising the replace ment of the flagstones they will be securely ce mented down he said they will never be put to the same dreadful use again morda kohn i said desperately the girl was not at belet vors house and we know she would hot have gone anywhere of her own accord did any of chinod sais guards survive if they did one of them may be able to tell us what hap pened i think there are several prisoners in the ante room morda kohn nodded question them if you like we went to the anteroom there were three sulking badly wounded prisoners do any of you know where shizala is i asked shizala one of them looked up with a frown the blonde girlthe prisoner who was here oh heri think they both went off together both her and the darkhaired woman where did they go whats it worth to tell you what i know the guard looked cunningly at me i will speak to morda kohn he owes us a fa vor i will ask him to show mercy to you youll keep your word of course i think they went to the mountains of argzoon ahbut why darnad broke in why should a vladnyar willingly go to argzoon the blue giants are noones friends there is something mysterious about horguhls association with the argzoon perhaps when we find her we will learn the answer i said could you lead us to the mountains of argzoon dar nad i think so he nodded come thenlets make haste after them with luck we may even catch them before they reach the mountains best that we did he said why because the argzoon literally dwell in the mountainsin the caves of darkness that run un der the range some say it is really the bleak world of the dead and from what ive heard its possible we spoke briefly to morda kohn telling him to show the guard mercy then we strode outside mounted our daharas and rode into the night heading for the dreadful caves of darkness we were not lucky first darnads beast cut its foot on a sharp rock and went lame we had to travel at walking pace for a full day until we came to a camp where we could exchange darnads prime mount for a rather stringy beast that looked as if it had little stamina then we lost our bearings on a barren plain known as the wilderness of sorrowand we could understand why anyone would feel sorrowful on encountering it on the other hand the mount that darnad had exchanged was in fact very strongand my own beast wearied before his did we finally crossed the wilderness of sorrow and emerged on the shores of an incredibly wide riverwider even than the mississippi another pause while we borrowed a boat from a friendly fisherman and managed to cross luckily darnad had a precious ring on his finger and was able to convert this into pearls which were the general currency of these parts we bought supplies in the riverside town and learnedto our relief for there had always been the chance that the guard was lying maliciously that two women answering to the description of horguhl and shizala had passed that way we enquired if shizala had seemed to be under re straint but our informant told us that she did not appear to be bound this was puzzling and we could not understand why shizala should seem to be travelling to the terrible domain of the argzoon of her own free will but as we told ourselves all this would be learned the quicker if we caught up with them they were still some three days ahead of us so we crossed the carzax river in the fisher mans boat ferrying our mounts and provisions with us it was a difficult task and the current drew us many miles down river before we reached the other side the fisherman would collect the boat later we pulled it ashore strapped our provisions to our animals and mounted it was forest land now but the trees were the strangest i had ever seen their trunks were not solid like the treetrunks on earth but consisted of many hundreds of slen der stems curling around one another to form trunks some thirty or forty feet in diameter on the other hand the trees did not reach very high but fanned out so that sometimes when passing through a particular grove of lowgrowing trees our heads actually stood out above the trees it made me feel gigantic also the foliage had a tinge similar to the ferns of the crimson plainthough red was only the main color there were also tints of blue green and yellow brown and orange it seemed in fact that the forest was in a perpetual state of autumn and i was pleased by the sight of it strange as the stumpy trees were they reminded me in some ob scure way of my boyhood had it not been for the object of our quest i would have liked to relax more and spend longer in that strange forest but there was something else in the forest that i was to meet shortlyand that decided me if noth ing else could have done on the necessity of mov ing on we had been travelling in the forest for two days when darnad suddenly pulled his mount up short and pointed silently through the foliage i could see nothing and shook my head in puz zlement darnads beast now seemed to move a little rest lessly and so did mine darnad began to turn his dahara pointing back the way we had come the peculiar apelike beast obeyed the guiding reins and my own followed suit rather quickly as if glad to be turning back then darnad stopped again and his hand fell to his sword too late he said and i should have warned you i see nothingi hear nothing what should you have warned me of the heela heelawhat is a heela that darnad pointed skulking towards us its hide exactly the same mottled shades as the foliage of the trees came a beast out of a nightmare it had eight legs and each leg terminated in six curved talons it had two heads and each head had a broad gaping mouth full of long razorlike teeth glaring yellow eyes flaring nostrils a single neck rose from the trunk and then divided near the top to accommodate the heads it had two tails scaly and powerfullooking and a barrelshaped body rippling with muscle it was unlike anything i could describe it could not existbut it did the heela stopped a few yards away and its twin tails lashed as it regarded us with its two pairs of eyes the only thing to its advantage as far as i could see was that it measured only about half the size of an ordinary dahara yet it still looked dangerous and could easily dis pose of me i knew then it sprang not at me and not at darnad but at the head of darnads dahara the poor animal shrieked in pain and fear as the heela sank its eight sets of talons into its great flat head and simply clung there biting with its two sets of teeth at the daharas spinal cord darnad began to hack at the heela with his sword i tried to move in to help him but my ani mal refused to budge i dismountedit was the only thing i could do and paused behind the clinging heelas back i did not know much about martian biology but i selected a spot on the heelas neck corresponding to the place where he was biting the dahara i knew that many animals will go for a spot on other species which corresponds with their own vital spots i plunged my sword in for a few moments the heela still clung to the daharas head then it released its grip and with a bloodcurdling scream of anguish and fury fell to the mossy ground i stood back ready to meet any attack it might make but it got up stood shakily on its legs took a couple of paces away from me and then fell dead meanwhile darnad had dismounted from the dahara now moaning in pain and stamping on the moss the poor beasts flesh had been ripped away from a considerable area of its head and neck it was beyond any help we could give itsave to put it out of its pain regretfully i saw darnad place his sword against the creatures head and drive it home wincing as he did so soon dahara and heela lay side by side a useless waste of life i reflected what was more we should now have to ride double and though my dahara was strong enough to carry both of us we should have to travel at about half our previous speed bad luck was dogging us it seemed riding double we left the heelainfested forest behind darnad informed me that we had been lucky to meet only one of the beasts since there had been others of its pack about apparently it was quite common amongst heelas for the leader to attack the victim first and if successful lead the rest in for the kill having tested the victims strength if on the other hand the heelaleader were killed then the pack would skulk off judging the enemy too strong to risk attacking besides which they would feed off their dead leaders corpse in this case the corpse of the dahara too it seemed that like hyaena the heelas were strong but cowardly i thanked providence for this trait at any rate now the air grew colderwe had been travelling for well over a monthand the skies darker we began to cross a vast plain of black mud and ob sidian rock stunted sinister shrubs and ancient ru ins the feet of our single dahara splashed in deep puddles or waded through oozing mud slipped on the glassy rock or stumbled over great areas of bro ken masonry i asked darnad if these were the ruins of the sheev but he muttered that he did not think so i suspect that these ruins were once inhabited by the yaksha he said i shivered as cold rain fell on us who were the yaksha it is said they are ancient enemies of the sheev but originally of the same race that is all you know those are the only facts the rest is superstition and speculation he seemed to shudder inwardly not from the cold but from some idea that had oc curred to him on we went making slower and slower progress over that dark wasteland taking shelter at night scarcely distinguishable though it was from dayunder halffallen walls or outcrops of rock strange livid beasts prowled that plain peculiar cries like the voices of lost souls queer distur bances that we felt rather than heard or saw it was like that for another two weeks until the looming crags of argzoon became visible through the dim misty light of the wastes of doom the mountains of argzoon were tall and jagged black and forbidding seeing their environment i said to darnad i can understand why the argzoon are what they are for such landscapes are not conducive to in stilling a sense of sweetness and light into one i agree he replied then a little later we should reach the gates of gor delpus before night fall what are they the entrance to the caves of darkness they are ive been told never guarded for few have ever dared venture into the argzoons own under ground landthey let our normal fear of dark en closed spaces do their work for them are the caves very dangerous i do not know he said no one has ever re turned to tell by nightfall we made out the gates by means of deimoss very dim moonlight they were mainly natural cavemouths widened and made taller by crude workmanship they were dark and gloomy and i could understand what darnad had told me only my missionto rescue the woman i loved but would never be able to make minewould in duce me to enter we left our faithful dahara outside to fend for himself until we returnedif ever we should and then we entered the caves of darkness chapter eleven queen of the argzoon they were cold those caves a chill pervaded them greater than anything we had experienced on the wastes of doom down and down we went along a smooth broad winding track that had torches lighting it at wide intervals we caught glimpses of vast grottos and caverns as it were within the great caverns of stalactites and stalagmites of jumbled black rock and rivulets of icecold water of a bittersmelling slime that clung to the rocks of small pallid ani mals that scuttled away at our approach and deeper down the sides of the path had been decorated with trophies of warhere a skeleton of an argzoon in full armor with sword shield spear and axe grinning down at us from its great height there several human skulls piled into a rough pyra mid dark trophies brought alive sometimes by the flickering torchlight but fitting decoration for this strange place then at length we felt the path turn sharply to the left following it round we suddenly came upon a monstrous cave its walls so far away they were invisible we stood above it looking down the path led to it we could see twisting down for perhaps two miles huge fires flared at intervals on the floor of the cave and there were complete vil lages dotted across it fairly close to our side of the cave there was a stone citya city that seemed piled on blocks of stone heaped almost haphaz ardly one upon the other a heavy city a cold strong bleak city a city to suit the argzoon moving about in the city and the surrounding villages we saw argzoon men women and chil dren going about their business there were also pens of dahara and some sort of small creature that seemed to be a domestic version of the heela how can we get in there i whispered to dar nad they will realize who we are immediately just then i heard a noise behind us and pulled him into the shadows of the rock a few moments later a group of some thirty argzoon warriors stumbled past they looked as if they had been through an ordeal many bore un treated wounds others had had their armor almost completely cut to shreds and all were weary i realized that these were probably survivors of the mopping up operation instituted from varnal the day we had left that was another reason why we should not ex pose ourselves the argzoon would enjoy taking vengeance on members of the race that had de feated them but these warriors were too tired even to notice us they just staggered on down the twisting path towards the cavern world where the great bonfires crackled and attempted to heat and light the place with little success we could not wait for nightfall here for it was perpetual night how could we reach the city and discover where shizala was imprisoned there was nothing for it but to begin creeping down the path keeping to the shadows as best we could hoping that the argzoon would be too busy with their own affairs treating their wounded as sessing their strength and so on to notice us not once did either of us think of returning to find help it seemed too late for that we must res cue shizala ourselves but then it occurred to me who else knew where shizala was held who else had all the information concerning the argzoon that we had the answer was plainnone when we had gone a little distance i turned to darnad and said bluntly you must go back go back are you mad noim perfectly sane for once dont you real ize that if we are both killed in this attempt then there can be no further attempts to save shizala for what we know will die with us i had not thought of that he mused but why should i go back you go i will try to no you know the geography of vashu better than i i might easily get lost now you have led me to the mountains of argzoon you must return to the nearest friendly settlement send messengers to tell where i am where shizala isget the news out as fast as you can then a big force of warriors can come here while the argzoon are still depleted and recovering and wipe out the threat of the blue giants once and for all but it will take me weeks to get back to civili zation of any sort if you get into trouble here you will be dead long before i can bring help if personal safety were our first consideration i reminded him neither of us would be here now you must see the logic of what i say go he thought deeply for a moment then clapped me on the shoulder turned and began to make his way rapidly back in the direction we had come once made up darnads mind made him act swiftly now i crept on feeling somehow even smaller and weaker in the face of monstrous nature now that darnad had gone somehow i managed to get to the base of the path without being seen somehow i managed to dash from cliffwall to the shadow of the city and hug myself close to the roughhewn stone and then all of a sudden it became darker i could not at first understand the cause of my good luck then i saw that they were damping down the big fires why then i realized what must be happening fuel itself must be scarce so for a period corresponding to nighttime on the surface the fires were damped while the argzoon slept in the almost pitchblack darkness i decided that this was my chance to ex plore the city and try to find out where shizala was imprisoned perhaps if luck continued to stay on my side i would even have a chance to rescue her and to gether we could leave the gloomy cavernworld of the argzoon and ride back to varnal i hardly dared consider this as i began slowly to climb the rough sides of the city wall it was a stiff climb but not too difficult both my hands and my feet had been hardened over the long weeks of our quest and so i found i could grip the rock like a gibraltar monkey the darkness brought its own dangers of course and i was forced to climb largely by touch but soon i was on top of the wall crouching sword in hand just in case i should be surprised i sidled along the wall peering down into the city trying to make out the likeliest place where shizala might be held then i saw it one building was fairly well illuminated by torches from within and brands on the ramparts but this is not what i noticed so much as the great brooding banner that flew from a mast on the cen tral keep of the building it was the naal banner that adorned horguhls tent oh the battlefield outsidea larger version but the same design it was little to go onbut it was something i would make for the building with the banner i resheathed my sword and clambered over the other side of the wall beginning to climb slowly down towards the ground i was nearly at the bottom with perhaps only a dozen feet to go when a detachment of argzoon warriors suddenly rounded a building near the wall and marched towards me i wondered if i had been seenwhether they had been sent to deal with me but then they began to pass beneath me i was only a couple of feet above the head of the tallest as he passed i clung like a fly to the wall praying that i would not slip and betray myself as soon as they were out of sight i climbed the remaining distance to the ground and dashed across to the cover of a building fashioned from the same roughlyheaped stone as the wall knowing that the argzoon warriors had not had many mounts i guessed that only a few had re turned as yet which explained why the city seemed virtually deserted this was another thing that i welcomed and which was to my advantage soon i had reached the building i was headed for the sides of this were somewhat smoother but i thought i could tackle it the only problem here was that the walls were fairly well illuminated and i might be seen there was nothing for it but to risk it for no other time would be better i would try to reach a window and swing myself in once inside the building i might be able to hide myself better and at least discover something by watching and lis tening of where shizala was being kept i got a hold on a piece of projecting stone and hauled myself up inch by inch it was slow going and increasingly difficult all the windowslittle more than holes in the rockwere some distance above the ground none less than twenty feet and the one i had decided to try was probably higher i deduced that fear of attack was the reason why the windows were positioned so high but at last i managed to make the window and peered over the sill to see if the room beyond was occupied it did not appear to be i entered quickly it appeared that i was in a storeroom of some kind for there were wicker baskets of dried fruit and meat herbs and vegetables i decided to make use of some of the food stuff obviously looted in an earlier raiding expedition i selected the most palatable items and ate them i was thirsty too but there was no readily available source of water i would have to wait for a drink feeling refreshed i explored the room it was fairly large and very draughty perhaps because of the draughts it had not been used as a living ac commodation for a long whilejudging by the old and nearrotted pieces of basket that littered the floor i found the door and tried it to my great disappointment it was locked barred from the outside probably as a precaution against thieves i was very weary and my eyes kept closing in voluntarily as i fought sleep the pursuit had been long and arduous we had allowed ourselves little time for rest i decided that i would be more use to shizala if i were rested i clambered over the baskets and made myself a kind of nest in the centre by removing some bas kets and piling them around me that way i would be warmer and if anyone entered the room they would not see me feeling fairly secure i lay down to sleep an increase in the glow of firelight entering the window told me that it was a new argzoon day but i realized immediately that was not what had awakened me there was someone else in the room very cautiously i stretched my cramped limbs and began to stand up peering through a crack in my barricade i was astonished the man collecting food from the baskets was not an argzoon he was a man similar in build to myself but with a pale complexionperhaps caused by living in the sunless vaults of the blue giants his face had a strange dead appearance his eyes were dull his features frozen as he mechani cally transferred meat and vegetables from the bas kets to a smaller basket he held in his left hand he was unarmed his shoulders were bowed his hair lank and uncared for there was no questioning his situation and func tion in the cavernworld of the argzoon the man was a slave and seemed to have been one for a long time being a slave he would of course have no love for his masters on the other hand how much had he been cowed by them could i reveal myself in the hope of receiving help from him or would he be frightened and shout for help i had taken many risks to get this far i must take a further risk now as silently as i could i climbed from cover and crept across the tops of the baskets towards him he was half turned away from me and only seemed to notice me when i was almost on top of him when he saw me his eyes widened and his mouth dropped but he made no sound i am a friend i whispered ffriend he repeated the word dully as if it meant nothing to him an enemy of the argzoona slayer of many of the blue giants aah he backed away in fear dropping his basket i leapt to the ground and dashed towards the door closing it he turned to face me his mouth trembling now his eyes still wide in ghastly fear it was evidently not me he feared so much as something that i represented to him yyou must go to the queenyyou must sur render yourself ddo that and yyou may escape the naal beast the queen the nall beast ive heard the namewhat is it ooh ddo not ask me who are you how long have you been here i tried a different line of questioning ii think my name was ornak dia yyes that was it that was my name i ddo not know hhow long ssince wwe ffollowed the argzoon hhere and wwere led into ambush th they had only sent half their strength against the lands of the southwe did nnot rrealize with these memories he seemed to remember something of the man he must have been previ ously for his shoulders straightened a little and he held his mouth better you were part of the force led by the bradhi of the karnalais that right i asked him i won dered what kind of hardships could have turned a warrior into this servile thing in such a compara tively short space of time ththat is right they lured you down here where the rest of their army was waitingit had been a calculated tacticand when you reached the floor of the cav ernworld they attacked you and wiped out your army isnt that what happened i had already guessed most of this of course yyes they took prisoners i am amongst the last of them left alive how many prisoners several hundreds i was horrified now it was plain that as i had surmised this move of the argzoon had been care fully planned for years the first force had been badly defeated but it had severely weakened the strength of the southern nations secondly the southern armys punitive force that had followed the argzoon here had been led into a carefully laid trap and the weary warriors must have been fairly easy game for a force of fresh argzoon warriors waiting in ambush then the argzoon had put the second half of their strategy into operation going secretly south in small numbers with the object of taking the south by surprise beginning with var nal something had disrupted this strategyper haps my slaying of their mastermindand the plan had broken down but much damage had been done the south would take years recovering from the blow and while recovering would face constant danger from other stronger wouldbe aggressors the vladnyar for instance now i asked the slave the leading question tell mehave two women been brought here recently a dark one and a fair one there hhas been a woman prisoner only one i prayed that shizala had not been killed on the way what does she look like she is very beautifulfairhaireda karnala woman i think i sighed with relief but what of horguhl the vladnyarthe darkhaired woman ah his voice was a muted scream do not mention ththat name do not mention it what is wrong i could see that he was in an even worse state now than when i had originally confronted him spittle ran down his chin and his eyes flickered crazily he was trembling in every part of his body he hugged himself hunched and twitching he began to moan slowly i seized his shoulder trying to shake some self control into him but he fell to the floor and contin ued to moan and tremble i knelt beside him tell mewho is horguhl what is her part in this ah ppleaseleave me i will not tell them you are here yyou must go lleave i continued to shake him tell me suddenly a new voice spoke from behind me a cool mocking voice full of controlled malicious humor leave the poor wretch alone michael kane i can answer your question better than he my guards mentioned a disturbance in the storeroom so i came to investigate myself i have been half expecting you i whirled still in a crouching position and looked up to stare into the deep evil eyes of the darkhaired woman whose role had been such a mystery it was to be a mystery no longer horguhl who are you i am queen of the argzoon michael kane it was i who commanded the army you defeated not poor ranak mard my army dispersed before i could recall it because that bitchdahara shizala at tacked me soon after you had left in the struggle she knocked me unconscious but she was then cap tured by some of my men when i awoke my army was in confusion so i decided to take ven geance on her instead of her city you all this was your doing but how are you queen of those giant savageswhat power can one woman wield over them it is my power over something else that they fear she smiled what is that you will learn soon enough blue giants were beginning to swarm into the room behind her seize him i tried to stand up but stumbled against the prone and shaking body of the slave before i could recover my position halfadozen argzoon were piling on top of me i fought back with fists and feet but soon they had bound my arms behind me and horguhl was laughing in my face her white sharp teeth flashing in the gloom and now she said you will learn the punish ment meted out to the man responsible for disrupt ing the plans of the queen of the argzoon chapter twelve the pit of the naal beast bring him to my chambers horguhl ordered the guards i will question him first i was forced to walk behind her following her through a maze of bleak and draughty corridors lit by guttering torches until we came to a large door apparently made of heavy wood covered with sil ver hammered into some crude semblance of a design this door was opened and the big room we en tered was warmed by a huge fire roaring in a grate at one side the room itself was rich with rugs of fur and heavy cloth covering the walls were tap estries obviously booty from raided cities for the workmanship was exquisite even the windows were covered and this explained the warmth of the room a heavy chest about the height of my waist stood near the fire on this stood jugs of wine and bowls of fruit and meat a large furstrewn couch was on the other side of the room opposite the fire and there were a few benches and carved wooden chairs dotted about though not particularly lavish by the standards of the civilized south the queens chambers were luxurious compared with what i had witnessed of the living standards of the argzoon peoples over the fireplace hung a tapestry much less well executed than the others it depicted the crea ture i had already seen on the queens bannerthe mysterious naal beast it looked menacing and i noticed the guards avert their eyes from it as if afraid of it i was still tightly bound of course and when horguhl dismissed the guards she was in no danger from me i stood straightbacked staring over her head as she paced before me darting me strange curious looks this went on for some time but i kept my expression blank and my eyes fixedly ahead suddenly she faced me swept back her right hand and slapped me stingingly across the mouth i kept my features rigid as before who are you michael kane i did not answer there is something about you something i have never sensed in any other man something i could learn toto like her voice became softer and she took a step closer to me i mean it michael kane she said your fate will not be pleasant if i order it to be carried out but you could avert it i still remained silent michael kanei am a woman aa sensitive woman she laughed lightly somewhat selfmock ingly i thought i am what i am through no cir cumstances of my own making would you like to hear why i am queen of the argzoon i would like to know where shizala is that is all i said at length where is she no harm has come to her yet perhaps none will i have thought out an interesting fate for her it will not kill her but it will help me turn her into a willing handmaiden i think iwould rather keep the ruler of varnal as my cringing slave than have her dead my mind raced so shizala was not to dieyet at any rate i was relieved for that would give time for darnad to come and try to rescue her i relaxed a littleperhaps i even smiled you seem in good humor do you not feel any thing for the woman then horguhl sounded al most eager why should i i lied that is good she said almost to herself she strode pantherlike to the couch and spread her beautiful body upon it i continued to stand where i was but looked directly into those smouldering eyes after a while she dropped her gaze staring at the floor she said i was only a child of eleven when the argzoon attacked the caravan in which i and my parents were travelling through the northern borders of vladnyar they killed manyincluding my mother and fatherbut took slaves as well i was one of those slaves i knew she was trying to touch me in some way and if her story were true i felt sorry for the child she had been but i could not considering her later crimes justify them in those days the argzoon were divided amongst themselves often the cavern was a battle field between warring factions they could not unite the argzoon were split into scores of family clans and bloodfeuds were normal daytoday happenings the only thing that could unite them for a short while was the common fear of the naal beast which haunted the subterranean passages be low the floor of the great cavern it fed on the argzoon who were its natural prey it would slither up and attack then slither away again the argzoon believe that the naal beast is an incarna tion of raharumara their chief deity they dared not make any attempt to kill it whenever possible they would sacrifice slaves to it when i was sixteen years old i was chosen as one of those who would feed the naal beast but already i had felt this power in mesome ability to make others do my will oh not in large waysi was still a slavebut in ways that made my lot a little easier strangely it was the naal beast which brought this power out of me in strength when news came that the naal was slithering up into the great cavern i and a number of oth ersfolk like myself and argzoon criminalswere bound and placed in its supposed path soon it ap peared and i watched in horrified dread as it be gan to seize my companions and swallow them i started to stare into its eyes some instinct made me croon at it ii dont know what it was but it responded to me through my mind i was able to communicate with it give it orders she paused and looked up at me i did not react i returned to this citythe black citywith the naal beast following me like a pet i ordered a deep hole to be made in which the beast was im prisoned the argzoon regarded me with supersti tious awethey still do by controlling the naal beast i control them later i decided to make up for my years of misery and hardship and planned conquest of this entire continent by several methods i got news of the south and her defences then i put the first stage of my plan into oper ation i was prepared to wait years for victorybut instead defeat i said a welldeserved defeat your years with the argzoon have warped you hor guhlwarped you beyond hope of salvation fool she was off the couch and pressing her voluptuous body against me stroking my chest fool i have other plansi am not defeated i know many secrets i have much power that you do not dream of michael kane you can share all this i told you i have never known a man like youbrave handsome strongwilled but you also have something elsesome mysterious quality that makes you as different from the ordinary riff raff of vashu as i am become my king michael kane she was speaking softly her hypnotic eyes star ing into mine and something seemed to be hap pening to my brain i felt warm euphoric i began to think her proposal was attractive michael kanei love you somehow that statement saved methough i will never know why it jerked my mind back to sanity bound as i was i shrugged her clinging hands away i do not love you horguhl i said firmly nei ther could i feel anything but loathing for someone who has done what you have done now i realize how shizala was so easily brought herethat hyp notic power of yours well it will not get the bet ter of me she released me and when she spoke again her voice was low vibrant somehow i knew that perhaps that is what attracts me to youthe fact that you can resist my power few others cannot even that primordial beast the naal i took several steps backwards i was still look ing around for some means of escape she seemed to realize this and looked up suddenly her face was now a mask of hatred very well michael kaneby refusing me you are accepting the fate i had planned for you guards the huge argzoon warriors entered take him send messengers to all the argzoon who have returned there are not many as yetbut tell them all to come tell them they are going to witness a sacrifice to raharumara with that i was led away i spent a short time with my guards when they paused in a chamber near the exit of the castle then they led me out through the smoky evil smelling streets of the black city behind us in twos and threes at first then in increasing num bers there began to follow a procession of argzoon one blue warrior who strode beside my guards keeping pace with me darted me a strange glance which i could not interpret the warrior did not wear armori assumed he had lost it during the flight back to the black cityand he had the signs of a recent wound on his breast then we were passing from the city and i forgot about him the scene beyond the city was like a mediaeval painting representing hell the great bonfires roared sending flickering smoky light across the rocky plain that was the cavern floor the giant argzoon looked like demons as they escorted me over the plain the fires were the fires on which the damned were roasted and i was soon to meet a creature very like an ancient representation of satan horguhl was already there standing on a dais that was reached by a flight of about sixty steps her back was turned to us and her arms were out stretched on either side of her were braziers flar ing brightly to show her to all the argzoon began to form a semicircle at the bottom of the steps and spread out along the sides of what was plainly a pit now that we were closer the steps termi nated at the dais and the dais looked down on the pit my guards halted and waited expectantly just before the first step we all looked up at horguhl she was crooning something the wordssounds rather for i did not recognize themsent a shud der through me and i noticed that many of the argzoon were similarly affected there came a peculiar slithering sound from the pit and from it just to one side of the dais i saw a great flat serpent head rise up and begin to sway in rhythm to horguhls crooning the argzoon muttered in superstitious fear and began to chant and sway in time to the movement of the serpent head it was of a sickly yellowish color with long fangs curving out of its mouth from the upper jaw there was a stale un wholesome smell about it and once it opened its great jaws and gave forth a horrid hissing re vealing a gaping red maw and a huge forked tongue then horguhls crooning became softer and softer the swaying more gentle the humming of the spectators almost inaudible and thenit came almost as a shock to meabsolute silence suddenly this silence was broken as from behind me there came a cry no no i turned my head and saw who it was that had cried out shizala i shouted involuntarily the fiends had brought her here to witness my deaththat was obvious even from that distance i could see her cheeks were streaked with tears and she struggled in the grasp of two massive blue warriors i tried to break away and run towards her but my bonds and my guards stopped me stay alive i shouted to her stay alive do not fear i could not tell her that darnad was even now riding for civilization bent on bringing help to rescue her but perhaps my cry would mean something to her stay alive her voice answered faintly oh michael kane ii silence horguhl had turned and was ad dressing her subjects as much as myself and shizala take the prisoner to the pits edge i was hustled forward and stared down to where the naal beast was coiled its oddly intelligent eyes stared up at meand i shuddered at thisal most with malicious humor the naal beast is in a playful mood today horguhl said from above me he will play with you for some time before devouring you i resolved to show no sign of the horror within me throw him down horguhl ordered bound and helpless i was thrown into the pit of the naal beast i managed to land on my feet some yards away from where the huge snakecreature still lay coiled looking at me with those terrible eyes and then suddenly from above i heard a cry and looked up an argzoon warrior was staring down at methe one i had seen earlier who had looked at me so strangely he had a sword in one hand and a battleaxe in the other what was he doing i heard horguhl shriek to her guards stop him and then the argzoon was leaping into the pit to stand beside me he raised his sword and i sud denly realized the truth of what was happening chapter thirteen an unexpected ally at first i had thought that the warrior was going to slay me himself for some obscure reason but this was not the case swiftly he slashed my bonds i know you i said in surprise you are the warrior i fought near varnal i am the warrior whose life you refused to takewhom you spared from the insults and swords of his comrades i have thought much on what you did michael kane i admired what you did it meant something to me and nowi can at least help you to fight for your life against this creature but i thought your folk feared it because of its supposed supernatural character true but i begin to doubt that this is true quicklytake this sword i have always been a better axeman than a swordsman with this unexpectedand welcomeally i turned to face the naal beast the beast seemed put out by this turn of events its gaze went from one to the other of us as though uncertain which one to attack first for we had spaced out nowboth crouching waiting the beasts great head suddenly whipped towards me i stumbled backwards until i stood against the wall desperately hacking at its snout with the great argzoon blade it was evidently unused to its victims retaliating and it hissed in apparently puzzled anger as my sword gashed a wound in its snout it drew back its head and began to uncoil so that soon the head had risen high above me and i was in its shadow down came the gaping maw and i thought it would take me in one gulp i raised the sword pointfirst and as the mouth was almost upon me the fetid breath almost overpow ering i dug the swordpoint into the beasts soft palate it screamed and threshed backwards mean while the argzoon warrior had come in and hacked at the beasts head with his axe it turned on him and the sweeping head caught him off bal ance he fell and the naal beast opened its mouth about to snap off his head then i saw my chance i leapt on to the naal beasts backon to its upper head and running over that flat head straddled it just above the eyes all this took only a few seconds as the argzoon below tried desperately to fend off the snapping jaws i raised my sword in both hands over the crea tures right eye i plunged the blade downwards the steel sank in the head jerked backwards and i was flungswordless nowfrom my perch the naal beast turned again towards me the sword still protruded from its eye so that it made an even more grotesque sight as it came at me the argzoon axeman leapt up again and came to stand by me evidently intending to protect me now that i was unarmed the beast let out a chilling reverberating scream and the gaping mouth forked tongue flick ering rapidly flashed down on us only inches before it reached us the head sud denly turned and flung itself upwards the beast uncoiled its whole length and began to shoot up so that i felt it would leave the pit altogether i caught a glimpse of spectators scatteringand then it flopped down almost striking us and finishing us by crushing us beneath its weight my sword had done the trick i had killed it it had clung on to life longer than anything should have i halfcredited its supernatural origin then i bent towards the great head and removed my sword it slid out easily then i realized that nothing was really saved i was still imprisoned and though armed there were some two hundred argzoon above us ready to destroy us at a word from horguhl what do we do i asked my new friend i know he said after some thought there is a small openinglook there at the base of the pit on the other side i followed his pointing finger he was right there was an opening large enough to take a man but not large enough for the head of the naal beast what is it i asked a tunnel that leads to the slave pens sometimes slaves are forced down it from the other side to feed the beast my new friend chuckled grimly it will feast no more on human flesh come fol low me we have slain the naal beastthat will impress them they will be even more impressed when they see we have vanished from the pens with luck we shall escape in the confusion i followed him into the tunnel as we moved along it he told me his name movat jard of the clan movattykone of the great argzoon clans in the old days before hor guhl had reorganized the argzoon nation he told me that though the argzoon feared horguhls power they were now muttering against her her ambitious schemes of largescale conquest had come to nothingand argzoon was decimated after some time the dark runnel became a little lighter and ahead i saw some sort of slatted grating it was of wood peering through it i saw a cavern lighted by a single torch lying about on the floor in attitudes of the ut most dejection closely packed like cattle naked and dirty bearded and pale were the remains of the great army that had been ambushed here ear lier some hundred and fifty undernourished spirit less slaves i felt pity for them movat jard was hacking at the wooden grille with his axe it soon fell and some of the slaves looked up in surprise as we entered the smell of humanity was almost too much to bear but i knew it was not their fault one fellow who held himself straighter than the rest and was as tall as i stepped forward he had a heavy beard which he had endeavoured to keep clean and his body rippled with muscle as if he had been deliberately keeping himself in training when he spoke his voice was deep and manly even dignified i am carnak he said simply what means this who are you and how came you here how did you evade the naal beast i did not only address him i addressed them all since they were all looking at us with something akin to hope in their eyes the naal beast is dead i announced we slew itthis is movat jard my friend an argzoon your friend impossible possibleand my life is witness to that i smiled at movat jard who made an attempt to smile back though when he bared his teeth he still looked menacing who are you asked the bearded man carnak i am a stranger herea stranger to your planet but i am here to help you would you be free of course he said a murmur of excitement ran round the cavern men began to get up a new liveliness in their manner you must be prepared to win such freedom dearly i told them from somewhere we must get weapons we cannot fight the whole argzoon nation carnak said in a low voice know i said but the whole argzoon nation is not here there are perhaps two hundred war riors in alland they are demoralized is this true really true carnak was grinning excitedly it is true i said but you are outnumbered as well as unarmed we must think carefullybut first we must escape from here that should not be difficult in our present mood replied carnak there are usually more guards but at present there are only two he pointed to the other entrance to the cave it was made of wickerwork that was all normally the cave beyond is thick with guards and all who have tried to escape that way have been cut down or forced back and sacrificed to the naal beast but now with movat jard close at my heels i strode to the door and immediately began hacking at it with my sword movat jard joined me using his axe the prison ers crowded eagerly behind us carnak well to the fore from the other side of the door we heard a grunt of surprise then an argzoon yelled ceaseor youll be food for the naal the naal is dead i replied you address the two who slew it we forced the door down it fell outwards and crashed to the floor revealing two baffledlooking guards their swords in their hands movat jard and i rushed at them instantly and had soon despatched them in as swift a series of strokes as i shall ever witness carnak bent down and took one of the swords from the fallen guard another man also took a sword and two others helped themselves to a mace and an axe respectively we must go to the weapon chambers of argzoon movat jard said once there we can equip ourselves properly where lie these dungeons i asked why under the black city there are several entrances and where lie the weapon chambers in the castlehorguhls castle if we are quick we can get there before they return to the city they must be in some confusion movat jard why do you help us against your own folk carnak asked he seemed just a little suspicious for he had already experienced one clever argzoon trap i have learned much from a little that michael kane here said and what he did once for me i have learned that ideas can sometimes rise above blood loyalties and besides it is horguhl whom i fight not the argzoon if we beat her then i shall have to decide again what my attitude isbut not until she no longer rules the argzoon carnak seemed convinced by this we rushed up the slopes leading away from the dungeons and had soon reached an iron gate kept by a single watchman when he saw us and noted perhaps the desperate looks in our eyes he did not draw his weapons but flung out his hands before him take my keysdo not take my me a fair bargain i said accepting his keys and unlocking the iron gate we will also borrow your weapons two more men were armed with a sword and an axemaking eight in all we bound the blue giant and passed on into the streets beyond the walls of the black city we heard the confused babble of voices but the argzoon had not yet reached the gates we headed towards the nearby castle pouring through the streets towards the weapon chambers with movat jard carnak and myself in the lead we swarmed into the castle cutting down the few guards who attempted to stop us just as we were breaking into the weapon chambers the first of the argzoon returned and shouted the alarm we burst into the weapon chambers less well laidout but not unlike the weapon room of var nal in appearance though the weapons were of course more barbaric while the joyful prisoners went to arm them selves with the best weapons of the argzoonnot to mention the heaps of captured weapons they found lying thereinwe eight who were already armed met the initial wave of argzoon warriors we must have made a strange sight the three of us who leda blue man of the argzoon nearly ten feet in height a wildeyed naked man covered in hair and a tanned swordsman who was not even of that planet but one thing we all had in common we could use swords we stood shoulder to shoulder fending off our attackers while our comrades armed themselves it seemed that i faced a veritable wall of swords rain ing down upon me from the blue giants somehow we held them offand succeeded in depleting our enemies then from behind us came a great roar the prisoners were all armed and ready to fight the slaves had become warriors againwarriors with a lust for vengeance for the years of servitude and fear revenge for the treacherous ambush which had wiped out a great percentage of the flower of southern manhood we pressed forward now driving the argzoon before us along the corridors of the castle we fought in halls and rooms we fought in horguhls deserted throne room we fought and in her private rooms too at one stage i took the opportunity to tear down the naal tapestry hanging there out into the streets until the whole of the black city seethed with fighting men our numbers were few our men had all but for gotten their old training but our hearts were full of exultant battlelust for at long last we were able to strike back at our old enemies by the time all our force was in the streets the argzoon had cut down more than a third of our menbut we had taken more of them and the longer we fought the more of their old skills the exslaves remembered the fighting in the city became more sporadic as the argzoon attempt ed to reform we used the pause to check our own strength and discuss strategy we held a large area around the castle but the argzoon still held most of the city somewhere were horguhl and shizala i prayed that horguhl would not order shizala slain in the pique of defeat that the queen still had confi dence in her warriors ability to win the argzoon attacked first but we were ready for them with warriors deployed in every street for a time neither side gained any advantage we held our position and the argzoon held theirs it is deadlock said movat jard as he carnak and i conferred how can we break it i asked we must get a fairly large party of warriors into position behind them carnak said then we can attack them from two sides and drive a wedge through their ranks a good plan i agreed but how can we move that party of warriors we cannot fly true movat jard said but we can go under them remember the slavepens remember that i said there were several entrances and exits yes i replied could we go through one of these and emerge behind the enemy unless they are ready for that trick he said we could but if they have blocked the entrances we stand to lose moresince we will have a force of good warriors stranded down there unable to help defend the area we have gained is it worth the risk yes i said for if we do not gain an ad vantage soon our men will tire they are already weak from the sojourn we cannot afford to waste any more time who will lead them carnak stepped forward evidently thinking of himself i will i said you are both needed here to rally the defenders they understood the necessity of this within a shati i was leading a force of some thirty warriors towards the slavepen entrance movat jard had indicated down the winding ramps we went at a loping run and we ran straight into a detachment of argzoon coming the other way almost before we knew it we were wasting time and men in a battle for the underground passage the argzoon seemed to be fighting with little will and i had killed two myself and disarmed several more before the rest lay down their arms holding out their hands in a gesture of surrender why do you give up so easily i asked one of them he answered in the coarse guttural accent of his people we are tired of fighting battles for horguhl he said and she does not lead us evenshe disap peared after you killed the naal beast we only followed her because we thought raharumara dwelt in the naal beast and she was stronger than raharumara but now we know that raharumara does not dwell in the naal beast else you could not have killed it we do not wish to lose our lives for her schemes any longertoo many of our broth ers have died over the years to satisfy her ambi tions now it has all come to thisa few warriors fighting in the streets of the black city defending themselves against slaves we wish a truce how many others feel as you do i asked i do not know he admitted we have not talkedtoo much has happened too swiftly you know the fairhaired girl horguhl brought here and who was at the ceremony of the naal beast earlier i questioned him i saw her yes do you know where she is i think she is in the tower of vulse where is that near the main gateit is the tallest tower in the city we took their arms from them and continued on through the slavepens emerging at last in a part of the city almost immediately behind the rear lines of the battling argzoon we attacked at once with cries of surprise the argzoon turned then we were locked in combat driving through their midst in an effort to link up with our comrades on the other side i myself was engaged with one of the largest argzoon i had encountered he was almost twelve feet high and fought with a long lance and a sword at one stage he flung the lance at me by chance i grabbed it in midair turned it and flung it back at him it caught him in the belly i fin ished him with my sword if it had not been for that lucky catch i doubt if i should have survived the encounter now i could see that we were almost linked with our fellows on the other side certain that the tactic had succeeded i left my men in charge of a darkskinned warrior who had shown skill and intelligence in the fighting and left the fray sheathing my sword i was running for the tower of vulse near the main gate here i hoped that i would at least find shizala and make myself responsible for her safety if i could do nothing else i saw the tower soon and noted that its entrance seemed unguarded but i saw something else something that sent a shock of surprise thrilling through me what i saw i thought impossiblesome trick of the light some illusion what i saw was an aircraft tethered near the top of the toweran aircraft similar to the one in which shizala and i had flown when we went to the camp of the argzoon how did it come to be there i reached the entrance of the tower and ran in side there i found a set of winding stone steps leading up and up there seemed to be no rooms in the lower part of the tower i began to run up the steps near the top of the tower i found a door it was unbarred and i flung it open i felt shock as i saw the two within the room one of them was shizala the other the other was telem fas ogdai bradhinak of mishim tep shizalas betrothed he had one arm around shizala and his other hand held a sword as he looked warily towards the door through which i had burst chapter fourteen sweet joy and bitter sorrow for a moment i confess that my emotion was one of dreadful disappointment rather than joy that shizala was safe in the arms of a protector i dropped my guard and smiled at telem fas ogdai greetings bradhinak i am glad to see that you have managed to keep the bradhinaka from dan ger how did you get here did you hear some thing of where we had gone in narlet perhaps or was darnad able to get word to you more swiftly than i had supposed telem fas ogdai smiled and shrugged does it matter i am here and shizala is safe that is the important thing i felt the answer rather unnecessarily oblique but accepted it michael kane shizala said i was sure you had been killed by now providence is on my side it seems i said try ing to hide the expression in my eyes which must have addedsave in the most important matter of my life i hear youve performed miracles of daring telem fas ogdai spoke somewhat ironically my dislike for him increased in spite of my effort to take an objective attitude to bin he was not help ing me providence again i said perhaps you will leave us for a moment telem fas ogdai said i would like to have some words with shizala in private i would not be boorish a second time i bowed slightly and went out of the room as the door closed i heard shizalas voice sud denly scream loudly it was too much in spite of my earlier encounter at the palace of varnal i could not control myself i sprang back into the room shizala was struggling in the grasp of a scowling telem fas ogdai he was trying to drag her towards the window to where his aircraft waited stop i ordered levelly she was sobbing michael kanehe i am sorry shizala but no matter what you think of me for it i will not stand by and see a brute handle a lady so telem fas ogdai laughed he had sheathed his sword but now he released shizala in order to draw it to my surprise she ran immediately to me he is a traitor she shouted telem fas ogdai was in league with horguhlthey planned to rule the continent together i could hardly believe my ears i drew my own blade he threatened to kill you unless i remained silent just now she went on ii did not want that telem fas ogdai chuckled remember your bond shizala you must still marry me when the world learns that you are a traitor i said she will not she shook her head no a bond of the kind we made goes higher than ordinary law he is right he will be exiled and i with him but that is a cruel law it is tradition she said simply it is a custom of our folk if tradition is ignored society will crumble we know that therefore the individual must sometimes suffer unjustly for the sake of the great law it was hard for me to argue against this i may be oldfashioned but i have great respect for tradi tion and custom as pillars of society suddenly telem fas ogdai laughed again a somewhat unhinged chuckle and lunged towards me i thrust shizala behind me and met his lunge with a swift parry back and forth across the room we fought i had never encountered such a skilled swordsman we were evenly matched save that i had earlier exert ed myself a great deal i began to feel that he must win and shizala would be condemned to spending her life with a traitor she hated soon i was actually retreating before a whirl wind of steel and found myself with my back not against the wallbut worsemy back was to the window a drop of a hundred feet was behind me i saw telem fas ogdai grin as he forced me fur ther back i became desperate from somewhere i called on extra reserves of energy in a last final desperate bid i hurled myself forward straight into that network of flashing steel i took him by surprise it saved my life and cost him his he stumbled backward for a moment i thrust rapidly at his throat the point met flesh and he fell with a great roar of baffled rage i knelt beside him as the life bubbled from him i could not save him we both knew he was going to die shizala came and knelt by him too why telem she said why did you do such a despicable thing he turned his eyes towards her speaking with difficulty it was an expedition i undertook in secret more than a year ago i thought i would try to discover what had happened to your father instead i was captured and brought to horguhl you were brave to attempt such a thing i said softly sheshe seduced me somehow he said she told me secretsdark secrets i became completely in her power i helped her plan the final stages of the attack on varnal i deliberately went to varnal at the time of the attack knowing that i would be asked to carry a message for help to mishim tep and your other allies he began to cough horribly then rallied himself ii could not help myself i expected you to be defeated but you were not your folk learned that i had not taken the message to mishim tepmmy father asked why i had not ii could not reply people talkedsoon it was common knowledge that i had betrayed varnal thoughthough none knew why it was that womanit is like a dreamii am a traitor and a foolsheshe he raised himself up then his eyes staring blankly out at nothing she is evil he cried she must be found and killed until she is all that we love and hold valu able on vashu will be in danger of corruption her secrets are terriblethey give her an awful power she must die and then he fell backdead where is horguhl shizala asked me i do not know i think she has escapedbut to where is a mystery this cavernworld is not fully known even to the argzoon do you think he exaggeratedthat his mind was clouded i think it possible i said and then quite suddenly she was in my arms sobbing and sobbing i held her close whispering words of comfort into her ear she had been through incredible hardships and terrors and had borne them all bravely i did not blame her for crying then oh michael kaneohmy love she sobbed i could scarcely believe my ears i felt that the days trials had turned my brain whwhat did you say i asked softly bewil dered she controlled her sobbing and looked up at me smiling through her tears i said my love she repeated michael kane i have loved you ever since we first met remember when the mizip chased you i laughed and she joined in but that is when i fell in love with you i gasped andi thought you loved telem fas ogdai i admired himthen she said but i could not love himparticularly after i had seen you but what could i do tradition had bound me to him and i could not break with tradition nor would i expect you to i said but now she put her arms around me and i drew her close now she breathed we are free to marry as soon as the betrothal day can be arranged i bent to kiss her and then realized that i was not yet sure how the battle had gone we must see how our men are dealing with the argzoon i said she knew nothing of what had happenedor at least little quickly i told her she smiled again and slipped her hand in mine i will not be parted from you again she said i knew i should have left her in the toweror better still in the aircraft where she would be safestbut i could not bear the thought of something else separating us the aircraft reminded me of the time we had flown to gether over the argzoon camp and i asked her why she had left the security of the ship did you not realize she asked as we moved down the steps hand in hand i wished to help youor die with you if that was to be but when i got there you had already done your work and gone i squeezed her hand affectionately and with gratitude i knew the rest from horguhl in the street we discovered that the argzoon were laying down their arms evidently losing all stomach for fighting now that they had learned their queen had fled towards us marching in excited triumph came a detachment of warriors headed by movat jard and carnak the exslave we waited to meet them and i felt suddenly weary as i realized that we had won and that i need do no more fighting that day tired as i felt my heart was bounding with gladness we had wonand shizala had promised to be mine i wished nothing else then suddenly carnak came rushing forward a smile on his lips and his hands outstretched shizala he cried shizalais it really you what are you doing here she looked puzzled not recognizing the bearded man i wondered if it was an old friend and hoped it might not be some previous fiance or someone who would shatter my happiness carnakyou know shizala i said in surprise know her carnak laughed heartily i should think i do carnak it was shizalas turn to laugh is that your name is it of course i watched with some jealousy i dont mind tell ing you as the older man took my shizala in his arms and then all was revealed in a single word father she cried oh father i thought you were dead so i would have been in a very short time had it not been for this young man with the strange sounding nameand this fierce savage his friend carnak cocked a thumb at movat jard shizala turned to me you saved my fathers life she hugged my arm oh michael kanethe house of varnal owes its very existence to you i smiled thank youif it did not exist i would be a very sad man carnak patted my shoulder what a cham pionive known none like him in all my daysand ive known some good warriors too you are a fine warrior yourself sir i said im not so bad young manbut i was never so good as you then he looked regretfully at his daughter and me i can see that you feelum some emotion for one another but you realize shizala that there is nothing you can do about it what i was almost beside myself with horror at this what new factor had arisen to become a barrier between my love and me carnak shook his head there is the matter of the bradhinak telem fas ogdai he he is dead i said i felt relief of course car nak knew nothing of what had happened recently quickly i told him he frowned as he listened i knew the lad was headstrongand i knew horguhl could use those eyes and that voice of hers to put anyone in her powerbut i never thought that the son of my oldest friend could he cleared his throat it was in a sense my faultfor he came to see if i still lived a prisoner with the intention of saving me carnakor the bradhi of varnal as he was shook his head we shall tell his father that he died on our behalf he decided as in an indirect sense he did he looked at us and smiled then you can an nounce your betrothal as soon as we return to var nal if that is what you wish it is what we wish we replied in unison smiling at one another it took only a short time to round up the rest of the demoralized argzoon and it was decided that we threecarnak shizala and myselfshould leave the black city in the charge of movat jard thus making the argzoons defeat less bitter we announced that movat jard was temporary ruler of the argzoon until some vote could be taken after a treaty had been drawn up realizing that the argzoon had been led to this situation by horguhls schemings we were not as hard on them as we might have been soon we were entering the aircraft bidding fare well for the moment to movat jard carnak took the controls of the ship and guided it through the difficult twists and turns of the tun nel leading to the open air soon we were passing over the wastes of doom over the stunted forests the wide river the wilder ness and the crimson plain the journey took many days but we spent it making plans for the future discussing all that had passed while we had been parted then soon we were hovering over varnal when the city discovered who we were it went mad with joy and we were received with great cer emony the betrothal was fixed for the following day and i went to my old room that night in a state of tremendous happiness but after all this came the bitterest blow of all it was as if fate had decided to make me go through all those trials simply to snatch away my reward at the final momentfor in the night i felt a strange familiar sensation come over me i felt my body seeming to break apart felt as if once again i was drawn across space and time at fantastic speed then it was over and i was lying down again i smiled thinking that it had been a dream i felt a light on my eyes and thought it must be morningthe morning of my betrothal i opened my eyes and looked into the smiling face of doctor loganmy chief assistant at the laboratories logan i gasped where am iwhat has hap pened i dont know professor he said your body is a mass of scarsbut youve put on extra muscle from somewhere how do you feel what has happened i repeated loudly you mean this end well it took us about seven hours but we finally picked you up again on some funny wavelengthwe thought wed lost you alto gether something went wrong with the transmit ter some jamming perhapsi dont know i got up and seized him by his lab coat youve got to send me back youve got to send me back heyyour experiences havent done you any good prof one of the technicians said youre lucky to be alive at all weve been working for seven hoursyou were as good as dead i still am i said my shoulders sagging i let go of logans coat and stood there looking at the equipment it had taken me to a place of high ad venture and a lovely womanand it had brought me back to this drab world i was hustled away to the sick bay and they wouldnt let me out for weeks what with the doc tors and psychologists trying to discover what had really happened to me i was judged unfit for work and theyd never let me get near the trans mitter of coursethough i tried several times fi nally they sent me to europeon extended leave and here i am epilogue and that substantially was the testament of pro fessor michael kane physicist and swordsman scientist on earth warrior on mars believe it as i believed it if you will do not be lieve it if you can after hearing kanes story i asked his permission to do two things he wanted to know what they were let me publish this remarkable story of yours i said so that the whole world might judge your sanity and truthfulness he shrugged i suspect few will make the cor rect judgment at least those few will be right very welland the other request that you let me finance a privately built matter transmitter can it be done yes i am after all the inventor of the machine it would require a great deal of money however i asked how much he told me it would make a large hold in my incomereally rather more than i could afford but i did not tell him that i was ready to back my faith in his story with a great deal of money now the transmitter is almost finished kane says he thinks he can tune it to the correct frequency we have worked like dogs for weeks to complete it and i hope he is right this machine is in some ways more sophisticated than the first one in that it is really a type of transceiver being permanently tuned on this special wave kanes idea is that if he can return to mars however many centuries in the past it lieshe will be able to build another machine there and thus travel back and forth at will that side of it seems perhaps a little too ambitious but i have de veloped a great respect for his scientific mind will it work i do not yet know as this manuscript goes to press we still have a week or so in which to test the machine perhaps soon i will have more to write about the warriors of mars i hope so
