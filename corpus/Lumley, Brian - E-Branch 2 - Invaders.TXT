storming trapped epilogue prologue in xanadu jethro manchester had built a pleasure dome in fact the pleasure dome casino but that was some time ago and since then manchesters fortunes had changed now both the casino and the mountain resort of xanadu belonged to another to aristotle milan and the new residentowners needs required that he make certain alterations the casino was a great dome of glass and chrome it was a threestorey affair a or fourstorey if one included a smaller dome which sat like a bubble or a raised blister on top of the main structure a that lorded its location at xanadus hub on a false plateau in a high dogleg fold of the australian macpherson range of mountains now it was night but still the work on mr milans alterations continued he wanted the work completed to his specifications before he reopened xanadu to the public in just a few days time and in his private accommodation in the high bubble dome milan himself supervised the last of the work or if not supervised at least he was there to see it finished to his satisfaction but milans presence a or more specifically the annoyance that accompanied it a wasnt to derek hinchs liking hinch was a painter and decorator but at times like this he tended to think of himself more as a steeplejack inside the bubble it wasnt so badthere wasnt very far to fall if he made the vttt classic mistake of stepping back a few paces to admire his work but outside some fifty or sixty feet off the ground that had been nerveracking and thank god he was done with it now but black painting perfectly good windows black both inside and out it didnt make a lot of sense to derek hinch and as for mr milan he didnt make much sense either the guy must be some kind of eccentric a nut case albeit a very rich powerful one the way he prowled through the glitzy false opulence of this place apparently lost in some indefinable distance in space and time though mainly lost in a world of his own the extravagance of his thoughts and his musichis bloody terrible interminable music there was a gleaming antique jukebox at one end of a small gently curving mahoganytopped bar on the perimeter of the bubble and when milan was taking it easy he would sit there in an armchair with a drink just listening to the musicthe same damn tunes or songs or just well music over and over again and it was driving hinch nuts too not that hinch didnt care for the stuff he liked a or he used to like and he would have continued to like a all of this stuff just fineif he hadnt been obliged to listen to each piece at least thirty or forty times in the space of just seven nights so thank god he was almost finished here but nights why in hell couldnt this work be done in daylight hours and why in hell couldnt milan sleep nights a like any other mad millionaire and why in doubledamned ml did he have to play his bloody music like this what was it that was playing now damn the tunes had kind of run together in hindis head he had heard them so often he knew what was coming next mr richforeignhandsomebloodybastard milan kept playing them in sequence in some kind of order of preference but it was the order of disorder totally out of order to hinchs way of thinking oh yes a now he remembered a zorbas dance that was it all bouzoukis fast drumbeats and anthony bloody quinn dancing on a beach a greek thing that was almost as much an antique as the machine that played it one of those tunes that never dies one which as far as hinch was concerned could die any time it fucking well liked and of course as the tune ended hinch knew the next item in the circular neverending repertoire and here it came yet again sunshine you may find my window but you wont find me some kind of blues with a country and western flavour and lyrics too deep for hinch to understandpleasing to listen to even soothing in a wayif you hadnt heard it half a dozen times already this very night some old black guy singing his heart out about misery but to hinchs mind the only misery lay in having to listen to it over and over again so you dont care for my music mr hinch the voice was deep yet oiled it seemed to rumble or purr yet was in no way catlike on the other hand milans movements were catlike as he came from the bar with a drink in his longfingered hand to gaze out on the night through an open window but if it wasnt painted black thered e no need to open the fucking thing not that theres anything to see out there while out loud he said er did i say something about your music i have a habit of talking to myself while im working it doesnt mean anything oh yes it fucking does it means that im pissed to death with you and your bloody music and with bloody kanadu and all of this bloody black paint he looked down on milan from a height of some twelve feet from a wheeled scaffolding tower where he had just put the finishing touches to the last pane of a high window and that was it the entire interior surface every square foot of hundreds of square feet of glass varnished for adhesion painted black and finally layered with polyurethane lacquer for durability a doubledyed bastard of a job perhaps i dont pay you enough said milan as hinch put down his roller wiped his hands came clambering down from on high the moneys fine the badtempered hinch said he stood six feet tall but still had to lift his head a fraction to look up at his employer and id like it now for im all done then if the payment is fine said milan it can only be that i was right and its the music or perhaps its me do you find my presence unsettling while he was speaking hinch had checked him out a again for aristotle milan was the kind of man you looked at twice at a guess hed be maybe forty fortyfive years old difficult to be more specific than that because his looks were sort of timeless he was probably sixty but toppedup with expensive monkey hormones or some such something was running through his veins keeping him young for sure spoiled rich bastard but foreign even without the name to give him away there could be no mistaking that italian with a touch of greek a but in any case a mongrel in hinchs eyes milans hair was black as night worn long it swept back from a high broad forehead and its shining ringlets curled on his shoulders and handsome he had the kind of mediterranean looks that seemed to appeal to a lot of women hinch would guess that his bedroom crawled with all kinds of young goodlooking dirty women his ears were fleshy a what could be seen of them a but he wore his sideboards thick and lacquered back to cover the upper extremities something odd about his nose too a flatfish look to it as if nature had pushed it back a little too far and his nostrils were too large and flaring and then those arcing eyebrows over deepsunken jetblack eyesthose eyes that were milans most startling feature jetblack and yet hinch couldnt be certain catch them at the right angle theyd sometimes gleam a golden feral yellow and despite the nose still those eyes loaned milan the looks of a bird of prey but handsome maybe hinch was all wrong about that it was simply the attraction of milans odd a his strange or foreign his almost alien a features that was all and as for mediterranean well that didnt seem quite right either not with the cold pallor of his flesh and the blood red of his lips he was something of a weird one this milan for sure something of an enigma an unknown or unspecified quantity payment when the job is done milan spoke again the rumble lower than ever which it isnt not quite not yet what hinch stared hard at him tried to look hard too a difficult with a man as sure of himself as milan or as sure of his filthy money but hinch reckoned that for all his lousy millions still milan would be a cinch in a fight hinch was a powerful brutal fighter the victor of a dozen roughhouse brawls and milan a he had the hands of a pianist fingers like a girl hw hinch would bet his life that milan had never felt a bunch of knuckles bouncing off that ugly nose of his and the thought never occurred to him that he had already bet his life cocking his head a little on one side milan looked at him curiously sighed and said first its my music and then its because youve had to work late into the night and nownow its personal to the point that you insult me and even measure your physical strength against mine like an opponentas if you could ever be an opponent or is it all just jealousy and suddenly it sank into hinchs less than enormous brain that while hed thought all of these things he hadnt actually voiced any of them a not even about the music was he that easy to read but he was tired of all this and so changing the subject he said whats that about the job not being finished i mean you wouldnt be trying to avoid paying me would you and the threat in his words the way he growled them was obvious not at all milan told him payment is most certainly very definitely due and you shall have it but out there a on the outside of the dome just a little to the left of this open window here a theres a spot you missed and i suffer from this affliction i cant deal with too much sunlight my eyes and my skin are vulnerable and so you see while sunshine may find my window it must never find me the work must be finished to my satisfaction that was our contract mr hinch god damn this weird bastard hinch thought as he paced to the window leaned out and looked to the left but god said milan from close behind your god mr hinch well if there is such a being and if his sphere of influence is as extensive as you suppose i think you may safely assume that he damned me a very long time ago eh said hinch looking back into the dome surprised by and wondering at the sudden change in milans tone of voice milan moved or flowed closer his slim fingers were strong where they came down on hindis hand trapping it on the window sill and leaning closer still with his face just inches away he smiled and hissed you dont much care for heights do you mr hinch in fact you care for them even less than you care for me or for my music what the bloody hinch looked into eyes that were no longer black or feral but uniformly red flaring like lamps bloody the other repeated him his voice a phlegmy gurgle now full of lust and his breath a hot coppery stench in hindis face ah yesssss but not your blood not this time mr hinch your blood is unworthy you are unworthy jesus christ hinch gasped choked tried to draw away and failed call on who or whatever you like milan continued to pin him to the window ledge and moved his free hand to the back of hinchs thick neck no one and nothing can help you now youre a fucking madman hinch jerked and wriggled but he couldnt pull free the others strength was unbelievable and youyou are nothing milan told him continuing to smile or at least doing something with his face hinch saw it but didnt believe it the way milans lips curled back and away from his elongating jaws the teeth curving up through his splitting gums his ridged convoluted nose flattening back while his nostrils gaped and sniffed and the red blood dripping from the corner of his mouth then milan freed hinchs hand in order to clench his fist and hit him in his ribs such a blow that hinch burly as he was was lifted from his feet at the same time milan hoisted him by the scruff of the neck and tilted him forward concerted movements designed to topple him into space and as the shrieking hinch flipped out into the night so the thing that looked like a man released him hinch fell but only for a moment then his shriek became a gasp as he came down on his belly and cracked ribs across the safety rail of a painters platform slung between twin gantries from above seven or eight feet to the open window hinch heard milans cursing and struggling to his feet inside the platform he looked up to see that hideous livid face looking down on him then moving like liquid lightning milan was up onto the window ledge and light as a feather came leaping to the bouncing rocking platform his intentions were unmistakable and as he landed hinch went to kick him in the groin milan caught his foot twisted it until the ankle broke then reached out with a long arm to grab the others throat and without pause lifting hinch bodily into the air he thrust him out beyond the rim of the safety rail a and let him fall as hinch fell a grasping at thin air and failing to catch it a he was aware that milan was speaking to him one last time but whether it was a physical voice he heard a chuckling whisper in his head or simply something imagined he couldnt have said and he certainly didnt have time to worry about it paid in fully the crazed voice whispered for your insults if not for your work so be it and below crashing down head first hinch was dead before the pain had time to register like an egg dropped on the floor the contents of his skull splattered at first but the grey was soon drowned in a thick nightdark pool that formed around his shattered head while up above that terrible face continued to smile down on himfor a little while until aristotle milans features melted part one back into a more acceptable form and he gave a careless shrug and grunted again so be it then he returned to listening to his music and no others thoughts to disturb him now in the solitude of a strange place in a strange land an unfortunate accident was how local newspapers would later report the matter they also reported milans generous offer to pay all of the funeral expenses and his very generous donation to derek hindis widow the how of it chapter one see the creechur it was hot as hell and flies the size of jake cutters little fingernails had been committing suicide on the vehicles windscreen for more than a hundred and fifty miles now ever since theyd left wiluna and civilization behind phew jake said sluicing sweat from his brow and out of the open window of their specially adapted land rover the top was back and the windows wound down yet the hot wind of passage that pushed their widebrimmed aussie hats back from their foreheads tightened their chinstraps around their throats and ruffled their shirts still made it feel like they were driving headlong into a bonfire and the road ahead a which in fact was scarcely better than a track a wavered like a smokeghost in the heat haze of what appeared to be an empty everexpanding distance behind the vehicle a milelong plume of dust and bluegrey exhaust fumes drifted low over the scrub and the wilderness thats your fifth phew liz merrick told him feeling talkative today so what am i supposed to say he didnt even glance at her though most men wouldnt have been able to resist it oh dear isnt it hot christ it must be ninety phew is about all im up to because if i do more than open my mouth a crack a ugh and he spat out yet another wet fly it liz squirmed and grimaced what the hell do they live on i wonder way out here i mean she swatted and missed as something small black and nasty went zipping by things die out here jake answered grimly maybe thats what they live on and just when she thought that was it that he was all done for now anyway the suns going down over the hills there another halfhour or so itll be cooler it wont get cold a not in this freaky weather a but at least youll be able to breathe without frying your lungs then he was done she turned her head to look at him more fully his angular face in profile his hard hands on the wheel his lean outline but if jake noticed her frowning curiously intent glance well it scarcely registered that was how he was hands off and she thought we make a damned odd couple she was right they did jake hard yet supple like whipcord and liz soft and curvy him with his dark background and currentcondition and liz with hera awhich was when they hit a pothole which simultaneously brought lizs mind back to earth while lifting her backside eight inches off her seat jake take it easy she gasped he nodded in no way apologetically almost absentmindedly he had turned his head to look at her a no liz corrected herself a to look beyond her westward where the rounded domes of gaunt yellow and redochre hills marched parallel with the road they were pitted those hills pockmarked even from here the same could be said of the desert all around including the socalled road these old mine workings jake growled gold mines that was subsidence back there where the road is sinking into some old mine i didnt see it because of this bloody heat haze gold squirming down into her seat liz tried to get comfortable again hah she thought as if id been comfortable in the first place they found a few nuggets here he told her there was a bit of a gold rush that didnt pan out there may be gold here a there probably is a but first you have to survive to bring it up out of the ground it just wasnt worth it because even without this awful el nino weather this was one hell of an inhospitable place to survive in she nodded right finally jake glanced at her a at her this time and while he was still looking she grinned nervously and said what a place to spend your honeymoon i should never have let you talk me into it a witticism of course huh was his reply shielding his eyes he switched his attention back to the rounded hills with the suns rim sitting on them like a golden pusfilled blister on the slumping hip of some gigantic reclining decomposing woman fuel gauge is low liz tapped on the gauge with a fingernail are we sure theres a gas station out here in fact she knew there was it was right there on the map it was just the awful heat the condition of the road evening setting in and a perfectly normal case of nerves lizs tended to fray a little from time to time as for jakeswell she wasnt entirely sure about his didnt even know if he had any gas station he glanced at her again sure there is to service the local community heck around these parts theres point nine persons per hundred square miles while jakes sarcasm dripped it wasnt directed entirely at liz but rather at their situation moreover she thought she detected an unfamiliar edge to his voice so perhaps he did have nerves after all but still his completely humourless attitude irritated her that many people really for a moment shed felt goaded into playing this insufferable man at his own gamebut only for a moment then shrugging she let it go so whats it doing here the gas station i mean its a relic of the gold rush he answered the australian government keeps such places going with subsidies or they simply couldnt exist theyre watering holes in the middle of nowhere way stations for the occasional wanderer dont expect too much though maybe a bottle of warm beer a make sure you tbkajn rt ijnvajjtks knock the cap off yourselfyes i know you know that a no food and if you need the loo youd better do it before we get there good advice around these parts the road vanished about a mile ahead an optical illusion just like the heat haze as the hills got higher so the road began to climb making everything seem on a level horizontal only the throb of the motor told the truth that the land rover was in fact labouring however slightly and in another minute they crested the rise then jake brought the vehicle to a halt and they both went off into the scrub fifty yards in different directions he got back first was leaning on his open door peering through binoculars and checking the way ahead when liz returned see anything she asked secretly admiring jake where he stood unselfconsciously posed with one booted foot on the door sill his jeans outlining a small backside and narrow hips but the rest of him wasnt small he was tall maybe sixtwo leggy and with long arms to match his hair was a deep brown like his eyes and his face was lean hollowcheeked he looked as if a good meal wouldnt hurtbut on the other hand extra weight would certainly slow him down his lips were thin even cruel and when he smiled you could never be sure there was any humour in it jakes hair was long as a lions he kept it swept back braided into a pigtail his jaw was angular thinly scarred on the left side and his nose had been broken high on the bridge so that it hung like a sheer cliff instead of projecting but despite his leanness jakes shoulders were broad and the sunbronzed flesh of his upper arms was corded with muscle his thighs too she imagined the gas station he answered sign at the roadside says old mine gas theres a track off to the right from the road to the pumpsor rather the pump what a dump another sign this side of the shack sayswhat he frowned well what liz asked says see the creature jake told her but its spelled creechur huh creechur he shook his head not much schooling around here she said then putting a hand to the left side of her face to shut out the last spears of sunlight from the west thats some kind of eyesight youve got even with binoculars the letters on those signs have to be tiny first requirement of a sniper he grunted that his eyesight is one hundred per cent but youre not a sniper or indeed any kind of killer any longer she told him a then caught her breath as she realized how wrong she might be except it was different now surely jake passed the binoculars looked at her but made no comment peering through the glasses she focused them to her own vision picked up the gas stations single forlorn pump and the shack standing a or leaning a behind it apparently built right into the rocky base of a knoll which itself bulged at the foot of a massive outcrop or butte the road wound around the ridgy shelved base of the outcrop and disappeared north and while she looked at the place jake looked at her that was okay because she didnt know he was looking she was a girl a no a woman a and a sight for sore eyes but jake cutter couldnt look at her that way there had em a woman and after her there couldnt be anything else not ever but if there could have beenmaybe it would have been someone like liz merrick she was maybe fiveseven willowwaisted and fully curved where it would matter to someone who mattered and to whom she mattered well and she did but not like that her hair black as night cut in a boyish bob wasnt natashas hair and her long legs werent natashas legs but lizs smilehe had to admit there was something in her smile something like a ray of bright light but one that jake wished hed never known a because he knew now how quickly a light can be switched off like natashas light not very appetizing liz commented breathing with difficulty through her mouth eh he came back to earth the dump as you called it the name says it all jake was equally adenoidal probably the entrance to an old mine hence old mine gas a great talent for the obvious she wanted to tell him but didnt sarcasm again covering for something else so what do you think she finally said as they got back into the rover good time not to think he answered and liz could only agree at least hed remembered what little hed been told so they tried not to think and continued not thinking as he started up the vehicle and let her coast the downhill quartermile to the old mine gas station lights of a sort came on as they turned off the road to climb a hardpacked ramp to the elevated shelf that fronted the shack the illuminated sign flickered and buzzed finally lit up in a desultory halfhearted neon glare grimy windows in the shack itself burned a dusty uncertain electrical yellow in an ancient river valley like this dry since prehistory it got dark very quickly even suddenly when the sun went down it also got cooler not cold by any means a not in this freakish el nino weather a but cooler after they pulled up at the lone pump jake helped liz shrug herself into a thin safari jacket took his own from the back of the rover and put it on in the west one shallow trough in the crest of the domed hills still held a golden glow but the light was rapidly fading and the amethyst draining from the sky squeezed out by the descending sepia of space to the east the first stars were already winking into being over blackly silhouetted mountains maybe twentyfive paces to the right of the main shack a lesser structure burrowed into the side of the steep knoll the see the creechur sign pointed in that direction liz wondered out loud what sort of creature do you reckon but now there was a figure standing in the shadow of the shacks suddenly open screen door and it was that figure that answered her well its a bloodywnnjy one i guarantee that much miss and then a chuckle as the owner of the deep gravelly voice stepped out into full view its a bit late in the day though so if ver want ter see im best take a torch with yer bloomin bulbs blown againor maybe e did it imself dont much care for the light that creechur feller now then what can i do fer you folks gas is it jake nodded and tilted his hat back gas fill her up ah the others gasp seemed genuine enough eh whats this then brits are yer a pair of whingein pommies way out ere now i asks yer what next he grinned shook his head just kiddin dont yer be takin no note o me folks to all appearances he was just a friendly old lad and entirely unaccustomed to company his rheumy little pinprick eyes long since abandoned to the wrinkles of a weathered face gazed at his customers over a bristly beard like that of some garrulous stagecoach driver in an ancient western as he took the cap off the land rovers tank his wobbly spindle legs seemed about ready to collapse under him and as if to make doubly sure hed said nothing out of turn er no offence meant he continued to mumble his apologies no offence taken liz gave a little laugh and jake had to admire her her steady giveawaynothing voice she quickly went on can we get a drink or something while youre filling her up its been a long and thirsty road and a way to go yet maybe a beer you do have beer right did yer ever meet up with an australian who didnt have a beer close ter hand the old man grinned again started the pump and handed the nozzle to jake then hobbled back and elp open the inner door to the shack for liz just you help yerself miss theyre all lined up on the shelves back o the bar there not a lot ter choose from though a fosters every one its my favourite and since im the one who drinks most of it its my choice too well good said liz its my favourite too jake watched them go inside frowned at the nozzle in his hand just like that hed accepted the bloody thing damn after thatbut it seemed it was going to take forever to satisfy the rovers greedy guzzling so jake quit when the tank was only threequarters full slammed the nozzle into the pumps housing tried not to look too concerned as he followed liz and the old boy into the shack but hed hated to lose contact with her lose sight of her like that even for a few seconds and shed looked back at him just before she passed from view her green eyes a fraction too narrow too anxious inside however it wasnt as bad as hed thought it would be or as it might have been it was the grime the blown dust of the desert clinging to the outside of the windows that had shut the light in and made the place seem so dim from outside but within a this might be typical of any outback filling station a million miles from nowhere that was jakes first impression the bar was a plank on two barrels with a bead curtain hanging from the plank to the floor in front and smaller barrels for seats liz was perched on one of them and the old man had passed her a beer that she held unopened in her hand she must have asked him if he was all alone out here and he was in the process of answering alone me naw not much and anyway i enjoys bein on me ownsome oh i got a couple o boys to elp out they aint ere right now is all it aint so bad actuly ad a truck through just a day or so ago a truck liz said all innocence and light out here and the old man nodded gawd knows where theyd be goin but for that matter where be you goin eh whatre yer doin out ere anyway having taken in much of the single room at a glance jake strode to the bar and asked for a beer without waiting for an answer from liz the old man reached for a bottle and turned to jake well now you was a mite quick he said yer just topped er up am i right i mean yerd never fill a big tank as quick as that right said jake accepting the beer he gave the bottle a quick shake forced the top off with a practised thumb then changing the subject as the warm beer foamed no cans he inquired he passed the bottle to liz took hers and repeated his trick with the same result the beer wasnt flat these bottles were old stock but they hadnt been opened previously and meanwhile cans i dont hold with em the oldster told him all this newfangled shite but yer can trust a bottle and turning to liz again you were sayin no she answered you were saying you asked what were doing out here well then he pressed she smiled can you keep a secret he shrugged his hunched shoulders sat down on a barrel on his side of the plank and chuckled and who do yer reckon id be tellin liz nodded we were visiting kin in wiluna decided to get married sort of quick so here we are run off where no one can find us eh honeymooners yer say run off on yer ownsome and left no forwardin address all out o touch secret an private in the gibson desert huh hell o a place fer a honeymoon i told him the very same thing liz nodded her agreement shaking an itoldyouso finger at jake and jake said anyway were headed north we thought wed take a look at the lakes anda lakes the old fellow cut in frowning yer visitin the lakes then with a knowing nod of his head he muttered big disappointment that oh jake lifted an eyebrow but the oldster only laughed out loud and slapped his thigh lake disappointment he guffawed way up north o here damn me they falls fer it every time he sobered up said lakes eh somethin ter see is it huh plenty o mud and salt but thats about all iq and wildlife liz protested oh aye that too he said anyway what would i know or care i ave me own wildlife after all the creature jake swigged on his beer ims the one the old boy nodded yer wanna see im jake had done with studying the oldster but he would certainly like to take a closer look at this shack a or what lay behind it or maybe beneath it liz could feel his curiosity no matter how hard he tried to keep it from the old boy moreover she knew that between them they must check this place out and so decided to do her bit create a diversion as best she could and anyway the old man didnt seem much of a threat id like to see him she said i mean whats the mystery what kind of creature is it anyway or is it just a con a some mangy diseased dingo crawled in out of the desert a to pull in a few more travellers and to her partner though she knew he wouldnt take her up on it what about you jake you want to come and see this thing jake shook his head took another pull at his bottle not me liz ive a thirst to slake but if you want to have a look at some mangy dog well go right ahead almost choking on the words he got them out somehow damn it to hellathe idea was supposed to be that they didnt get split up he hoped she knew what she was doing there again shed been in this game longer than he had and that pissed jake more than a little too the fact that liz was in effect the boss here torch said the old boy taking a heavy rubberjacketed flashlight from the shelf and handing it to liz yer need it i keeps im in out o the sun which would surely fry is eyes but its dark in the back o the shack there and this time o evenin even darker in is cage when she looked uncertain didnt move he cocked his head on one side and said er yer just follers the signs is all liz looked at him hefted the torch said you want me to go alone cant very well get lost he said but then grumblingly he hobbled out from behind the makeshift bar its these old pins o mine he said see they dont much like ter go but yer right a cant let a little lady go wanderin about in the dark on er own so just you foller me miss just you foller old bruce and then they were gone jake took a small pager out of his pocket and switched it on now if liz got in trouble she only had to press the button on her own beeper and he would know itand vice versa for in this game it was just as likely that he would be the one to make a wrong move those were his thoughts as he stepped silently behind the bar and passed through a second bead curtain hanging from the timbered ceiling to the floor and as easily and as quickly as that he was into a horizontal mineshaft and almost as quickly into something far less mundane liz had followed the old man along the foot of the knoll to the lesser shack that leaned into an almost sheer cliff face it was quite dark now and the torch hed given her wasnt nearly working on full charge the batteries must be just about dead of course knowing the place as he did that wouldnt much concern the old boy but it concerned liz and despite that she followed slowly and carefully in old bruces footsteps a mainly to give jake the time he needed to look the place over a still she stumbled once or twice over large rocks or into this that or the other pothole but in truth much of her stumbling was a ploy too so that it was perhaps a good thing after all that the torch was almost spent she thought so at the outset anyway until eventually here we are the old man said turning a key in a squealing lock and opening an exterior screen door beyond that a second door stood ajar and as old bruce if that really was his name reached out an incredibly long arm to one side of liz to push it fully open a at the same time managing to bundle her inside a so she recognized the smell of a lair it was a primal thing something that lies deep in the ancestral memories of every human being to be able to recognize the habitat of a dangerous animal or animals the musty feral smell of a cavern where something dwells a or perhaps an attic where bats have hibernated for untold years a or maybe the reptile house in a zoo but there are smells and smells and this wasnt like anything liz had ever come across before or perhaps it was simply the tainted composite smell of all of them until suddenly she realized that it wasnt just a smell a wasnt simply a smell a but her talent coming into play and that the stench wasnt in her nostrils alone but also in her mind and then she had to wonder about its origin the focus or point of emanation of this alien taint was it the shack a or the steelbarred walltowall cell it contained a or perhaps the nightblack tunnel beyond the bars with its as yet unseen unknown creechuror could it possibly be old brace himself there came a sound from the darker depths of the horizontal mine shaft and just as there are smells and smells so are there sounds and sounds liz gasped aimed her torchbeam into the darkness back there and saw movement a flowing gathering approaching darkness in the lesser dark around an inkblot of a figure taking on shape as it came bobbing wafting on a draft of poisonous air from wherever and whatever lay beyond and it had luminous yellow eyes a slanted as a beasts and yet intelligent notquiteferal a that held her fixed like a rabbit in a headlights beam but only for a moment thena you liz transferred the torch to her left hand dipped her right hand into a pocket and came out with a modified baby browning used her thumb to release the safety and aimed it at the old manor at the empty space where he had been while from outside in the night she heard the grating of his booted feet his now obscene chuckle and the squeal of a key turning in the exterior screen doors lock as he shut her in hell but this could quite literally be hell along with her talent a held back far too long by her desire not to alert anyone or anything to her real purpose here a lizs worst fears were now fully mobilized realized she knew what the creechur in the mineshaft was knew what it could do but even now she wasnt entirely helpless tucking the torch under her arm she found her beeper and pressed its alarm buttonat the precise moment that it commenced transmitting jakes own cry for help the shock of hearing that rapid beep beep beeping from her pocket almost made liz drop the torch she somehow managed to hold on to it held her hands together pointed the gun and the torch both through the inchthick bars of the cage but as the weak beam swept the bars it picked out something that she hadnt previously noticed there had been little enough time to notice anything the cage had a door fastened with a chain and stout padlock a but the padlock hung on the inside the other side where it dangled from the hoop of its loose shackle she knew what she must do reach through the bars drive home the shackle to close the padlock a twohanded job again she put the torch under her arm fumbled the gun back into her pocket then in the crawling tingling living semidarkness liz thrust her trembling hands between the barsand all of the time she was aware of the thing advancing towards her its slanted sulphurous eyes alive on herand the beeper issuing its urgent staccato mayday like a small terrified animaland on top of all this the sudden nightmarish notion but what if this thing has the key to the padlock at that moment it was liz merrick who felt like some small terrified trapped animal a but a human animal while the thing striding silently ever closer to her along the shaft was anything but human though it might have been not so long ago it was almost upon her she smelled the hot stench of its breath chapter two dark denizens liz had squeezed her eyes shut in a desperate effort to locate the padlock now she opened them and it was there it was there its face caught in the upwardslanting beam of yellow light from the torch in her armpit looked down on her and ahhh it a or he the creechur a sighed a girl no a woooman and a fresh one how very good to meet you here how veryprovident am and as simply as that his cold cold hands took the padlock from hers freed it from the chains and let it fall with a clank to the dirt floor meanwhile jake cutter had proceeded maybe a hundred yards down the gradually sloping shaft deep into the earth the shaft was quite obviously the entrance to an old mine the walls and roof were timbered and there were sleepers and rusty narrowgauge rails in the fairly uneven floor in places there was some evidence of past caveins where holes in the ceiling and boulders on the floor told their own story since the surviving supports seemed stout enough jake wasnt worried for his safety in that respect but in one other respect he was and he kept finding himself wishing that right now he wasnt somewhere but rather someone else a despite that he would usually prefer not to be all very confusing and paradoxical but it was something which had only ever happened twice and then in the most extreme of circumstances and for the time being jake was only jake cutter such were his thoughts when the narrow but adequate beam of his pencilslim pocket torch picked out the first of several side tunnels shafts that radiated off from the main the original mineshaft until now the floor had borne a thick coating of dust and sand much of which had settled against the walls towards the centre however and between the rails most of this had been scuffed away presumably by the recent passage of several or many persons but persons going where of course the old proprietor might be using this place as a warehouse or stock room indeed back where the shaft opened into the shack that fronted the mine jake had passed a jumble of old crates and cardboard boxes and labels on the latter had declared their contents as wiper blades fuses various grades of motor oil spark plugs and spare parts and vehicle accessories in general naturally he would have expected as much that close to the entrance but all these signs of recent disturbance a or of occupation a all this way back here why would anyone want to come back here except perhaps on exploratory forays maybe someone who was curious about old mine shafts but recently and how many someones it was beginning to look like this might be the place in which case he and liz should never have split up and gone their own ways oh he knew why shed done it all right but now now what was that jake froze the side shafts werent recent diggings they were probably old exploratory digs from the days when prospectors sought an ultimately elusive mother lode certainly quartz was present in the walls where the subsidiary tunnels had been hewn or blasted from the rock it was here too that the scuff marks on the floor a in places actual footprints a were most in evidence and it was from the first of these lesser branching diggings that the sound had issued a sound like a sigh or a yawn like someone waking up jake knew that by now it would be night in the valley in the gibson desert dark in the outside world but not nearly as dark as it was in here and liz was back there somewhere alone with the old man or maybe not alone and hadnt his orstrylian accent been a little too thick and hadnt there been something a maybe just a trace a of the gypsy about him jesus jake was now aware of fumbling movements from the side tunnels a from more than one of them a and was immediately galvanized to action but at a time and in a place such as this there was only one action he could take flight behind him the main tunnel curved however slightly back towards the entrance setting off at a loping run jake played his torch beam on the ceiling in order to avoid the jagged ends of dangling timbers in a number of places where pressured beams had popped and as he went he felt for his pager making ready to send out his distress call not that he felt panicked or in immediate danger himself but liz might well be if she wasnt already aware of the danger the beeper would give her advance warning he wouldnt use it just yet though because to do so would be to alert whoever she was with that he was on his way perhaps precipitating some undesired activity in a matter of twenty seconds or so when he was in sight of the beadcurtained rear entrance to the shack jake skidded to a halt a figure momentarily silhouetted by the light from the shack had appeared on the other side of the curtain jake recognized it as that of the old proprietor switching off his torch he flattened himself to the wall behind a support beam took out his mm browning and soundlessly armed it and none too soon grumbling to himself in his fashion the old man came on through the curtains and made straight for jake there was no other way he could go but as he blotted out some of the light from the shack so jake noticed that his movements werent any longer those of an old man he came on at a sprightly almost youthful lope and his previously dim eyes were no longer hidden in wrinkled folds instead they were a glowing feral yellow and in their cores burned red as fire jake needed no further warning or convincing he now knew for a certainty what this place was if not exactly what he was up against going into a professional shooting stance he took careful aim and squeezed the trigger but the other had seen or sensed jake in the moment that he fired seeming to flow to one side he moved closer to the wall jake knew hed missed and got off a second shot the bullet whined where it ricochetted from the shafts wall hurling sparks and splinters of rock at the old mans face and neck he jerked at the impact of the stony fragments then stood up straighter and stepped out into full view and putting up a hand to his neck under the ear he glanced at it almost curiously and said blood that was all blood but his voice was no longer old and his furnace eyes had turned uniformly crimson knowing he couldnt afford to miss a third time jake moved forward behind him there was real activity now voices calling out wailing questions and the sounds of stumbling feet and lead is it said that low growling dangerous voice as the distance narrowed between them oh ha ha ha then come on son fire away for as youll discover ive something of an appetite for lead how about silver jake said squeezing the trigger again his words were pure bravado for he was by no means sure of himself but it was a nice line and perhaps in that last second the vampire sensed that his opponent had the advantage whichever he once more caused himself to relocate used that weird flowing motion to move to one side but not quickly and not far enough the silver bullet hit him in the right shoulder spun him around and slammed his back against the wall with a gurgling cry of ah ah he clawed at his shoulder and fell to his right knee and jake leaped around him to carry on headlong through the bead curtains taking them with him in a jangling tangle maybe he should have stayed to finish the job certainly he would have if he had been that someone else a or half of someone else a but despite the danger jake was still only jake cutter he hadnt yet reached that point of uttermost desperation free of the curtains he crashed through the makeshift bar and sent the plank flying from its barrel supports and without pause he rushed out into the night wheeling left to go sprinting towards the second shack that was where the alleged creechur was and jake could scarcely doubt but that was where he would find liz toowhere the lying scheming undead proprietor of this terrible place had left her as he went so he reached into his pocket to activate his pager the things cold hands on lizs handsthe beeper continuing to issue its endlessly repeating mayday and this thing from her worst nightmares smiling at her through the stout iron bars but bars that might as well be of paper because the door in the cage stood ajar the creature freed her right hand pushed at the door liz stood frozen she let him get that far a but in the next moment was shaken from her paralysis on hearing jakes shout of liz liz where in hell are you he was dead right that was exactly where she was but she guessed he already knew that all was total darkness now all bar the glow of her monstrous adversarys eyes offbalance as the door swung squealingly open on her carrying her with it still liz managed to snatch the baby browning from her pocket ramming it between the bars she gritted her teeth and fired gah said that shuddersome voice sounding mildly surprised and as the thing released his hold on her she slammed the door shut again on its rusty hinges and on him turned and groped fumblingly towards the inner door to the shack she came across it found the doorknob and yanked it open but the creature was behind her she could feel its hot fetid breath on her neck its oppressive strength gathering in the darkness then liz came jakes voice again hed heard her shot came to a halt beyond the locked screen door she heard him cursing rattling the lock until stand back he called out she should stand back when right behind her something was rumbling urgh a ah a argh even now and christ liz said quickly turning and firing again and then a third time until the grotesque black shadow of the creature was lifted from its feet and hurled bodily away flailing its arms and spitting blood back into the shacks more natural shadows a where it collided with yet more shadows that liz hadnt been aware of until now her shot had come simultaneously with jakes as he blew the lock off the outer door and a moment later she was out of the place stumbling into his arms he steadied her breathlessly told her this place this is it its what we were looking for do you think i dont rucking know that she gasped and then they were running both of them heading for the rover for safety and for sanity but as yet safety and especially sanity seemed a long way off behind them the smaller shack was spewing stumbling dazedseeming zombielike figures into the night a handful of them four or five at least while ahead of them god almighty jake breathed with difficulty the moon was up a waxing moon that gave good light likewise the stars very bright in a sky that was now black as jet and banded with varying degrees of purple on the hills and so by moon and starlight the pair saw what waited for them close to their vehicle were in it up to here liz panted choked and god i cant breathe me neither jake told her but dont panic and keep the plugs in this isnt over yet our beepers will have been heard by the others theyll be on their way wewe cant run forever she answered veering away with him towards the track back to the road how we get to the rover with those damned things waiting for us split up jake answered you head for the roadkeep running like hell northill try to lead the bulk of these bloody monsters on a wild goose chase behind them the vampires were taking it easy they werent running they ambled arms hanging loose some with their hands in their pockets eyes aglow kicking pebbles aside as they followed their intended prey there was no great hurry a nowhere out here to hide that couldnt be sniffed out the girl would be easier to handle when she was tired they wouldnt have to damage her in order to have her one by one a or maybe two or three at a time a before they had her blood as for the man his blood would be good strong but hed caused bruce trennier no small amount of pain and bruce would be wanting him first oh this one would be missing an arm or leg or both before bruce gave him up to the rest of them and the wouldbe lord trennier would wax fat on meat and marrow while the hole in his shoulder slowly but surely healed but silver came trenniers voice in their minds where they tracked the humans across the false plateau at the foot of the knoll these people are more than they appear to be their indicts are silver which could mean danger for some of us in the short term and for all of us in the long which in turn means i have to talk to them question them so be sure to take them alive and do it quickly there was pain in his mental voice quite a lot of it butsilver bullets that took something of the arrogance out of the pursuit while the rest of trenniers sending served to speed it up liz had almost reached the top of the ramp cut from the side of the plateau the ramp would take her down to the road but one of her pursuers had somehow managed to flank her was drawing ahead he would get there first and the way was simply too narrow to avoid him she cut right heading for where shed last seen jake meanwhile someone a or something a back at the shack had started up the land rover its lights came on cutting a bright swath through the darkness as it bumped over the rough terrain whoever was at the wheel liz guessed hed be looking for jake since hiding or disguising her talent was no longer of benefit finally she opened her mind to seek her partners thoughts and perhaps discover his whereabouts liz couldnt send could only receive but she knew that other minds a and especially enhanced vampire minds a might be able to detect her presence if not read her thoughts this was a result of the germ of telepathy that was present in a majority of them thus vampires were frequently spotters indeed the best of them could smell out an entirely human being in much the same way as could a great hound but what the hellthey already knew she was here jakes mind was immediately accessible fuck he was thinking oh jesus theyve got the vehicle theyre after me and yet even now there was very little of any real panic in him hed been in too many tight spots before but do it liz tried to send to will him into action do it now for cods sake he couldnt hear her of course not but surely the other jake that other facet would have to emerge now well apparently not and behind liz her pursuers footfalls sounded loud and clear as did the clatter of pebbles squirting out from under his pounding feet she put on speed took in great gulping draughts of air through her mouth headed in the rough direction of jakes thoughts where they had led her to believe he was jake too was feeling stressed but obviously insufficiently as yet the nose plugs were killing him but hed been warned about the dangers of removing them all well and good but his throat was raw from drinking in dry dustladen air and since hed probably been splashed with blood it seemed likely he was already contaminated god how he could use a beer now even a warm one a except he probably wouldnt have time to drink it the rover was on his tail right behind him when jake saw a flattopped boulder he spun to one side and the vehicle skidded and threw up a cloud of dust as its driver hauled the wheel over jake knew that if he had failed to get out of the way the rover would have hit him not hard enough to kill him maybe but hard enough to put him out of business certainly this big boulder was his only chance leaping onto the rim of the rock he scrambled to its flat surface as the land rover came to a halt there were two men in the vehicle he could think of them as men anyway one seemed a little dazed he must be a recent convert recruit or thrall but the other the driverthat one wore a grin like satan himself a lieutenant jake couldnt even even hazard a guess this was jakes first time in at the fucking deep end the driver was out of the vehicle in a flash ducking and disappearing beneath the rim of the boulder before jake could get a bead on him the other was slower and jakes first shot hit him in the head well who or whatever he was he wouldnt be getting back up on his feet again as for jake even with his record still he felt sick knowing that hed killed another man except this one hadnt been a man not any longer but the sight of the vampires head exploding like that a the red wet spray and whatever other colours there had been a just so much black slop in the moonlight and then jake asked himself what moonlight a cloud just one damn cloud in an otherwise clear night sky had drifted across the moons threequarters grimace just as quickly as that the night was black as pitch and the rovers headlight beams were pointing the wrong way darkness favours the vampire and jake knew he must make his move now there was room for just two short paces along the flat surface of the boulder jake took them lifted his feet and hurled himself up and outwards towards the rover his arms stretched forward for balance but even as he cleared the boulders rim a powerful arm and hand shot up grabbed his left foot jakes impetus carried him forward his balledup body turning like a pendulum at the end of that ohsostrong arm and when he hit all the wind was knocked out of him he felt his nose plugs eject trailing streamers of gritty snot as his browning flew from momentarily nerveless fingers then that nightmare figure was standing over him leering down at him going to one knee and reaching for his throat with long mantrap hands thats it the thing that had been a man said the fun and games are over friend well yours are for sure with which he drew jake effortlessly to his feet but yours first said a small but resolute female voice the moonlight came back and jake saw the vampires yellow eyes go wide as liz stepped closer the monster snarled and turned his awful head towards her the muzzle of lizs tiny weapon was almost in his astonished gaping mouth when she pulled the trigger in that same moment jake turned his face away but in any case the debris went the other way therover liz was pale as a ghost stumbling in the moonlight that picked out her softly feminine curves she managed to run a few paces but jake caught up with her at the vehicle and almost threw her into the passenger seat he had seen a handful of silent flameeyed figures approaching from the direction of the shack they were the most immediate problem obviously but as yet jake wasnt aware of the lone pursuer tracking liz she knew she hadnt lost him however and continued to urge jake lets go lets g seat belts he snapped its going to be bumpy then the engine was roaring the gears grinding the land rover kicking up dirt as it wheeled for the service road which was when lizs lone pursuer came aboard he came from the side came vaulting into the rear seats in the moment before jake picked up speed and off balance he staggered there his eyes like hot coals in the night jake and liz had seen him liz twisted her body tried to fire her baby browning pointblank and heard the click as the firingpin fell on a dud the vampire grinned and reached for her and jake cursed changed down and floored the accelerator in the back the vampire was taken by surprise and thrown off balance again if only for a moment then falling to his knees on the back seat he leaned forward put his head between theirs grinned first at liz then at jake a before taking the backs of their necks one in each hand which was exactly what jake had hoped he would do and hang on jake yelled and literally stood on the brakes mercifully liz had seen it coming she leaned to the right even as jake leaned left and the loathsome thing gurgled eh what but the explanation was already forthcoming as he flew between them he released their necks tried to bring his hands forward to protect his face didnt even nearly make it with his arms forming a v behind him he hurtled forward and smashed face first through the windshield godawful a damn a thing jake choked slamming the rover into first and crunching forward over something that was trying to stand up they heard its body grinding and thumping mangled between the rovers underside and the stony rubble of the terrain then my god liz gasped i think we might actually make it never doubted it her partner told her lying for all he was worth just as they turned onto the service track and headed for the ramp a light commenced flashing on the dash radio liz said reaching under the dash to grab a hidden mike thumbing the transmit button she said hunter one for zero what kept you this is zero one a gravelly voice answered in a stutter of static to match the sudden throb of a choppers rotors is that you mobile down there and a searchlight beam swept down from above jake leaned over and spat into the speaker only fucking just zero a trask is that you a we could use some help do you have a target if its behind us and its moving its a target jake said i straightening up in time to avoid a pothole and as the adrenalin began to recede and his skin stopped prickling he eased up a little so as not to send the land rover nosediving off the rim of the ramp then liz said stop stop stop the vehicle i want to see feeling bloodthirsty jake looked at her frowning as he cautiously applied the brakes not me she shook her head shuddered her relief as she thumbed her nostrils one after the other to blow out her plugs then she halfturned her head inclined it to indicate the dark shelf of rock that theyd left behind and not them not after this and now her voice was a sigh they looked up and back first at a sleek black dragonfly shape under the gleaming blur of its fan a shape that blotted the stars in its passing and turned the night to a whirling dervish dustdevil with its downdraught as it sped overhead then at the torpedoshapes that tumbled lazily end over end down from its belly like so many elongated eggs jesus jakes sigh matched lizs and let there be light she said and there was light the napalm hit a little way back from the top of the ramp it lit up a widening path all the way back to the knoll roared with the thunder of its allconsuming passion washed the wall of the outcrop like a tsunami of fire in the space of a few short seconds the scene might well have been that in the caldera of an active volcano a small mountain burned in the night with manmade lava flowing down its flanks for long moments there were running leaping screaming figures in the roiling smoke blackly silhouetted against terrible balls of fire that seemed to roll across the shelf of the rocky outcrop with lives of their own the spidery figures were thereand they were gone cindered rolled under the unit was made up of two choppers a giant support truck and various smaller vehicles mainly rovers the truck and lesser vehicles wouldnt get here for some time yet they had miles of rough road to cover the choppers landed on the shelf itself one to the north and the other to the south in half an hour their combatsuited gasmasked heavilyarmed special forces crews were moving forward into the scorched zone meanwhile jake and liz had joined up with ben trask in charge of operations also with lan goodly his ic and a civilian peter miller of australias rudall river national park administration a or mister miller as he insisted on being called obviously miller hadnt been told too much which was perfectly understandable it was all on a needtoknow basis and when ebranch went out into the world it was standard procedure to avoid unnecessary rumourmongering and the panic that might ensue miller was small round and bouncy as a rubber ball he was very excitable and utterly confused and like many another small insignificant man in a position of assumed authority he made a lot of noise right now he raved on at the tall unflappable beanpole that was lan goodly who kept steering him away from ben trask so that trask could talk to liz and jake but still millers yappy littledog voice could be heard over just about everything else that was going on right now he was flapping his arms yelping about this uttermost devastation damn it all mr goodly i know that this is a wasteland a useless desert region that you cant damage any worse than nature herself has butthere were men in that blaze i saw men burning in those hellfires what was that stuff napalm but in any case what does it matter what happened here tonight was sheer murder there is no other word for it ii still cant believe what i witnessed herecoldblooded murder goodly and someone will be called to answer for it in fact i demand an answer right here and now who is he liz asked and trask frowned hes supposed to be our local liaison officer for the western deserts region a handful of top men in the aussie government know what were doing just how important our work is even so they couldnt simply let us loose give us carte blanche to get on with things we were obliged to accept an observer but that doesnt make him one of us and ive managed to keep him out of itwell until tonight even now i dont intend to waste time with him on long explanations what were doing is impossible to explain anyway a not if we expect to be believed but whether we want miller or not weve got him and maybe the best way to keep him quiet will be to let him see for himself something of whats going on well hes seen it jake growled but he isnt quiet he hasnt seen everything trasks face was grim and to liz what do you reckon knowing what he meant she opened her mind gazed intently through the smoke of the remaining fires at the burning shacks where they slumped in the lee of the knoll and as lines of concentration formed on her brow she said the worst of them a the old man bruce trennier a is still alive alive afraid and angry hes still very dangerous very clever too despite that he tries to hide his thoughts maybe because of it i know hes there his a what mindsmog a is as thick as the mist on a swamp and it stinks a lot worse hes the boss but he isnt alone back where the fire couldnt reach in the depths of the old mine theres a handful of others theyre waiting for us trask nodded well lets not keep them he said his lips twisting in a cold cruel grimace and his eyes lighting with a vengeful fire of their own and mr miller he called for the small and smallminded official if you will please accompany me i hope to be able to answer some of your questions chapter three firestorm looking at ben trask jake cutter found himself wondering what it was about the man he knew some of it a that trask was the head of a british secret service organization called ebranch based in london but with many other branches affiliations and powerful friends throughout the world a but not everything by any means one thing seemed certain however ben trask was a driven man moreover jake thought it likely that whatever was driving him was the same thing that caused him to look so much older than his years not that trask was young in fact he could be anything between fiftyfive and sixty years old but while his mousey hair was streaked with white his skin pale and his aspect in general aged and maybe even fragile still the man inside the mind soul and personality a the id itself a was diamondhard jake sensed this and felt a certain empathy for trask felt that he knew him despite that the man had only recently become a factor in his life but one hell of a factor for his height of about fiveten trask was maybe a couple of pounds overweight his broad shoulders slumped just a little his arms tended to dangle and his expression was usually well lugubrious or maybe that too was as a result ofof what his loss for that was the impression you got if you caught him unawares the feeling that something had gone out of him leaving him downcast empty his green eyes strangely vacant or far away his face drawn and his mouth turned down at the corners as if hed suffered a loss too great to bear and jake thought he knew something of how that felt on the other hand if what little jake had been told about trask were true then he might well be misjudging him trasks pain could have its origin in something else entirely for in a world where the simple truth was becoming increasingly hard to find it would be no easy thing to possess a mind that couldnt accept a lie and that allegedly was what trask was a human liedetector ebranch e for esp telepaths empaths locators precogspsychos thats how jake had thought of them just five days ago as raving lunatics no as very quiet lunatics for nary a one of them had actually raved but that was five days ago and in between hed seen some stuff and anyway who was he to talk what jake cutter who went on instantaneous hundredmilelong sleepwalking tours in broad daylight and suspected that someone was hiding in his head all of these thoughts passing through jakes mind as he and liz followed trask goodly and miller a who in turn followed a team of four armedtotheteeth special agents a between the stinking fires and towards the slumping blazing ruin that had been the main shack the lone pump had disappeared now a column of shimmering blue fire roared its fury at the sky as fuel from the subterranean storage tank burned off and as trasks party advanced on the shack so miller went prattling on do you think there can ever really be an answer to this mr trask good lord man but who gave you the authority to do such as this i meana look and his hand flew to his mouth a bbbodyhe stammered for gods sake a cindered body in the lee of a clump of hiphigh boulders where the blackened smoking skeletons of cactuses and other oncehardy plants oozed bubbling sap the cleanup squad had missed something it was an arm and a hand protruding from the molten mess of vegetation like a root among all the other exposed roots obviously someone had tried to escape the fire by diving for cover in the foliageany port in a firestorm or rather it lad been an arm and a hand now it was a smoking black twigthing with four lesser twiglets and the remains of an opposing thumb yet even now it was twitching vibrating showing signs of impossible life and the vile soup within the nest of rocks was heaving and bubbling you there a you missed something trask called out and one of the specialists came back with his flamethrower playing its bright yellow lance on the shuddering mess until it seethed into a black liquid slop in the meantime miller had been sick trask looked unemotionally at the little fat man where he stood trembling holding a handkerchief to his mouth and said best if you stay here and to liz and jake you two keep mr miller company but make sure he gets a good look at it ifif anything happens he turned away moved off with lan goodly both of them were equipped with viciouslooking machinepistols oh my god miller moaned hanging halfsuspended between jake and liz swaying from side to side oh my good god doesnt the man have a heart i mean doesnt he feel anything for these poor pppeople ben trask is all heart liz told him and yes he feels a great deal for people for every man woman and child of us for our entire a and entirely human a race thats why were here because these creatures arent human not any longer but miller was bending over being sick again and jake had got behind him was holding on to make sure he didnt fall face down in it the fires were burning lower now and the night was creeping in again long shadows danced like demons turning the barren rock ledge into a scene from dantes inferno near the main shack the column of flame from the underground tank shrank down into itself issued a final muffled blast and then became a fireball that rolled like a living thing up the face of the cliff along the foot of the knoll a second halfteam of agents had killed the fire at the shack with the cage and gone inside to explore the secondary mine shaft while fifty feet away from the main shack a which continued to burn sending a column of smoke and the occasional lick of red and orange fire into the night sky a trask brought his team to a halt how about it he shouted at goodly over the crackle of burning brush and scorched timbers what do you think do we burn him out not him them liz wanted to yell but goodly was already doing it for her theres more than just him ben the precogs piping voice carried on gusts of hot smoke but we can handle them trask seemed undeterred goodly shrugged and said im not forecasting any casualties if thats what you mean but it wont be very pretty it never is trask told him he came to a decision nodded turned and called for liz tell them were going to bring the whole damn place down around their earsand tell him he isnt getting out alive i want you to taunt the bastard butdo you think that hell hear me liz seemed dubious unsure of herself i mean im only half a telepath i can receive but not send anda we cant be sure about that trask cut her off thats one of the things were here to find out but we know your talent isnt fully developed yet and just because you cant send to a human telepath doesnt mean trennier wont hear you hes in there a vampire and these things have skills of their own maybe this will give us some indication of what to expect from you when your talent is fully developed liz gave an answering nod moved forward and miller stood up a little straighter and asked jake whowho is he talking about and how can that girl talk to someone in there just take it for granted she can jake answered despite that he wasnt too sure himself and now liz was concentrating concentrating sending her thoughts into the main shaft its entrance a smoking black hole glimpsed beyond the skeletal facade of the shack there were no true telepaths on the team this time out no one to hear her or even suspect that she was at work but her thoughts a which werent intended for the minds of common men a went out anyway were coming for you eruce trennier she sent and if you think that what youve seen so far is hot stuff wait till you see how hot it can really oet we have grenades that will bring the roof down on you and your thralls burying you forever like fossils in the earth and thermite bombs to melt the rocks into permanent cocoons for your molten bones youre trapped and no way out so stay right where you are hiding your face from the sun and do your best to enjoy what little you have left of the rotten parasitic halflife you call existence it was of course a taunt a challenge and coming from a woman would be seen as even more of an insult if trennier answered liz didnt hear him what she did hear or more properly feel was a sudden silence a mental silence a psychic serenity or was it more properly a sullen silence the calm before the storm lan goodly confirmed that last with his piped warning theyre coming how many as the combatsuited men fanned out a little trask swung his uglylooking weapon up into the ready position and cocked it goodly followed suit narrowing his eyes as his mind read the futures secrets he saw men staggering crumpling to their knees bursting into flames three of them and he saw one othera more than a man an animal a thinga leaping headlong to the attack and three of them he yelped on their way to hell and one other who looks like he was born there thatll be bruce trennier and ben theyre coming now are they armed trask snapped no goodly piped butdo they need to be the first three came like moonshadows dark and fleeting seeming to flow with the wreathing smoke out of the shack and into the open so that trask and goodly could scarcely be sure what they were firing at a but they fired anyway and in a matter of moments the scene became chaotic the nightmarish figures firmed into being as lethal silver bullets found their targets they had been loping flowing forwards with their arms and hands reaching but now were brought up short in the stutter of gunfire snapped upright and hurled backwards the feral yellow eyes of the central figure turned red as blood a overflowed with blood a in the instant that the back of his head exploded in a crimson spray he slumped went to his knees and burst into flames as the agent with the flamethrower found the range and licked him with a tongue of cleansing fire there on his knees with his head half blown away the vampire burned like a giant candle but astonishingly the other thralls recovered and came on and driving them with the sheer force of his presence flowing like a vast inkblot immediately behind them came the last and the worst of them their master the two in front were trenniers shieldshe cared nothing for them or their undead existencehis leech was intent on only one thing its own survival and for the leech to survive its host must survive too but ben trask had other ideas lan their legs he was shouting you men aim at their legs a smash their bones a cut the bastards down he kept firing his machinepistol a stammering jerking mad thing in his hands goodlys too as he followed his leaders example likewise from the flanks a stream of gunfire that turned the night to an uproar as the weapons of the squad spat silver death yet still the three came on they seemed to float drifting forwards in that dreadful dreamlike kaleidoscopic or strobing stopmotion manner of the vampire it was hypnotic it appeared to be slowmotion but in fact was lightning fasti and now they were only thirty to forty feet away at which trask gave a nod to one of his men on the right flank and down he shouted as the man armed and lobbed a grenade jake was young and fast and his military training came in handy liz had already thrown herself flat when he took miller off his feet covering him with his own body then the brilliant flash and a bang that echoed back from the valley walls the entire squad was on the deck cordite stench came drifting and with it the mewling of something utterly alien take looked up saw trask getting to his feet and offering his hand to goodly but in front of the wrecked smouldering shack the scene was unbelievable one crumpled figure a hump of broken flesh shuddered and steamed in the flickering firelight another was sitting there just a trunk with no arms smoke curled from his hair his yellow eyes were dim rolling vacantly in their orbits but trennier was still on his feet and jake thought this is the old man bruce a pitiful wreck of a man was what we saw but this was the reality with his clothing in rags bloodspattered his awful face sliced open to the bone still trennier stumbled forward crying out his agony he came on hands like claws reaching blood spurting from his gums as his jaws cracked open and open and open his eyes were scarlethis great ears curved and scalloped like the wings of a batand those teeth scything up through his riven gums the man with the flamethrower was on the ground his weapon lay where hed let it fall trask grabbed it up and still trennier came on weaving towards liz reaching for her where shed managed to get to her knees you the thing rumbled spitting blood he seemed dazed his flickering forked tongue licked tattered lips finally his eyes focussed and he smiled a monstrous smile you womanthoughtcaster you thought to fool me a you even taunted me very well and so youll die with me jake was up on his feet now and miller was on his fat backside scrabbling away from the horror for all he was worth but trennier was concentrating on liz he was almost upon her his ohsolong hands dripping blood as they reached for her jake caught her round the waist and ran with her made only two or three paces before tripping and falling but they didnt hit the ground no for it was as if they fell in slow motion and in jakes mind a voice saying now the numbers a the formula read it use it rut his own voice or some others numbers rolled on the screen of jakes mindan endless mathematical progression displaying itself on his brains computer numbers yes and he knew them a or someone did still holding on to liz still falling jake stopped the numbers at a certain combination an impossible formula that at once formed into a door they tumbled through it into a place of negative gravity a place of nothing at all and in another moment a or perhaps no time at all a through a second door and only then hit the ground and rolling in the dust full fifty feet away from where they had been so jake heard peter miller babbling his terror trasks cry of triumph or vengeance or both and the unmistakable roar of the flamethrower even at that distance still jake and liz felt something of the heat and drew back from it and a moment later spied miller where he came crying like a child dragging his fat body along the scorched earth then they looked back trennier danced there the hideous agonized dance of the true death vampire that he was he beat his arms and screamed his wrath or was the awful sound something else like the hissing and popping of air or gasfilled bodycavities when live lobsters are dropped in the pot maybe it was the nerverending firescreech of the flamethrower or perhaps a mixture of both jake wasnt sure couldnt rightly say he didnt see how trennier could scream a not in the airless inferno that surrounded his melting body his stumbling dance went on for many a long second there in the heart of that bluewhite blast of superheated chemicals until finally he succumbed but the thing inside him fought on a or at any rate caused trennier to fight on a for a while longer yet and that was the proof the undeniable proof of just how long he had been a vampire for as his body began to melt and his legs gave way letting him collapse onto his backside so at last his metamorphic flesh answered the call of his vampire nature it was one last desperate attempt by trenniers leech to escape the fire a by using his altered flesh and liquids to damp down the flames his scraps of clothing had drifted free of his blackened body to waft aloft on the vile updraught now his fingers elongated into writhing worms and his stomach bulged and burst into a nest of lashing purple tentacles and all of these appendages were like penises that pissed into the fire but uselessly for this was a fire they couldnt put out only ben trask could do that and he wouldnt until there was nothing left to burn or nothing left that could be considered injurious anyway or at least until his weapon ran out of fuel but now the members of the other halfteam were back from the ruins of the lesser shack one of them had a flamethrower turning his liquid fire on the vampire and his fallen thralls he finished what trask had started eventually it was over and trask wanted to know were there no weapons why didnt they have weapons now that it was done he seemed halfmazed drained as if there had been fires in him also and they too were now extinguished weapons the second teams leader answered him theres a small armoury in the mine shaft behind the lesser shack maybe they didnt think theyd need guns against just two humans anyway weve set charges well back inside the mine shaft thermite too when that blows the whole place will go with it if theres anything still in there it wont be getting out good trask gave himself a shake and took a deep breath and to the leader of the first team lets get to work on this end too i want the main shaft rigged good and deep okay gentlemen lets move it the nights not over yet but it soon would be by then too trask would be his old self again hard and businesslike at least on the surface within the hour the charges were triggered the ground trembled underfoot and the deep rumble of manmade thunder sounded from the mouths of the mine shafts and even though the teams members were standing safely back from the face of the knoll still they felt the flurry of hot air that rushed out of those nightdark pits and smelled stenches other than those of chemicals then there were clouds of dust erupting as from blowholes as the shafts gave way to countless tons of solid rock and lesser debris that came avalanching from on high but even then it wasnt quite over for now the effect of the thermite was seen white gases escaping in highpressure jets and smoking liquid that filled even the smallest crevices running over the rocks to seal them finally someone said in there right now it will be much like a blast furnace a the entire mine cooking itself i would sooner take my chances in a cellar in world war two dresden than in there to which no one gave argument or even made reply the backup vehicles started to arrive and secondary cleanup could now commence an old man apparently plagued by rheumatism hobbled here and there examining the ashes of fires that were already cooling like trask and goodly he wasnt especially protected he wasnt wearing a gas mask seemed to breathe freely and didnt appear too concerned with contamination his only weapons were a wickedlooking machete hanging in its sheath under his left arm and an antiquated handfashioned crossbow while this final phase of the operation got under way jake and liz waited for trasks instructions by no means fully recovered from the nights events a lost in private and personal thoughts a they leaned against the side of the land rover where jake had driven it back up onto the elevated shelf to clear the way for the articulated ops vehicle and they were mainly silent but finally jake shook off his mood of introspection a a worrying morbid train of thought where he questioned his sanity and pondered the seeming unreality of certain things that had happened and were continuing to happen to him a and fixed his attention on the hobbling old man who apparently had more than a little authority here limping between the flamethrower teams he appeared to be pointing out areas they had missed in their scorched earth mission burn here jake heard him growling over the hiss and roar of searing lances of fire and over there too oh its charred ill grant you that but charred isnt enough it must be burned right through then when its smoke and ashes drifting on the windthen its done with not before his accent was strange hard to place european mediterranean area though definitely italy sicily romania there was something of a romance language in it anyway but in fact jake couldnt have been more wrong or rather his conclusion was too mundane in the literary sense of the word who is he he asked liz the old boy there look at him he reminds me of nothing so much as a bloodhoundthe way he stops every now and then to sniff the night air the only thing can smell is smoke and fireand death and what about his clothing just what does he think he is some kind of frontiersman out of the wild west and for a fact the old man might well have been a frontiersman a and was of sorts a but from a wilder west than any jake might have imagined you know jake went on i got the impression that there was something of the romany something gypsyish about the vampire bruce trennier well now i have the same kind of feeling about this fellow hell he even jingles when he moves but the oldster had spotted them even as jake spoke and he came hobbling in their direction ben trask came too probably to make introductions jake thought and meanwhile liz was answering at least one of his queries you said he reminded you of a bloodhound she said and youre just about right a human bloodhound is exactly what he is what youve seen tonight hes seen so many times he cant count them so ive gathered anyway his name is lardis sometimes called the old lidesci liz the old fellow nodded his greeting and smiled a gaptoothed smilebut in the next moment he was frowning stepping closer turning his head on one side to look up into lizs face then huhlhe grunted spitting in the dirt no plugs what and are you impa impera er imperv impervious she helped him out yes he snapped pointing an accusing finger at her and you too he turned to jake cutter is it jake cutter we were wearing plugs jake answered then we got involved in a lot of activity my plugs were knocked out of me but liz had hers to the end and anyway who the hella deconi the other abruptly cut him short er decontama contain adecontamination liz said rightthe old man snapped jerking his thumb in the direction of the command truck both of you now who on eartha jake started again but by then ben trask was there to stop him jake cutter trask said this is lardis lidesci i heard you asking who on earth well nobody on earth actually originally hes fromoh a different place entirely trask had almost let something drop stopped himself at the last moment lardis was in the greek islands with another team he changed the subject when they didnt find what they were looking for i asked that he be sent here he came in this afternoon by chopper from perth and turning to the old lidesci he said well how about it obviously there was something between the two of them that jake and liz werent privy to him lardis looked at jake frowned gave a shrug cant say could be i suppose fit and youngand stubborn wont listen to good advice and doesnt respect his elders too much either makes him a funny choice if you ask me but if its so its so and who are we to fathom the ways of the necroscope nothing certain then trask seemed disappointed lardis shrugged again and said well the proof could be right here in the slime and the stink where these bastards burnedthats if you really want to test your theory trask knew what lardis meant even if jake didnt he shook his head said no hes not ready for that yet and probably not for quite some time to come jake had been studying lardis the old lidesci was short barrelbodied almost apelike in the great length of his arms his lank black hair beginning to grey now framed a leathery weatherbeaten face with a flattened nose that sat uncomfortably over a mouth that was missing too many teeth as for the ones that remained they were uneven and stained as old ivory but under shaggy eyebrows lardiss dark brown eyes glittered his minds agility denying the encroaching infirmities of his body jake guessed hed been a leader and rightly so if jake examined lardis lidesci it was certainly no less of an inspection that the old man was giving him and suddenly feeling uncomfortable jake went on the defensive frowning he said i wish youd talk to me you two instead of about me i mean you were talking about me werent you about you and about someone else trask told him were talking about the fellow that you thinkaand that we thinkamight be in your head talking about a man called harry keogh i never heard of him said jake but wondered if in fact he had the name did seem somehow familiarand felt familiar too in a weird sort of way which only served to confuse him and make him angry anyway what has he to do with me trask rubbed his chin said theres something he used to do thatwell that you seem to do too when liz was under threat youyou moved her away from trennier and i know i dont need to remind you that thats how you first came to our attention its how you brought yourself to our attention by moving in on us jake shook his head that wasnt deliberate he said i mean i didnt have anything to do with it it wasnt me exactly trask told him jake frowned again i dont see the connection neither do we trask said not just yet but if there is one were going to find out about it his eyes were speculative bright with some strange emotion a hope perhaps a where they studied jakes facebut then he shrugged it off and said meanwhile lardis is right decontamination time for you two and i do mean right now and liz and jake both knew enough a they had seen enough now a not to argue and so headed for the command vehicle when they had left i missed it the old lidesci spoke to trask but he did actually do it then this jake he used the mobius continuum trask nodded and that makes three times now that we know of then we must accept that he is what he is lardis shrugged it seems obvious to me and i wish it seemed as obvious to me said trask its just that i dont like the coincidence a that at a time such as this he turns up but what better time lardis asked him or what worse trask countered the point is we know what he might be but we dont know what he is the only thing i know for sure it isnt an act he really doesnt know whats going on and you havent told him what do you want me to tell him lardis that part of him has been occupied by someone who talks to dead people someone who can even call the dead up out of the earth to walk again someone who at the end of life as we know it was himself a vampire a and not only him but two of his sons too should i tell him that in starside in your world one of harry keoghs sons was a lord of the wamphyri while another was the dweller a werewolf and if jake didnt think i was a madman if he actually believed me what then again lardiss shrug but then perhaps grudgingly i see what you mean he growled if it was me id run like all the devils of hell were after me and so might he trask nodded and in the mobius continuum he can run a very long way we cant afford that cant afford to lose him which is why well just let this thing develop for a while and see what happens and some little distance away as jake and liz passed a patch of blackened tarry ground and a slumped mound that still gave off the stench of roasting flesh what jake paused and his face was very pale what do you hear that those screams jesus what the hell is that he turned in a circle looked all about but no one was there for a moment liz said nothing she had heard nothing and couldnt imagine what he was talking about a or maybe she could but didnt want to but it was plain to see that jake was badly shaken screams she said the hiss and sputter of sap perhaps boiling out of a scorched branch well maybe jake shuddered maybe but he really didnt think so what he knew hed heard had sounded much more like the screaming soul of a sinner roasting in his own private hell or perhaps someone shrieking his final denial from a world beyond the flames a world beyond life and the bubbling patch of scorched earth continued to give off steam and smoke chapter four gadgets and ghosts the decontamination booths reminded jake of those antique telephone kiosks so treasured by collectors they werent red and didnt have those small glass panes for windows but they were much the same size and even smelled bad not of urine no but garlic jake couldnt make up his mind which was more nauseous situated in the back of the rearmost articulated trailer section and fitted with doors as small as the toilet doors on an airplane there were three booths on each side inside each booth was a disposal unit for soiled clothing discarded items were sucked away irradiated and microwaved spat from an exterior chute and burned the procedure covered all clothing which meant you were left bucknaked in the waterproof and airtight booth where the rest of the process was entirely automatic and that was when you discovered why these claustrophobic little showerunits a for thats what they were a smelled so foul at first it was just hot water stinging like bb shot where it blasted down on you from overhead jets but in a few seconds it was something else a mixture of something chemical and antiseptic and something vegetable and oily the chemical saturated and then evaporated but the oil stayed and a damn it to hell a you were supposed to rub it into your pores but if there was one thing jake especially hated it was garlic there was an intercom system you could talk to people in the ops section or to other agents undergoing decontamination in the booths whichever also the uppermost sections of the booths were glasspanelled on the sides from the neck up and from there down stainless steel this last was simply a matter of common decency there were female as well as male agents jake had chosen a central booth and liz had taken the one to his left switching on her booth intercom she said i see you picked the middle one you could have taken the one on the end so thered at least be a booth between us looking sexy as hell she pulled an impish face at him through the glass but he only grinned a a rare occurrence in itself where jake cutter was concerned a and answered oh really and why didnt you choose one on the other side of the vehicle so you wouldnt have to be near me at all then on the spur of the moment he leaned forward flattened his hawk nose to the glass panel and made as if to look down inside her booth there was no way the glass was misted at the edges and it was all gleam steam and cream down there oblige me and stand on your toes will you he grunted a and was so astonished at himself that he bit his tongue a and was equally amazed at liz when for a single instant of time she actually seemed to consider doing it it was the look on her face a notquite innocence a curiosity a magnetism that worked both ways she looked beautiful like that hair plastered down makeup all washed away and her skin shiny with oil a yet still beautiful jake was drawn by it a and repulsed there was something hed vowed to himself and he would stick by it to the end until it was done and anyway liz didnt stand on her toes but simply blushed or maybe that was as a result of the steam in which case it would be hiding his colour toothank the lord anyway what are you doing here she said and maybe it was his imagination but her voice sounded just a little husky must be the intercom i mean youve made it amply clear that you dont want to be with us so why are you jake glanced at the intercom panel lizs button was the only one that was lit up no one else was listening so their conversation would be completely private that was assuming he wanted to talk of course and suddenly he did i didnt have any choice he said i could be here or i could be locked up well ive been in jail and here is better but after tonight i can tell you its not much better there he stopped short reconsidered why bother why try to get close to anyone hed been close to someone before and shed paid for it once was enough theythey jailed you for murder liz said and her face was very serious now thats what ive heard anyway i killed some people jake nodded and if i get half a chance there are still two more who i want to kill he admitted it oh so matteroffactly and for a moment his brown eyes were very nearly black they were bleak too almost vacant in their intensity liz felt that jakes eyes looked at something a thousand miles away perhaps a scene from memory his as yet undisclosed past or maybe it was just an effect of the misted glass but then he smiled however wanly and was animate again so there you go thats me mr bad man so whats your story liz whats a nice girl like you doing in a freaky outfit like this she felt cheated because she knew he hadnt told it all not nearly tell me just one more thing she said shivering because the spray was cooler now and also because of the look shed seen in his eyes about you or about those men you say you killed did they deserve it he looked at her then answered her with a question of his own what about those creatures tonight did they deserve it but they were vampires monsters he simply nodded left it for her to figure out by which time the spray had become shampoo and they knew it was nearly over this part of it anyway as he soaped himself down jake reminded her im waiting despite his doubts his resolve still his interest couldnt be denied hmm she said then oh why am i here thats easy i was doing some work for a psychicresearch group looking back i suspect it was an ebranch recruiting ploy they havent said as much not yet but i gather theyre pretty hushhush until a person is wellestablished with them anyway the job was easy the money was good and i needed the work my office was in central london i interviewed people allegedly for mind magazine and if they responded positively to a certain set of questions then i was supposed to work with them and carry out a series of tests she shrugged and through the misted glass jake saw her shoulders give a little twitch the suggestive movement of her o oo underarm flesh as the weight of her ample breasts settled anyway she went on i used an old german prismaton in the tests anda a what jake cut her off its a machine that chooses psi symbols at random psi symbols liz sighed five designs a star a circle a square a plus sign and wavy lines im with you now jake said the machine picks the symbol and the test subject has to guess which one it is except its not supposed to be a guess liz told him i mean theyre supposed to concentrate and try to know what symbol it is thats what esp is all about go on well at first i would get a few lucky guessersthey might come up with two or three correct symbols in a row and i would get all excited but in the long run it never worked out to anything and id be disappointed because you know i wanted to earn my money but for me to be successful obviously my test subjects had to be successful too and so i found myself willing them to get it right someone would say square and i would be telling myself no no no thats wrong its the wavy lines until i reached the stage when i was saying no thats wrong or if someone got lucky yes thats right before they named their choice before they even spoke let me guess said jake you didnt know what was going on you thought that either you were mistaken or the machine a the er prismaton a was playing tricks with you ora but it couldnt be the machine liz cut him short because its only a machine aor that you yourself jake went on must somehow be in tune with your subjects mental telepathy right she nodded it was me it wasnt that my subjects an incredibly high percentage of them were good at sending a which is ebranch parlance for telepathic transmissions a but that was good at receiving i was a receiver a mindreader i could tune in to other peoples thoughts yes not all the time and not without a lot of effort and concentration but sometimes which was something youd never noticed before despite the events of the night a the fact that hed observed for himself her obvious effect on trennier a still jake was a little sceptical i mean that you knew what people were thinking she grinned well i frequently knew what men were thinking slowly her grin disappeared no seriously i hadnt the foggiest idea but as soon as i did know then it was like topsy it just growed and growed jake thought it over and then theres you liz said pointedly but he wasnt having any and simply looked away the pungent soap had stopped and it was plain water now and cold just as they might have started complaining the system closed itself down and a light began flashing on the intercom it was trask wanting to know are you people done good so get out of there and make room for someone else the rest of the team all of them would go through a less intensive cycle but jake and liz werent finished yet dry towelling robes dispensed themselves from compartments in the rear of the booths with plasticbag bootees for their feet then the doors concertinaed of their own accord and outside in the corridor other agents were coming aboard and making ready but jake and liz stayed apart from them and went on into the body of the ops vehicle and the next stage where trask himself administered hypodermic injections while the old man lardis lidesci stood watching until finally they were obliged to drink something vile god jake gasped clutching his throat and again god but if im not going to be sick as a dog if you aresaid the old lidesci til take it as a very bad sign and trask grinned however coldly as lardis fondled the grip of his machete he wont be sick trask said then and even if he is it wont mean anything i remember i was sick myself desperately the first time i tasted that stuff garlic still jake felt like gagging derived from trask shrugged anyway its good for youor so im told turning he led the way down the corridor past doors to a halfdozen cramped bunks and through a telescopic conduit and hatch into the vehicles forward trailer section then at last they were there in the ops room itself the mobile nervecentre lan goodly was in the hollow oval that formed the central desk he swung round the oval on a tracked chair studying the various illuminated wallcharts and monitor screens the place was hitec heaven well in advance even of anything else that ad had to offer in complete contrast to the articulated shell of truck and trailers a indeed utterly contradicting that outer facade with its mundane and easily identifiable castlemaine and xxxx legends a this interior was something out of speculative fiction and never a can of beer in sight goodly was wearing what looked like a virtual reality headset that was constantly tuning itself to whatever event or location he was observing but as he swung into a new position and trask and company came between the precog and the everchanging screens so goodly brought his chair to a halt and took off the headset the old lidesci shook his grizzled head in astonishment and grunted after two years of working with you people im still not used to it not used toto this trask nodded his understanding know what you mean he said but you wont get too much sympathy from me hell its been more than thirty years for me a and i still feel the same about it what was it alec kyle used to say how did he put it or was it darcy clarke he shrugged but what difference does it make eh it could have been any one of us robots and romantics superscience and the supernatural telemetry and telepathy computerized probability patterns and precognition huh gadgets and ghosts well thats it thats ebranch but jake wanted to know just what is ebranch whats it all about dont you think its time we saw the whole picture he glanced at liz well me at leastespecially after what you threw me into tonight threw us into said liz im not as much in the dark as you jake but its still pretty murky around here she looked at trask perhaps accusingly and after all while tonight was one of the first things weve done it might also have been the last but lan goodly shook his head no he said you have a way to go yet you two precog jake said sourly thats how ive heard people refer to you but how can you possibly know for sure and trask said because he hasnt let us down yet and what if tonight had been the first time jake wasnt convinced but trask only raised a white eyebrow so whats your big problem jake are you trying to kid us you havent been doing your best to get yourself killed these last three years maybe jake snapped but on my terms well now its on my terms trask growled or ebranchs terms then he relaxed a little looked less severe and said okay ill tell you it was a test oh it served its purpose too but it was nevertheless a test and you both passed it we saw enough tonight a enough happened a to convince us we were right about me jake said about both of you trask replied liz did her thing and we all saw trenniers reply she sent and he received a and he reacted did he ever said liz with a shudder but youre the one who told me to taunt him trask nodded and said and you made a damn good job of it too and satisfied our best expectations so if you still want in welcome to the club youre one of us and having seen what youve seen a even with what little weve allowed you to learn a weve no doubt but that youll join us so thats that and in any case you have time to think about it and do i have time to think about it too jake said testily if so you can have my answer right now its no im out trask frowned narrowed his eyes and said well thats a damn shame because you dont have a choice and thats because you too did your thing tonight something i havent seen the likes of in oh five years and when i did last see itit was in another world a vampire world lardiss world jake looked at the three men in turn a trask goodly lardis lidesci the way they looked back at him sincere serious speculative a and shook his head in mock despair ive been telling myself that its all a dream one from which ill soon be waking up he said then his voice hardened but it isnt and i wont a not from any dream of mine anyway this is your dream your fucking nightmare and ive had it up to here oh no this is everyones nightmare trask told him and then pressed on but which part do you think is a dream jake the strange work we do or the fantastic thing that you do i dont do anything jake turned on him and for a moment looked like he might hit him it justit just happens he clenched his fists unclenched them stood lost for words trask shook his head but things dont just happen jake he said they happen for reasons and weve got to figure out why theyre happening to you he turned to lan goodly do we have his file the precog nodded swung his chair to a filing cabinet set in a section of the oval desk took out a slim folder and handed it over there were chairs that folded into the walls trask let one down sat in it and invited the others to do the same then he opened the file and jake cutter he began but jakes voice was harsh as he interrupted do you intend to to read it all even the nasty bits with a woman present the others had taken chairs but he was still standing brief details trask said staring up at him why do you ask is there something youre ashamed of what has that got to do with it jake blurted thats my life youre holding in your hands its private a or it used to be the newspapers didnt think so trask didnt even blink hell no they didnt jake said they held me one hundred per cent responsible for my crimes and do you intend to detail those too is this how youre going to keep me in line working for you for ebranch by holding a bloody axe over my head every time i voice an opinion or refuse to cooperate trask shook his head that has nothing to do with it the object of the exercise is to get to the root of your talent as for your socalled crimesits the opinion of this branch that you dont have too much to be ashamed of for a moment jake was taken aback but then he said what if i dont much care about the opinion of this branch but you do said trask you believe in justice and you couldnt get any so you provided your own rough justice which was just a little too rough for our modern society in ebranch jake we understand rough justice its sometimes the only kind that will fit and we were taught by an expert someone who believed in an eye for an eye almost as much as you do well now we wonder if thats all you have in common with him or if this talent of yours is something else and whats more there might even be other talents we want to explore that possibility too a indeed every possibility a and you can help us or hinder us in which caseeventually wed be obliged to give up on you and theres still an empty cell waiting for you remember jakes hardfrozen shell was coming apart now not his resolve but the icy sheath that covered it without which he wouldnt have been able to face his own atrocities for that was how he secretly viewed some of his past deeds as atrocities everyone else had seemed to think so anyway yet in his heart still jake believed that what ben trask had said was right sometimes an eye for an eye was the only way and suddenly jake found himself believing everything else that trask was telling him that ebranch really did care and was on his side it was just that it had been such a long time since anyone was on his side and now trask was saying so can we get on jake drew a chair out from the wall sat down heavily and said why do i get this feeling this isnt a con youre what they call a human liedetector right well mr trask if you ask me id say your talent works both ways i get the impression that you really do want to help me even if its only so i can help you trask actually smiled then and said jake youre exactly right i hate all lies and liars and i instinctively know when something isnt true isnt right dont ask me how i just do but its equally hard for me to tell a lie as to listen to one i just thought you might like to know that jake nodded and feeling a little more in control now said okay so if you think theressomething wrong with me and you can maybe fix it i suppose id be a fool to object trask sat back and issued an audible sigh very well but you have to understand its not that we think theres anything wrong with you but that something may be right from our point of view anyway and then he returned to the file your father was a usaf pilot trask began as a rookie joe cutter served at an american airbase in southern england that was where he met your mother an english girl from a welltodo family janet carsons folks objected they got married anyway for a while janet was a camp follower living wherever joe was based then you came along doing your bit to stabilize a frequently stormy relationshipwell for a little while anyway but the marriage didnt last your father was too often away and your mothertook lovers trask lifted his gaze from the file looked at jake if this is too personal i can skip forward youre doing okay jake shrugged since my parents left me nothing in the way of great memories what does it matter and so trask continued your mother had friends in whats called high society eventually she married a french businessman with whom she lived in st tropez untilwell until she died five years ago again jakes shrug though not as careless as he might have tried to make it seem its nice in nice he said so as a baby you went to your british grandparents trask went on who were maybe a little on the wrong side of fifty to take on your upringing as for your father joe cutter died on aerial manoeuvres in germany in piloting a way beyond its sellbydate airplane known affectionately to its pilots as a flying coffin joe was coming to the end of his service when it happened and you were just fifteen years old you were an unruly kid jake too much money courtesy of your then aging and indeed doting grandparents too many opportunities to smoke funny cigarettes and probably to try other controlled pharmaceuticals too much time on your hands and nothing much to look forward to not to your way of thinking at least so you dropped out of school spent some time with your mother in france but she had quite a few bad habits of her own and wasnt a very good influence and anyway you didnt get on with her you said you might join the army and your grandfather was delighted he said excellent the brigade of guards the old school tie and all that wot wot so you joined the parachute regiment because you wanted to jump out of airplanes and in just two years you transferred to the sas well so much for parental guidance when they kicked you out of the sas your final report said you were incapable of taking orders also and this is a damned strange thing for the sas the report said you were too much of a loner this from an outfit that prides itself on selfdependence or total independence so there you were five years ago back to the good life a life of luxury in the south of france where you lived off your mas money jake shrugged but he looked more than a little uncomfortable her second husband left her a packet he said and her third was even richer so why should i break my back working im not criticizing you jake trask told him tm just pointing out what you were then in order to find a comparison with what you later became in the eyes of society which is to say a criminal more than that a brutal murderer now just you wait a minute jake started to say didnt you tell me that youa until trask cut him off with in the eyes of society anyway but society has been known to make the odd mistake here and there and ebranchwell were sometimes called in to clean up the mess though as often as not we just jump in feet first regardless very well now we can get away from your story for a minute or so and after a brief pause fie went on for the last fifteen to twenty years a or even longer than that indeed ever since the fall of communism a europe has been in one hell of a mess recessions revolutions coups one after the other nuclear black spots where russian powerstations and weapons dumps are left rotting down to so much atomic rubble little wars and not so little wars left right and centre as nations take their revenge engage in racial vendettas that should have been settled probably would have been settled a hundred years ago if soviet expansionism and communism hadnt called a temporary halt to them power struggles in political systems that are still sorting themselves out in rome and moscow and elsewhere ethnic cleansing in and around the slavic and baltic countries and regular revolutions in turkey bulgaria and romania italian french and german governments coming and going as regular as the ticking of a clock and lasting about the same length of time never long enough to do anyone any good and as for the near and middle east africa the orient trask sighed and shook his head have i painted a sufficiently gloomy picture and without waiting for an answer well thank god were an island a england i mean a and also that weve maintained and strengthened our ties with america and australia because the rest of the world seems like nomansland in a word its chaos it seems an ideal scenario for the end of life as we know it right even as i speak the depletion of the ozone layer continues were into yet another el nifio a the fourth in fifteen years a and theres a riproaring plague spreading west out of an ideologically and financially exhausted china but there are worse plagues than a new strain of the bubonic variety believe me again a brief pause until and so back to you trask continued staring at jake your mother died of an overdose left you some moneya the money was about the only decent thing she ever did for me jake nodded his husky tone betraying his true emotions abut you and money together spelled more trouble trask chose to ignore the interruption so maybe you didnt have too much going for you you and your ma a still her death affected you badly you went on a long drinking spree in all the mediterranean resorts from genoa to marseille wrecked your car on the italian riviera the paparazzi took your photograph during several fistfights in cannes also its not at all unlikely that you returned to your drugtaking habits i never had much of a habit jake told him oh i tried just about every brand thats true but they only made me ill those funny cigarettes were about as bad as it ever got and where ive spent the last three months even they were far too expensive im used to my asshole the shape and size ive always known it he looked at liz and said sorry but if you insist on being here she shook her head answered im not a child jake after tonight i thought youd know that much at least and trask went on just as if no one else had spoken then you met a girl thered been women in your life a quite a few a but this one was something else she was special this is the bit you can skip jake told him gruffly but unfortunately not trask answered if liz is to be your partner and the rest of ebranch is to work with you theyll need to know that you arent quite the savage that the world a and probably you too jake a thinks you are theyll need to know you had your reasons and jake sat silently now his head lowered n chapter five jakes story her name was natasha trask went on and she was working for the moscow mafia she was a courier for the mob in the guise of a fashions artist but in fact the only designs that interested her were the designer microdrugs in her sports cars rollbars natasha was also the mobs collection agent and ferried lots of highdenomination francs and lire back to a vastly depleted russian economyor rather to the thugs who were in large part responsible for that depletion trask shook his head in disgust god hoods of the world unite we thought it was over and done with when the mafia took a couple of bad falls back in to in america the families really suffered when gotti went down everyone thought it was the end of that kind of corruption at least in the usa in sicily nearly four hundred of these lizards were convicted of murder extortion graft racketeering prostitution you name it surely that was the end of it oh really but the russian mafia were just starting out and with the collapse of the european immigration laws ten years ago and the removal of border controls on the continentwell as i said thank the lord that the uks an island we kept our border controls our immigration laws and for once we got it dead right even so the illicit drugs trade is hard to beat and were suffering our fair share though not nearly as badly as the rest of the world and of course hardcore survivors of police activity and old mafiastyle gang wars in italy sicily and the states have formed liaisons with the ever more powerful russian gangs which means that in common with the worlds terrorist organizations theyre now pretty much integrated marseille has always had a big drug problem the riviera with its jetsetters and highroller socialites has been drugdealer heaven for a long long time natasha slepaks mobility a the routes she used a were several but mainly she would fly from moscow to budapest and then drive down into italy or over into france or she might use another route into france driving into genoa then taking a yacht to the french riviera the mob have contacts keep boats in most italian sea ports jake met natasha in marseille according to a statement he made later a much later a to the italian police she wanted out of the drugs business she was being pestered for sex by one of the italian mobs top men one luigi castellano a young sicilian who ran the french side of the action from a sprawling villa on the outskirts of marseille castellano was natashas top contact in france and he was also the man she most feared and hated as trask paused jake a who had been looking more and more agitated a burst out if it has to be told let me do the telling from here on in trask pursed his lips then nodded we met in a bar jake began what youve just heard is true natasha wanted out but there was nowhere she could run not on the continent anyway no border controls the mob would find her wherever she went maybe thats why she went for me a because i had british nationality a but thats only a maybe i prefer to thinkwell otherwise anyway we got on famously for a couple of days i wined and dined her she was a very good reason for staying sober staying clean we roomed at different hotelsso i thought but in fact she was staying at castellanos villa and all the time fending the bastard off and she wouldnt come anywhere near my place in short she wasnt any kind of pushover and i knew she was worried about something eventually she told me just about everything and all the time a all through our romance if you want to call it that a i was aware that she was being watched even when id first met her this tall guy had been watching from the shadows i didnt tell her about it but i knew i wasnt mistaken finally she told me why we couldnt be together it was for my sake she didnt want me to get into trouble the time came when she said shed have to be moving on i knew i loved her even though wed known each other less than a week maybe i needed someone to love my mother was recently dead and i guessed that at the rate i was burning myself up it wouldnt be too long before id be joining her and now there was natasha to fill a void i had never thought would exist and i just couldnt see anything to stop us being together but she could the mob so i asked her why shouldnt we go and tell her story to the local police the surete she said they were in castellanos pocket so i said she should think about something next time shed be in marseille let me know beforehand and i would be there to take her out of it to england where shed be safe or comparatively safe anyway and she said okay so on our last night together i was in a pretty frustrated mood and wouldnt you know it her tail was there as always i would know him anywhere this tall man with his thin white face and dark eyes but we had made our plans and the next time natasha was in town would be the last time she would come with me into england on a tourist visa wed get married and she would stay on as my wife it seemed more than likely shed be lost to the mob for good so maybe she thought we should seal our pact or perhaps it was more than that maybe she simply wanted to be with me on what would be our last night for some time to come anyway she said yes she would come back to my hotel with me but there was no way i intended to have the tall fellow for company we took a taxi to a bar a stones throw from my hotel and when natasha went to the ladies i waited just inside the door sure enough a car pulled up and the tail got out and that finally did it for me id had it up to here so stepping outside i didnt bother to introduce myself but simply lashed out and knocked him down some of the stuff the sas had taught me was finally coming in useful and before he was even nearly ready to get up again i took natasha off to my hotel looking back on it now a oh i was some kind of clown to actually believe i could get away with it worse i hadnt considered the repercussions where natasha was concerned though i certainly did the next morning after breakfast when i took her down to catch a taxi the heavies were there and this time i didnt see them didnt see it coming a didnt even feel it until i woke up at castellanos villa not that i knew where i was at the time my location was something i found out later anyway i was tied to a chair in one of the bedrooms and natasha was tied to a bed we were both in our underwear i seem to remember windows with thick drapes so that not even a chink of sunlight came through but it felt like day midday quiet too hot outside to even think of movement that was what it was no movement a humid drowsy day and the room was dimly lit wall lights turned low and a shaded bedside lamp but im way ahead of myself at first i didnt see a damn thing i only felt the pain in the back of my skull then as i gradually came to i heard voices speaking in italian i knew the language well enough to know they were talking about meand natasha after the girl one voice said then you can have him but first i want him to see and understand a the spoiled english brat i would have had her myself a long time ago except that might have been problematic even so i was tempted and if shed been a little more willingbut i wont force any woman its too demeaning a to myself i mean anyway our colleagues in moscow think highly much too highly of this bitch and now this brat has spoiled her well for me at least i dont take anyones leavings jean daniel so this is your lucky day you get to do it for me lets face it youve watched her often enough and im sure youve fancied her just as frequently eh so what better way to pay him back for what he did to you fancied her the other voice said hey im only human luigi and this isthis is a lota lot of woman jakes own voice as he told or relived his story had sunk very low become guttural until at this point he was choking on his words having difficulty getting them out trask saw this and said jake we can leave it there if you like but the other shook his head no he said grimly no i think id like to finish it maybe its good for me to remember what went down because then ill be sure i was right in what i did yes and it also serves to remind me of what remains to be done and after a moment these voices he went on were very distinctive the one belonged to castellano as i was about to find out it was very deep and powerful like a rumble a purring sound even when he was speaking quietly and the other this jean daniels voice it had an obvious french accent in keeping with his name but it also had something of a lisp which explained itself as soon as i saw him anyway i must have twitched moved my head or something maybe i groaned but suddenly they knew i was awake then shadows moved in that dim room they came from behind me one pausing to stand beside my chair the other moving towards the bed positioning itself in an easy chair on the other side of the lamp they were men of course but to my blurred vision they were more like shadows but as my eyes adjusted and my head stopped swimming finally i saw natasha spreadeagled there on the fourposter and because shed lifted her head she could see me too maybe that a that look on her face expressing her relief that id finally come to a was how they knew id regained consciousness but in any case it was an expression that didnt last much longer the one beside the bed spoke and his deep purring voice told me that this was luigi castellano ah natasha natasha he rumbled as she turned her pale frightened face to look at him first the injury and then the insult he said to have spurned my friendship my warmest offerings of affection for thisthis englishmans perhaps you didnt understand that in the game we play its always business first a no such thing as mixing business with pleasure natasha and if there was we might reasonably expect you to take your pleasures with one of us not with some stupid outsider perhaps its my fault i allowed you too much leeway but no for i hate to blame myself i tried to look at the speaker but he was still a shadow a dark silhouette hunched behind the cone of faint yellow radiance from the bedside lamp and he went on speaking but then again what if this foreign playmate of yours wasnt so stupid after all but a member of one of those agencies we havent yet got to eh you took too many chances natasha a took too much pleasure i fancy a and now you must pay ah but what price well since you dont seem to care too much for the company of a business partner i was obliged to find a punishment to fit youryour what your crime ah but no a too harsh by far a your error of judgement then a punishment to fit both participants that is tit for tat if you like or better far tits for tat castellanos tone was much harsher harder now yes and the rest of your more than ample charms into the bargain he looked up and beckoned to jean daniel my chair was a swivel the man beside me spun it and i went turning turning feeling sick as a dog as the room revolved around me at least it gave me a chance to identify my tormentor his cold smiling face passing before me as the chair slowed down it was natashas tail of course and castellanos tall palefaced watchdog finally he spoke to me in broken english through a broken mouth which accounted for his lisp i hadnt realized how hard id hit him bastard he said stupid english pig bastard when i finish with her then is your turn we see who hit hardest eh he made to move towards the bed if you hit her i mumbled if you strike her just once i swear illa but he turned cut me off said hit her with fist for a moment he frowned looked puzzled but then grinning as best he could through split lips he said no stupid i not hit i fuck her and he did jakes voice was a growl now a sob a low moan with that dog castellano watching and laughing and me i couldnt look away i had to look he ripped her underclothes right off her the skinny bastardahe didnt pause to get undressed a he justhe justand natasha she didnt even speak didnt cry out but she did cry i heard her sobbing trask cut in til take it from here jake okay and before the other could protest you were found in an alley badly beaten four broken ribs and your nose much as we see it now the rest of your face was a mass of bruises youd been kicked too a someone had really worked on you a so badly that for a day or two the french doctors couldnt be sure theyd be able to saveeverything but you still had your plastic and paper money in your pockets so it looked like the motive wasnt theft in fact they never discovered what the motive had been even when you could talk you werent telling anyone said you didnt know now why was that jake i was going to handle it my own way jake answered dispassionately now and i did eventually yes you did trask nodded but that came later do you want to pick the story up again the others face was white drawn but he nodded i was three weeks in hospital jake eventually continued no word from natasha i didnt know what had happened to her but i prayed it wasnt physical or rather nothing more than shed already suffered as for what had sufferedi think it was as much mental as physical worrying about natasha i mean but at last they turned me loose by which time thered been plenty of time to think things out now it was up to her if she still wanted out a if she still dared ai was her man huhlthat old motto of mine who dares wins well i dared for sure because i loved her see i still hadnt learned my lesson then again do fools in love ever learn he managed a wry grin how about that jake cutter philosopher about jean daniel which was the only name i ever knew him under my initial intentions towards that bastard had been very bloody at firstwell i admit that id equipped myself and i had gone looking for them too a the mob i mean a but carefully and as i healed so i quit abusing my system with booze and maybe some other stuff the army had trained us hard body maintenance my section commander had used to call it but now i found it really difficult to get back into the routine oh i was still young but as youve pointed out mr trask that jean daniel had done a hell of a good job on me such a good job it took me four long months to put the damage right i completed my recuperation in england went back to marseille but time was passing and i still hadnt heard from natasha i had given her both my english and french telephone numbers if she couldnt speak to me she should certainly be able to speak to friends of mine still i hadnt heard from her and time seemed against me seemed to be flying but where natasha was concerned it was like some kind of paradox the months passing like so many years i couldnt forget her a i still wanted her a and the debt that the mob owed us was slowly slipping out of memory and into the past earlier however not long after leaving the hospital i had found castellanos villa i did it the easy way by tailing the tail id grown a designer beard tinted my sideboards grey and changed my mode of dress even developed a limp or rather i had deliberately held onto the limp id been left with legacy of jean daniel in all i looked quite a lot older and i was staying out of bars places where people might have been warned to look out for me but one lonely night a i dont know maybe i was hoping against hope that natasha would be there a i went back to the bar where id first met her i suppose i was lucky id developed my disguise for jean daniel was there he was on his own didnt notice me but when he left i was waiting in my car followed him to the villa and having found the place i sat back out of sight and watched it watched its clientelehard men all of them then for some few weeks i followed them too well and good a now i knew the places to avoid if ever natasha came back to marseille i mean i knew which routes not to take getting her out of there and i knew to get her out fast for despite all my earlier intentions finally i was getting some sense these people played rough played for keeps so maybe id be wise to forget the revenge thing simply take natasha and run for home if she ever came back and eventually she did it was less than three years ago in early november i got a message from a friend who gave me a moscow telephone number and when i calledi knew it could only be natasha she was scared castellano had done a job on her ruined her reputation with the moscow mob for a long time theyd left her alone let her go to the dogs shed been unable to find work and finally shed become desperate then shed begged a mob boss to let her run drugs again and now she was coming to marseille but castellano knew she was coming and she was more afraid of him than ever i asked her if she remembered our previous plans she did and was ready to do whatever id worked out for us but her own idea was a lot more daring to dump her drug consignment cheaply on a rival french gang and then to run with the money even cheaply it would still be worth a quarter million sterling at first i backed away from it but the more i thought it over the more i liked it wouldnt it be as good even better than the somewhat more physical revenge that id once planned and it would hit them all not just jean daniel who obviously had been my principal target natasha had already contacted her buyer she was supposed to come by yacht but instead would fly into marseille that way shed have time to dispose of her load and get out of france a with me of course a before castellano and his people even knew she was missing my part of it would be simple drive like hell for lyon dijon and paris finally the tunnel id studied the routes couldnt find any fault with the plan wed be on board a train and passing beneath the english channel before the marseille mob even thought to backtrack natashas movements so we reckoned anyway maybe it would have been easier to fly but that way would have meant leaving my car behind i had a beauty an almost new peugeot also if wed flown the mob would find it a lot easier to track us idiot that i must have been i still hadnt fully appreciated just what kind of people i was fooling with jake paused to look at trask you compared the modern mob to terrorist organizations well i thought i had learned something about terrorism in the sas maybe i had but plainly not enough and anyway that was just classroom stuff whatever i thought of the mob a lot differently from you as just a bunch of hoods i suppose but you were right and i was wrong they were probably watching her all the way down the line theyd probably always watched hermaybe they have watchers for all their couriers and dupes take jean daniel for example that spindly bastard was just another watchdog not so hard to understand when you consider the street value of the merchandise natasha was wearing dark glasses a wig and all when i met her off the plane but i knew her immediately and so did they thenit was like a repetitive nightmare almost a repeat of last time except this time there were five of them at the villa and the way they went at it oh god oh god a i knew they wouldnt be taking prisoners this time jakes face was ashen now earlier tonight hed known more or less what to expect even if he had only halfbelieved in it still he had been doing a job but at the time of his collision with the mob castellanos people a that kind of monster a he had beenwhat naive well no longer ben trask knew it was time to step in but more forcefully now thats enough jake he said you dont need to go into any further details why upset yourself weve all heard enough and were on your side as for justice a the justice you received a i might know a lot more about that than you do so for now lets skip that night at the villa but that long long night jake husked sweating and shivering at the same time his skin almost visibly crawling all of them and that bastard castellano watching it from the shadows god i still dont know what he looks like but afterwards oh i remembered the rest of them in minute detail would never let myself forget them and their laughter like jackals and their jokes the way they went at her leaving no marks no signs skip it jake trasks grating voice shaking him out of itjake sat back and gulped at the air gradually quit shuddering eventually a little colour returned to his face and finally he was able to continue i came to in the water underwater my cars windows were half open and we were sinking like a brick at first i was disorientated didnt know what the hell was happening i think i woke up because i couldnt breathe like when i was a kid id come screaming awake thinking i was drowning only to discover that my head was under the covers but this time it was river water and i was stupidly trying to push back the coversi mean i felt stupid drugged a which of course i was but then as i remembered what had gone down i looked for natasha in the passenger seat she wasnt there and i thanked goda athanked him as i somehow managed to wind my window down and drifted out and up and free but as the car went down and i floated up buoyed up in an eruption of big bubbles i saw natasha in the back of the car her faceher hair floatingher eyes wide openher mouth gaping and her spread fingers flattened and white the hands of a corpse a i hoped a against the curved back window but dead i didnt know i still dont know to this day if she was dead or alive but ive got to keep telling myself that she was dead because thats the only way i can bear it and in any case i couldnt have done a thing about it weak as a kitten i felt half dead myself my lungs were bursting a my ears too a we were that deep and i drifted up oh so slow while the car went down disappearing into the deeps and this girl i had loved still loved natasha disappearing with it this time it was a while before jake could go on he was like a man apart from reality he started and sat up straighter in his chair when the old lidesci coughed and looked around for a moment as if wondering where he was then are you okay jake liz asked him a nod was his only answer until he was able to continue dont ask me how i got back to marseille he finally went on i cant for the life of me remember but i did and i laid low with a trusted friend by then my earlier plans for revenge were firmly back in place before that however i actually considered going to the police then i remembered what natasha had told me about the police being in castellanos pocket and decided against it i would wait it out see what happened i didnt have long to wait it was in the newspapers home and abroad my car had been found in the verdon river where it comes down from the alps of provence near riez locals had been alerted by a hole in the wall of a stone bridge over a torrential gorge natasha was still in the car also a quantity of illicit microdrugs and other evidence that shed been a bad lot as for me well with my past record i would have been a wanted man a her partner obviously a except they assumed i was dead but i wasnt dead and now i had absolutely nothing left to lose also i knew a few things about castellanos people where they hung out and who with and i wasnt about to waste any more time there was one thing i had been really good at during my couple of years with the sas sabotage sabotage boobytraps and demolition and i still remember a and i cherish the memory a of the night i found jean daniel drinking alone in that discreet little bar that i knew so well i was there watching the place when he arrived and i was there when he left it was a rainy night as he got in his car in the alley i stepped out of the shadows maybe twentyfive yards in front i stood there with my legs spread like an inviting target and i waved at him and i started oh so slowly to walk towards him he saw me i saw him flinch knew that hed recognized me then he turned the key in the ignition and i knew exactly what the bastard was thinking that he would run me down by then id turned my back and hit the deck just in case but no there wasnt much of a blast what little there was of flying glass went over my head so i got up walked to his car and looked in through the shattered window i knew pretty much what id see for id been determined to make the best kind of job of it and i had i had taken a small hacksaw and cut halfway through the four spokes of his steering wheel close to the column and id fitted a trembler to the highexplosive charge that id placed under the plastic casing where the column was jointed for adjustment it was a hellishly sensitive mechanism far too sensitive to ignore the vibrations of a revving engine the blast had driven the steel core of the steering column through jean daniels middle stripping its plastic casing as it went the core had broken his lower ribs and torn through his stomach and done a lot more damage along the way yet somehow it had missed severing his spine he sat there a alive but barely a pinned to his seat with this fat cylindrical rod right through him sat blinking at me the steering wheel still gripped in his spastic hands this is a different kind of rape jean daniel i told him watching as blood filled his mouth and his eyes began to dim and his twitching gradually stilled my own special version and then just before the bastard died so now you know who hits the hardest chapter six more of jakes story ben trask lan goodly and the old lidesci were first away from the gutted smouldering remains of the vampire enclave liz and jake followed on behind trasks commandeered transport in their own vehicle they would be taking it easy so it shouldnt be a problem that theyd lost the windshield if they kept well back from trask the dust thrown up by his land rover wouldnt bother them and the cool night air would be a definite bonus just as they rolled onto the ramp cut in the steep face of the bluff jake slowed almost to a halt and looked back apart from the smoke there was very little to show for the earlier activity several members of the team dressed in fresh combat clothing but no longer armed or gasmasked were hammering sharp signposts into the stony earth one such post carried a legend only just visible in moon and starlight health hazard toxic waste keep out ebranch took no chances what next jake jerked his head to indicate the scene of recent devastation for this place i mean liz shrugged the mines sealed there are no life signs tomorrow the sun will come up and scorch the bluff clean maybe theyll bulldoze the surface and dynamite the ramp eventually but theres no real hurry now the main man was bruce trennier as yet only a lieutenant but a wouldbe lord if he had got away again her shrug tomorrow theyd be back to tracking him down again as it is the operation was a complete success and this was the first time youve seen this kind of action jake slipped the rover into third let gravity draw them down the dusty ramp how come you know so much more about this stuff than i do liz tossed her hair back ive had a little time to study what they do a the branch i mean a and im aware of my own talent which makes their talents so much more acceptable once you begin to realize that all the weird stuff is real its not so difficult to believe the weirdest stuff of all but jake only wondered and thats a good thinga to actually believe in all ofthispeut still it was hard to deny his own five senses assuming they were his own of course down on the level he turned onto the old road a quartermile ahead trasks tail lights glowed red i still cant accept that we were simply thrown in at the deep end jake said it was a test as trask told you liz answered i guess he knew that once wed actually experienced it gone up against the plague itselfwell that we really would accept it so why dont i jake wanted to know for a while she was silent letting the wind blow her hair back breathing the night air then she said jake about your story tonight in the ops room there are terrible experiences and there are terrible experiences there are monsters and monsters and i dont know which ones are the worst but your life has been one of extremes maybe if mine had been messed with as much as yours id start to wonder what was real too but this talent of yours thats really something else i mean what you did tonight wasa awasnt me he said sharply cutting her off and with a shake of his head i cant explain it any better than that try she said if we are to be partners surely you can try look this isnt something i suggest lightly a the branch has its own internal code of conduct for espers telepaths empaths and such a but if youll just let your thoughts flow free ill youll what he looked at her read my mind see if im as messed up as you suspect well i probably am probably have been ever sincesince natasha died the way she died then he sighed and relaxed a little on the other hand you could be right my life las been a mess and fate seems bent on screwing me around more than my fair share so is it any wonder i have a problem sorting out whats real from whats fantasy and as for ebranch jake shook his head wonderingly gadgets and ghosts a yeah and they want you for one of their gadgets she said huh he answered maybe one of their ghosts if things had gone wrong tonight youve changed the subject liz accused look back in the ops room you started to tell your story a good start but you didnt nearly tell it all now me im a hell of a listener and right now right here theres just the two of us oh really he said a good listener a and bloodthirsty with it like one of those things we destroyed tonight thats not fair liz answered and thats not the part that interests me she gave a little shudder i mean i know you killed all of those mena no not all of them jake said coldly castellano and one other theyve still got it coming aand that your methods wereextreme but thats not what im talking about ive heard ben trask going on about the way you use what he calls the mobius route thats your talent right jake its how you moved us to safety back at the lair he nodded growled and thats what i keep trying to tell you its not mine its like a i dont know a somebody else i f someone who gets into my head anyway someone whos living in there like a bloody squatter trask keeps mentioning this harry keogh well who is this keogh some kind of telepath and if so why is he so damned keen to mess with my mind why not pick on someone else someone more receptive no i cant see it maybe its a part of me that this me a i mean the real me a doesnt recognize like im aa split personality or something god maybe i really am crazy he banged on the steering wheel with the flats of his hands stamped his feet and set the landrover to swerving liz gave him time to cool down then said jake how can i get through to you this isnt just for me nor even for ben trask or his people its mainly for you i wish youd tell me about it how you escaped from jail and all and ended up with ebranch i know it happened but not how it happened so what do you say will you tell me and he knew she wouldnt let it go until he did i got sloppy jake began when i killed the third and last but one of castellanos men a of the men who had been present at the villa that night a it was a sloppy job a case of familiarity breeding contempt glancing at liz he shook his head i would really hate to think so hate to admit that i was getting used to it but who can say maybe i was at that anyway he was an italian and i killed him in italy and i got caught there too maybe they were waiting for me after all i had been working down a list like a serial killer you know of course castellano must by then have made the connection a must have figured out that this wasnt just another gang waraand its possible he had tipped off the authorities the police when i thought it out it was even possible hed sent that last victim out of france to put distance between himself and me if so then id actually managed to get to the bastard a id worried him considerably a which felt very good but in any case i was tried and convicted in italy and there was no hope of extradition having dual nationality a english and french a only made the legal side of it even more tangled complicated hopeless and to put the cap on it current european law made it imperative that i was tried in the country where the crime was committed for any serious offence against nationals of the said country well you cant get any more serious than murder which was their term for what id done even if i called it an act of justice and finally if found guilty a which of course i was a i would have to serve out my time in that same country thats why i think it was castellano who set the trap for me and baited it with his own man castellanos a sicilian or an italian if you like and its like trask says the gangs are highly organized now a computerized integrated and all a and as always they have their fingers in every pie so why do you reckon this bastard thug would want me in an italian jail obviously it was one of those pies in which he had a finger jake cutter was a dead man if not immediately then soon but to me the hell of it was id never been able to get a sniff of castellano himself the villa in marseille was always guarded to the hilt and if hed ever left itwell i certainly didnt know about it how could i i still didnt a still dont a even know what he looks like this is one secretive son of a bitch but i will find him one day and when i do but not while youre working for ebranch liz broke in the one thing you mustnt do is compromise the branch theyre your protection jake and youve got to remember trask is the only thing standing between you and a return visit to that cell inwhere in torino jake answered turin where theyre alleged to have found the shroud and where i was being fitted for one i tell you liz there were some hard men in that jail it took me maybe a oh twentyfour hours a to figure out that i wasnt getting out in one piece the looks the nudges the winks but what i said earlier about the size of myer you know what that wasnt true could have been but wasnt no one came sidling up to me offering their protection for a little buggery on the side i guess because the word had gone out that i couldnt be protected and that anyone who tried it might well need some protection himself and there were a couple of narrow squeaks knife fights i wasnt involved in to start with that i somehow got involved in and once in the prison hospital a i was in for abdominal bruising and a suspected fractured ribyes another one when someone tried to inject me with a hypodermic full of human shit anyway id been in there for eleven weeks when this guy a just a guy no one sinister i thought but someone who probably pitied me a got me on my own and told me that it was coming and when it was coming i had a week to live he said and no good going to the prison staff they were in on it and the governor was a man who knew which side his bread was buttered then a funny thing this same little fellow said he was working in the machine shop he gave me a rough key a just a strip of metal really a showed me how to make an impression of the lock on my cell this was an old old prison liz not like the home from home youll find in a lot of modern english jails anyway you take the impression he said and i make finish the key so what was in it for him he already had his own key he said and a plan but he couldnt do it on his own and he figured i might be just desperate enough to go along with him oh he supposed i had seen those old prison movies a of the double doublecross kind a but hey it was his life too wasnt it did i think he was suicidal or something so maybe he was but hed got one thing right at least i was desperate enough okay my reasons for wanting to escape were plain enough i wanted castellano dead and couldnt do it from inside where my own life seemed destined to be a pretty short one but what about my newfound friends reasons apparently it was for a woman a dear old friend of mine he fucking my maria he told me grinning emotionlessly the last man who did that he deadis why i in here this time i going fuck loth of them maria too after that i not care funny thing is i understood him well enough just didnt realize how far hed go to clear this little matter up thats all came the night we got out into the exercise yard way too easy and i felt it was all wrong all fixed but it was far too late to go back and lock myself inand what if i was simply being paranoid i mean this was my one last chance it was his one chance too this bald scrawny little italian murderer who made the keys his plan was simple he had a length of chain hed welded hooks to between us and freedom there was a twelvefoot wall barbedwired at the top he was a little guy he would get on my back use his chain like a grapnel to grab at the barbed wire hed tried it in the workshops and it worked by god it also worked out there in the exercise yard so paolo scrambled from my shoulders up the chain took a prison blanket from around his neck and tossed it over the barbed wire which his weight had pulled flat he balanced himself up there with a leg over the wall stretched out a hand for me but when i was on the chain and as i was reaching for his handhe withdrew it and i saw his eyes looking beyond me into the night i glanced over my shoulder saw them prison guards armed and taking aim i looked up at paolo his face staring down at me i sorry jake he shrugged but they promise me and then cutting him short the crack of a rifle shot jake paused swerving to avoid a pothole and liz took the opportunity to ask is that when it happened when youmoved he shook his head not quite but liz you know how they say you dont hear the one that kills you well its true i know because i heard the bark of that first shot but i didnt feel a thing paolo on the other handhis blood splashed me as his right eye turned black then he was falling and taking me with him it was only a few feet but with him on top of me i hit the ground like a ton of bricks just as well because there was more shooting shouting the flash of bullets sparking where they spanged off the wall thats when it happened but exactly what happenedi dont know to this day and something very weird if you dont hear the one that kills you how about seeing it i mean did you ever hear of anyone actually seeing a bullet in flight of course not and please no cracks about phoney stage magicians who catch them in their teeth yet i sawsomething a flash of fire from a ricochet it could be but it didnt look like fire it was tiny bright and it came came right at me a at my head a and couldnt have missed me if it had been a bullet then i was dead but it wasnt couldnt have been and i only thought i was dead liz nodded her mouth suddenly dry because for a moment as jake had finished speaking she had received a vivid impression of something alien to all science and knowledge something from outside shed seen his meeting a his confrontation a with what hed described a transitory thing it came and went like a bright flash of fire reflecting from the surface of his mindor still burning in his mind that was when you did it she said hoarsely and cleared her throat that was when you moved took the mobius route there was an indescribable darkness jake told her more than darkness a nothingness it was death i mean i thought it was death for what else could it be but i was drawn into and through it towards a point of light a typical outofbody experience liz said a neardeath experience as certain survivors are supposed to have known it the light which you refused to enter but jake shook his head refused nothing i had no choice i was dragged right in but suddenly there was gravity weight and id been struggling with the darkness a whatever it was a and the wrong way up i emerged upside down fell smacked my head against somethinga desk as it turned out so you see the second bout of darkness wasnt nearly so drastic i was merely unconscious or about to be anyway even as i passed out i remember there were alarms going off someone hammering at a door a voice shouting then nothing more not until you came to at ebranch hq in london liz said thats where your talent had taken you to harrys roomsanctuary he shook his head in denial not my talent oh someones as it appears harrys maybe but not mine liz not mine the radio crackled into life trasks voice saying all callsigns but especially hunter one this is zero one maybe five miles up the road from here the chuck wagon base camp where we eat drink and debrief those with beds in the ops vehicle use em tentage for the rest or should you prefer to stretch your legs you can put up your own tents and bivouacs and hunter one ill be wanting to speak to you all acknowledge hunter one roger liz answered into her handset and in strict numerical order coming through the hiss and crackle of static hunter two roger hunter three roger and so on jake shifted his position in the drivers seat craned his neck and glanced back along the dark winding road through the ancient river valley back there stretched well out a handful of headlights made a lantern string in the night and from dragonfly shapes on high came the steady neardistant whup whup whup of powerful blades slicing the air the occasional flickering beam of a searchlight five miles liz said maybe seven or eight minutes will you tell me the rest of it while we still have time the rest of it jake was reluctant again you still need convincing im crazy youre not crazy she said just troubled come on jake you ran away escaped again this time from ebranch what happened how did that come about was it any different he sighed and said once you stick your claws in you just dont let go do you or could it be that im simply fascinated she answered and quickly added er with your story i mean huhake snorted but he also angled his face a little turned it away from her liz could have sworn that he was grinning and didnt want her to see but that was a good thing okay she said im fascinated period so now will you tell me the rest so you can report it to trask right well ive got news for you your boss a our boss a has already had this from me oh at least a dozen times dont you get it i cant tell you what isnt there then tell me what is she said again jakes sigh before he succumbed to the inevitable but then okay this is how it was when a or rather where a i woke up everyone was speaking english i dont know what i thought oh several things a jangle of things rattling around in my skull maybe following injuries sustained in the failed jailbreak id been extradited back to england after all but what injuries while its true i was flat on my back with a sheet and blanket thrown over me i didnt feel in any way injured also i was in no way conscious of the passage of any real time it felt like snapi had been in turin and now was here so logically while this wasnt the prison it had to be a place somewhere in or near turin as for the people trask and co a they werent jailers or even physicians so if this place was a hospital well it wasnt like any id ever heard of and they kept asking me a lot of nonsense questions the silliest with regard to my identity who are you they all wanted to know huh who were they kidding if they didnt know who i was who would who was p but the question i kept asking myself was who the hell were they then a real doctor arrived who checked me over giving me a thorough physical before i was allowed up on my feet i supposed i was lucky that i hadnt at first been able to talk even if id wanted to the whole experience had struck me dumb but then it dawned on me that they really didnt have any idea who i was so why should i tell them i kept quiet told them nothing didnt even speak but traskhe knew i wasnt on the level right from square one i could see that he was more than curious positively suspicious about me i suppose he had every right to be i know now that the place i a er emerged into harrys room a is highly significant to the branch more than that though trask knew i was lying even without me saying a word he knew i wasnt telling the truth knew i was hiding something well of course i was wherever id escaped to anywhere had to be better than the vermininfested slaughterhouse in turin that id escaped from and yes i had already made up my mind that as soon as this weird crowd gave me room to breathe id likewise be escaping from here a wherever here was finally instead of asking me stuff and getting no satisfactory answers no answers at all trask said youre in the headquarters of a branch of government a very offlimits establishment mrwhoever you are you shouldnt be here and the penalty for trespass is a high one but im really interested in you in how you arrived a especially where you arrived a and id very much like you to start explaining if you dont ill have to assume youre a common criminal and deal with you on that basis but then he got a certain look in his eye like hed suddenly stumbled across the truth a maybe a truth even i didnt know a and quickly went on or maybe an uncommon criminal in which case we might just be getting somewhere some of trasks people had guns and there didnt seem too much point in trying to break out of there not at present so i just had to keep playing along finally i was escorted to the hq ops room jake glanced at liz do you know the place i take it youve been there he waited for her nod the one word that summed up her own feelings the first time shed seen the ops room awesome yes awesome he agreed i dont know about ghosts but ebranch certainly has the gadgets anyway as soon as we entered a before anyone could stop me a i stepped to a window and yanked the blinds it was night but there were plenty of street lights there could be no mistaking where i was the very sight of it set me reeling that skyline that city impossible but it was westminster london the centre of bloody london and grabbing me looking at me with those allseeing eyes of his trask said surprise surprise so where did you think you were mr nobody by then a lot of other people had arrived theyd got the place up and running it was the middle of the night after all and my being there was just as big a maybe a bigger a shock to them as it was to me but they must have a good emergency callin the place was fully operative in no time at all and every manjack and woman of them wideeyed whispering curiousmaybe even awestruck but why what was so special about me anyway things were happening at a rapid pace prison clothing trask said at a guess continental very well get fingerprints mug shots a do it now then get a link to interpol see if we can get a match but lets not get carried away not yet lets not think the unthinkable or the incredible check the security system and see if it recorded a physical breakin and lets have a check on all doors and windows and the elevator then get me the duty officer didnt i hear him saying something about not being able to get into harrys room because the door was locked now why would mr nobody here first break in then lock himself in and how could he do it anyway without a keyassuming he broke in at all trask said all of these things if not in the same words and he probably said a lot more that i cant remember before he finished up with answers people i want all the answers and i do mean tonight i had been fingerprinted and photographed by the time two new agents entered the ops room trask greeted them with current affairs and tomorrows affairs and not before time you two liz nodded said millicent cleary and lan goodly millicent is a telepath but shes also an expert in current affairs she has that kind of memory you want to know whats gone down in the last ten years ask millicent and lan goodlya aa precog jake said yes i know that now but then a i couldnt make head nor tail of their conversation trask wanted to know why goodly hadnt seen anything and he asked the woman if she was getting anything that was the way he talked to everyone around him it all seemed pretty esoteric to me espers have an almost different tongue liz answered it takes some getting used to anyway lan goodly was at a loss to explain his lapse and the woman millicent cleary she stared hard at me frowned and said there was a lot of confusion damn right there was the confusion was in you liz told him looking back on it youre dead right he said and after a moment by then all the wall screens were up and working a people processing my pictures and feeding them into machines computer keyboards tap tap tapping away a but i was a little less the centre of attention i saw my chance snatched a gun from a man who was momentarily distracted grabbed hold of goodly i had the gun to his neck his arm up behind his back for a moment i thought trask and the others might rush me but then goodly said its okay ben everything will be fine just let us go and be sure well be back i told him do you want to bet but nowim glad he didnt ill cut a long story short i got goodly out of there and into the elevator he used his card without argument then we were out in the street which was when he turned the tables on me how well i suppose he saw the future knew i wouldnt shoot him or maybe he saw that i couldnt anyway he just twisted round to face me grabbed the gun and started wrestling me for it i was so surprisedi just let go of the thing and the fact was i couldnt have shot him anyway not an innocent man but i couldnt say the same thing for him now could i and there he was crouching down aiming the gun at me the vehicle was nosing down a slight decline as they came round a shallow bend jake saw campfires and started to brake then a man stepped out onto the crumbling tarmac and made signals directing them into a makeshift roadside parking area as they slowed to a standstill liz sat still said finish it and jake thought why not except theres nothing left to tell or if there was he couldnt possibly explain it but he could at least try its already finished he said when i thought goodly was going to shoot me i made a dive for cover i mean i knew i was diving to safetybut that wasnt possible how could there be any cover any safety out there in the middle of the street there couldnt be she said no jake answered huskily pale in the flickering firelight there couldnt be not out theje in the street but it wasnt me who reacted to the perceived danger liz not me but someone in my head someone or something that reckoned i would be saferthat id be safera but liz reading it clearly in his mind came to his aid and finished it for himathat youd be much safer back in harrys room yes she sighed he shook his head frowned and said but safe from what from goodly who didnt intend to harm me in the first place she made no answer but thought no just safe a period maybe lan goodlys gun hadnt triggered the thing at all maybe it simply hadnt wanted jake out there on his own on the streets for whatever it was this thing had been new to him at that time still very strong in him a and having only recently found him a it hadnt been about to let him escape not without first exploring him and not until jake had explored its possibilities its potential such were lizs thoughts but bringing them back to earth were there said jake so are we going to sit here all night me id like a mug of coffee and a bite to eat chapter seven more gadgets and ghosts as liz and jake got out of their vehicle trask came over and checked it for damage a few scratches to the paintwork some small dents in the hood and the missing windscreen of course did you have this attended to liz knew what he was concerned about not the damage itself but rather its origin and any possible contamination that might have been left behind she nodded back at the old mine gas station a squad sprayed her down cleaned up the mess i worry thats all trask explained but having seen some of the measures the travellers take on sunside i suppose thats only natural he shrugged i dont knowmaybe im too cautious his reference to sunside flew over jakes head but he was getting used to that kind of thing i didnt see you taking too much care of yourself jake told him back there i mean you and the old man lardis it was as if you didnt give a damn between you no noseplugs or combat gear no gas masks no precautions trask looked at him a paradox is that what youre saying do as i say not as i do not really maybe one day ill tell you my story but couldnt it simply be that some of us have less to lose and before he could be asked to elaborate as for lardis lidesci hes been doing his own thing all his life perhaps theres a partial immunity among the szgany i cant say but even so i watch him just as he keeps his eye on everyone else and the day he gets rid of his silver bells or starts shrinking from the sun trask let it go at that maybe i havent been listening very much jake said in fact im sure i havent theres been too much happening a not only to me but all around me a for my tiny brain to accept it all at once but what if i start listening as of now am i asking too much that we sit down some time so you can fill me in put me fully in the picture about ebranch i mean if im to work for you isnt it only right i should know something of whats going on so youve finally decided youll work for us jake pulled a wry face actually i thought you had and the three of them walked together towards one of the campfires the rest of the vehicles were arriving and lining up on the road before being allocated parking areas making himself heard over the revving motors trask shouted a few instructions then answered jake oh i think theres work for you but there are still a few things i need to clear up if im to control you i need to know what im controlling he looked at the other his gaze seeming to pierce the younger man through and through and with a wry smile continued tve got to be sure you wont just cut and run a like maybe in a crisis when youre most needed after all you do still have your own agenda dont you ever trust anybody jake growled knowing that indeed trask had seen right through him but enigmatic as ever trask wasnt buying it in my time with the branch he said ive seen what trust can doand what its done to some of my favourite people they sat by the fire with one or two other agents most of them keeping to themselves lost in their own thoughts now that the nights work was done it was a night theyd been building up to for some time the old lidesci dished out food a steaks and steaming stew from a container on a military shallowtrench backburner and mansized chunks of bread fresh from the burners oven a but with the exception of lardis himself no one was much interested in eating maybe it was the backburners roar the way it sounded so much like a flamethrower by the time the three had done eating and washed the food down with mugs of coffee the big articulated truck was in situ and lan goodly had gone to check on incoming messages by then too the rest of the agents had sat down to eat and the atmosphere wasnt quite so heavy liz had been yawning for some time and though she swore she would never sleep still shed gone off to seek out a bivouac for herself watching her go jake put down his empty mug and said to trask me im not tired either in fact my mind is going every which way so all misgivings aside im asking you to tell me what ive got myself involved with how it all began and how you think i can fit in trask stood up and for a moment looked as if he might say something but just then lan goodly came striding from the direction of the ops vehicle on top of the first trailer in fact the mobile ops room a cluster of antennae and radio dishes had poked up locked into position and aimed themselves at the skyalso at several communication satellites ben goodly called in his piping voice david chung is on the wire from london you can get him onscreen if you want he got your message and he appears to be rather excited but as trask headed for the ops truck goodly had second thoughts at least he made it seem that way oh and ben er maybe you should take jake with you introduce him to david the two of them looked at each other in passing and jake could swear some sort of silent exchange took place then trask called back to him jake if youd still like to know how you might fit in perhaps you should come along with me in the ops room the duty officer and one other were on listening duty within the oval desk the do got out of the way when trask lifted a flap in the desk walked through and parked himself in the command chair jake followed and stood close behind him trask looked at the do and said chung london hq waiting the other nodded do you want him onscreen put him up there trask said indicating a screen on the wall and the do hit a switch as the other lights dimmed a little the wall screen flickered into life and its picture quickly firmed up this was the first time jake had seen ebranchs chief locator david chung he was small middleaged oriental as they come and very seriouslooking and he was quite obviously highly intelligent it was in his eyes just as it was in trasks a light behind them shining out but it was also in the high dome of his head jake didnt need advising of the extraordinary brain that was housed within chungs ravenblack hair was thinning there might even be a few strands of grey here and there but his skin was clear and unwrinkled and his posture was ramrodstraight he was sprightly alertand excited yes that too showed in his eyes hi david trask greeted him with a smile a but in a moment got down to business how did it go he said ben the other nodded then immediately fixed his attention on jake and jake could see that his curiosity was intense but trask had seen it too and save it he told the locator his tone of voice carrying something of a warning i suggest we deal with the other matter first and turning to the do are we scrambled yes the do nodded and chung said all bad news im afraid its as greenpeace and the others suspected in fact its worse then anyone suspected the russians are still doing it but now its where theyre doing it you know if wed had annamarie english in on this we could have cracked it without even leaving the hq i know trask answered his shoulders slumping a little but we dont have her and anyway shes happier where she is a god help us all but is it really as bad as you make out what yet another treaty gone up in smoke a or nuclear pollution i suppose youd better put me in the picture but not onscreen let me have a printout chung spoke to someone offscreen turned again to trask itll take a few minutes and later when ive done a little checking ill also be sending you er a weather report some unexpected smog but id like to check it out first and see if its still hanging around you know meanwhile what about the other business his gaze switched however momentarily to jake then back to trask understanding chungs coded message trask gave a cursory nod and said do you remember what happened at ebranch hq when nathan arrived in perchorsk i mean you personally do you remember how you proved his identity or his connection chung grinned his excitement plainly in evidence do i remember how could i ever forget im way ahead of you ben and he held up a hairbrush showing it to trask and jake i wasnt sure you still had it trask sighed his relief it wasnt in harrys room i had it searched immediately after jakecame visiting but i knew that if you had it it would be secure with your special items at the hq thats why i asked you to go and dig it out as soon as you got finished with what you were doing now the locator looked at jake again and said i suppose this is jake cutter he nodded a greeting so why is he looking so a what lost before trask could answer jake leaned over him and said i look so what lost as you put it a though personally id prefer stunned a because no one has bothered to tell me what the fuck is going on its okay for ebranch to put my life in jeopardy set me in conflict withi dont know a vampires mutated things alien invaders that live on the blood of human beings a but totally out of the question to tell me what its all in aid of the human race perhaps well great but since im a member dont have any rucking say in the matter right first time said trask and on both counts its in aid of the human race and no you dont have any say in the matter chung saw now why the head of ebranch was so cautious as yet jake cutter knew very little but chung was already certain that jake would have to know it all eventually and so he said thats fine for now ben but if youre asking for my opinion hell have plenty of say in the not too distant future trask quickly held up his hand we understand each other and thats for the future a maybe but dont say any more right now instead you can tell me about the brush oh its active chung said very definitely why its like a live thing in my hand even now he looked at the mans hairbrush a just a wellused wooden oval tufted with pig bristles some of them coming loose a and smiled but alive from what jake could make out the brush was about as dead asas a piece of wood sprouting pig bristles so said trask speaking to chung can i take it youre thinking that just like once before maybe something of a well lets for now call him a onafriend of ours a has come back to us but if so come back from where and in what form absolutely chung answered a then stopped smiling as the meaning of trasks words sank in and he began to understand the others caution and i think i see he said so now we must ask ourselves whether or not its beneficial is it here under the aegis of a friend to help us or is it herea afor something else trask cut the locator short and after staring at him for a long moment he said thats it for now david stay there at the hq the chairs yours until were all sorted out at this end okay whatever you say chung answered his face once more inscrutable and the do blanked the screen what was all that about jake queried the head of ebranch on the way to his tent trask had a room in the ops vehicle but preferred a little more space in keeping with his status his tent was somewhat bigger than a bivouac when we have a little light ill show you trask said some of it anyway from which time on youll need to be aware that youve signed the official secrets act but i havent jake said but if you ever give me reason ill say you have trask grinned his cold grin and youll have to anyway eventually jake snorted said could this mean youre actually going to let me in on some secret or other sarcasm will get you nowhere trask said except maybe in a whole lot of trouble the camp wasnt far from the edge of a watering hole several large australian night insects were fluttering occasionally buzzing through the smoky flickering firelight there were clusters of knobbly fatboled trees of a type jake didnt recognize trasks tent stood shaded by one of these in comparative darkness trask squeezed a rubber button on a cable hanging outside the tent and as a light glowed within he drew aside the canvas flap and a finemesh gauze fly screen to invite jake in inside a folding table supported trasks briefcase a bottle of liquor and two glasses there were folding chairs and a camp bed and in a screenedoff corner a portable toilet comfortwise it was better than a bivouac certainly but scarcely luxurious trask sat jake down opened up his crammed briefcase fumbled out a flat machine the size of a box of typing paper and flipped a switch the device whirred softly and a slot opened in one end feeding chungs printout into the slot trask said its enciphered and this is a decoder gadgets and ghosts said jake yes trask answered i have to agree this is certainly a gadget and chungs message is about ghosts a of a sort are you kidding me jake couldnt any longer be sure of anything i suppose i am trask suddenly looked tired though not necessarily dont you believe in ghosts jake and before the other could answer well these ghosts are submarines theyre dead russian subs yes a except theyre still very much alive another paradox not really just wait a minute and youll see what youll see meanwhile why dont you pour us a drink and consider yourself lucky its wild turkey jake poured the machine whirred eventually two sheets of paper slid from the slot pushed out and followed by the original one of the decoded sheets was alargescale map of europe and the seas around with numbered circled pinpoints of reference the other was a list of grid references numbered to correspond with those on the map all of the grid references were oceanic two pinpoints in the black sea off varna in bulgaria another off podisma in turkey two more in the tyrrhenian midway between naples and sardinia one in the atlantic off portugals algarve and three more between iceland and norway south of the arctic circle and there were others marked out by tiny question marks instead of dots looking at these little black marks on the map and matching them with the grid references trasks expression was very bleak look there he indicated the question marks as close to home as that the barents sea off norway crazy close to home jake echoed him close to the former soviet union trask answered odd because the russians are usually more careful than that chernobyl taught them that much of a lesson at least a taught them to look after their own anyway so maybe those two were accidental maybe they didnt intend for them to go down just there jesus but whatever they intended still its a mess im not with you said jake shaking his head then let me explain each of those pinpoints represents a hulk resting on the bottom but what kind of hulk the answers almost unbelievable but since ive already told you submarines trask nodded those innocuous little black dots each one of them is a disaster just waiting to happen or already happening theyre allegedly decommissioned nuclear subs we thought had been cleaned up made safe taken apart and stored with ten thousand tons of other radioactive rubbish years ago relics of russias penniless outmoded unwanted cold war navy yes but the russian military was lying to us a which is nothing new a and this is the truth and its a bad thing jake still didnt see it i mean that these things have been sent to the bottom miles deep out of harms way out of harms way god what an infant trask shook his head and before jake could get upset again look most of these subs have twin atomic engines there are two possible meltdowns in each hulk barely possible mind you but possible we dont know if theyve been shut down properly or even if they could be but the very means of disposal tells us theyre less than safe why else would the russian military dump them on someone elses doorstep whats more a since theyre capable of this a how do we know they didnt load them to the gills with other highlevel waste before scuttling them what they might have even left their leaking missile payloads aboard these were ships of war jake and sooner or later the bastard things will start spilling their guts what in ten twenty fifty years and a mile or so deep jake still wasnt too impressed and anyway what has this to do with you and ebranch trask scowled at him actually clenched a fist and thumped the table if annamarie english were here right nowshed knock you arse over breakfast astonished jake drew back annamarie english isnt she someone who chung mentioned she worked for us trask snapped an ecopath she gave warning of earths decline a i mean personally she was ecologically aware or as she herself would put it she was as one with the earth it was her talent a or her curse funny isnt it jake but there are very few in ebranch who are happy with their talents they would much prefer to be ordinary but since they cant be theyre ebranch jake wasntsure of trasks meaning so how did this help you her talent i mean how did it work trask shook his head none of us can tell you how our talents work only that they do in annamaries case as water tables declined and deserts expanded so her skin dried out became desiccated when acid rains burned the scandinavian forests her dandruff fell like snow in her dreams she heard whale species singing of their decline and inevitable extinction and she knew from her aching bones when the japanese were slaughtering the dolphins she was like a human lodestone she tracked illicit nuclear waste monitored pollution shrank from holes in the ozone layer annamarie was an ecopath jake she felt for the earth and suffered all its sicknesses because she knew that she was dying from them too trask was eloquent jake would grant him that much youre saying shes dead then no trask answered im saying shes somewhere else but by nowshe might well have started to suffer again yes he sighed and sat up straighter seemed on the brink of coming to a decision finally continued me i believe in ghosts jake i really do for ive seen a few in my time and they werent always of the moaning chainrattling and mainly harmless variety but i also believe in listening to my colleagues now it seems a ghost has come among us possibly a beneficial one well according to chung and goodly anyway unfortunately its come at a very bad time the coincidence is just too great a that this should happen now just as we find ourselves in conflict with the wamphyri and the plague theyve brought with them out of starside a for me to take any chances thats what holds me back from telling you everything the thought that perhaps you are an agent albeit an unwitting agent of the wamphyri me jakes surprise couldnt have been more genuine and trask a human lie detector knew it more certainly than any other man ever could ah but trask remembered other times when harry keogh had fooled him too and jake went on how in hell could i be anyones agent and im certainly no ghost no trask agreed but whats in you might be whats in me dont play the fool jake trask snapped were talking about whats in your head this talent youve suddenly come by which brought you to ebranch and then returned you there when you tried to run off but is it the ghost of harry keogh a or is it something that merely tastes like him should i take you into my confidence or shoot you dead right here and now jake started to his feet and upset the table his face was a snarl his hands reaching for trask ive had it up to here with your threats and your bullying youre an old man trask and as far as im concerned youre an old fraudtoo but by then hed seen the gun that trask had been holding under the table it was aimed right at him and he understood the others apparent fumbling when hed taken the decoder from his briefcase but what he didnt understand was the way trask stared at him the urgent burning question in his penetrating gaze what would you have done trask snapped what would you have done to me done jake looked at the gun then at trask nothing ii might have shaken you or tried to shake some sense into you or maybe id have tried shaking a little out of you god cant you see youve got me going in circles and trask actually smiled as he slowly lowered his gun and put it away yes i can see that he nodded with which jake got the idea what another bloody test to push you hard trask told him and see what answered youor something else well if i were you jake said i would have supposed it was something else but youre not me trask told him and you passed that leaves just one more test to go then lets get it over with not now no when then tomorrow morning im having a man flown in from carnarvon on the coast an expatriate brit and the best in his field what yet another great talent jake was still angry not the way you mean trask shook his head but he has talent enough yes oh and by the way thats some temper you have jake you said you might have shaken me well you shook me all right i thought you might actually attack me jake relaxed a little grinned i scared you i was scared i might have to shoot you yes but before that could start jake off again a voice called from outside the tent mr trask phillips here we have a bit of a problem a male figure stood silhouetted behind the gauze fly screen trask let him in said shouldnt you be on your way to carnarvon would be said the other if not for this problem its name is peter miller and it wont get its ugly arse out of my chopper the speaker was small and young and looked very hot sticky and agitated in his flyers gear millers in your machine trask raised an eyebrow then nodded decisively so he wants out of here and once away he intends to take his story to the authorities or worse to some newspaper or other well it cant be allowed yes i want rid of him no i dont want the trouble hell bring only a handful of people in the very highest places know what were doing and if were compromised it will make them look bad as for the man in the streetwell its simply out of the question the worlds insecure enough as it is he turned to jake go and find lardis lidesci will you bring him to the chopper park in the clearing on the far side of the road and speaking again to phillips you and melets go and have a word with mr miller just what is that fat jerk doing here anyway jake wanted to know he was supposed to give us some legitimacy trask answered hes liaison a gobetween thats all but he took his job too seriously discovered the location of our original base camp near lake disappointment which is after all his province and since then hes insisted on staying aboard well with us is one thing but against us is another now after seeing far too much of what were about hes all too eager to leave i cant very well stop him but i really should warn him against doing anything stupid now go and get lardis will you and trask and phillips went off through the night the old lidesci was in a foldaway chair dozing by the guttering campfire but as jake approached he gave a start and looked up eh what is it trask wants you jake told him at the helicopter park some trouble with mrs miller mrs eh lardis frowned at first then burst out laughing oh hahaharut you know the truth is ive been thinking much the same thing how that poor excuse for a man reminds me of a chattering old woman a week on sunside would sort that one out i fancy but no nothe poor bastard wouldnt last but a day jake assisted him to his feet and the old lidesci stamped his left foot a little cramp he said im getting past it we call it the crippler where im from but its rheuma er rheumaa er rheumatism jake said damn right said lardis its rheumatism here ah but its a sod in any world and with the old man leaning a little on jakes arm they made for the road and the helicopter park chapter eight miller and the trouble with dreams in the helicopter park voices were raised in anger one was a rasp ben trasks and the other was highpitched shrill and threatening in short blustering but the mind behind it held threatening knowledge certainly try to see sense man trask was growling as jake and lardis approached the welllit area where a handful of branch agents and chopper ground staff stood in a clearing and watched the show sense sense miller was in one of the two helicopters belted into a passenger seat near the section of aluminium frame that formed both cabin wallpanelling and steps at present the steps were down and miller was seated opposite the open door from where he looked down on trask outside the aircraft what are you telling me my attitude is nonsensical but i know what i saw tonight and it wasnt of this earth it was intelligent and alienoh and it was ugly yes but i also saw the devastating force that your thugs used against it which was even more inhuman so who the hell are you mr trask some kind of monster yourself you and your people youre not the military not even australian its obvious to me that youve duped somebody somewhere as for those poor aliens whoever they are and wherever theyre from they deserved a lot better welcome than you gave them this is earth year a dedicated to the ecological survival of the planet a r and you might well have condemned our world to interplanetary isolation worse we may even find ourselves at war the precog lan goodly stepped out of the shadows and spoke to jake and lardis this idiot obviously has some kind of bee in his bonnet the flying saucers have landed and all that rot he seems to think weve been murdering aliens a visitors from another world that is a out of hand havent we jake looked at him no goodly answered we killed invaders visitors dont arrive uninvited stay and kill off or enslave the occupiers but invaders frequently doand the wamphyri always do not knowing everything miller sees our action tonight as an unprovoked assault a preemptive strike against beings whose intentions hadnt been fully determined we on the other hand a knowing the entire story having been here or there before a see it differently we see tonights action for what it really was the only cure for a nightmarish plague that submits to no other antidote and meanwhile miller come down out of there trask was insistent the airplane youre sitting in has been serviced and fuelled for an important mission youre cutting into a tight schedule thats mr miller to you the other snapped and im delighted to be disrupting your vile schedule what am i preventing another massacre like the one you organized tonight good my god how many of these poor people have landed then you see goodly muttered theyre poor people now i meanis miller unbalanced or what he had a ringside seat for tonights show yet hes still not convinced lardis had seen and heard more than enough freeing himself from jakes helping hand he moved up alongside trask and in a lowered tone said why dont you just drag his arse out of there i was trying to be diplomatic trask answered under his breath it didnt work said lardis trask nodded and said thats why i sent for you then turning away he said get him out of there and bring him to the big ops truck maybe his own authorities can convince him for i certainly cant jake help lardis after hes got miller down from there why dont i just do it for him jake was surprised the old boy wellhes old trask agreed hes full of old ways too so dont worry hell manage okay and probably scare miller half to death into the bargain serve the bastard right and without another word he went on his way and lan goodly went with him meanwhile lardis had climbed the steps leaned inside the choppers open door and was showing miller his machete sharp as a razor he said you could shave with this a except youd get tired holding it up to your face see these notches in the grip twentyseven of em twentyseven execa er excecua er killings yes and all of them were these people you seem so fond of dyou know why i killed em bloodthirsty old lunatic miller hissed well i dont know where you come from a what reservation a but where im from were educated and civilized dont try to threaten me i dont give afuck for your big knife which was more bluster for anyone in his right mind would certainly give a fuck about lardiss machete and millers language was slipping too in any case it was as if lardis hadnt even heard him i killed em cause they eat fat little girls like you he said cause theyre a containa er a contamina er contamination said jake from the foot of the steps damn right lardis nodded he put the point of his machete up to millers neck inside the nylon seat belt and continued now ben trask wants you to come down out of there he was asking you nicely because he believes in being diplomatic but me i dont miller tried to cringe away from the glittering blade but his no in seat belt trapped him in position are youdo you dare to threaten me he gasped dare to threaten you said lardis his dark eyes narrowing to slits hell no mr miller this isnt a threat but a promise if you dont move your arse out of there im going to cut your fucking ears off and he made a sudden slicing motion with his machete miller screamed aloud and for a moment jake thought that lardis really had cut him but no hed sliced upwards and outwards and his finehoned blade had passed with scarcely a hiss through millers seat belt above the shoulder miller had been straining away from the old lidesci freed from the safety harness he jerked from his seat in that direction and fell to his hands and knees on the helicopters floor lardis stepped over him and while the little fat man was still offbalance grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and the seat of his pants to send him bouncing down the steps it didnt take too much effort millers blubber saved him from any real hurt but still he yelped as he hit the dirt yelped yet again as jake hoisted him to his feet a only to put him in an arm lock mr trask is waiting for you jake told the babbling fat man as he frogmarched him in the direction of the operations truck in ops trask stood inside the oval control desk speaking earnestly into a telephone yes i appreciate the lateness of the houri understand perfectly sir and i agree entirely but in this case im sure that only the highest authority will sufficeyou may believe me when i tell you that this really is as important as your minister for internal security has reported a matter of the gravest security i certainly wouldnt have had you brought from your bed for anything lesshes called peter miller sir a thats mr miller a our socalled local liaison not very helpful sir no indeed completely hysterical as ive saidthats what i would suggest yes absolutelyuntil were finished here yes that is of course if youre in agreement confinement im afraid so yes oh we have the means but miller a mr miller a is an australian citizen sir and were not which is why i need your trask looked up saw millers face throbbing with rage and righteous indignation where jakes hand was clamped over his mouth the sight of the man in no way pacified seemed to convince trask of the course he must take and perhaps youd like to have a word with him in person he continued into the phone see for yourself as it were with a nod and a grimace he passed the phone to miller at the same time indicating that jake should release him miller shook himself reeled and said eh what intent on freeing himself from jakes grasp hed taken in very little of trasks conversation with the unknown other but now trask said its for yousomeone who wants to know how youre keeping bloody crazy pommy bastards miller raved and who the hell is this the primebloodyminister he snatched the telephone from trasks hand yelled whoever you are the man you were speaking to is not a reasonable human being hes fucking british a fucking murderer and im a godfearing completely innocent fucking australian this is my goddamned country for christs sake and i demand to speak to the police to the military to someone in authority to to the primebloodyminister perhaps said ben trask coolly examining his fingernails and under his breath to the others in the trailer lance blackmore whose platform slogan if i remember correctly was sanity sobriety and common decency in speech and spirit oh and something else hes decidedly probritish millers round face was suddenly wobbling its colour visibly changing paling eh he gulped do i what your voice do i recognize it well maybe he didand maybe not with his pigeyes narrowing he stared suspiciously at the phone a then at trask a and spat some lousy fucking pommy con man you are and this is supposed to be lance bloody blackmore right oh really what at two oclock in the morning after what ive seen and been through tonight you expect me to believe that my own prime minister the australian primebloodyminister would condone but the telephone was making loud noises in millers ear and suddenly his face was floppily mobile again for this time the owner of the now angry voice was fully awake and the voice itself unmistakable as millers flabby mouth fell open trask took back the telephone and spoke into it there you have it prime minister now you know what were up against and a moment later yes certainly i shall see to it myself physical restraint a house arrest shall we say a until were through here thank you and there will be a copy of my report on this phase of the operations on your desk by noon yes so far its looking good my pleasure sir thank you once again and goodnight he put the phone down it was him miller gasped his mouth opening and closing like a stranded fish it really was lance blackmoref clenching his pudgy fists he glowered at trask you duped him you even duped the prime minister who the fuck are you people trask shook his head in disgust once your minds made up it really is made up isnt it miller thats mr millera oh shut the fuck up trask was mad now he reached over the desk grabbed the fat man by the front of his sweaty shirt bunched a fist and drew it backthen thought better of it instead he gave him a shove sent him reeling back into jakes arms and before miller could start up again youre under arrest if you protest too loudly ill have you gagged if you come on all physical ill have you bound if you attempt any interference with the work going on around you ill put you under constant surveillance by lardis lidesci and if youre stupid enough to make another run for it then youd better be aware ill deal with youfar more severely have i made myself clear why youyou miller mouthed his furious expression speaking volumes more than all of his frothing bluster and so when i turn you over to your internal security people in perth tomorrow trask went on theyll read you the riot act demand that you sign an oath of silence give you to understand how very much in error you are and generally threaten you with all sorts of dire things if you so much as mention anything you witnessed as our regional liaison person during this operation and believe me miller even if they cant make it stick i can dont for a moment think im going to forget the trouble youve put me to and something else you should remember in this modern world of ours distance isnt a problem ill be back in the uk shortly a i hope a but i have the longest arms in the world and if i ever suspect that youre out there somewhere flapping those soft selfrighteous lips of yoursa trask paused for breath and lardis lidesci said athen hell send me to stop you flapping them a perhaps permanently the old lidesci stood in the narrow doorway holding his machete to his chest thumbing its blade and turning it in his hand to make it reflect the ops rooms lights into the fat mans eyes twentyseven notches remember miller but in your case id just love to make it twentyeight miller flinched a little but his expression didnt change and again he blurted youyouyou obviously i havent made myself clear trask sighed and to jake see if theres a spare bunk room back there will you and lock this fuckhead safely inside it and that was that for the moment finally they could all get some sleep to some a jplessing but jake cutter didnt much care for sleep for some time now in fact since his weird escape almost a week ago sleeping had been a problem oh he could do it and he could do with it a indeed his eyes felt heavy from the lack of it a but he didnt want to do it because when he went to sleep that was when the other woke up that bloody other that one who was there in the back of his mind and when jake sleptwhy then he couldnt be sure that his dreams were his at all he hadnt told ben trask about it mainly because he suspected that trask would be interested it was the relationship that was developing between them just as the head of ebranch continued to hold things back so did jake cutter in his book trust was something that could only work if it was mutual and so he was left to face it on his own and sleep was a necessity he avoided as best he could while yet recognizing of course that it was a necessity it wouldnt be so bad a or so he told himselfa if only he could remember what these troubled dreams of his were about afterwards when he was awake or then again maybe it would and maybe that was why he couldnt remember them because he didnt want to lardis lidesci sat with jake a while heaped a little wood on the dying fire opened a can of sausages and beans in tomato sauce and ate them cold the old lidesci smacked his lips appreciatively some of the things in this world he said then started again ahell no most of em a i could do without but a canopener and a can of beans he grinned smacked his lips again and shook his head well these beans and the meat in these sausage things theyre a sight easier on these gnarly old tusks of mine than roasted shad i can tell you shads a fish jake said tiredly in this world sure lardis nodded but the first time i see a fish pull a caravanill quit drinking plum brandy and thats a vow he held the empty can in one hand the canopener in the other looked at each in turn admiringly burped and uttered a sigh but since my people dont have cans what goods a canopener you and trask could drive a man mad jake told him without looking up you come up with this weird stuff right out of the blue as if im supposed to know what the hell youre talking about i mean ive seen enough now to know this isnt some gigantic legpull so what the hell is it hells just about right lardis grunted creaking to his feet he laid a hand on jakes shoulder but son take my word for it bens not trying to drive you mad and neither am i it could be we say these things hoping youll recognize something hoping youll perhaps remember there was something in lardiss gruff old voice that caused jake finally to look at him but remember what he said and it was as if they stared deep into each others souls so that for a moment a just for a moment a it seemed that they had known each other oh for quite some time then lardis nodded and as though he had read jakes mind said other times maybe other places times and places though jake tried hard to understand still it was beyond him make sense cant you there was no anger now just a need to know a time on starside perhaps lardis said still staring hard at jake when a man and his changeling son laid waste to the aeries of the wamphyri or a time when the same man lay in the arms of a wonderful woman whose name was nana kiklu or a time when we met a met for the last time that man and i a in the ruins of the dwellers garden when it was already far too late for him lardiss words conjured pictures that came and went they meant something a jake knew that much at least a but they were monochrome things they flickered like the frames of some ancient silent moviejerky scenes and twitching puppet figures and despite that jake thought he recognized some of them still it was as if he saw them through someone elses eyes he looked down on a plain of boulders lit silvergrey beneath a tumbling moon where distant spires climbed to a sky of icechip stars and that alien sky was alive with flying beasts whose weird shapes god those shapes designs not of nature but of nightmare as quickly as it had come the scene was gone disappeared and another took its place a garden a the garden a where a younger lardis stood by a wall and gazed upon a scene of desolation a windmills crumpled vanes slumped all lopsided atop a skeletal tottering timber tower some of the roofs of low stone dwellings hadfalien in the trout pools were green with algae and the greenhouses were tangles of shattered frames leaning or fallen flat with clumps of bolted vegetation sprouting through their torn plastic sheeting the pictures continued to flicker and blur and the oddly young lardis turned jerkily to stare at jakeor at the one gazing back at him through jakes eyes but in this notsoold lidescis eyes there was fear and in his hands a shotgun that came swingingframe byjlickeringframe a click clicketyclick a in jakes direction and the look in lardiss eyes was no longer fear or not entirely but fear combined with deadly intent abruptly the scene changed to the straining face of a handsome woman handsome yes but by no means beautiful a yet beautiful too in her way her body was beautiful certainly and hands on her breasts where they lolled in his face and her breathlike jire in his flared nostrils and the sweat of her passion as slippery and hot on his hands as the wet core of her womanhood where it sheathed his jerking flesh nana nana jake exclaimed as the scene slipped from memory a but his memory a and he found himself seated by the campfire his hands before his face perhaps to fondle the handsome womans breasts anyway or perhaps to ward off lardis lidescis shotgun well there was the old man sure enough but now more surely the old lidesci as jake knew him and he had no shotgun but a strange satisfied look on his face and its nana is it lardis said with a knowing nod as jakes mind swam back into focus and he slowly lowered his trembling hands took you back a ways didnt i my young friend whatwhat did you do to me jake whispered the words sighing out of him i have an ancestors seers blood in me lardis answered it smells things out and i think that it has smelled you out too jake cutter for just as this art of my forebears has been passed down to me so something has been passed to you its in you man not in your blood as it was in nestors and nathans blood but buried in your mind and your soul for sure and now the look on the gypsys face was one of awe as much as anything else its in me yes jake agreed knowing it was so and then coming very close to desperation but what is it lardis what is it the other shook his head no no ben wouldnt want me to say any more indeed hed nag that ive already said too much it will have to take its own good time thats all but whats in will out of that you can be sure and now goodnight to you jake cutter with which he backed off and like the wild thing he was faded into the night maybe jake had been too tired to dream or perhaps he had managed to fight it off this time whichever he had slept deeply soundly and dreamlessly and remembered coming awake only once when hed thought hed heard a vehicles engine starting up then hed eased his cramped body off the chair zipped himself into a sleeping bag and curled up right at the edge of the fires cooling embersa aand now came starting awake as the toe of a boot nudged him and trasks voice rasped jake get up have you seen anything of miller obviously not well the fat bastards run out on us and in your bloody vehicle damn i thought for a moment youd gone with him throwing back the mosquito net from his face jake unzipped the bag and struggled out of it now he remembered the engine starting up dipped headlamps swinging faint beams out onto the road and the cautious crunch of tyres on dirt and pebbles he had thought at the time that someone was being very careful not to awaken the campand hed been only too right my vehicle he mumbled but trask had already moved on the entire camp was coming awake and overhead the shrill pulsing whistle of a jetcopter cutting its thrusters the whupa whup a whup of its vanes lowering it down from a sky in which the stars were only just beginning to fade and the first faint nimbus of dawn silhouetting the treetops and shining on rising writhing wisps of mist hells teeth lardis lidesci groaned where he came stumbling from the direction of the big articulated ops vehicle as he came his trembling right hand gingerly explored a blackened patch of bloodied matted hair on the left side of his head it looked ugly and was made to look worse by a flow of blood that had run down and congealed around his ear damn the bloody man to hell he said meeting him halfway trask grunted miller wouldnt you just know it lardis nodded then groaned and held his head again i bedded down under the steps at the back of ops and i heard something in the dead of night something breaking but these damned short nights of yoursmy systems all out of kilter with themim used to sleeping not these forty winks that you people take you didnt wake up till too late trask grunted im not a damned watchdog lardis snapped trask shook his head tm not blaming you lardis hell i didnt think the crazy bastard had enough guts to make a run for it so if its anyones fault its mine i should have posted a guard on him lan goodly came loping looking more than a little angry with himself the camps awake he said sourly trask looked at him and growled you too it seems were each and every one of us blaming himself but im the precog goodly chewed on his top lip right trask agreed but one man cant foresee it all and lets face it if you could anticipate everything that was coming then i would probably have killed myself a long time ago yes goodly nodded but damn it i did see this one you what jake was wide awake now so why didnt you do something i saw it in my sleep the precog answered saw it as a dream hub when is a dream not a dream when its a glimpse of the future but even if id known what it was how would i have woken myself up when youre asleep youre asleep and the future guards its secrets well and i thought i was the only one who was having problems with his dreams jake said at which trask looked at him very curiouslybut only for a moment there was too much to do okay trask said lets forget it im to blame lardis is to blame lan is to blame and so is jakea me jake raised an eyebrow for leaving the keys in your rover trask nodded anyway no one is really to blame the problem is weve grown too used to dealing with the weird the abnormal the monstrous i mean if its mundane we tend to let it slide and you couldnt ask for anything more mundane than mr bloody miller i beg to differ said goodly eh trask looked at him can i put you fully in the picture now the precog said and when trask nodded millers a strange one goodly continued when finally i woke up i was worried about my dream so i went to see if everything was okay i missed lardis where miller must have pushed him back out of sight behind the trailers steps but i found the duty officer hes going to be okay but he too had been bashed on the head he was lying in the corridor outside millers bunk with the door on top of him theyre pretty flimsy those doors the hinges had been worked loose i wasnt sure how long the dod lain there so i checked that he was okay then went to see if the ops room was safe the place was working as normalincoming that is several messages waiting for answers and situation reports coiling up on the floor there was some cosmic secret stuff that the do must have been processing when miller attracted his attention quite a bit of it had been decoded then i remembered how youd asked for background information on miller that was there too coming out of the printer even as i got there but there was stuff that should have been there and wasntlike a lot of cosmic secret stuff from hq the printouts had been ripped through and some of the serials were missing well need to get them duplicated find out what was on them anyway i grabbed the stuff on miller then began to wake people up now theyre all awake though i dont see what they can do to help oh yes and heres all the background information on miller he thrust some sheets of printout at trask but before trask could even begin reading goodly went on miller isnt as mundane as you think ben but he is an obsessive nut and the black sheep of the family his uncle was big in western australian politics got him work as a minor official in a job where he didnt have a lot to do but could indulge his thirst for powerain however small a way why else do you suppose hes the guardian of a million square miles of nothing to keep him out of the way thats why good grief and we had to get lumbered with him come to think of it its likely that that too came about as a result of his uncles influence okay his obsessions anything i mean it this fellow can get hooked on literally anything an obsessive personality its as simple a or not as simple a as that but guess what back in the late s early s he saw close encounters and et a well who didnt but this is peter miller were talking about he joined a whacky ufo group of which hes still a member and wrote two friendly aliens are here books that didnt get published need i say more no way you could have convinced this bloke that we were in the right last night ben no way at all i see said trask and after he had given it a moments thought do we have any idea how long hes been gone judging by the dos signatures in the message log maybe three three and a half hours goodly answered trask nodded then he could be anywhere by now two hundred and more miles away for all we know so no good our trying to chase him very well here are the priorities i want lardis and the do taken care of as best possible and i want a man a you lan a in the ops chair sending out wanted notices to all the police authorities in a two hundred miles radiusbetter make it three hundred milesor better still all of western australia but on second thought no wait send out just one to the internal security people in perth hes their man after all so let them go after him oh and check that they have his profile too which ought to scotch any wild stories that miller may be circulating and finally i want to know what was on those missing printouts trask paused shrugged and eventually continued anyway theres one good thing come out of all this i wont be wasting half a day handing miller over to the is people in perth and as for right nowim hungry he headed for the trench with the backburner which someone had fired up tm going to have breakfast by which time an agent was tending to lardis and all over the camp sleepylooking people were on the move the jetcopter had landed and phillips the pilot was leading a tall grizzled stranger a strange to jake anyway a through the grey predawn light between the trees into the camps clearing trask spotted them as they came striding through thinning ground mist waving to attract their attention he diverted his steps in their direction jake followed on behind him grahame trask smiled a greeting if its no the laird himself its been quite a few years now but while jake might wonder at trasks assumed accent the strangers seemed perfectly in keeping and went well with the swing of his kilt aye that it has he rumbled through the full grey beard that gave him his grizzled aspect grinning to display a bar of strong square teeth what twelve years how goes it with you benjamin you and yere bleddy gadgets they shook handsbut in the next moment the strangers searching eyes those oh so dark eyes of his transferred their gaze to jake and thisll be the subject is it no part two it is trask nodded as for the gadgets a like the one that flew you here in a matter of hours a well theyre improving all the time if that in itself can be considered an improvement but to be truthful which i always am i find it harder and harder to keep up future shock or something anyway its not that side of the equation that concerns us not this time then if its no the gadgets it must be the ghosts said the other still staring at jake and trask nodded one ghost anyway he said the why of it chapter nine regression as they seated themselves at a folding table to a breakfast of black coffee in plastic mugs and bacon and eggs on paper plates trask made belated introductions jake cutter mah guid friend here is grahame mcgilchrist laird o kinlochry but then he ahemmed his embarrassment and went on who despite my atrociously false and corny accent is the genuine article shaking hands with the big scotsman across the table jake said a scottish laird living on the other side of the world there has to be something of a story in that no much o a one the other rumbled its simply a matter o choice see the mcgilchrist estate went broke all o a hundred years ago oh ah had mah crumblin old castle but in truth ah wiz a figurehead in the local community and that wiz a but ah still had mah pride so when a cousin o mine pegged it out here in oz and left me his wee place in carnarvon ah came out and took over that was some nine years ago that wee place grahames talking about trask cut in is two and a half thousand acres of wellwatered farmland east of carnarvon if he wanted to sell up he could go back home and be a proper laird again but ah willnae do it mcgilchrist said ah have lads tae tend mah land and animals while ah have mah own interests he has a practice in carnarvon trask explained his own special slant on psychiatry aye and there ye have the other reason why ah made mahsel scarce frae they socalled british isles mcgilchrist cocked his head frowned at trask and winked at jake tae escape frae these bleddy ebranch types he worked for us a while trask said but jake had been quick to catch on to something else psychiatry he said suspiciously and im the subject liz merrick appeared out of nowhere looking great in black slacks cowboy boots and a frilly white blouse seating herself beside jake she said and a suitable subject at that thanks jake told her sourly while he waited for trasks or mcgilchrists explanation and hypnotic regression trask said without further preamble thats grahames speciality its not a talent as recognized by ebranch a that is it isnt some strange parapsychological ability though the way it works for grahame it might well be a but it does come in useful in cases like yours cases like mine again jake waited where the subject has subconsciously deleted some part of his memory trask said or something else has blocked ita aor he has simply forgotten it mcgilchrist finished it for him yere no a nutcase if thats whats bothering ye you dont know him yet said liz and jake scowled mcgilchrist grinned at liz across the table and said will one o ye kind gentleman no introduce me tae this beautiful wee thing oh ah ken ahm a mite late a a mite too old maybe a but still ahd like tae be in wi a chance too late liz blushed at his words but mcgilchrist simply looked at jake smiled and went on eating jake had been studying the scotsman and despite his apprehension he discovered that he liked him mcgilchrist seemed as open as a book the hypnotist was tall yes but with his huge chest and massive girth looked almost stocky jake could well picture him tossing a caber and for that matter he could probably toss big men around as well except jake reckoned that wouldnt be in his nature he was the salt of scottish soil the hard flint of wooded mountains however far removed but there was a kindness a an understanding of nature human nature especially a in those dark eyes of his however deeply they might probe it was frequently the same with men of rare ability even in jakes few days with ebranch he had been aware of it in ben trasks espers the ones hed met and of course in the head of ebranch himself the big scotsman might not be as parapsychologically endowed as a true esper but still there was that special something about him in those eyes mainly a those hypnotic eyes a and the way they studied a man jake suddenly realized that theyd been studying him reading him much as he had been reading the other perhaps reading him more or more cleverly and breakfast was over now so whens it tae be mcgilchrist stood up stretched and yawned god but ye got me up early ben trask ah wiz barely in bedthen up again when yere chopper landed in mah back yard ah wiz expectin yere man aye but no at that hour im sorry about that trask said but we never know how long well be in any one place and in fact we could be moving on at any time im just waiting on some information from london and then well be out of here he got to his feet jake and liz too and she said can i come in on this jakes my partner after all he might yet be your partner trask answered immediately we wont know that until we know and jake as fidgety as ever burst out then for christs sake lets get on with it for whatever it is it seems my futures hanging on it yere future said grahame mcgilchrist as trask led them towards his tent ah no yed be better off askin the precog about that and yell find that even he isnae that sure but as for the past well thats different whats been has been and it cannae be changed but even if its been well and truly buried a buried in or by the mind that is a we can usually dig it up again aye and as for me ahm one hell o an archaeologist he turned his attention to trask so then but this is a verra different ebranch to the one ah used tae know they pilots talkin over there australians aye and a couple more fiddlin wi those vehicles there seems yere recruitin far afield these days benjamin no not really trask answered not even if it was just our espers you were talking about see in ebranch weve never much cared about colours creeds or nationalities in that respect you could even say that weve always recruited far afield for example david chung is of chinese stock you are scottish and poor darcy clarkes forebears were french as for zek foener zek trasks voice faltered and his face clouded over aye ah ken and ahm sorry mcgilchrist took his arm they had arrived at trasks tent freeing himself from the scotsmans grip his wellmeant but inopportune commiseration trask turned his face away occupied himself in fastening back the entrance flap to let in the predawn light and in a while currently the team consists of a small nucleus of agents mainly from london hq he went on on but the backup squads are australian military and likewise all their gear its not likely that anyone would know that because the tac signs have been removed from the vehicles and choppers and of course the men themselves arent wearing their standard uniforms but the discipline is the same and youre quite right grahame there have been several changes in ebranch for one were no longer the shoestring outfit that we used to be financially were pretty stable now when you can pay your own way it gives you that much more clout five years ago through our dealings with gustav turchin the russian premier we got ourselves accepted and wellestablished we could afford to come out of hiding a emerge as it were from the esoteric closet a but never too far for lets face it an organization like ebranch cant remain secret if everyone knows about it as for these australians obviously theyre all subject to their own version of the official secrets act and theyve all been handpicked for their loyalty their unswerving devotion to duty and their country isnt that just exactly how it should be who better to dowell what im calling on them to do than loyal subjects of the country under threat under threat suddenly mcgilchrists tone was sharp as he took his seat at trasks small table trask nodded gravely perhaps the entire world he said except the world doesnt know it yet and it mustnt a secret invasion mcgilchrist looked from face to face trying to fathom their expressions as bad as a that is it then ye can only be talkin about one thing oh ah dinnae need tae ken it a but is itthem an exmember of the branch hed had access to the files on their longterm war against the wamphyri indeed those files had long been required reading for all branch operatives and senior affiliates grahame you werent part of the sunsidestarside thing trask told him and from past experience i know how dangerous it could be to put you in the picture now so please let it be but yes it isthem and now perhaps youll forgive me for getting you out of bed in the middle of the night as for jake cutter here he could be very important to us a but very important a in the work weve still to do the big scot had heard enough and was suitably impressed then wed best be at it he said but tell me just what am ah supposed tae be lookin for can ye no offer a wee clue trask looked torn two ways he glanced first at jake then turned back to mcgilchrist i can but that would mean telling jake too whats that but doesnae he have a right to know mcgilchrist frowned and jake said huh my point exactly but trask countered if he does have such a right why doesnt he already know if hes been denied access it must be for a reason in which case what right have i to give him access now mcgilchrist shook his head frowned again well doubtless ye ken well enough what yere on about but ahm as much in the dark as jake here can ye no gi me a startin point oh yes trask answered that i can do just a week ago jake was in jail in italy turin whena undercover the hypnotist cut in er no said trask and the big scot sat back and scratched at his beard musingly anyway trask went on jake escaped from the prison barely but its the way he escaped that interests us and its where he escaped to eh said mcgilchrist escaped to to harrys room grahame trask told him youll remember harrys room at ebranch hq ah the other stopped scratching on the instant stared hard at trask and harder still at jake he escaped there ye say arrived there said trask but the question is was he brought there or did he come of his own volitionor was he sent and if the latter by whom was he sent and again aw said mcgilchrist verra well then thatll be our startin point the prison the escape he unbuttoned a tartan shirt pocket took out a small vial and uncorked it gave it to jake and said sit down here and swally that jake sat looked at the colourless liquid in the vial suspiciously do what he said its only a wee drug mcgilchrist was completely matteroffact about it weve had truth drugs a long time now stuff ye had tae inject but weve come a ways since then this isnae a truth drug but it does open the mindit lets ye see more clearly intae yere own past aye and it lets ye talk about it oh and one other thing it enhances mah power over ye your power over me jake didnt like the sound of that especially since hed already poured the draught down his gullet it simply means that unless theres a verra strong posthypnotic block on yere mind yell gi me all the assistance ah require ye willnae hold anythin back and if there is a posthypnotic block will that mean ive been hypnotized before well if no hypnotized yell have been got at certainly and youll be able to clear it man ah cannae make ye that kind o promise mcgilchrist was honest about it as ben here will tell ye theres hypnotistsand then theres hypnotists and if what he fears has been here first he shrugged i understand said jake though in fact he didnt now thats a fastactin drug thats in ye mcgilchrist continued so ahd best be tellin ye one or two things yere tae sit verra still and upright in yere chair oh dinnae fret ah wouldnae let ye topple over and yere tae look at me at mah eyes verra big and black mah eyes are they no they were very big and black and jakes head was beginning to spin oh so slowly languidly at first but gradually getting faster as if he were drunk flat on his back on a bed and the room spinning around him but without the sick feeling and heres me bringin mah eyes closer lookin at ye and lookin intae ye mcgilchrists voice was so very low now like the growl of a great wolf so low so dark and so close ahm lookin intae ye and yere lookin intae mah eyes or is it mah eye for see theres only one o they now the two have merged intae one like a wee swirly black hole in mah face or maybe a big black hole and its suckin at ye jake suckin at ye it was indeed that blackest of black holes spinning faster and faster and jake felt its lure its attraction god if he could back out of this now he would but he couldnt and dinnae fight it laddie said a voice that burned in his head just let it go and come to me open up to grahame and then the black hole had him he was sucked in and whirled like a bug down a plughole it was as quick as thought it had happened before he could even cry out if he had been able to paolo has slid a length of rubber tubing over the links of the chain to deaden its clanking now he looks at me gives me the nod and i cup my bands far him he steps into my hands and i can smell his groinhe smells of fear and i imagine i do too thank cod theres no moon hes up on my shoulders now swinging the chain i hear it swish through the dark night airhear it clatter too just the once but enough to make me grit my teeth and now theres a scraping sound as paolo hauls on the chain fattening the roll of barbed wire to the top of the wall but hes done it paolo is on his way up the chain i look up his head and shoulders are silhouetted against the black horizon of the wall he clings to the chain with his right hand takes the blanket from around his neck and lobs it up and over the wire is covered damn the mans a genius now hes balanced up there with one leg over the wall and hes reaching down for me my heart is thudding hammering away in my chest but at last im on the chain up i go and i reach for paolos hand but what what he withdraws it i dont believe it and i cling to the chain and look up at him look into his eyes that are looking down into mine except now they look beyond me into the night and dangling there i glance over my shoulder and see them prison guards armed and taking aim across the exercise yard i look up at paolo and his sweat falls on me like rain he gives a shrug says i sorry jake but they promise me and then he jerks and i hear the shot and now paolos blood splashes me as his right eye turns black hes falling taking me with himwe hit the ground like a ton of bricks paolos body is on top of me which is just as well because i can feel it jerking shuddering to the sound of more gunshots i struggle under his dead weight somehow manage to throw him off and rise into a crouch but god im a dead man a i have to be fat white sparks light the night like angry fireflies where bullets ricochet off the wall and spit concrete splinters at me but nowa anow theres a spark thatthat isnt a spark dont understand it havent the time to understand it but it hovers there like a golden dart level with my eyes only twelve inches away seeming to follow my movements as i dodge bullets and now it moves too and i know that it has to be a bullft after all because it smacks me right between the eyes and i fall face first but i cant feel it when i hit the ground of course i cant feel it because you dont feel anything when youre dead dead and weightless and rushing somewhere rushing out of my body i suppose rushing to heaven or hell if i believed i wish i had believed nowand ill bet im not the first man who thought that but jesus im not going out without a fightnot jake cutter i struggle and twist and tumble but this cant be right because i can feel myself im not dead yet and now i see a light in the darkness i rush towards it fall into itno i fall out of the darkness my head god im sick dizzy and my head but im not dead yet im not dead yet not dead yet not dead not no i its been an hour said mcgilchrists voice ye ought tae be comin out o it now jake mah lad jake remembered where he was and would have jerked erect but since he was already erect a sitting upright in his chair just as the doctor had ordered a instead he became aware of incredible cramps in all his limbs whose pain was physical and of course far worse than the imagined thump on the head that he had experienced for the second time around just a few moments ago he opened his eyes tried to reach up and touch his head maybe cradle it in his trembling hands but even the slightest movement caused violent shooting pains in his arms and shoulders freezing him in position and ggod almighty he groaned his throat dry as kindling mcgilchrist dropped two white pills into a glass of water swirled them and watched them dissolve thesell do ye a power o good he said and ii should believe you said jake blinking rapidly as his eyes grew accustomed to the full dawn light eh but theyre only wee aspirins man mcgilchrist told him for yere headache ye ken which is a side effect o that draught o mine what dye really think ahd poison ye slowly jake allowed himself to slump in his chair and as his blood began to circulate and pins and needles took over from the true pain so he took the glass and drank and then he remembered not only what had gone before but also something of his regression again he straightened up but much more carefully now and said that dart a golden dart or splinter i seem to remember itit entered my head just like you told me liz merrick sighed from where she sat close to him except you didnt call it a dart jake carefully turned to squint at her through the tents luminous air and ben trask said i think thats all we needed to know it makes any further questions i might have academic conjectural meaningless for the time being anyway he too was seated a looked like he needed to be a and his voice was trembling to match jakes limbs great said jake unsteadily fine so now that all of your questions are answered how about mine yours said trask stopped dead in his tracks and ah well well deal with those shortly yes and jake im really really very sorry about that a i mean that i had to be so secretive im sure youll understand when you know it all but for the next few minutes said mcgilchrist with his massive hand on jakes shoulder yere tae take it easy until yere back on yere feet and then ye should stop worryin about whats happened tae ye yere in the verra best o hands after a the stiffness was draining from jakes limbs and his headache was in recession did i do okay he said looking at ben trask did you get all you wanted it was that dart right it was that dart that i thought was a bullet what in hell was the thing but while jake was beginning to feel okay trask was still shaken its not so much what it was he replied as what it is but definitely and what that makes you makes me sensing something of trasks quandary perhaps his reluctance to accept whatever he was having to accept jake had stopped feeling okay on the instant now frowning he said how do you mean what it makes me what i am is plain a fugitive from socalled justice hiding out under the protection of ebranch unless youve changed your mind that is is that it did you learn something that makes you want to throw me back to the wolves am i in fact the sick psychotic killer that people have been made to believe i am and perhaps trask would have started to tell him there and then but at that moment lan goodlys piping excited voice was heard from across the clearing ben ben the precog was calling those serials i know which ones are missing and i think were in a lot of trouble think trask called from the open door of his tent i know we are goodly was closer now and his voice commensurately less strident ive seen it coming ben he said heading towards trasks tent at a fast agitated lope trouble with a capital t yes so whatever it is youre doing put it aside for now this is just as important a maybe more so a and i think you need to hear me out as trask ducked out under the tents awning liz took hold of jakes hand and said no one thinks badly of you jake what you told us when you were under only serves to corroborate what ben trask has been hoping all along but thats for him to tell you not me and as for throwing you to the wolvesau contrain jake cutter on the contrary but it could be his intention to throw you at them ten minutes later trask had called his small nucleus of branch people to him and at the last moment hed invited liz and jake into the briefing everyone was crowded into his tent wasting no time when all of his people had arrived trask said i wont make a meal of this and as soon as were through here i want you to start packing up id like to be out of here asap ops truck and vehicles strip them of everything important to us because were leaving them behind our next target is too far away that we can simply drive to it it was possible we might have stayed just as we are now but something has come up our aussie friends will have to follow on behind us but as the brains behind the brawn as it were time is a luxury weve just run out of sowhats the big hurry eh well you all know about our mr miller but you dont know all about him to recap millers some kind of nut who believes in friendly aliens and despite that hes seen the enemy pretty close up he thinks that we are the butchers he thinks the work we did last night was a totally unjustified preemptive strike against a landing party of explorers from outer space and that they only turned nasty in order to survive he has even written books on the etiquette of first contact so obviously in millers warped perceptions were sadly lacking in manners it doesnt matter that our aliens are stinking murderous vampires from a parallel world millers mania would never accept that he doesnt believe a word ive said to him a probably doesnt even believe theyre vampires a but he does think he can talk to them well that in itself wouldnt be a problem his own people can look after him lock him up or do whatever they deem necessary to make him look like an idiot a which he is a if miller should start babbling his crazy stories about our work to the press or other sensationalist outlets so when i found out that hed made a run for it in a way i was pleased at least he was out of my hair yes but that was before i discovered what hed taken with him people last night our locators at london hq headed up by david chung found us a new target they detected a hitherto unsuspected patch of mindsmog on the other side of the australian continent it was only there for a moment a someones mental shield slipped shall we say a but it was the real thing the unmistakable signature of a lord of the wamphyri im talking about a lord yes and what we have to remember is that the thing we went up against last night bruce trennier that was a mere lieutenant a someone in thrall to a lord a left behind by his maker and master for whatever reason okay this mindsmog it was detected at the same time a i mean precisely the same time a as we were dealing with trennier now we know that many of the wamphyri had the power of telepathic contact with their thralls even over great distances so its possible indeed probable that trenniers unknown master felt his lieutenants death and it so surprised or startled him that he let his guard down if only for a moment he might even have done it deliberately tried to establish better contact with trennier to find out what was happening as for our people in london they were lucky someone happened to be looking in the right place at the right time and thats when they detected the evil aura of a great vampire of course chung forwarded this information to me only to have it intercepted by peter bloody miller and now i couldnt give a damn about him speaking to the media or anyone else for that matter but i do care that he might be on his way to deliver a warning to one of the worst threats our world has ever faced a warning that we are on our way to destroy it chapter ten the vampire file when everyone with the exception of jake and liz was clear of trasks tent he opened his briefcase and plumped a thin file down on the tabje read it he told jake it will give you something to do for a while for we may be here a little longer than i anticipated i was forgetting that wed have to fly grahame back home again even though hes on his way now it will still be three to three and a half hours before the chopper gets back but on the other hand and since id like ebranch to move as a unit thats probably just as well it gives us more time to get our act together a our thoughts too a for which im grateful i hate starting something without being able to think it through first he looked pointedly at jake that file is your chance to think things through too you see i dont want anyone in the branch who doesnt fit or doesnt want to be here however in the event you do decide to move on you neednt worry about my handing you over to the law thats not my way i would simply wash my hands of you but if you stay then youre with us all the way i have no time for quitters and in that case i would assist the law in any way possible huh jake answered and just when i thought youd begun to appreciate me okay do you want my answer right now read the file first said trask curtly then ask lardis to tell you about sunsidestarside after that ill fill you in on some of our history bring you up to date on the current situation and how we got here and generally try to explain where you fit in the grand scheme of things oh youll find it lots of fun jake i can guarantee that but despite his guarantee trasks words were dry as dust he was deadly serious his face utterly devoid of humour oh good said the other just as drily and seemingly unimpressed i cant wait god why him trask asked under his breath of no one in particular as he went stamping from the tent it was a question he would be asking himself for quite some time to come so why arejyow still here jake asked liz because im good company she answered testily or maybe im maintaining some kind of balance my good and pleasant aura versus your miserable messedup selfpityinga ai dont pity myself jake cut in scowling then have pity on me and leave it out she told him and abruptly angrily starting to her feet very well do it your way who needs you anyway wait jake said sit down i may need you a to help me with this he waved a dismissive hand at trasks file liz took a very deep breath but despite her annoyance she sat down folded her arms said nothing and after a while jake said you know why im pissy even with you that even told liz something at leastmainly that she was special different in his perception but she remained cool towards him and simply said go on ben trask goodly lardis he said especially lardis a he can give you bad dreams that one a its as if they were all waiting for something to happen and he thumbed himself in the chest to happen to me or waiting for you to do something she said exactly jake narrowed his eyes at her and you too well and werent we justified in that she countered i mean weve seen one of the things you can do the way you movewithout moving but i thought that was agreed his frustration was mounting ive already told you thats not me maybe its trying to be you she said a and at once bit her kp jake nodded and his voice was harder when he accused so you are in on it jake liz told him if you were to learn everything all in one go it might be too much for you i can understand that even if you cant ben trask and the other espers theyve recognized a germ in you but maybe its more than a germ especially after last night and again this morning with mcgilchrist anyway they would like it to grow they dont want to kill it off with the shock of sudden awareness thats why theyll let you in on it slowly gradually that way when it all becomes clear to you youll be ready for it jake looked at her and saw only truth in her eyes then he looked at the file again so reading this stuff is like trask said just another step in my gradual education right i think so yes she answered huhand muttering darkly to himself jake picked up the file it had a yellow plastic jacket with a red diagonal stripe stamped with the word cosmic a oncewhite wellthumbed label gummed in the top righthand corner bore a scrawled legend in indian ink vampires and the wamphyri basic but as jake cutter was about to discover there was little or nothing basic about them jake had of course been briefed prior to last nights foray a very sparse a even a briefa briefing before being thrown in at the deep end as he had had it hed seen a jerky old black and white film from a place called perchorsk in the ural mountains which at first hed thought was a clip from some old horror movie that a sensitive th century film censor had refused to pass for general viewing it was just too graphic too real too horrific and its special effects had beenwell something else but the rest of the footage had finally served to convince jake of its authenticitywell almost but still not quite with it and at that time not really wanting to be he had allowed himself to arrive at his own incorrect conclusion that all those years ago soviet scientists had been breeding something a probably biologically engineered soldiers a in subterranean laboratories in the urals and that an unspecified number of genetically mutated monsters not to mention several altered human beings had somehow escapedwhich even now seemed a far more acceptable explanation than the fantastic story he was beginning to piece together from the notes in trasks file wamphyri the mowing notes result from harry and nathan keogh debriefs the keoghs father and son were mainly responsible for the destruction of the wamphyri this file should be read in conjunction with harry keogh necroscope and nathan and then he started again on the text the wamphyri are the original vampires of myth and legend for the last two thousand years vampires have been periodically banished from their own world into ours prior to that time it seems possible that several of them found their own way to earth via a wormhole situated in starside having its exit in a subterranean cave under the foothills of the carpatii meridional the transylvanian alps this is obviously the reason why even to this day that region is associated with vampires and vampirism it is the source of the socalled myth but the wamphyri are not a myth they are the inhabitants of an earthtype world lying parallel to earth in a universe on the other side of our familiar spacetime continuum and but for the fact that the wormhole enters our world deep underground on a watercourse subject to flash flooding it is quite feasible that by now the human race would have been conquered converted and enslaved by vampires however and whatever might have been mankinds fate one thing is certain there will be no more vampires in this world the only means of entry have been closed in the russian premier gustav turchin diverted hydroelectric dam waters from the urals pass into the subterranean complex at perchorsk thus drowning the singularity or gate in the heart of the complex this action served to preserve the integrity of both worlds and guaranteed the future safety of at least one of them ours for further reading see perchorsk and the refuge stages of vampirism the vampire lifecycle in large part speculative in the east and west of sunsidestarside lie swamps which are always gloomy under rolling banks of fog in a time immemorial to sunsides szgany the first vampires came out of these swamps the morphology or evolution of the wamphyri would make for a fascinating study in its own right cyclical it frequently involves forms other than human vampire dna is unique in being mutative within a single lifecycle without the benefit of generation like any disease but almost sentiently aggressive it invades nonvampire tissues to infect them but instead of destroying the contaminated body it passes on its mutant dna causing the host to adapt a and indeed to mutate a within its own span since longevity is invariably a result of vampirism barring accidental death or fatal diseases the lifespan of the victim then a vampire in his own right might easily extend to many hundreds and perhaps even thousands of years in the vampire swamps of sunsidestarside the first phase of the cycle may be found it is a black mushroom that ripens to give off red spores speculative the spores are the genesis of vampiric life and carry the as yet blank form of vampire dna breathed in the spores attach to animal lungs and commence leaking their poison into the bloodstream along with oxygen then the mutation quickens the victim falls ill and following a period of some three days emerges as a vampire in his own right in transylvania the illness would occasionally appear fatal and the victim dead hence the legend of the vampire rising from his grave after three days in the earth the spores do not discriminate they infect who or whatever breathes them in an infected fox or dog would have vampire instincts but the true vampire has instincts of its own second phase within an infected host certain special strands join up to take on a separate parasitic identity this may take a few years decades or even centuries the reason for these variations are as yet undetermined but the symbiotic creature that results is the true vampire a semiprotoplasmic leech clinging to the spine of the host and extending its own nervous and sensory systems into his brain literally possessing his mind it is him and he is it and the parasite or symbionts appetite is for blood it feeds on the source of life itself the blood of its hosts future victims indeed the blood is the life the symbiont is not necessarily faithful to an original host in sunside should a dog or fox host come in contact with a human being a wholesale transfer of leech from the animal to the human is possible especially if the animal is stricken and dying in other words the leech will seek a continued existence a or even better a higher lifeform a in its new host among the szgany of sunside the tenacity of the leech is a legend in its own right third phase wamphyri not only has the symbiont become an integral part of its hosts body but the hosts being a even his thought processes his personality and of course his dna a have been altered forever just as strands of that dna have mutated into the leech so the hosts flesh has become in itself imitative his flesh is now metamorphic he can within certain limits bring about physical alterations in his shape and form he is wamphyri fourth phase back to the origin speculative in the event of death the symbiont leech may attempt a secondary existence by way of reconstitution essential fats and amino acids a the building blocks of life a may seek to escape into the earth there to develop into mushroom spawn that lies dormant until a time of maximum opportunity how the vampire essence or mushroom germs recognize this one opportune moment remains unknown in transylvanian legends as in those of sunside certain vampire lords store native soil and sleep upon it a clear evidence of the instinct for survival and once again immemorial sunside myths have it that the drakuls a an especially infamous line of lords a kept loam from starsides swamps for the same purpose against just such an eventuality final phase the true death decapitated a vampire dies however the bulk of a symbiont is located mainly on the left or heart side of its hosts spine and a stake driven through the heart will usually suffice to pin the creature there for a time at least a stake soaked in garlic will certainly do the job for garlic like silver is a quickacting poison to vampire flesh but the only sure way to kill a vampire is to burn it to ashes wherefore sunsides szgany stake decapitate and burn all vampire manifestations wherever possible only then can they be certain that the vampire has died the true death there exists one other phase in the vampire lifecycle vampirism infection deliberate and accidental by a bite the virulence of a vampires bite which is usually delivered in the act of feeding would seem to differ from vampire to vampire but the bite of a lord of the wamphyri is especially infectious it can cause delirium and death though not necessarily the true death when a lord seeks to recruit a vampire thrall or servitor the bite isnt usually deep and little blood is taken in this case the bite has been used to transmit vampire dna but only in an amount sufficient to bring about the first phase of the change it may then take years for a leech to develop and the servitor a or later the lieutenant a to ascend and become wamphyri but when a lord or ladys bite is excessive and too much plasma is taken a and a commensurate amount of vampire essence transfused a then the result may be death of a sort lasting the specified three days then too when the victim ascends it will be with the germ of a leech established and growing within him accidental infection may occur when an infected animal fighting to avoid entrapment or and execution bites a human being in such a case it is possible for a person bitten in this manner to develop the characteristics of the original host beast this is the proven source of the werewolf legend it seems feasible that in earths past there were even genuine vampire bats other than desmodus and diphylla accidental infection may also occur when vampire blood is spilled such as in sunside executions of suspect vampires by the szgany in common with aids and similar contagious diseases open wounds and mucous membranes are especially susceptible even healthy whole skin splashed with a vampires blood or urine should be treated immediately the most definite and definitely the most effective form of vampiric infection is obtained when a lord or lady wishes to create an eggson or daughter apart from one rare exception a symbiont leech is capable of producing only one cryptogenetic egg during its lifespan in this the parasite relies on the judgement of its usually human host to provide a superior vessel for habitation the egg a a flexible ciliolate spheroid half an inch in diameter a is willed into being by the vampire host and passed on mouth to mouth or by sexual intercourse or by simple spillage when it must find its own way a spilled egg being protoplasmic will seep through the skin of a designated host or other acceptable vessel interacting with him to cause speedy infection and transformation any such changeling is considered to have ascended and is wamphyri not all exchanges of bodily fluids between vampires and human beings are necessarily infectious the vampire has a degree of control over his parasite and also over his blood and other plasma fluids a lady of the wamphyri may consort with a human lover without converting him she simply avoids taking his blood and following intercourse wills her vampire essence to destroy his sperm likewise a lord may will his sperm free of vampiric influence to keep a concubine pristine this cannot in any way be taken as indicative of love or even affection it is simply that the wamphyri do not casually create other wamphyri egg and bloodsons and daughters are chosen with infinite care and among the reasons are these a powerful eggson may one day usurp the father knowing and even accepting this the nature of the man the prospective host must first be explored to the full and eggdaughters a as all wamphyri ladies a are treated with great care not only by their sires but also other lords because while the occurrence is rare nevertheless the occasional lady will prove to be a mother or breeder of vampires the exception that disproves the general rule a mothers parasite has the ability to spawn a great many more than the usual single egg the nature of vampires a possible explanation of the wamphyri lifestyle the wamphyri are aggressive tenacious territorial egotistical ruthless and unrepentantly evil and proceed in each mode or mood with passions exaggerated to a degree quite beyond human understanding by our standards they are deranged it appears that the symbiont leeches are directly responsible for their hosts invariably antagonistic natures unless the host is made strong the parasite cannot be certain of its own longevity lacking aggression the host would be seen to be weak easy prey to his contemporaries and without tenacity or the will to survive he must fail if territory exists for the taking a vampire will take it extending his boundaries makes a lord safer within his own sphere of jurisdiction and as for ruthlessness since the driving instinct of the leech is survival the question of law and order a and especially justice a never arises might is the only right the evil of the great vampire springs naturally from all of his other vices an intelligent being may not be aggressive ruthless and territorial a and of course a merciless killer a without being unrepentantly evil as for the vampires ego that becomes glaringly evident in the pride he takes in his evil according to szgany legends the first of the wamphyri was shaitanain our world satan and pride was his downfall too it will have been noticed that the above vices are identical with mans forming in the main our definition of evil in that respect it should also be pointed out that the vampire has no recognition of evil regret shame or guilt are in all probability words that he does not accept or emotions which a if experienced at all a are held in abeyance by his parasite as for any comparison with mans evil the scale of difference a the enormity of the gap between ours and the vampires capacity for evil a simply does not allow for comparison vampires are in themselves the ultimate evil diseases and vulnerabilities the wamphyri shrug off most diseases common to man their leeches produce antibodies to order there is one ailment however whose morbid encroachment may only be delayed by the symbionts healing powers and the hosts protoplasmic dna leprosy the bane of vampires disfigures and kills them no less than it kills wholly human beings but the diseases progression is usually far slower in the wamphyri the symbiont is itself susceptible to the disease and once the infection breaks through a vampires resistance to infect the leech the process becomes irreversible and the true death results silver is a poison to the wamphyri the mythical silver cross may well turn aside or stay a vampires hand but not by virtue of any mysterious religious power in the cross the silver itself is the deterrent and may not be considered a supernatural element in this regard but simply a poison to the wamphyri much as mercury lead and plutonium are poisons to man but it does more nearly compare with plutonium in this respect as it is quite deadly when used correctly silver will sear the vampires flesh wounded with a silver knife the wound will take longer to heal and leave a permanent scar injected internally as by a shotgun using silver shot or a gun firing silver bullets it will cripple and even kill vampire flesh damaged by silver in this way must be shed and new flesh manufactured by a protoplasmic process garlic is also a poison and once again no supernatural reason is attached garlic is simply poisonous to the vampire even as various fungi poisoned ivy and many fruits and vegetables are poisonous to man the smell of garlic offensive to many humans is emetic to the vampire its oil will sting him causing his flesh to slough taken internally if it does not kill him it will certainly damage organs and make it difficult for the symbiont to effect repairs the szgany of sunside make extensive use of garlic not only in their cooking but also as a poison with which to daub their crossbow bolts nevertheless a and despite the fact that silver is by no means rare and garlic is plentiful on sunside a still the wamphyri have been a scourge among the szgany from time immemorial to the most recent of times the szgany how they relate to the vampire the szgany are so called because they are kept on the move by wamphyri raiders who come nightly into sunside to hunt the szgany are their prey their livelihood their sole means of survival and continuity without the szgany there would be no wamphyri for the leech would never have had access to humanity and the means to rise above the intelligence level of say a dog or a wolf the szgany provide sport and women for the lords of the wamphyri and men for their ladies szgany blood is the staple diet of starsides vampires their flesh feeds vampire beasts even their skins bones and hair are fashioned into furniture or decorations for the manses of their persecutors the szgany are to the wamphyri of starside as the coconut to the th century south sea islanders useful in every part with little or nothing going to waste but when the szgany are no longer of use as lieutenants concubines or thralls then they are drained of their blood and butchered and all unappetizing parts ground down for the provisioning as meal for the flying creatures and warrior beasts of their masters wamphyri esp and other supernatural skills most lords and ladies of the wamphyri are to some extent telepathic in addition to being physically stronger than entirely human beings their sensory skills have also been enhanced a including several sixth or higher senses as defined by ebranch it is therefore fortunate that their intelligence has not been enhanced their symbionts can only make use of what native intelligence was there to begin with and ruthlessness and deviousness must compensate for the simplicity of the peasant mind a lack of learning which ironically has come about as a direct result of centuries of wamphyri predation on the other hand and in response to wamphyri esp a and apparently as a process of natural selection a the szgany are adept at disguising their thoughts mentally they are equipped to hide from the telepathic probes of their hunters but the supernatural abilities of the wamphyri almost always tip the balance their way and our science is hardpressed to find an answer to certain of the great vampires skills metamorphosis the entire lifecycle of the wamphyri could be said to be a series of metamorphoses a constant ongoing mutation is apparent even in the individual specimen but in certain circumstances the vampires spontaneous metamorphosis is theoretically improbable scientifically baffling and physically awesome it is too a reality in battle the normal or usual morphology of a lord of the wamphyri becomes something else entirely when whatever aspect he has assumed is put aside in favour of his parasites best protective armour and weaponry his flesh stretches tears and refashions itself hands become talons while jaws elongate fantastically to accommodate teeth or tusks worthy of a sabretooth or wild boar his usually pale aspect turns grey to leaden as his skin thickens to hide the wild feral yellow of his eyes turns from flame to red especially at night possibly enhancing his already incredible nightsightedness and in the fullness of his change the very sight of him is as a weapon in itself the closest approximation in man would be the rage of the berserker a without the berserkers disregard for his own safety for over and above all else survival is uppermost in the vampires symbiontcontrolled mind survival the basic instinct that quite literally lends a vampire wings for in certain extremes many of the wamphyri can so change their shape as to flatten their bodies lengthen their arms sprout webbing like the membranes of a bat or flying squirrel and form aerofoils to support their weight or at least allow for gliding and the most adept of all are capable of controlled flight and aerial manoeuvres in this respect it seems reasonable to suspect that there is something of the bat about them there are giant bats in starside a they are often the watchdogs of the wamphyri a and if an infected bat with a spore grown to a leech were to bite and pass on its characteristics to a man this theory might well account for the sensitive convolute snout to be found in a great many lords and ladies of the wamphyri also their night vision and of course their tendency to flight but what theory or accident of evolution could possibly account for their mistmaking or is this simply another facet of the vampires powers of metamorphosis for when the great vampire is in danger a or conversely when he sets out to creep up on prey or a foe a he can create or call up a mist to cover his movements and vampire mist is not the often humid and softly lapping vapour we know but slimy and cold as a cold sweat and the vampire lords enhanced senses a the normal five along with his telepathic probes a are carried in his mist like electricity in a wire but faster than the speed of light at the speed of thought as for the mist itself it issues from the vampires pores as sweat issues from ours but the process is brought about through his will there is a theory however fanciful concerning the way in which the earth itself is caused to release its moisture this theory holds that the vampire mist is some kind of catalyst as when dry ice is released over a cloud to excite precipitation but this scarcely explains the volume of such mists as are generated by the wamphyri for hypnosis oneiromancy and other powers of the wamphyri see also the appended notes to ebranch and other talents this brought jake to the end of a paragraph a third of the way down a page that was twothirds blank turning the page he read a more comprehensive file is in preparation then nothing more except perhaps the feeling that he was floating at the centre of a weird sphere of inexplicable understanding chapter eleven the lidescis story silently closing the file jake started as lizs voice reached him through the vacuum of concentration a a zone exclusive to his mind and the words that the file had left mirrored upon it a which had somehow settled about him well she said and surprising himself frowning he answered where have i read this before i mean do i know these things too late for the vacuum was dissolving the familiarity fading no of course i dont and shaking his head perhaps to clear it he looked at her no questions she said staring hard at him should there be liz shrugged but not casually you tell me jake all i can tell you is that for the last half hour youve been sitting there like a man in a dream totally engrossed learning ht wondered or remembering but aloud he only said well a couple of questions maybe like what oh one or two ambiguities anyway i think ive already worked out some of the answers go on well he said this file cover for one thing it has a few dents in itits obviously not new in fact its got to be years old as for this label on the cover its been thumbed to death but these pages i mean the paper itself is new and the text has at least one glaring ambiguity oh he nodded it talks about an underground exit in the carpathian foothills a one underground exit that is but it also mentions gustav turchin and how he flooded a gate in perchorsk in the urals he frowned again and continued tunny but when i was reading this stuff it seemed to make sense i dont know i seemed to understand but now i only remember the text likeeureka liz said that word on the tip of your tongue that abrupt but transient flash of insight its there and its gone right jake knew she was fishing a albeit for something he wasnt able to give her not yet a and said werent we talking about gates there are two she answered the one under the carpatii meridionali is the original it occurred naturally and has been there for a well no one knows how long its like a black hole or perhaps a grey hole and its other end comes out in starside in a vampire world a long time ago warrior lords would throw their conquered enemies into it its how vampires got here in the first place jake accepted that it felt real he knew it was so and the other is manmade liz told him and settling back she said this is how the story goes thirty years ago the americans put one over on the soviets a ig one that is and good for them a for us the whole world a too because since world war two the russians had been bluffing the west right out of its pants kennedy was the first us president to call that bluff over cuba later ronald reagan and maggie thatcher would have their say they just said no thatcher was good at that said no to what jake was no historian to the russian military buildup she answered to trying to keep up with all of that expenditure on ships aircraft bombs the space race and so president reagan or his advisors invented sdi the space defense initiative star wars he remembered that much at least right liz said a fantasy scenario if ever there was one and the soviets fell for it now the boot was on the other foot and eventually their expenditure went over the top it was probably the beginning of the end for russian communism but in the early s while they were still financially stable their top boffins and physicists were tasked to dream up an answer to the usas sdi a a programme that didnt exist except on paper and very thin paper at that well thats what perchorsk was all about they built a dam across a powerful watercourse in a ravine to give them the hydroelectric power they needed also to give them some camouflage against the wests spy satellites a which was something else that didnt work a and carved out a subterranean complex from the bedrock they put in an atomic pile to boost the projects energy requirements and bingo they were in business but they very quickly went out of business the idea wasi dont know some kind of radar a fan of energy raking the sky covering all the northwestern territories of the then soviet union it was an experiment but if it had worked theyd have built more complexes just like it as defensive measures against incoming missiles or bombers hitting that fan would be like running into a brick wall nothing was going to be able to get through in effect a forcescreen huh talk about an iron curtain and what price sdi then eh except of course there was no sdi and no forcescreen either during the first test it backfired the pile imploded and a new kind of energy a or perhaps a different and extremely primal kind of energy a different kind of heat a was discovered and where the pile had been right at the core of the perchorsk complex there was thiswell this hole this hole that went right through the wall of our universe in starside the new singularity appeared in close proximity to the original the natural one soa aso jake took it up when turchin flooded the perchorsk complex he drowned both gates on starside making any sort of travel through them impossible she smiled at him for someone who hasnt read the files you figured that out pretty quickly which gave him pause because hed been thinking much the same thing and again he knew that what shed told him was so but liz was already going on well there you have it the answer to at least one of your ambiguities now what about the others just one other jake told her but a difficult one in a way it makes no sense while in another a in the light of our involvement a it makes too much sense the file talks about how the gates were closed drowned by gustav turchin which guaranteed earths safety similarly it talks about harry and nathan keogh father and son men whom it credits with destroying the wamphyri but if the world is safe and the danger past why is all of this information laid out in the present tense also how can it possibly fit with what we saw and did last night liz nodded this is the bit you already have the answers for right its selfexplanatory well youre correct those inserts in the file are brand new hastily prepared and incomplete makeshift replacements for the old text that used to be in the past tense which is now present tense becausea because thats the nature of the problem jake finished it for her as we saw last night its here and now not left for dead in another worlds past but alive and well and horribly real in our worlds present fine or not so fine whichever a but it still doesnt answer my questions doesnt tell me where i fit in liz tossed her head i i bloody i she said is that all you exist for jake you but he could get just as irritated and no he rasped i exist for something else something i havent finished that i still have to do and that all of this is pushing to one side jake came a gruff query from out in the morning jake cutter is that you in there huffing and puffing again lardis lidesci his shadow falling across the tents doorway right on cue liz snapped and very welcome if anyone can answer your questions lardis can hell certainly be able to add to your knowledge anyway and if nothing else comes of it at least ill get a break from your moaning and find something better to do with all of the valuable time im currently wasting on you ebranch staff and espers were busy all around the camp stripping personal and branch kit and equipment from the vehicles a lot of the gadgetry a the hardware in the ops vehicle a was in reality commonorgarden stuff computers and communications equipment on loan from the australian army along with the truck itself mobility would be the key word in any future war a the mobility of ops centres that is and war meaning any conventional war between nations not species a and all of the wacs the western alliance countries used compatible equipment but the software and such belonged to ebranch and just as trasks people had been thorough in cleaning up last nights mess now they were being thorough in removing every last trace of their work and presence here for as trask had pointed out covert organizations such as ebranch couldnt remain secret if too many people knew about them and in the sort of war that he envisaged the branchs secrecy would be of the utmost importance indeed cosmic on sunside lardis said oh not all that long ago the szgany fought the wamphyri with whatever weapons were to hand here your weapons are far supera er superior and not only your guns grenades and flamethrowers no for it seems to me that youre using trreir own tactics against them too eh jake queried walking beside him disguises smokescreens visual lies a like that vehicle there beer no such thing a deadly weapons system or if not a weapon itself a system capable of directing and controlling weapons ben has told me that in earths past the vampires had a saying that longevity is synona er synonymous yes a with anona er anonyma er anonymity said jake and knew it for a certainty without knowing how he knew yes lardis nodded his grizzled bandaged head and in ebranch they have another saying that secrecy is synonymous a haha with survival pretty much the same wouldnt you say pretty much said jake but vampires are one thing and im another and frankly ive had it with all the secrecy if im so important to the branch why cant i be told about it at first it was because you might be less a or other a than you seemed lardis told him now its because you might be more and also because you mightnt like what you are a if you are confusing well not only for you believe me anyway regardless of what liz says its not my job to tell you about you but about me and mine and the way things were and the way they could be again by now on sunsidestarside around the camp goodbyes were being said hands shaken the australian contingent making ready to move out soon there would be just the ops truck with its array of worldwide communications devices one jetcopter and another on its way back from carnarvon the two choppers were transport for branch personnel and sas commanders the ops truck would stay until they were airborne when it too would move out in their next location trasks team of espers and support staff would be on their own until their aussie backup teams caught up with them thus these farewells were temporary the same parties would soon be meeting up again next time on the far side of the continent this was something that puzzled jake how come we dont move as a complete unit trask has all the contacts why cant he order up one of those big military transport choppers better still why doesnt he just call on ahead and arrange for a new righting force to be waiting for us he could probably do any or all of those things lardis answered but how would it look if we all arrived together at our next camp wouldnt you consider that indisaer indiscaer indiscreet jake remember its no easy thing for a man or men to hide their intentions from the wamphyri any event unusual enough to arouse the interest of ordinary citizens is bound to arouse theirs too like a sudden influx of specialist troops said jake indeed said lardis with a nod and as for starting out fresh with a brand new platoon of soldiersbut doesnt that go against the very first rule the fewer people who know about usa the longer we survive said jake hahsaid lardis finally we make progress and the problem with mrs miller becomes that much clearer too the first vehicles were pulling out now and the old lidesci grunted his approval this i like he said its what the traveller is all about constant movement between one place and the next on sunside we szgany became travellers to stay ahead of the wamphyri we rarely stood still for very long in any one place but here here we are the hunters we move to track them down and then we kill the bastards oh yes i like it a lot he smacked his lips the pair had arrived at the place of last nights campfire the backburner stoves and oven were gone but a steaming pot of coffee and a few paper cups had been left beside the trench and as these very different men from entirely different worlds sat down on the last of the folding chairs jake said lardis why dont you tell me about sunsidestarside i mean all about sunsidestarside or as much as i can take in for since thats where all this seems to have started maybe its my best starting place too and lardis said as you will but i may as well tell you now it still wont answer your one big question i had a feeling it wouldnt jake grunted but tell me anyway and in a low growly voice in words that strove valiantly to accommodate jakes language a and when they failed reverted to lardiss native szgany which the listener took in as best he could a the old lidesci complied as its name suggests though in more senses than one sunside starside is a divided world on sunside a slow and benevolent sun spins out days to more than four times the length of earth days but it sits low in the sky and casts long shadows a the shadows of the barrier mountains a on starside and the gloom and the long nights of starside must have been the greatest of aids in the evolaer the evolution yes of the wamphyri we dont know how it started it happened in a time lost to memory except in myths and legends campfire stories carried down a and altered of course a by word of mouth but before the wamphyri there was something of a young civilization in a world much like this world with oceans and mountains islands and continents and even seasons and its peoples were setting out to explore it just as your first sailors explored yours then an accident not of man but of nature a white sun fell from the sky ben trask will tell you it was some kind of singularitybut that is science of which i know very little anyway it bounced over the world like a flat stone skipping on water in one place where it bounced the impact caused its outer shell to break in pieces which fell to earth in such numbers they couldnt be counted according to nathan keogh a called kiklu upon a time a the land there became hot chemicals in the soil gathered into pools acids ate the white suns metal skin into rust thus a great red waste came into being which today lies east of the barrier mountains but the core of the white sun made a final leap shrinking it sped west and slightly north and such was its lure or fascination a its incredible gravity a that even as it fell to earth it drew up from the earth those mountains that formed the barrier range ive probably made light of this it should be said that the entire planet was in shock convulsion lightnings crashed the earth shook and broke open and oceans stood on end hurling themselves upon the land from a benign world the planet was changed to a nightmare entire races were wiped out vanishing forever in the tumult of earth and fire wind and water it cant be known for a fact but trasks science has created a model for such a disaster which calculates that ninetyfive out of every hundred human beings on my homeworld were killed in that historic upheaval the seasons were no more even our worlds orbit around its sun was changed again by the gravity of the white sun which had not destroyed itself but come to rest in a crater on starside the barrier mountains reared where none had reared before and north of the mountains grim and pitiless lands of ice shone dark blue under writhing auroras it was as if a hell had descended from the sky and the szgany a those of my race who remained a were its denizens but they werent its only denizensat first there were no wamphyri but there were always other peoples the szgany had avoided other races they deemed them strange and called them unmen among these others survivors of a northern clan of troglodytes now settled in caverns in the lee of starside unmen from warmer southern climes secretive desert folk known as the thyre became inhabitants of the burning regions south of sunsides fertile green belt it is even said that a race of cannibals a necromancers who tortured and ate the dead a existed and perhaps still exist in a remote far eastern country beyond the great red waste the mountains and all other places known to the szgany of these latter i have never seen one and do not wish to but all of this resettling and all of the planets gradual recovery took years and centuries and even millennia trask has said that it must have seemed like an endless nuclear winter well to the people of the time i suppose it was but it did end eventually and then there were no seasons or only the very smallest climatic changes and the green belt close to the barrier mountains was the only land in all of sunside that could support the szgany tribes who slowly but surely began to multiply and forage in the forests on starside where a great pass splits the mountainous divide there in its crater restingplace at the fringe of the barren boulder plains the white sun sat like a blind eye deep in its socket shining its white light up into the night like a beacon or perhaps a warning it was likelike a door or a gateway to the unknown for if a man should climb down to touch that blinding lightah be sure he would not come up again and because it had brought hell to the szgany it became known as the helllands gate aye from then on hunters and wanderers in the heights of the barrier mountains would look down on starside and see the light of the helllands gate and they would curse it by their stars and turn their faces away and the faces of all the szgany were turned away from starside and its gate but then who would be interested in exploring starside what was starside but barren and endless boulder plains reaching north and towering stone pinnacles a stacks or buttes as trask calls them a reaching thousands of feet into the sky and to the north the frozen oceans and beyond the oceans the icelands with their eerie auroras no fit habitation for men my friend where the sun shone only on the topmost spires and the cold was a knife in your bones i have been to the foot of one of those great fangsthat far but no further and now thanks to harry and his sons there are no aeries as such but it appears ive gone ahead of myself best if i slow down i was speaking of the past and this is how it was came the vampires ask me how i can only shake my head today no man knows none living anyway we know their spores were born in the swamps west of the farthest reach of the barrier mountains and nathan keogh has spoken of similar swamps in the east very well then thats where they came from but how did they get there ben trask has a theory a his people these ebranch people have theories for most things a which has it that they were released into my worlds skies out of the debris of the white sun an alien life form from the stars perhaps it is so but i am not a scientist anyway and however it was they came legend has it that shaitan was the first because he couldnt bear the sun he cohabited with trogs in the gloom of starside caverns but he was more like unto a man and he wondered about the szgany of whom the trogs had told him finally when he grew weary of the company and the blood of trogs he came in the night into sunside and the curse of the vampire a shaitans mark his vices a was left on all the tribes of the szgany for all time to come theres that of shaitan in all of us and i think in all of your people too especially the espers a but mercifully it amounts to very little watered down by time and blood we see it only in these rare talents that ben trask collects and uses against the forces of evil in him its his ability to see the truth and therefore to recognize falseness in goodly its his visions of the future and in me its my seers blood warning me of dangers whose scent is blown on the air felt in running waters and glimpsed in the leaping flame of fires or patterns in the dust when all is not well i feel it and in youa in you it is something elsebut once again ive strayed in sunside shaitan recruited thralls but the sun was too strong for him and his they retreated into starside and there he built the first aerie of the wamphyri in those great stacks out on the boulder plains and the great vampire begat other vampires out of sunside women and even out of trogs and he raided on sunside for blood and plunder and while the wamphyri prospered the szgany suffered every conceivable torment fortunately the szgany had been nomadic travelling folk for long and long before the advent of the wamphyri since land was their only possession they had to beat the bounds to protect it and lay claim to ownership and so they were rarely at rest just as well for their mobility was their survival they could run and they could breed and they could hide but that was all and at night the vampire would ride his flyers out of starside to hunt and to play in sunsides darkened forests and everything that the szgany are today is built out of the incredible the despicable depredations of the wamphyri the szgany learned to hide not only their trembling bodies but their very thoughts why eventually they even learned how to fight back but that was a long time in the coming and as evolution taught the szgany its lessons of survival so the vampire a by nature lazy a found it increasingly difficult to take his prey and then from time to time vampire would turn upon vampire and all starside become a battle zone the wars of the wtamphyri their bloodwars were endless and except when truces were called they were times of rejoicing for the szgany clans but gutted aeries would always need replenishing and depleted larders filling and fallen flyers and broken warrior creatures refashioning in their morbid masters vats of metamorphosis and however long it took the wamphyri would return to sunside its pleasures and plunders the szgany lidesci were the fiercest fighters of all i make no boast though naturally im proud but merely state a fact when i say that my fathers fathers a the forefathers of the szgany lidesci a were the first of the travellers to lay traps for the wamphyri their lieutenants thralls and creatures we were staking beheading and burning those bastards a hundred years ago aye even before the dweller and harry helllander took up our fight and showed those monsters what a real war looked like the lidescis had the respect of the wamphyrialong with their hatred of course i was chief of the szgany lidesci when the dweller came and later zekintha and later still jazz simmons and finally harry helllander called dwellersire but harry and his sons the dweller and nathan keogh they all moved as you move jakebetween the spaces used by common men along a route invisible nathan keogh still does but in sunside in my world on the far side of spacetime or one of its far sides at least which is ben trask speaking you understand me hah i dont even know where spacetime is anyway i was chief when harry and his boy fought their battle in the dwellers garden a their grand battle with the wamphyri a and won i couldnt be there with them mores the pity couldnt stand alongside zek and jazz simmons and the lady karen too no for i had problems of my own and arrived too late but with these very eyes i saw what they had done how theyd used the science of another world the helllands and weird talents fromwell from beyond any lands of the living to defeat the forces of lord shaithis of the wamphyri and kick his backside into the icelands we thought that was the end of it all of the aeries bar one karens had been burned out toppled and brought crashing down onto the boulder plains why the thunder of it a the shaking of the earth a had been felt in sunside itself well perhaps not as far away as that but you get the idea it had been awesome and as i have said we thought that was the end of it that finally the wamphyri were no more most of my people thought so anyway but i have a seers blood in me a perhaps even vampire bloodoh its possible a and i didnt believe that the wamphyri were no more it simply didnt smell right it didnt feel right and for a time equal to four of your earth years i couldnt settle but watched and waited and held my breath and from time to time i would climb up into the barrier mountains through the high crags and passes and down into the dwellers garden all fallen into ruin where i would sit alone to think it overand to worry and not without good reason one time when i went there harry came back but he was changed no dont ask my meaning he simply wasnt the man id known but i believe he was soil my friend and the necroscope had chosen a most opportune time to return to my world for my seers blood had told me no lie the wamphyri were back in sunsidestarside not only the last of them but also the first shaitan the unborn himself aye come back like a plague that can never die chapter twelve the rest of lardiss story shaitan the fallen a shaitan the unborn shaitan himselfa and his banished descendant lord shaithis the two of them back in starside after four years of peace and quiet and nights without nightmares back from the icelands they had flyers and warrior beasts the makings of a small but deadly army and harry helllanderno longer himself and his son the dweller much less than himself for he was a changeling creature as for the lady karen who could say what karen would do or where her loyalties now lay who for four long years had been alone and brooding in karenstack the last great aerie of the wamphyri well the rest of it is strange and frightening i know i know all of it is strange and frightening but to me far worse for it came of earths science of which i knew nothing at that time and when i saw it i knew we had named the helllands gate aright for most certainly this was made in hell what it was the very breath of hell this is how it was shaitan shaithis and their forces they had made camp at the starside gate the necroscope had been taken prisoner the lady karen too for in fact shed sided with harry which was only natural i suppose after all karen had always been shaithiss most deadly enemy as for the details i cant be definite about any of this because my observation point was so far away high in the mountains i assume they were suffering torture certainly bonfires were blazing down there among the many clumps of boulders surrounding the gate then i felt something happening and i sensed it was of the necroscopes doing my seers blood warned me not to look and i warned the others there with me mostly they heeded my cry of warning but one of them peder szekarly was young and sometimes stupid a brave but stupid he continued to look and was witness to it he saw itthen saw no more ever again the light was such that it burned him burned his eyes out and blinded him nor did he live for very long but that lightll swear it shone through the very boulders where we crouched for comparison the gates glare was but a candle and the light was merely the beginning for then came the crack rut that doesnt convey it for it was a sound like the earth splitting and finally the blast well ive seen what a grenade can do but this not even a million grenades a and all of them detonating at the same time a could equal it but before that i had looked up from behind the rocks where i crouched i didnt know that peder had failed to heed my warning there he stood exposed looking down on starside but then in the smallest fraction of a second that awful light jumped from starside into the mountains and shone on peder smoke leaped from him as from a leaf fallen in the fire he screamed his agony clutched at his face tottered back away from the gap in the rocks but even as he stumbled it was as if a giants hand slapped at him hurled him down and i remember thinking perhaps this was how it was when the white sun fell hot grit stinging and stones spattering the earth trembling and lightning lashing the sky and myselfa aye and the rest of my men with me a gasping in our terror of the unknown while peder moaned and sobbed where he had fallen then in a while a as the frenzy of the winds gradually lessened and the pebbles stopped falling and the ground stopped shaking a that rumble of sound that hissing of warm rain that darkness closing in as the stars were shut out and when i dared look that mushroom cloud going up and up towering as high and higher than the mountains themselves and the electrical storm in its dome and the fires that billowed all up and down its pulsing stem ben has told me what it was a tactical weapon he says a which im told means a small one of its kind a had been fired through the gate from the underground complex at perchorsk and would you believe it he pretends not to understand why i still think of your world as the helllands so we didnt know it was a weapon and since its deadly cloud swept north we didnt suffer its effects on sunside but when it was all over and done the gate shone as bright as ever and starside looked no different except now beyond the gate a softly glowing plume lay fallen on the earth forever pointing in the direction of the icelands and no matter the rainstorms or howling winds the plume was always there then for a while we blessed the gate because it had issued that awful breath of hell that destroyed the first and last of the wamphyri so we thought for long and long and this time i admit that i believed it too for with ah we had learned of the tenacity of the vampire we had not yet learned the lessons of history let me go back a little way at an earlier time following the battle in the dwellers garden harry keogh called helllander had fallen sick at the time wed thought it must be similar to the sickness that was in his son the dweller for both men had used the power of the sun itself as a weapon against the wamphyri wherefore both might have suffered similar scorchings the dweller a who had seemed the most badly burned a was soon well on his way to recovery so we thought yet his father far less badly affected if at allhe had fallen ill er but all of this is incidental to my story you understand anyway the necroscope had a szgany woman nana kiklu to tend him where he lay tossing in his fever upon a bed in one of the gardens housesthe dweller had built small stone homes for his trog servitors and harry lay ill in one of these now nanas man hzak had died in the fight for the garden and she was without child and here was harry keogh also called dwellersire a handsome man of rare skills and soaring intelligence mumbling in his fever dreams of olden loves and lusts i need say no more a indeed i know no more a except that nine months later nana gave birth to twin boys one of whom was nathan which explains why we ofttimes refer to harry and his sons as to the other son nestorbut he grew up wild and doesnt concern us here many years passed and nathan grew into a youth but while he possessed the germ of his alien fathers skills no one knew of it because we believed he was hzak kiklus son conceived at the time of the battle in the dwellers garden well perhaps i had guessed otherwise but nana was a good hardworking woman and i was fond of her boys both of them at that time and anyway the szgany lidesci had always had more than its fair share of gossipy chattering hags it wasnt for me to offer them yet another tidbit to cackle over and remember even i didnt know that he was or would soon become more like his father so then and now you know something of nathan but a deal more to come later i have mentioned my annual trek into starside when a as if to reassure myself that the vampires were no more and their aeries toppled all save one a i would venture to the foot of lone karenstack and gaze up at that great grim relic of ancient horror and shout into its nether caverns until the echoes sounded to bring down the dust came a time when i was returning home from just such a journey i felt that i was witness tosomething but i couldnt be sure it had become my habit to pause in the mouth of the pass at a certain hour the hour of sunup climb to a higher elevation and gaze back on the emptiness of starside and the boulder plains on sunside it would be morning now but here starside of the pass the barrier mountains cast their shadows for many an uncounted mile out across the barren waste and here it was that a certain sight had never failed to gladden me the first rays of the morning sun lighting on the topmost spires of the last great aerie of the wamphyri how it buoyed me up to see that purifying light burning there to watch a golden stain spreading over the highest ramparts of that vast tower of evil and to know that nothing was hiding within behind bone balconies and blackdraped windows yes it made these pointlessseeming trips of mine worthwhile it satisfied my seers blood which even now all these years later was wont to bring me awake clammy and troubled in the dead of night but this time even after i had climbed back down to the pass something seemed burned on the surface of my eyeand in my mind but of course a i told myselfa the sun even reflected from the uppermost fangs of an aerie is a brilliant dazzling thing that can blur your vision and cast false images if only momentarily ah but on this occasion that moment went on and on and i could not forget it karenstack in my minds eye it continued to burn karenstack and something else i had thought to see and every time i closed my eyes the picture came up clearer the aeries crest aglow with its false halo of fire but below the area of reflected light where the golden rays could never reach black motes swirling jetting settling towards the yawning gape of a vast landing bay they appeared as midges at that distance but what would they be up close it was my imagination of course what close on a thousand sunups come and gone since the gate spat hell at the last of the wamphyri and still i didnt accept it but kept on conjuring nightmares out of thin air sunlight and swirls of dust hahlthey would say i was mad and after that the way i set off for home a almost at a run a im sure my companions did think i was mad but even if i was my seers blood was not and the attack on sunside and on settlement the town we had built at the edge of the forest under the mountains came at the next sundown the wamphyri were back this time from the east a place beyond the great red waste they were led by a lady wratha the risen and though wrathas band was small its members were evil and ruthless as any gone before canker canison was a doglord i hesitate even to hazard a guess at his lineage and gorvi the guile who was so devious as to be legendary even among his own kind and vasagi the suck whose face was like that of a stinging insect aye and bloodcrazed twins named wran and spiro a also called the killglance brothers a whose very cognomen says it all but they were only the harbingers of a worse a greater force still to come it was the lord vormulac unsleep who pursued wratha from the east to punish her for fleeing his jurisdiction and vormulacs army was a horde but let me cut a long story short this was the time when nathan came into his own though not without great trials when he was taken by the wamphyri and thrown into the starside gate who could imagine he would be back here in your world in perchorsk he was captured by evil men escaped fled to ben trask and ebranch who helped develop his powerseven as theyll try to develop yours jake finally nathan returned to sunside with zek a sweet zekintha ah a and trask lan goodly david chung and other good men and marvellous weapons from the helllands a or earth as i must learn to think of this place and at last we could carry their bloodwar back to the wamphyri on starside and we did but nathan it seems he had his fathers powers and then some or perhaps it was the talents of all of that brave band for certainly they were all in on it at the end it was five years ago jake but i remember it like yesterday who could forget such a thing nathan and the others had walked into a trap at the starside gate hed been trying to send his companions safely home again back through the gate to perchorsk and out of the thick of the fighting but vampire lieutenants stood in the way and no room for manoeuvring nathan and his colleagues must stand and fight they had earth weapons aye but were low on ammunition eventually they must be taken and if nathan were taken what then of sunside but here im being selfish and perhaps i should ask what then for earth for the wamphyri a now under the leadership of devetaki skullguise a mentalist lady of awesome skill and enormous greed a had learned the gates secret they knew that beyond it lay an entire world ripe for the taking now dont ask me how it was done for im a simple man but nathan and the others linking hands they pitted themselves against the starside gate itself the gate is immovableaeven that incredible tactical weapon that destroyed shaithis and shaitan had not moved it nor even marred its surface a and sitting there on the boulder plains it seemed anchored in position perhaps by its own enormous gravity wherefore in order to move the gate a man or men must move the world and they did with all their weird talents together acting in unison they willed the gate to move south south towards the rising sun which had never once shone on starside since an age long forgotten and the gate a and the world a moved the world turned all sunsidestarside turning like a great wheel and the sun rising ever faster over the barrier mountains and the wamphyri their lieutenants creatures and all were seared in a moment and now surely it must be over why with the turning of the world even the last aerie had fallen like a felled giant toppling onto the boulder plains all that remained of that great and monstrous tower was its stump like a flattopped mound a or perhaps one of ben trasks buttes a glooming on the horizon while its vile body sprawled like a corpse crumbling in the newfound light of starside in the far east and west as far as men were yet to journey the vampire swamps were drying out cracking open in their beds cleansed by the sun and in all the length and breadth of sunsidestarside no vampires existed a at least as far as men knew but that didnt mean that men wouldnt keep watching not while i lived anyway nor was the transformation confined to the swamps water presumably released from the icelands had brought great rains to the scrubland savannas and showers even to the furnace deserts south of sunsides fertile belt until the land was green as far as the closest thyre colonies all of which processes of an altered nature and others would continue a while yeta abut not for long enough as for the starside gate that was scarcely the ominous place it had been for now it was the centre of a lake a constantly moving body of water diverted from its source in your world in this world jake and driven by its own weight into starside and the wormholes around the gate a or energy channels as ben trask calls them which wound through solid rock to the first or primal gate the white sun deep in the belly of the crater a they had become whirlpool sinkholes diverting the waters of the lake a second time and returning them to the refuge at radujevac in this world earth and on into the danube thus nothing was lost and nothing gained but what a wonder that fountain of light reaching up a hundred feet into the starside night lit up by the gate glowing in its core and raining its soft white waters on the land and into the lake moreover it had closed off both routes out of and into sunsidestarside which preserved the integrity of both worlds and so things stood for one and a half of your years a earth years that is a and seventy of my days for the sun rose much higher now and the days were longer yet well at least in the new beginning but it wasnt destined to stay that way man cant master nature jake or if he does his reign is short what nathan and the men of ebranch had done was against naturewhat to move a world and slow but sure the lure of the white sun its strange gravity began to turn us northwards again the days grew shorter the sun sank ever lower and starsides shadows lengthened as before the rains retreated seasons we had known but briefly merged into one the savannas wilted away to their usual russets and yellows nightly the rim of the barrier mountains showed more stars flowing back into position from the north and once again the grim northstar which had always shone on karenstack rode high in the starside sky but were the szgany dismayed or the trogs in their caverns or the desertdwelling thyre not a bit of it the trogs had detested the surplus of light it destroyed their mushroom farms and irritated their skins and moonwhite eyes the thyre in their subterranean colonies had been hard put to build barriers against unseasonal flood waters that coursed along their river routes and the szgany we had enjoyed our permanence of climate what need had we of seasons when the trees were ever in fruit but with the world turnedeven the foliage a the flora a had suffered too much sun in the one season a surfeit of rain in the next and colder air in the third and now back to normal except there was no more scourge no more vampires no more wamphyri theyd been erased forever out of our world and the szgany could sleep easy in their beds and not fear for their lives and the blood of their loved ones why we might even begin to explore those lands and territories previously forbidden to us a starside itself perhaps and the great lakes or oceans that lay north of the boulder plains and those unknown lands to east and west of the nolonger barrier mountains beyond the driedout swamps and the great red waste for it would take time for the swamps to revert and the thyre were no longer unmen but neighbours a we valued their friendship and had determined to share with them all the technology that nathan had brought us from the helllands ah how perfect it all seemed grand schemes and grander dreams aye ah jake but my seers blood told me it wouldnt be so and i fretted while i waited there are myths and there are legends a myth is a story come down the ages so changed by its retelling over and over that that we may no longer say if it is true or simply a story one such myth was shaitan the unborn a until he became reality a legend on the other hand is something much closer in time a legend is not so old that it has lost its authenticity here in your world jake you have a saying hes a living legend do you see what i mean a thing a usually a man or woman a that attains legendary status even in its his or her own lifetime but legends are generally older than that if not as old as myths in sunside our days being so long the szgany use them as a measure much as you use years and we have a legend that dates back twentyfive thousand sunups not as long as your history no but still five hundred years oh yes i have learned your numbering system i pride myself that ive learned many things even though ive no use for them on sunside but five hundred years ago in my world there were three great vampires unlike any others before or since and they were legends two of them were lords and the other a socalled lady but vavara believing her name potent enough in its own right a warning enough in itself scorned all titles and cognomens the name itself would suffice and she was simply vavara and perhaps she was right for see even as i speak that name a vavaaara a so i shudder ugh not that she was ugly on the contrary she was incredibly beautiful a irresistibly so and that was vavaras menace she was a beguiler a spellbinder it was a kind of hypnotism jake but by no means the same as grahame mcgilchrists grahame uses a drug to enhance the authority of his eyes and voice his is a skill as opposed to a true power there again who can say perhaps vavaras hypnotism was just such a skill but one enhanced out of all proportion by her vampire leech as all human senses are enhanced by vampirism trasks science has it that not only humans but all creatures possess lures other than the purely physical attractions efface and form but in humans the voice and the eyes are especially important in defining a persons a what charisma hah but that is also a szgany word for personality ben talks about pheromones and chemistry and such but all i know of chemistry is how to mix a decent gunpowder and its a damn hard thing to beguile a rocket or silver shot from double barrels anyway and whatever this attraction is vavara had it and again perhaps bens right for the spell she cast over men was stronger than her power over women and usually fatal any man who took her fancy a whether a simple sunsider or even on occasion a lord of the wamphyri a he was a goner to resist vavara was a wasted effort so much for the witch now for the wizards the other two were lords as i have said lord szwart was one for he had taken his szgany name by which the szgany knew him szwart pronounced like the german schwartz which means black and black he was blacker than night black as the black heart of the leech that empowered himbut with what strange powers ive said he was blacker than night a totally inadequate description lord szwart was the night now all of the wamphyri are children of the night certainly they are for they cannot bear the sunlight and because night is their element a because they are awake at night and see and revel and hunt at night a it is like a cloak they wear disguising them even from the most keensighted of men on sunside when vampires were abroad in the forest the szgany would lie still in their hiding places and watch them pass and sometimes when they passed a clinging mist would spring out of the earth by which you would know they were there or perhaps the stars would blink as a shape flowed across them but you would not see whose shape it was just a darkness in the lesser dark and sometimes a oh sometimes a the mist and the shape would come close closer and sniffand laugh but you must excuse me jake the things of which i speak are not pleasant things i may not speak of them without remembering anyway lord szwarts command over the night was so much greater than any others that when the sun was down he was simply invisible he made no mists blotted no stars and cast no shadows yet he was seen but only once by a man of the szgany a seen in a storm in a flash of lightning a and then no more but the man who saw him was a madman until his dying day which wasnt long in coming for he went into the woods to dig a hole to hide in but never stopped digging and when finally the pit fell in on him he didnt cry out in his horror at being buried alive but only his lunatic joyfor at last he was safe and lord szwart could never get him now i do not know what lord szwart was only that he was wamphyri which leaves one other and perhaps the most dangerous of all lord nephran malinari a called malinari the mind or simply the mind a was a mentalist a thoughtthief a mindreader without peer none of the stripling telepaths in ben trasks ebranch today would have stood a chance against lord malinari in any battle of minds nor all of them together let me tell you how it was with him among the szgany even more so than in your people there were weird talents my own sixth sense a my seers blood a is but one example but we had mentalists too and oneiromancers and even men like lan goodly aye despite that their precognition was a dubious art at best for its as ive said theres a trace of the wamphyri in all men of sunside their taint lingers on and i fancy it has carried over even into this world but malinariwas special his evil was special why among the wamphyri themselves lord nephran malinari had no friends but dont let me mislead you jake its not that the wamphyri were given to forming lasting relationships they werent but some of them did form alliances well occasionally but never with malinari the mind how may a man trust or remain on good terms with a creature who knows his every thought who is one step ahead of his every move the wamphyri are devious secretivebut how to keep secrets from such as malinari let him but touch a man a mere touch of the fingertips and it was as though the others thoughts flowed like water a or like blood a out of their owner and into the mind of malinari ah a vampire with a difference he slaked two kinds of thirst the one for blood and the other for knowledge no idle curiosity jake but the lust for knowledge itself and once a thing was learned nephran malinari never forgot it but of course in sunsidestarside just as in this world there were those who could not be read be it strength of will or simply their nature there was a wall in their minds no ordinary mentalist could ever breach ah but lord malinari was no ordinary mentalist i have said his touch opened the way so it did like opening a dam in a pent river but if the soft brush of fingertips would not sufficethere was another way fingertipsand the incredible strength of the wamphyritrask says its their metamorphism that allows them to punch stiffened fingers into a mans chest to nip his heart i think so too for it certainly wasnt brute force with malinari his fingers were fluid like liquid allowing the exploration of a mans inner ear or the sockets behind his eyes or the brain itself and whenever the mind stole a mans thoughts out of his very brainthen he left nothing behind no not even the will to live were almost done what remains is not for me to tell but for ben trask a in his own time that is just one more thing i spoke of vavara lord szwart and malinari the mind in the past tense for thats how i heard of them around camp fires when i was a boy as part of sunsides legends the final part of the legend had it that four hundred years ago the rest of starsides lords and ladies got together to be rid of them and it took all of their strength and their fighting forces together to do it to banish them into the icelands but five years ago a when nathan and trasks espers turned sunsidestarside towards the sun a it appears that some of the ice melted and if vavara szwart and nephran malinari were locked in the ice waiting out the long cold years thats trasks explanation anyway and now were done for thats all i know of it or all im willing to say for nowexcept for one final thing that im sure youve worked out for yourself the fact that theyre back jake all three of those monsters theyre back and thats the nature of trasks mission its what he and his espers are pledged to do for once again there are vampires on the loosea aand no longer confined to sunsidestarside chapter thirteen trasks story when jake looked up he was alone perhaps hed been asleep by the end of lardiss story but he didnt think so it had gone in all of it and perhaps a lot more than lardis had actually said weird but thats how it had felt during the telling as if jake had been there on sunsidestarside as if he had known all or most of these things a the sights and sounds and smells of lardiss world a and had only needed the old gypsys corroboration but that was during the telling and now it was all receding the scenes that lardis had painted so inadequately which jakes own mind had coloured and into which hed inserted the finishing touches were just words instead of feelings sensationsemotions and all that was left was a legend in its own right half of a legend anyway you didnt tell me everything jake accused before he fully realized that he was alone then looking all around and feeling foolish he stood up tossed aside the dregs of coffee gone cold in his cup stretched the stiffness out of his limbs it would be good to get some real sleep sometime suddenly the silence the emptiness the loneliness of the place had become oppressive weighing on himuntil he spied movement in the clump of pale stumpy trees between himself and the big ops truck it was ben trask dappled grey and green and gold in the partial shade of the trees heading his way jake trask called ahead he wasnt shouting but in the clear morning air a the silence of the neardeserted campsite a sound carried a long way and drawing closer trask asked did i hear you talking to someone talking to myself jake answered rubbing at the stubble on his chin or maybe to one of your ghosts a lardis that old man has this strange effect on me he doesnt just tell a story but takes me with him says his piece and leaves me there then vanishes sunsidestarside jake nodded but he left a lot out he was told to trask said but thats okayyou can have the rest of it from me most of it anyway and if theres stuff i leave out youll just have to believe me that theres a good reason lets go to the ops truck its going to get hot out here in the next hour or so by which time the chopper will be back and we can get on our way meanwhile the ops truck has airconditioning as they walked back towards the articulated vehicle jake said the stuff lardis left out i mean apart from the technical stuff or science as he calls it was mainly to do with people harry keogh of course the mysterious necroscope but also his sons the dweller nestor and nathan huh i learned more about vavara malinari and szwart than about these human figures trask looked at him but said nothing and so jake went on that term necroscope it comes up time and time again now i know what a telescope is tele is from the greek right far as in far away likewise micro in microscope which obviously means very small but necroscope an instrument for seeing corpses something like that trask told him and that makes sense to you and to you eventually trask answered i hope jake shook his head so its your belief that this harry keogh this necroscope who sees dead folks is in my head now i know ive tried asking this before but what the hell is this guy some kind of telepath trask nodded he was that too towards the end was jake frowned towards the end then he snapped his fingers oh yes and thats the other thing lardis mentioned a bomb a a nuke a that came through the gate into starside and i somehow got the impression that harry and this er a this changeling son of his the dweller a that they were there at the time they were approaching the steps at the rear of the big ops vehicle trask paused in his striding to take jakes arm they were there he said his voice hoarse now and before you ask me no harry didnt escape what jake said trask climbed the steps and made to enter then turned and looked back harry keogh necroscope a the original necroscope a is dead and gone jake he said in one way an incredible waste and in another a merciful release and probably a blessing too dead jake said and was suddenly cold fn the full glare of the sun then how cana aharrys gone trask cut him short hes just another one of ebranchs ghosts but dead and gone or alive and living in you he has never been more important to us than he is right now inside the vehicles ops section the duty officer and the precog lan goodly were seated within the central control area liz was standing outside the desk her elbows on its nolongercluttered surface her chin cupped in her hands apart from minimum servicesathe permanent telephone array one small radio crackling with static and a dimlyluminescent wall screen a ops had been more or less unplugged and decommissioned however temporarily the muted conversation tailed off awkwardly as trask and jake entered but the head of ebranch held up a hand and said its okay i want all of you to stay i have to speak to jake and i cant see any reason to leave anyone out lan if i slip up and forget some important detail youll be here to correct me and liz there may be the odd tidbit of information thats new to you too he hitched himself up onto the desk and jake let down one of the wall seats and sat opposite then without further pause trask told his part of the story jake lardis lidesci has told you something about his world a parallel world called sunsidestarside by its inhabitants hes told you about vavara szwart a and malinari too so by now you know that these arent just legendary or mythical figures but a very real threat to everyone in our world theyre here biding their time hiding out somewhere on earth now please take that for granted and believe that its so for last night was a mere lesson a a primer a single leafa out of the great textbook of the enormous threat posed by the wamphyri so lets deal with it step by step how they got here has to be the first question thats obvious five years ago the gate in perchorsk was closed that was in large part gustav turchins doing for which our thanks but turchin is only one man and russia is a big place the expansionist element hasnt gone away there are still plenty of powerful people in the former ussr who hanker after the good old days when their satellite subordinates paid tribute to mother russia so while communism may have been wounded its scars are quickly healing and the scene is set for a resurgence the russians are rather well known for their capacity for the odd revolution now and then and their armed forces are now political factors in their own right well the fact is they always have been but never more so than now in ebranch we all remember how turkur tzonov then head of the opposition a our term for the ussrs answer to ebranch a planned to take his partly nationalistic but mainly egomaniac schemes along with a dedicated crack military unit into sunsidestarside to conquer it for russia but turchin had his own ideas about tzonovs real motives and so did we sunside starside is rich in gold far richer than the yukons klondike in its heyday and its not some kind of localized motherlode gold is common in the vampire world it can be found literally anywhere working with turchin we tried to keep that a secret too for obvious reasons or maybe theyre not so obvious so id better clarify russia is broke her army navy and air force are destitute or so close it makes no difference they cant even afford to decommission their clappedout nuclear submarines and leaking missiles but have to dump them in someone elses backyard but russias generals her admirals and air marshals are still very powerful when that lunatic turkur tzonov went into starside to get himself killed he left many of his men behind trapped in perchorsk by gustav turchins security forces tzonov had promised his men gold and we all know what gold does to men gold is power power corrupts and ultimate power so then sunsidestarside was literally one big goldmine and the only sure access was through perchorsk in russias ural mountains oh it was blocked flooded thats true but if you can turn a tap on you can also turn it off okay the rest of this cant be guaranteed as pure fact but were ebranch and we do what we do and were not usually very far wrong we keep our eyes and our ears a oh and a lot of other equipment a open and try to keep up to date and we also have what nathan keogh told us so its a patchwork quilt of sorts but pretty accurate we think where was i oh yes the perchorsk gate was closed but somebody wanted it open enter russian internal security a militarized updated kgb lookalike headed by general mikhail suvorov they stepped in and did just that diverted the perchorsk dam waters back into the ravine and let the gate drain the complex dry then they had to decide who was going to explore sunsidestarside though exploit might be a better word for it but in any case it didnt quite come to that more than eighteen months had passed since turchin closed the gate since when hed had a hard time fighting off suvorov who of course wanted it opened up because he had heard rumours about the gold and suvorov eventually won the fight because turchin was over a barrel russia was in the red and suvorov a who was very red a had the answer a huge goldmine in a primitive world at the other end of an interdimensional tunnel whose only accessible entrance lay deep in the earth and deeper still inside mother russia thus turchin had very little choice he could step aside and let suvorov get on with what hed promised would be a limited exploration or suvorov would tell all the hungry russian people about the unlimited wealth that their premier was striving to deny them well we all know what that would have meantonly think back on the klondike and youll see what i mean everyone would want a piece of the action and remember gustav turchin knew something about the horrors of the vampire worldaknew as much if not more than we do about what happened at perchorsk in its early days certainly he realized that the fewer people who entered the gate the smaller the odds theyd bring something back with them out of starside something other than gold that is and in all that time a some eighteen months a wed had no word from nathan keogh who of course had made his home in sunside but how could we have heard from him since the gates had been closed ah but nathan had his own route to earth through the mobius continuum thats the place where you go jake a er between going places a its the darkness between leaving one place and arriving at the next okay i know thats not good enough but more later anyway nathan probably had his own reasons for breaking contact with us but it wasnt as if we felt let down indeed without him wed have been in a hell of a mess we being our entire world its bad enough that we have three of these monsters here but without nathan wed have had an army come to think of it lan and i wouldnt even be here right now to talk about these things and none of you would be here to hear what im saying oh you would probably still be here a somewhere in the world a but not the way you are now and damn few other people not as you know them very well nathans reasons for breaking contact in turning his world and working out a means of preserving its integrity a for it had been nathans idea to flood perchorsk not the russian premiers turchin was acting mainly on nathans suggestion a hed also secured a measure of isolation for sunsidestarside maybe he thought that if he left us alone we would leave him and his alone he knew how far ahead we were technologically speakingi dont know perhaps he preferred to keep his people out of the ratrace also he wouldnt have forgotten that there were some people who would continue to see his world as a threat despite all precautions and he knew they had the means to destroy it and finallythere was all that gold useless to the travellers except as a malleable metal but valuable beyond measure on earth an irresistible lure for the helllanders a meaning you me us a probably well enough of thathe simply didnt contact us for whatever reasons and during that same period of time nathans world was swinging back again the shadows lengthening on starside and the sun settling back into its old accustomed orbit and far beyond the boulder plains under the flutter and weave of strange auroras a lot of the northern ice had melted enter szwart vavara and nephran malinari the only possible explanation is that they had been locked in the ice a or they had locked themselves in the ice preserving themselves in suspended animation a when theyd been thrown out of starside wamphyri they could do it they must have done it deepfrozen themselves a handful of thralls and however many flying creatures theyd required to bear them into the icelands when they were banished from the aeries of the wamphyri the natural or unnatural tenacity of the vampire and meanwhile here on this world our world we werent even aware that mikhail suvorov and a party of scientists geologists and prospectors a not to mention a platoon of heavily armed russian soldiers a had entered starside through the gate in perchorsk perhaps turchin had been warned not to inform us i like to think so or maybe he didnt want to for that would have been to admit his own impotence in the matter and he must have been just as ignorant as we were of the return of the wamphyri no way he could have known they were back in starside nathan knew though and so did lardis lidesci they knew because of the new spate of raids on sunside ah but this time the wamphyri didnt have it all their own way not by any means nathan had equipped his people with some devastating earthtype weaponry and because of his knowledge of our technology traveller science was likewise leaping ahead so that as quickly as vavara and lords szwart and malinari were recruiting building up their vampire forces in the hollow stumps of the fallen aeries of the wamphyri nathan and his traveller fighting men were cutting them down to size again but while this resulted in some kind of stalemate still szgany lives were being lost especially in the farthest corners of sunside in tribal territories that lay far beyond the lidesci sphere of influence despite nathans esp those amazing powers that hed inherited from his father he couldnt possibly be everywhere at once and even in sunsidestarside charity begins at home of course his main concern was for the szgany lidesci and he had his work cut out protecting them part of that work which was of the utmost importance to nathan was to get the old lidesci and his wife lissa safely out of there for its a fact that lardis is an old man now a older than his years a as a direct result of living most of his life in the shadow of the wamphyri in his youth life on sunside was no bowl of cherries now nathan would take over from himjust as soon as hed taken him out of harms way so let lardis complain all he wanted a and im told he complained quite a bit a nathan gave him no choice but simply brought him and his wife to the supposed safety of our world thats how he got here and why lissa is in the care of our people in london nathan would have protected his own wife misha in the same way but misha wasnt having it shed lost him twice before if nathan was going to be fighting the wamphyri yet again she was going to be at his side its the same story for our own annamarie english anna had married a traveller called andrei romani and made a life for herself caring for orphans of the bloodwars she wasnt going to leave andrei or the children behind without one hell of a fight and so she stayed very well but just weeks before nathan er transported lardis and lissa to earth there was a curious lull in vampire attacks on sunside when they started up again the three principal survivors of four or five hundred years of frozen banishment were no longer in command of their lieutenants thralls and warrior creatures a or rather they no longer accompanied them in their raids on sunside in order to find out what was happening nathan and his szgany fighting men trapped a lieutenant bound him to a cross with silver wire and offered him the usual choice he could talk and die a clean death with a crossbow bolt in his heart or he could say nothing and be lowered face down undead and kicking into a fire pit he talked died quickly and then burned there is no other way for a vampire as for what he said vavara and the others had intercepted strangers entering starside from the gate on the boulder plains there was a short unequal battle a very short for suvorovs troops werent prepared for this but then who would have been a and lord malinari was now questioning the handful of survivors before they were sent to the provisioningthat is before they were used and drained by lieutenants and thralls and their corpses turned to fodder for the beasts for of course following malinaris kind of interrogation they wouldnt be very much good for anything else apparently stalled by something in his story trask had paused his face was drawn and grey now his eyes sunken he looked far older than his years much as hed described the old lidesci the precog lan goodly knew what was wrong and said ben ill take it from here if you like no trask husked when jake was under pressure he told his own story so its only right i tell mine hell ive lived with it for almost three years now but still he took a few seconds to straighten out his thoughts then call it coincidence he continued or maybe synchronicity but nathan arrived at ebranch in harrys room yes just a little too late he had lardis and lissa with him and a list of stuff he wanted to take back with him but it was the middle of the night and there was only a skeleton staff and iwas already on my way in driving like hell through the empty cold night streets god only knows how many red lights id crashed why was i in such a hurry because of a dream a a bloody nightmare a a feeling that something was wrong no it was much more than just a feeling the sure knowledge that something was definitely wrong my espers how often had i heard it from them that their talents were a curse mine too i supposed when i had to sit and listen to rapists paedophiles and murderers trying to talk their way out of jail sit there reading their lies and knowing that in fact they were coldblooded killers molesters and defilers but not once until that night had i really considered my talent a curse and i can well understand how you felt lan seeing the future in a dream but not knowing it was more than a dream for thats how it had been with me just a dream but ohsomuch more than a dream and iit had been a hard day at the officeid just lain there tossing and turning reading the truth of the damned thing but unable to wake up until she told me to god and again he paused but this time before goodly could speak up again it was zek my wife trask blurted it out she was at the refuge in romania where for a fortnight the outflow from the underground river had been almost at a standstill the regular crew at radujevac couldnt understand it but since it coincided with low winter rainfall patterns right across europe thats what they put it down to anyway thats not why she was there zek is a she was a a telepath of the highest order but she was more than that no one who ever met her could fail to be impressed by my beautiful zek harry keogh himself jazz simmons lardis lidescieven the lady karen theyd all been won over by zek and those poor romanian kids at the refuge some grown into men now but still suffering from deep psychological traumas dating back to ceauaescus time of course she must try to help them she could get inside their minds track down their problems even try to cancel them out sometimes it worked other times she cried and she was crying in my dream crying out to me to her husband who knew he was only nightmaring yet at the same time knew he wasnt but in any case couldnt do a damn thing about it and despite what was happening to her or about to happen zek was getting through to me in the only way left to her it wasnt the first time once before shed contacted me telepathically that was in may when she was with nathan in the mediterranean more specifically the ionian theyd gone to zante a or zakynthos the island of zeks birth from which shed taken her name a so that she could well pay her respects to jazz simmons who was buried there jazz had been zeks first husbandhe was dead of natural causes but turkur tzonovs people were tracking nathan to kill him and since zek was with him theyd kill her too it was while they were trying to kill her that shed contacted me and for a moment i had experienced all that she was feeling i had known what it was like to die but she hadnt died because thats when nathan discovered the mobius continuum and used it to bring her back to ebranch in my nightmare it was the same again zek in her a god her extreme of terror a knowing it was over yet trying to get through to me to let me know what was happening in one way it was a cry for help which she must have known i couldnt possibly answer and in another it was this incredibly brave woman passing on everything she knew about about it came thick and fast telepathy is like that conveying a lot more than mere words whats that old saw about a picture being worth a thousand words well its true enough i saw half of it in pictures and half in thoughts mind to mind all of it while i tossed and turned and a damn my dreams forever a while i slept on one of the refuges maintenance men a new zealander called bruce trennier was down in the sump a the subterranean rivers exit or resurgence a examining the system of hydroelectric barriers and the turbine that powered the refuge during the romanian rainy season his being down there was partly in connection with the falloff in the outflow and partly because his instrumentation indicated that something wasnt right down there the system hadnt been entirely reliable since the time when cmi a combined military intelligence disbanded now thank goodness a made their biggestever mistake and blew it up anyway trennier was in contact by landline with the refuges night staff and hed told them he was opening a dry inspection duct to go into the actual cave of the resurgence hed thought that perhaps something was clogging the works in there and something was a a dead vampire lieutenant his body rammed into the pipe that monitored the flow obviously vavara szwart and malinari had been trying to get someones attention and theyd succeeded and trennier had provided them with a way out well the rest is sheer conjecture im trying to remember all of this from a dream after all and its a dream ive tried so hard to forget and even at the time it was fragmentary as dreams usually are and zek my zekshe wasnt at her best but who would be in herin her situation once again trask fell silent choking on his own emotions in a little while when liz quietly inquired if she should make coffee he simply nodded then for a time no one said anything not even jake i chapter fourteen zeks passing it was several minutes before trask could continue but eventually let me try to tell it the way i saw or received it he said it was night at the refuge two hours ahead of our time in london zek had been awakened by her pager a call from one of the twoman nightnursing staff bruce trennier was already down in the sump whatever the trouble was hed said it couldnt wait the forecast said heavy rain and the resurgence was prone to flashflooding if there was a blockage the pressure could create all kinds of fresh problems down there which was why he had gone down at night with a tool box a powerful torch and an ancient batterypowered landline telephone that was probably on the blink because contact was weak and intermittent but even before zek got to the duty room she sensed that something was wrong not with trennier you understand a for she didnt even know about him a but just generally wrong zek was a very strong telepath as ive said and there waswhat a presence a probing in the psychic aether some kind of interference whatever something wasnt right with the static a the term used by telepaths to define the background hiss and babble of thoughts emitted by the people around them a and it was something shed never experienced before now in ebranch we have rules we dont use our talents on each other never myself i have an excuse my things automatic as was darcy clarkes before me darcy wasnt in charge of what he did a in fact he didnt do anything a his thing simply took care of him he was a deflector the opposite of accidentprone as if some kind of guardian angel was constantly on duty looking after him darcy could have crossed a minefield in snowshoes without getting hurt except his talent wouldnt have let him but dont think it made him careless on the contrary he used to switch off the power before hed even change a light bulb or maybe that was just another form of his talent in action my thing is the same if someone lies to me i cant help but know it its not that i want to not every time its just something that happens but a telepath has a choice to tune in on the thoughts of others or simply to ignore them and most telepaths can turn the static down or even switch it off which is just as well or theyd never get any sleep so in ebranch we dont mess with each other lets face it it has to be the easiest way to lose friends if your partner is in a bad mood you really dont want to know that youre pissing him off just by being in the same room but zekshe was the same with everyone at work a in the foreign embassies or working criminal cases a she was the best outside of work she switched off she wasnt interested in the many perverse little thoughts that are flying around out there and it was the same at the refuge she had enough on her plate just working with those poor sick kids let alone probing the minds of her colleagues and incidentally she was the only esper out there its quite some time since ebranch maintained any real presence in radujevac i mention these things so youll see why she didnt immediately switch on to the truth of what was going on zek didnt use her talent as a matter of course only where it was needed and as for trennier being down in the sump she didnt find out about that until shed reached the duty room and even then she wasnt much bothered not at first for that wasnt the reason shed been woken up no that was because being ebranch she was the senior officer in situ at that time and any problem with the kids the senior officer had to be informed thats what it was the kids and as far as zek was concerned a halfawake and all a thats all it was but they were really going to town or rather they werent thats what was wrong with the static not that its flow had been interrupted but that it just wasnt there it was as ifas if the kids had all come awake at the same time and were listening to something but listening intently to the exclusion of everything else and whatever it was they could hearthey didnt much like it that was why they were using their pagers every last one of them also why the duty rooms switchboard was lit up like a christmas tree and why zek had been woken up and called in for her opinion but she didnt get to voice that opinion for as she entered the duty room and saw the switchboard two things happened simultaneously one she reached out with her mind a to one of the kids a case shed been working with and knew intimately a and two the oldfashioned landline telephone jangled and went on jangling of course it was trennier but a damned insistent trennier first the kid a romanian orphan of maybe eighteen years zek broke into his mind and someone was there not just the kid but someone something else something incredibly intelligent that crawled and observed and was thirsty for knowledge something that felt like cold slime and left a cold cold void behind it and when zeks talent touched it she felt a recoil and then a question a who a as whatever it was tried to fasten on her too then she was out of there snatching her thoughts back as if theyd contacted a live wire closing them down and erecting her mental barriers as things began to make sense by which time one of the duty nurses was answering trenniers call this was a male nurse one who zek knew to be solid as a rock but as he listened to trenniers hysterical babbling over that tinny old telephone wire so his eyes widened and his mouth fell open zek took the phone from him told him to go and see what was wrong with the kids the other nurse had already left and now she was on her own a well except for the terrified voice of bruce trennier reaching up to her from the sump he told her about the body in the monitor pipe said that it had been shoved or crushed all the way in almost its full length but despite the awesome force that must have been exerted to cram it in there head first a because the pipe was only eighteen inches in diameter and the male figure wasugathere was still some kind of horrible life in it the feet kept twitching and that wasnt the worst of it whoever or whatever had done this awful thing was still down there trennier had heard something and hed seen movement in the inky darkness between him and the open duct and now zek knew beyond a doubt what was happening here she didnt want to believe it but she knew anyway in the eye of her mind suddenly she could see the whole story something had happened to stop the water flowing from perchorsk and the starside gate was open again it was the only possible explanation the children were feeling the influence of whatever trennier was experiencing and the darkness between him and his only escape route had to be could only bea awamphyri how didnt matter but they were back back in our world this time and bruce trennier was down there with them and the kidstheir vulnerable minds had been discovered and explored by more powerful minds or one more powerful mind at least sensing it as mice sense a cat the orphans had reacted a not without justification knowing the wamphyri zek knew that their thoughts were terrible things a knew also that the cat was already bunching its muscles preparing to spring her mind must have flown every which way her responsibilities to the refuge the children ebrancheven to me god damn it the fact that out of the refuges double handful of staff she was the only one who knew anything about the wamphyri and the sure knowledge that if they broke into the refuge into romania the world then the nightmare would be on us all over again all of these things galvanizing zek into activity but the right or wrong activity a who could say she only knew she must do something and how to tell trennier still hysterical on the phone that he was already as good as dead or changed forever so perhaps hed care to volunteer his own life for the sake of everyone elses for zek knew something about the refuge that no one else not even the new zealander the engineer knew that some years ago ebranch had installed the last of several failsafes and down there in the sump there was a way to close this end of the loop for good powerful explosive charges in the ceiling of the cavern a blast sufficient to bring down the roof of the place and seal it permanently and we would have done it long since but the gates were closed and the wamphyri gone and we needed the turbine to power the refuge there were two switches that had to be thrown one inside the sump to arm the charges and the other outside the reinforced concrete barrier that sealed the resurgence and channelled its waters the exterior switch triggered the thing obviously but also as a sensible safety precaution there was a fifteenminute delay after both switches had been thrown and last but not least by way of safety both hatches had to be locked from the outside a in fact they could only be locked from the outside a before the electrical circuit could complete itself zek calmed trennier down as best she could gave him directions to the switchbox told him to throw the switch and get out of there a but she kept that last reservation to herself for there was no time no way she could begin to explain her fears about the wamphyri not that the new zealander would have understood he was in too much of a funk and who wouldnt be trapped in the dark with the utterly unknown at least zek had given him something to go on instructions of a sort then she hit the alarms woke the staff told them to take the kids and move out a all of this taking very little time and none of it making too much sense to anyone except zek who just didnt have time to explain and in that chaos of blaring alarms and puzzled sleepy staff colliding with each other and scared kids awake and crying in their rooms the rest of it was up to zek now she must make her way to the basement set the trigger and wait at the open hatch for the engineer to come through a and hope that it was only the engineer who came through a before she closed the hatch and locked it completing the connection that would blow the sump and whatever else it contained to hell but if it wasnt the new zealander who came through what then my god what a nightmare and now maybe youll forgive me that ive tried to forget all this all the panic and sweaty horror of it as zek my zek rushed to the basement levels climbed down into the nowsilent engine room and made her way down a spiralling steel staircase into the belly of the refuge to the reinforced concrete floor whose underside was the manmade ceiling in the natural cavern of the resurgence in normal circumstances that floor would have been trembling to the throb of pressured water but the water was a trickle now and the place no longer vibrated there in that cellarlike room which now seemed vaguely threatening a pair of cylindrical turrets stood up kneehigh from the floor the carbonsteel hatch of one of them had been laid back on massive hinges revealing a dark throat that was more threatening yet but looking around and seeing a niche in the wall and a shelf bearing an extension telephone handset zek believed she knew how to approach this thing first and foremost there was the hatch it must be closed and immediately if trennier was on his way outhe would go through hell when he found the hatch locked but there was nothing else for it and it was only a temporary measure and trying not to think of the new zealanders terrible situation zek wasted no time but closed the hatch locked its wheel then ran to the open end of the cavern where concrete steps took her down to the ancient bed of the resurgence from there she climbed rusting iron rungs to a place high in the wall of the cavern where a deep crevice housed the triggers waterproof switch it was stiffa probably a little rusty a but she managed to throw it anyway then rapidly retraced her route back to the empty echoing basement by now zek was feeling shaky the combination of fear and frantic physical activity had almost exhausted her but at last the stage was set by now too trennier should be battering on the closed hatchbut wasnt and if by now hed thrown that switch he only had eight to ten minutes to get out of there zek had an automatic pistol ever since being attacked on zante shed been in the habit of carrying a gun i dont think i need mention what kind of ammunition she used now preparing her weapon she stuck it in her waistband and took up the dusty telephone from its shelf in the wall niche neglected its battery was dead but its generator handle twirled readily enough in a moment she had trennier on the other end of the line the new zealander was still in a state a even worse than before a and he hadnt done what zek required of him oh hed found the switch in its secret place but he hadnt thrown it trennier wasnt a stupid man an engineer hed taken one look at that switch and known that the sump was rigged for destruction knowing zek however he was pretty sure that wasnt going to happen while he was in there but still he wasnt taking any chances and in a panting whisper he demanded to know what was going on what it was all about and what it was that was keeping him silent but observant company down there something was watching him he felt sure she couldnt tell him could only tell him once again to throw the switch and get back to one of the ducts a either one it made no difference a and climb out of there as long as they stayed in contact she would know it was him and no other she wouldnt shoot him as he emerged but telling him that was a mistake no other what other or others was zek going on about what did she know that trennier didnt others that needed shooting others that were capable of stuffing a big man into an eighteeninch pipe what in hell were the murdering things down there in the dark with him in the sump but no she neednt bother to tell him and fuck the switch hed be going back to the duct right now a and up through the hatch a and god help anyone or anything that got in his way zek yelled into the phone then screamed into it to get his attention and finally she got it but she knew she had to be hard on him it was the only way and so she told him about the hatches how they were closed and she wasnt going to open one until she was sure he had thrown that switch oh zek knew she would let him out anyway however it went but she darent let him see that and so he did it threw the switch and zek knew he had because shed reached out to him with her telepathy and seen him do it and now there were just fifteen minutes to go but in reaching out to trennier she had opened her mind a and it wasnt only his thoughts that came through the breach then however briefly she found herself listening to something else the thing that had terrified the children it was a fleeting experience momentary but all the same it chilled her mind like a blast out of some frozen hell ahhh see now he makes a move now he flees this place and in so doing shows us the way outthat much and no more before zek closed her mind again but more than enough surely panicked bruce trennier was on his wayand how many of the wamphyri were following on behind him but it also showed a degree of uncertainty on their part a showed that they werent entirely sure of what they were up against in this world a for they hadnt simply taken trennier and made him show them the way out what would that cold thing have learned for example from the damaged minds of the refuges children nothing except perhaps something of the caring warmth and attention of the refuges staff but that in itself might have been seen as a weakness for on starside such children wouldnt have been spared mentally a and frequently physically a unfit their only use would be as fodder for the beasts even on sunside the szgany would have thought twice before accepting such burdens especially under threat from the wamphyri what could such children be except an enormous hindrance yet here they were cared for it spoke volumes for the inhabitants of earth but mainly that they were soft riddled with unnecessary guilt selfdoubt and pity for their societys underdogs but in starside underdogs were eaten what zek didnt know of course was that vavara and the others had already seen something of earths awesome firepower at the starside gate theyd clashed with general mikhail suvorovs men an unequal battle yes but at the time theyd been an army now there were just the three of them plus a handful of lieutenants not only that but malinari also knew that at least one of this worlds inhabitants was a powerful telepath while she wasnt of his order still she was proof that the helllands werent entirely defenceless the minutes ticked by and zek was on tenterhooks five minutes six seven even if she returned to the dry bed of the resurgence and climbed up to the crevice with the switch still she wouldnt be able to reverse the process now the clock was ticking and nothing could stop it and the only way to delay it would be to open one of the hatches a temporary measure and definitely the most dangerous of all the basement was lit by half a dozen naked light bulbs in the ceiling since these were powered by a small emergency generator their light was less than reliable through all of what she had been doing zek had worked in the flicker of these weak light sources all the while conscious of the refuges foghorn alarms their muted blare carrying down to her through concrete floors and steel stairwells yet in a way the sound had comforted her and even the flickering lights had reminded her of the world above its relative sanity now it seemed someone was intent on denying her even these small comforts for suddenly the alarms ceased and at the same time the lights burned low held for a moment and went out it could only be that up there in the chaos of the refuge someone had turned the alarms off whoever it was he had inadvertently hit the basement light switch too and now there were only a few minutes left before the sump erupted in death and destruction zek couldnt even be sure she herself was safe there in the basement let alone bruce trennier in the sump and she was tempted to reach out to him yet again and see what progress hed made she would have done so a but that was when the telephone jangled mercifully shed thought to take a small torch down there with her three paces took her to the niche with the telephone and in another moment she was asking bruceare you alright where on earth are you at the foot of the duct he answered and his voice was one long shudder ive been dodginggod things catch them in my torch beam and they just sort of melt aside but i can feel them there in the darkness one of themit doesnt seem to have a shape it collapses in my torch beam flows reforms and zek a god zek a they make my flesh creep bruce come up she told him but as quick as you can and ill let you out and then another slow minute until she heard him banging on the hatch that shed closed a moment to spin the wheel her heart hammering and breath coming in panting gasps the silence absolute the darkness too except where her torch beam sliced into it she hauled on the hatch and he pushed from below and in that last moment she thought to reach out to him touch him with her mind and she dida abut his mind was a blinding white agony and his single thought was a scream that shrank even as it pierced her gradually disappearing into the distance of mental oblivion and as it ran and ran with nowhere to hide still it echoed her name zekaah zek zekkk zekkkk ah zekkkkkf until it was gone then zeks strength was as furious as her fear as she tried to slam the heavy lid on trennier for in fact it was the new zealander a his head and shoulders a emerging from the hatch but it wasnt his mind that drove him it wasnt his muscles propelling him up out of the darkness for pain had robbed him of consciousness and all its attendant skills try to picture it his body rising up loose arms flopping up over the rim blind eyes staring back ramrod straight the engineer was like some grotesque puppethe was a grotesque puppet for someone had an arm up inside him at full stretch and that someones hand was gripping his spine from inside holding him upright a glovepuppet yes as he folded in the middle to topple out of the turret and anothers head and shoulders came into view but such an other zeks legs were rubber her hand too where she forced it to reach for the gun in her waistband she was stumbling backwards away from this scene of uttermost horror yet every move she made was in some kind of dreadful slowmotion and the figure in the hatch wrenching its crimson arm from trenniers bodyblood flying splashing zeks face in a red slapyellow eyes burning on her seeming to burn into her their cores blazing scarlet in a moment they were like the holes in a halloween mask those eyes but they were alive he a it a came out of the hatch in one flowing movement while another figure rose up behind him all of this happening in a surreal slowmotion that was simply a trick of zeks mind for in fact it was very fast and in her extreme of numb gnawing terror almost too fast to follow she snapped out of it put her hands together aimed with the torch and the gun both but even as she pulled the trigger that bloodied arm swept the gun aside sent it flying and the torch too and a cold wet hand caught at her wrists trapping both of them in its icy grip trask had paused his eyes were staring unblinking gaunt and grey he seemed to have collapsed down into himself a little when a crackle of static sounded from the radio the duty officer gave a start but then a tinny voice was heard reporting the jetcopters progress bird one to baseeta twenty to twentyfive minutes over roger out said the do into his handset that served to bring trask out of it and i suppose id better finish it he said and in a little while lacklustre and robotic but inured now he carried on understand this wasnt my dream a not all of it a though im sure that parts of it were what ive told you so far is mymy reconstruction of the socalled radujevac incident as ive pictured it time and time over in my minds eye and in my current nightmares its built out of details that nathan keogh gave us out ofgod evidencethat we found at the refuge and lastly out of zeks telepathic contact with me while i lay tossing and turning during her final moments her final moments yes for that was when she knew it was over when that bastard thing malinari trapped her wrists gripped them in his freezing cold hand and smiled his dreadful smile at her smiled at zek inclined his head and began reading her like a book but every page as he absorbed it was torn out discarded went fluttering into oblivion and knowing it was over that was when she contacted me once before shed done it when shed thought she was dying but this time she was dying in my nightmare i saw his face handsome yes but a vacant sort of beauty superficial cosmetic lord malinari looked as he willed himself to look young but not too young dark but not too dark thirsty andand no way to hide it greedy for knowledge and the power it would bring zeks knowledge which she wasnt going to give him without a fight at first she didnt look at him could only stare at poor trennier sprawled on the floor in his own blood his face alternating between glaring white and shadow white and shadow as her torch rocked to a standstill close by at his bulging eyes his gaping mouth poor trennier raped and dead buta ah no said malinari the mind in a voice like bubbles bursting on a pool of oil not dead but undead or soon to be he knows things a of metals machines and engines a and i would know them too but youthe things thatjyow know are of far greater interest moreover i see that i am not the first of my kind that you have known zek could feel her knowledge slipping from her a slithering out of her and into him like a greasy rope in a tugowar a and she fed her thoughts to me that much faster but malinari would not be denied he read her telepathic messages too interpreting them as best he might as for her knowledge it was as if zeks past her memories her understanding of the worldas if it were all iron filings and malinaris mind a vast magnet drawing them out of her but she fought a oh how she fought a so that what came to me was of the moment not of the past as she allowed me to see how it was and explained in a kaleidoscope of telepathic scenes how it had been for her and how if would be for the world if i didnt receive her warning but she knew that it couldnt go on a couldnt be allowed to go on a for he was taking too much and if she let him hed get it all about me ebranch our espers their talents malinari would get it all if she let him by now the others were up out of the sump vavara incredibly beautiful in zeks mind lit by her own radiance alluring so as to further weaken zek by her presence and i saw her but ill spare you any description because i know that any description would be false for the beauty of a vampire lady is literally skin deep let me just say this most womenayoung women especially those of great beautyawould hate her they would be irresistibly attracted to her but theyd hate her and even the most blase man a man drained by his excesses sated to his full measure would lust after vavara and finally lord szwart a darknessa flowing oozing somethinga shape without a shapethe ultimate in metamorphismscorning any fixed form for the constant ongoing unceasing mutation of protoplasm which was his existence a flythelight but more so than any other great vampire the closest comparison we could make would be nathan keoghs description of eygor killglance of madmanse in turgosheim in a vampire world but where eygor was made of flesh and bone a albeit the flesh and bones of others a szwart was of a far more elemental material and most of it was darkness vavara seeing zek drawn up against nephran malinari and jealous of any naturally attractive woman said take what you will and finish it her voice was beautiful as her lying form as ugly as her words and szwarts was a hiss of air driven out through temporary lungs specifically created as on the spur of the moment to enable speech aye get done with it there are young ones up above sweet meat for the taaakingand a world entire to conquer but no ah no said malinari and moved his slender hand to lift zeks chin she fights me with a will of iron and i desire whats in there and to zek a and through her to me a do you know the eyes are the windows of the soul its true zekintha but to these fingers of mine they are also the doorways to the mind and i weary of this and would have it quickly he held up two fingers before her aiming them at her only inches from her eyes zek knew what he would do but seeing his fingers vibrating pulsing with purple veins elongating and reaching towards her she also knew what she must do she volunteered a picture thrust it at him showed him the doom shed planned for him and the others and seared it into his probing mind oh she lied a described a devastation far greater than the truth that would come ripping through the floor in rivers of fire and tortured concrete threatening him even here a and perhaps lord malinari suspected it was a lie but the way zeks eyes were locked on that open hatch out of which the last of three lieutenants was even now appearing he couldnt take the chance what he said furious where he drew back a pace and was this for me for us then he gathered her up carried her to the hatch and without pausewithout pause head first she fell down and down and as nephran malinari slammed and locked the hatch the time was up that was when i woke up drenched and shivering hot yet cold with zeks last words still ringing in my mind goodbye ben she said i love you and then a blinding white light which i prayed was only the dazzle of my bedside lamp as my trembling fingers switched it on thats what i prayed it wasa abut it wasnt chapter fifteen charnel house it was plain that trask couldnt go on so while he sat there shaking his head in a kind of numb disbelief still seeking a reason for or perhaps a solution to his irreparable trauma the precog lan goodly took over in contrast to trasks harsh grating rasp his voice was almost melodious it was a period of unrest among the old ussrs satellite countries he began one of many since the death of european communism the former yugoslavia bulgaria romania they were all in a state of political turmoil and radujevac stood at the crossroads as it were of all three nations the refuge was a kind of sovereign base area a a british enclave if you like a on foreign soil but despite that and as a result of its work it was greatly respected and had achieved an almost diplomatic status of course the british government had safe houses embassies and the like in all the former satellites but because of the unrest access was always difficult even to the refuge well nathan keogh arrived at our london hq that night and he was in the process of explaining what was happening in sunsidestarside when ben got there at first ben was overjoyed even relieved to see him maybe this was what had sparked his dream perhaps in some way he had anticipated this renewed contact with a friend from the oncehostile environment of the vampire world but as nathans story unfolded bens awareness a his sense of dread of foreboding a returned in short order it was one of those times that come to all espendowed persons when out of the blue theyre made aware of the other side the downside of their talents and now more than ever bens talent was telling him that zeks telepathic message had been no mere nightmare as the precog paused trask levered himself off the desk stood up straight and closed his eyes he breathed in until his lungs couldnt take any more then made for the door and no one said anything until he had made an unsteady exit covering for his superior a though in fact trask needed no such excuse a goodly said did you hear the chopper ben will want to see it safely down and maybemaybe talk to the pilot he offered a shrug which was followed by an awkward silence until jake said lan it was the first time hed used goodlys first name will you finish it goodly looked mildly surprised as he answered of course all of this is for you after all but in any case theres not much more to tell and in a little while we had radio and telephone links to the refuge the precog went on well we should have had but not that night we tried but couldnt get through and because of what nathan had told us we feared the worst but ben a denying or even defying his own talent a he had to know for sure of course several means were to hand we called in our espers everyone who was available and put them to work but long before the first of them arrived at the hq nathan was volunteering his services hed been to the refuge before and its coordinates were locked in his mind but if ben was right and the wamphyri had come through the subterranean gate a and if they were still there a what then for ben the next hour was an endless anxiety attack he sweated and agonized over dangerfraught decisions and equally painful but inescapable truths having faith in his talent he knew it was already too late a but it was zek who was there at the refuge and nathan he would have gone at the snap of bens fingers a indeed he was the only one who could go along that special route of his and in fact we had to restrain him order him not to and ben weighing all of this in his tormented mind all the time knowing in his heart that it was too late that it had been too late from the moment hed started awake in a cold sweat at his home in kensington then millicent cleary arrived milly is a now she is a the very best of our telepaths and right on her heels our locator of long standing david chung ill never forget the scene in the ops room that night chung standing before the illuminated wall map with the tip of his index finger touching the location of radujevac and his left hand holding millys we frequently work in tandem that way and after only a second or so their reactions how david snatched himself back away from the wall and how milly snatched back her hand from his for the locator had sensed something a something at radujevac at the refuge a and she had picked it right out of his mind the clammy feel of it its evil taint mindsmog milly had hoped to contact zek firm friends and colleagues they knew each others minds but now there was simply no trace of zeks telepathic aura no indication of life hers was a flatline on the monitor of telepathic awareness and as for the overwhelming presence of mindsmog it couldnt be denied or mistaken and bens worst fears were corroborated of course the necroscope had his own way of looking into matters of that sort butno need to go into that here well just like last night i blamed myself why hadnt i seen it coming what good is a talent that only reveals itself when it wants to why is the future so bloody devious i blamed myself that i hadnt foreseen it while ben was in hell for having seen it and the rest of the team they were depressed that theyd had to confirm it while at the refuge the mindsmog was rapidly dispersing after that there was no holding nathan his father harry keogh had owed zek favours and nathan himself was in her debtnot only was she a friend one who had fought alongside him in starside but shed even been involved with his discovery of the mobius continuum no less than ben nathan knew he wouldnt rest until he a until they a were sure not sure that zek was dead for all of us knew that by then but sure that she would never be wndead and so we armed ourselves and nathan took us to the refuge but a refuge no longer for now it was a charnel house ben myself chung and lardis a huh try keeping the old lidesci out of it hed loved zek dearly a nathan took us along the mobius route to radujevac it was some two hours maybe two and a half since ben had come awake from his nightmare more than enough time for thethe slaughter of the staff and children from what we saw twenty minutes had been enough those poor kids and the people who had looked after them their torn sometimes shrivelled bodies were already cold they had been dead before ben had driven his car even halfway in to the hq and i believe that seeing that for himselfa that knowing there was nothing he could have done a was the only thing that kept him sane there were no survivors thirtysix kids and eight staff dead oror disappeared gone from us anyway for you see we knew only too well that the ones who werent therethat they werent survivors either and certainly theyd have been better off dead for they were now undead or if not now then soon there was no other explanation for their absence unless they had simply been taken as food for later but if that was the case why only adults when the children had been murdered out of hand and left behind anyway the missing staff three of them a or rather two of them since last night a were denise karalambos a paediatrician from athens andre corner a psychiatric specialist from london and and someone who isnt any longer a problem bruce trennier the engineer as for why they were singled out there are theories but we cant be sure trennier as weve seen found favour as a lieutenant perhaps the others are similarly situated but anyone who feels sorry for them can forget it theyd be better off dead a theyre going to be better off dead at least that has to be our point of view not to mention our intention but about zek a and excuse me if i seem offhand its simply that i find it best to be cold about certain things for im sure my emotions would be just as fragile as anyone elses if i were to forget myself and let them hold sway a zek hadnt suffered when that blast hit the sump she hadnt felt a thing down in the basement everything was askew the reinforced concrete floor had buckled upwards the turrets had been blown off their bases like popping a pair of corks the cave of the resurgencesimply wasnt there any more the walls and roof were completely caved in and its a wonder that the rear end of the refuge hadnt followed suit the wamphyri and their lieutenants must have felt it too that awesome blast indeed any creature in that basement a any creature of normal flesh and blood a would have been stunned by the concussion or even killed by the shock of it but then the wamphyri arent human and in all probability it only served to enrage them further certainly they raged through the refuge the only good thing to come of it all as far as i could tell was that one of those bloody awful gates was now well and truly closed oh the gate itself was still there miles up the underground river under the carpathian foothills but its single exit was finally blocked by two thousand tons of fractured concrete slabs and god only knows how much solid rock so much for that but what about the three creatures who had come through and were already in our world what about them and their lieutenants and now a trio of new thralls to aid and advise them in their earthly ventures and three very intelligent thralls at that who knew the ways of earth that we believe is the main reason why those three were sparedor cursed depending on how you see it because they could add to malinaris intelligence of this new and potentially dangerous world and we also see something of his cunning a and of his ruthlessness too a in the murder of the innocents it was simply a matter of leaving no one behind to speak about what they had witnessed for you see only six of the victims appeared to haveto have been used and where they had been fairly well drained the rest of them were just dead but horribly dead for most of them it had been instantaneous stiffened fingers with nails as hard and as sharp as chisels had chopped through their backs or into their chests to break their spines or crush their hearts the terrible strength of the wamphyri but otherswe dont think some of the others had it so well so easy i said that certain corpses were shrivelled but shrivelled doesnt say it all by any means lardis when he saw those bodies said it was szwarts work it wasnt simply a reduction of bodily fluids but ofi dont know of the substance the essence a the soul a of the victims the destruction of whatever it is that makes a person human giving him shape character humanity for christs sake these pitiful things they no longer had any of that picture the last apple on the tree all wrinkled and dried out by the sun all fallen in with the last of its juices fermented and sick inside it when it falls or if you touch it its skin splits and deep in its core the pulp is rotten and black thats what they were likeand there were others whose eyes were open staring quite empty and for all that they were dead i couldnt help but feel that they hadnt known very much about it their bodies werent shrivelled like those of szwarts victims no but it seemed to me that their minds had been and lardis told us malinari would have been responsible for that as for the female victims their pale dead faces were full of awe amazementrapture some kind of exquisite delicious agony its true that i dont have the words for it but i might have a name vavara well enough there are no words that can say how we felt appalled doesnt nearly cover it and nothing we could do about it not then not immediately what we should alert the authorities shout it to the world initiate total panic and put the fear of god and all the devils of hell into every mortal human being on the entire planetif we were believed we couldnt do any of those things and for obvious reasons cant you just picture the witchhunts god but wed be back in the dark ages witchpricking and human bonfires and licences to torture and kill handed out willynilly free to anyone with a grudge medical research would stop stop dead a or undead the laboratories would search for cures of course they would and spread the thing faster than a plague blood donors you think were short of blood now but blood would become the most precious of commodities and keeping it the first priority people locked in their homes making them impregnable fortresses defending them with guns silver stakes crossbows and whatever and the filthy rich with their private armies making the odd eccentric hermit of say howard hughess meager stature seem like a highprofile socialite by comparison borders in the last fifteen to twenty years weve seen them open up britain has been cagey about controls passports and such thank god a but europe cant you just imagine the panic see the chaos as all the old rules and statutes were reinstated the checkpoints rushed back into being with armed guards at ports and airports and not forgetting the reservoirs farms fisheries andand anywhere where food is processed and how long before countries started blaming each other when the shit a excuse me the accusations a started flying russia and romania would probably take the brunt of it if only because the gates are on their territory but what about the uk great britain weve known about the gates for thirtyodd years or am i just talking about we the team the organization a ebranch itself for gods sake a and our involvement as for our minister responsible the invisible man at the top hull t but havent we all heard about this a er how does it go a this culpable deniability or some such gobbledygook damage limitation and the like does anyone care to guess what those things really mean theyre just ways of carrying on lying to cover up unpalatable truths that werent told the first time around thats all and folks what that boils down to is we would get crucified the end of ebranchand who would look after the shop then and thats not the end of it hell ive barely started sooner or later the world would find out that the russians had actually made the gate at perchorsk an experiment that didnt work out and the same world would demand that they destroy it too damned late of course but destroy it anyway oh really what with mikhail suvorovs henchmen in moscow still waiting for it to pay off they should shut down a potential goldmine just because the goldgreedy west couldnt stand the competition and cant you just see the old iron curtain slamming shut again and that old red flag flying as before oh they might get the message eventually a when nights turned to nightmares a and then theyd destroy it quick enough but how as they were ready to do it the last time around with nukes for just like the rest of us the soviets have made progress in the last quartercentury and i really dont care to speculate about what they might do nowbut i will if only to make the point and get this over and done with nuclear biological and chemical weapons missiles with multiple warheads launched through the gate at perchorsk the total devastation of a world a nathans world a and nathan and all his people all the szgany with it neutron bombs yes so that all life would die but the gold would still be there with no one and nothing to deny its plundering its massive planetwide tomwooting which is fine or not except we dont even know if neutron radiation will kill the wamphyri only that it will kill everything else and meanwhile the vampires would be raging on this world because if we killed a couple of thralls the lords would make more survival people the damned survival of the damned and how long before total embargoes a in effect sieges a were laid on entire islands nations continents as the terror overtook them one by one and how long then before the missiles and the neutron bombs were flying again this time on our world weve had final solutions before but there are holocausts and holocausts i mentioned the dark ages but i think we could probably go back oh a couple of centuries earlier than that so you see we couldnt tell anyone it was our baby and wed just have to handle it ourselves butif we handled it our wayaebranchs way the right wayathen we might have a chance and in fact there were several clues that indeed we had a chance it was a question of thinking it all through then using our combined talents to check on our conclusions very well so why had vavara szwart and malinari left starside to come venturing in our world where were the benefits for them what was wrong with sunside that theyd left it to their lieutenants and burgeoning vampire army in favour of earth but they were known on sunside indeed they were figures from legend there and the szgany knew how to fight them fight them with alien weapons and the incredible skills of the necroscope nathan keogh also these vampires were ambitious beyond the bloodiest dreams of almost any other lords or ladies of the wamphyri before them perhaps the world of sunsidestarside was too limiting in its scope but earth theyd learned of earth from mikhail suvorov and his illfated team of explorerprospectors they knew us that without our weapons we were softer far than the szgany of sunside and there were millions indeed billions of us spread out in many different nations across a world that was as wide as its horizons not merely a single strip of habitable woodlands between barrier mountains and burning deserts but a huge and thriving termites nest of sprawling humanity a land of milk and honey a and blood of course a stretching out forever better far we didnt believe in vampires in our world a vampire was a fiction a creature in a book a myth out of our superstitious past even in romania hungary or the greek islands youd have trouble finding more than a handful who truly believe in vampires today in ebranch however we have known for a long time that they never were a myth that indeed there were vampires in our world once before and maybe more than once and zek she knew it too and knew it better than most she had actually lived in the lady karens aerie on starside so perhaps the mentalist lord malinari took something from her after all the fact that earlier invaders had learned an important lesson in this world longevity is synonymous with anonymity but having faced a or having sent their thralls to face a mikhail suvorovs firepower on starside maybe theyd known that before they set out theres evidence of that last too suvorovs party went through from perchorsk emerging into starside through the surface gate but the wamphyri chose the other route the original or natural gate into our world probably because they knew that perchorsk was once again a semimilitary base and defended and all of its weapons concentrated in one spot the perchorsk gate itself hardly a good place to commence a covert infiltration but the best evidence that malinari and the others intended to keep their presence secret at least for the time being lay with those poor dead kids and murdered staff for they had not been vampirized no vampire essence a nothing of that sort a had been allowed to get into them so plainly it wasnt the intention of the wamphyri to start a plague not yet anyway but people had been killed murdered by vampires and the old lidesci wouldnt be satisfied until the bodies were burned while he had found no trace of infection in them a not even in the six whod been used drained a still he was insistent and since no one in this world has lardiss experience in such matters the experience of so many years no one argued the point what was more thethe cremation that lardis insisted upon fitted perfectly with a plan we were shaping however gradually for not only were we unable to bring the presence of the wamphyri into the open but we must actually disguise it cover it up assist them in their efforts to remain secret secret to the world in general at least but not to us not to ebranch no for we knew our enemy of old there was fuel oil plenty of it at the refuge ben saw to it that the entire contents of a fiftygallon drum went down the wrecked inspection ducts then we punctured the rest of the drums and let the fuel leak through all the ground floor rooms and finally we stood off while nathan struck a match that one match was all it took it could only be the act of a maniac or group of maniacs some kind of crazed sect or perhaps sabotage the work of some antibritish terrorist organization or maybe a band of utterly ruthless criminals determined to cover up their crime at any rate that was how it would look well romanian rescue services are notoriously slow and where the refuge stood across the danube from radujevacit wasnt the most populated or accessible region the danube itself was the most frequented route through the countryside fortunately for us there were no landing stages wharves or docks on the romanian side and the nearest fire engine was all of a hundred miles away so we watched the refuge burn and eventually nathan took us home again but back in london we took our time before calling the authorities in belgrade sofia bucharest to tell them wed had an sos a mayday from the refuge that a gang of raiders was sacking the place it took them a couple of days to get back to us with their condolences their security forces would do all they could to bring the unknown marauders to justice of course but since the refuge had been gutted there was precious little to go on and meanwhile we were busy was busy bending all my efforts to scan the future as never before butthe simple fact is i cant force what i do cant control it i see what i see when i see it and thats it and our locators were busy none more so than david chung but where to look there was no more mindsmog and there were no borders in continental europe the three invaders their lieutenants out of starside and their raw recruits they could be anywhere they could have crossed the river west into yugoslavia gone east into bulgaria headed north into the carpathians or caught a boat upriver for hungary in daylight hours theyd go to earth or to any dark safe place but at nightno one travels as fast as the wamphyri nathan suggested returning to sunside for annamarie english but to what purpose the invaders were leaving no blight behind them as yet they werent vampirizing anyone murders but there are always murders and there are always missing persons no we couldnt hope to track them that way in any case annamarie wouldnt have come back she has dedicated her life to the orphans of the bloodwars and to her man in sunside the mindsmog thing puzzled us a while the lack of it for where there are vampires and especially lords of the wamphyri there is usually mindsmog a tainted impenetrable cloud on the psychic aetherunless that was something else that malinari had stolen from zeks mind but of course it was he had also been about to learn something of ebranch from her a until she had deliberately shortened his interrogation by showing him his intended doom which had precipitated and mercifully shortened her own but just how much did he know how much had he sapped from zeks mind her memory her knowledge in general and especially of the branch we had no way of knowing but it must have been sufficient that he and the others felt the need to lie low and control their alien mental emissions or perhaps we were wrong and they were simply being cautious biding their time nathan stayed with us for five days just long enough to look up a few oldwell acquaintances but he was needed in sunside and dared not delay any longer and remember his problem was as great if not greater than ours a small army of aspiring lords lieutenants thralls and warrior creatures left behind by our trio of wamphyri invaders an army which now inhabited the toppled ruins of starsides ancient aeries from which they raided on the szgany as before no we had no claim on nathan indeed our longterm debt to him could never be repaid and so we had to let him go with our best wishes a and as many weapons as he could take with him a back along the mobius route to rejoin the battle for his vampire world and through all of that time that terrible frantic week the only one of us who wasnt busy was ben trask he had simply withdrawn from a world that would never be the same again and i admit that i thought ebranch had seen the last of him fortunately i was wrong and when he returned he was stronger than ever a well in some ways a but in his resolve for sure and now ill tell you something that even he doesnt know i was duty officer that night at ebranch hq a that night when nathan brought lardis through from sunside and ben nightmared about zek a and the moment that ben came in and i saw the state he was in ii knew about zek i mean i knew oh i couldnt tell him but where he was uncertain and darent allow himself to be sure i knew and hated myself for knowing just seeing him like that bens future was immediately apparent to me in one way it was the clearest picture of anyones future that id even seen yet in another it was the vaguest a which was how i knew for all i saw was how cold and lonely that future would be goodlys delivery the way he had told the story of the events of that night at ebranch hq from his own personal viewpoint a the obvious passion and compassion in this apparently reserved indeed phlegmatic man a had brought him into far greater definition in jakes perception or rather it had brought him into focus as a threedimensional character in his own right previously a shadow or a softvoiced cipher he had somehow filled out and jake understood now that the precog had been a major part of this scene for a very long time now too and also for the first time goodlys physical person had impressed itself upon the branchs most recent however hesitant recruit lan goodly all of six feet four inches tall skeletally thin and gangly greyhaired and mainly gauntfeatured his expression was usually grave he rarely smiled only his eyes a warm brown and totally disarming a belied what invariably constituted an unfortunate firstimpression appearance that of a cadaverous mortician except and as jake was suddenly aware you cant always tell a book from its cover he would have done better to take more notice of goodlys eyes than his outline outside the ops truck he cornered the precog and drew him away from the others into the shade of a tree what is it goodly asked though he believed he already knew well enough for just like trask and lardis lidesci before him hed left several blank pages in his telling of the story jake was still fishing for the bits that would bring the whole thing into focus just you and me jake answered just the two of us and no one else to confuse the issue would you mind if i ask you a few questions i mean right from square one ive had this feeling that youre on my side that you think i should be told the whole thing the others are holding stuff back but youre reluctant to do so am i right goodly smiled a wry smile sighed and said til tell you what i can but even though youre right about my being on your side a or rather about my talent being on your side a still i wont be able to answer all of your questions the branch comes first and ben trask is the branch what ben says goes some of my questions then jake pressed and he quickly went on so youre a precog right and this talent of yours this precognition it lets you see into the future thats the general idea goodly sighed again but only a very rough idea for its not nearly as simple as that havent i made that plain and now he was frowning okay fine jake placated him but you did tell me youd seen some of my future right you did say that id be with you with ebranch for quite some time to come thats true yes goodly answered in what capacity i dont know okay then is it going to be that way simply because trask wont let me go off and do my own thing or possibly because he wont let you go the precog answered he has to see how you work out which could take a while that could be a it obviously is a part of the reason why ive foreseen your continuing presence yes but what is this jake are you still uncertain i thought youd decided to stay or is it mainly because he thinks im going to be useful to you jake ignored goodlys last well that too we hope but jake youre talking in circles and i dont seea aim getting to it jake growled his attitude intense now and after a moments thought so tell me is it me jake cutter wholl be useful to you or is it this harry er that was my meaning yes said the precog that the necroscope would definitely be useful to us but if you want me to pick and choose i cant do it i would have to answer both of you a youll both be extremely useful to us i thought that had been made plain too heswhat contacting me this harry getting into my head to guide me is that it jake was pushing it now or is he simply using me using you personally i would say hes keeping you safe wouldnt you but in my head like telepathy a kind of telepathic control jake scowled telepathy goodly seemed uncertain something like telepathy yes but harry had a different name for it had why is it that when we talk about this harry everything has to be past tense then jake gave a snort huh dumb question a because hes dead of course a which i cant see at all for if hes dead how can he do whatever it is hes doing to me see i dont believe in ghosts theyre a concept i just cant seem to wrap my head around and as for harry keogh hes something i dont want to wrap my head around even though its apparent hes already seen to that but since hes obviously a disembodied voice out of the past then it must be equally obvious that his talent was similar to yours i mean harry didnt so much read the future as reach into itis how it seems to me but okay fine lets keep it going so if what hes doing to me isnt telepathy then what did he call it it wouldnt help you to know not at this stage goodly shook his head in fact it could easily become an obstruction a deterrent to your acceptance ofof everything jakes frustration was mounting again a deterrent to my acceptance he snapped dont you think there are enough deterrents already its nuts all of it i mean what am i some kind of psychic medium if there was a reason just one logical reason why i should suddenly become this dead blokes target his focus his genius loci then i might be willing to believe at least some of thisthis whatever see i know that what ive actually seen and experienced so far is real but i dont know that a lot of what ive been told is real i trust my own five senses or used to but i dont understand how or why im involved id even like to believe what ive heard if only as an alternative to considering myself some kind of psycho some kind of schizoid nutcase butbutbut harry is fucking dead well in a way hes dead said the precog just as serious as ever as if their conversation was utterly mundane but you see harry didnt view existence life and death as we do there was a time when he really was two people it was after he suffered well an accident that his mind temporarily manifested itself in the identity of his own infant son and later he underwent another singular change best to think of it as a kind of metempsychosis ora metempsychosis jake cut him short for despite that he was sure hed never heard the word before still he understood it likewise another word that meant much the same thing you mean transmigration of souls like he waswhat some kind of bodysnatcher and now suspicion was written plain on the younger mans face it wasnt like that at all the precog protested what jakes voice was brittle now cracking like glass splintering under the heel of a boot i dont give a twopenny toss what it was like shit look at it from my point of view this blokes dead but hes trying to control my mind and then what my body and if he ever got it do you really think hed want to give it back and what about me mr lan bloody goodly precog what the fuck about me is that why you cant tell me my future because the real me doesnt have one calm down for goodness sake goodly looked alarmed my word but youve a very short memory jake cutter eh that had served to slow jake down a little a short memory how so but didnt harry get you out of jail hasnt he saved your life twice already and lizs too jake considered it relaxed a very little said but what does he hope to do with me thisthis ghost well perhaps thats one i can answer goodly told him you see the necroscopes principal tenet was that whatever a man does in life he will continue to do after death he proved it too used it to discover the mobius continuum youll just have to take my word for that for the time being anyway but harrys greatest claim to fame or one of them lay in finding and destroying vampires oh yes the earth was infested before this latest invasion and believe me jake without the necroscope on our side our world would have become an unimaginable hellhole of a place a long time ago so so you think he intends to keep on doing what he did before jake nodded his understanding all the while fighting hard to suppress his disbelief this harryhes trying to come back because he somehow knows they have come back and he wants to go on killing vampires hes the avenging ghost and iim his gadget the precog shrugged and answered and there you have it jake shook his head looked bewildered said come again didnt you get something backwards just then surely you meant there it has me but goodly was weary of this now as you will he answered and pursing his thin lips he turned away jake saw his mistake didnt want to alienate someone who obviously gave a damn and quickly said listen i appreciate everything youve told me im not trying to mess you about a none of you a but looking for a little firm ground somewhere i can safely plant my feet the way im feeling every step is like quicksand and what you just said doesnt help any what im supposed to be happy with the notion of this harry working his will through me if not actually on me well thats probably fine by you ebranch people all nice and safe in your own talented little skulls buta buttheres no safe place in ebranch jake the precog cut him short glancing back over his shoulder however i did say you would be around for quite some time which with the necroscope a or something of him a on your side seems a very fair forecast to me but a ghost there are ghosts and ghosts the other answered walking away but hes dead for christs sake made meaningless now through repetition still jakes exclamation exploded from his dry lips and not just a ghost not just any old spook but one who has access to my mind in ebranch goodly told him without looking back we do believe in ghosts especially in the ghost of harry keogh we have every good reason to but thats something you dont have to take my word for jake you see im sure that before very long you believe in them too i mr lan bloody goodly precog am very sure of it yes chapter sixteen a meeting of minds jake was in chopper one with trask liz goodly lardis and a pair of technicians jimmy harvey and paul arenson their next stop was alice springs for refuelling chopper two needed an hours maintenance and would follow on behind as for the vehicular contingent theyre heading south for kalgoorlie paul arenson a gangling blueeyed blond of maybe thirtythree years was telling his younger colleague from there theyll go piggyback on a freight train to broken hill then back on the road again to brisbane all except the big artic it has to be the great aussie bight coast road for the big feller i calculate something like two thousand three hundred miles all told well be home and dry in less than five hours thats taking it easy including a stop to stretch our legs at alice but as for the lads in the big truckjust be glad youre not one of them five hours for us and three or four days for them the conversation buzzed in jakes head singing with the vibration of the jetcopter the airplane was safe and stable but with its paramilitary design it hadnt been built for comfort jake sat on the floor in the narrow stowage area towards the tail where there were no seats halfreclining his large angular frame was cushioned by holdalls sausagebags and various packs of personal belongings some hard and some soft it wasnt his idea of luxury but tired and even hoping to get a little sleep he repositioned himself as best he could and let the aircrafts singing soak into him the tune was much too regular for a lullaby and snatches of muted conversation kept drifting back to him monotone lyrics that didnt fit the music but clung like cobwebs to his thoroughly weary mind cocooned in this odd mix of white noise and blurred babble gradually jake felt himself nodding off liz merrick was loosely belted into the rearmost of the seats a gunners swivelling bucketseat between wide sliding doors on both sides her long legs were up flopping over the gunners arm rests the gun itself slumped nosedown strapped in position glinting a dull bluegrey and despite its proximity to lizs lovely body the weapon looked sullenly impotent but the picture jake kept in his mind as he drifted into sleep was that of a naked liz with the gun between her legs but then he was asleep and he was the gun between her legs and a damn it to hell a he wasnt fucking liz but was facing xwsy from her out of the door and she wasnt trying to ride him but was firing himher arms round his waist with one hand massaging his balls while the other working his rampant dick shot burst after burst of silvery smoking semen at nightmarish vampire shapes that flapped in the choppers slipstream snarling their bloodlust as they fought to get inside the plane to get at liz trask goodly and the others barely asleep jake jerked awake liz was staring at him her cheeks flaming mouth halfopen eyes wide and jake didnt need a degree in psychiatry a or in parapsychology a to understand what had happened here whether as a deliberate voyeur or an innocent observer liz had been in his mind shed seen that last scene and as for what it meant that was his fear surfacing his ongoing suspicion that ben trask was simply using him now complicated by the notion that trask was also using her as some kind of bait a like a carrot for a donkey a to keep him happy as he plodded on he could be right at that or he could be wrong but if liz were the carrot then what did trask have in mind for the stick everything remained to be seen ii liz mouthed words at him a mouthed them but nothing came out a as she quickly selfconsciously ashamedly slid her jeanclad legs from the gunners arm rests and sat up straighter in the bucketseat and serves you fucking right jake snapped back but silently in his head and he knew hed reached her from the way her head jerked and now keep the fuck out following which as his anger cooled it took some time to get back to sleep snatches of conversation drifting back to him but in his ears or in his had perhaps he was still on lizs mind and unsuspected even by the girl herself where she sat in her bucketseat midway between jake in stowage and the others in their seats up front she had become some kind of mental relay station for in the few days she had known him liz had established something of a rapport with jake it was possible that the sending technique she had used to taunt bruce trennier had fixed itself and was now developing more rapidly in her special mind maybe this was simply her way of making amends by letting jake in on the conversation the conversation about him or was it something or some one else entirely trasks hushed voice asking but why him lardis lidesci does the why of it really matter if jake has been chosen hes been chosen and lan goodly there are certain similarities maybe we shouldnt overlook them im sure mental characteristics a how jake thinks a are more important than the purely physical way he looks when we look at him we dont see harry thats true but the necroscope was a hard act to follow perhaps we should give more thought as to how harry sees him and there are similarities trask go on goodly for one thing they both lost loved ones both of them drowned murdered too trask granted but thats where it ends and as for losing a loved one murdered you could say the same about me but where is harrys humility wheres his compassion his warmth this jakehes abrasive a roughneck spoiled and wild goodly a roughneck but in the right circumstances that would be a and it already has been a a positive bonus a rough diamond maybe surely the necroscope would know better than to choose a weakling for a job like this trask but a hard man a killer even if he does have his reasons lardis me i say they were good reasons i like him and i say it again if hes harry helllanders choice thats good enough for me trask and mewell within limits so dont misunderstand me a im not arguing the necroscopes choice a its just that i dont understand it i have this feeling that jakes not only fighting us but fighting harry too goodly oh he is be sure of it but aside from his manners and tendency to aggression there are similarities trask dubiously more similarities goodly indeed for harry believed in revenge too dont you remember an eye for an eye he was just a boy when he went after boris dragosani if like attracts like a mentally speaking that is a then i can well see how harry would be drawn to this one and thats something else you might give some thought to if you want jake firmly on the team and his mind exclusively on the job in hand you could do a lot worse than find this man this luigi castellano trask and then what let jake go after him goodly this castellano is rubbish and should be disposed of a were all agreed on that i think jake will chase him down no matter what which makes castellano a distraction but if he were to be taken out no more distraction and we would have jakes gratitude trash mildly surprised well now and just listen to the coldblooded one but youre right and were checking into it interpol and other friends abroad if we could just bring castellano to justice that might suffice goodly no it wouldnt when he is dead that will suffice you know as well as i do how jake dealt with the other members of that gang do you really think hell be satisfied to see their boss nice and comfortable all warm and well fed behind bars lardis anyway in case i havent already said it loud or often enough i like jake cutter and so does liz liz heatedly i do not well not especially lardis chuckling throatily see then silence for a while the darkness deepening and jake finally adrift in dreams and a strange cold current taking him in tow steering him to an unknown yet oddly familiar destination a river bank and below its grassy roottangled rim the water swirling in the eddies of a small bight a boy sitting on the edge and leaning forward at what seemed an unsafe angle dangling his feet close to the slowly swirling surface his elbows were on his knees his hands propping his chin and he appeared to be talking to someone perhaps to himself jakes shadow fell on him and the boy turned his head to look up at him he didnt seem at all surprised by jakes presence on the contrary he smiled a pale painful yet appreciative greeting hello there so you came why dont you sit down a while and talk to me i er didnt like to cut in on you jake answered not knowing what else to say and then because he wasnt sure what else to do either a and wondering if he knew the other a he finally followed his suggestion sat down and asked him er do you think its possible weve met somewhere before beginning to feel the strangeness of it all he looked the boy over more closely perhaps even warily apart from the obvious fact that the other had recently been fighting there didnt seem to be anything especially odd about him he could be any scruffy boy though for some reason jake found himself doubting that maybe eleven or twelve years old sandyhaired freckled he wasnt skinny yet barely filled out his illfitting threadbare secondhand school jacket the top button was absent from a oncewhite shirt that hung halfway out of his grey flannel trousers and a frayed tightly knotted tie with a faded school motto hung askew from his crumpled collar his lumpish nose supported plain prescription spectacles small circular windows through which dreaming blue eyes gazed out in a strange mixture of wonder and weird expectation then suddenly aware of jakes inspection the boy looked down at himself wrinkled his nose in disgust said this will be the school bully big stanley greens work hes got it coming has our stanley in about a year from now or maybe two and his lips were thinner tighter more determined there was dried blood on those lips a gash in the corner of his mouth but little or nothing of fear in his dreamy eyes which were now other than dreamy and contained a certain glint indeed they looked older than the rest of him those eyes and jake thought there was probably a pretty mature mind in there somewhere behind that halfhaunted face but he could never in a million years have guessed how mature a or how wise in otherworldly ways and because the boy hadnt as yet answered his first question jake now felt the urge to remind and prompt him er son but he neednt have concerned himself obviously the other had considered jakes earlier question and now took his prompt into account too son he finally repeated jake and cocked his youngold head on one side and youre wondering if we know each other well ive got to answer no to both questions uhuh jake you and i dont know each other not yet and im not too comfortable with you calling me son its a case of a i dont know a what came first the chicken or the egg there was no animosity in his reply eh jake frowned someone else just bursting with riddles i dont need that right now but its a hell of an adventure said the boy sounding not at all like a child despite his childs voice er working them out that is ive done my share of that jake then sitting back and gazing directly into jakes eyes studying his face and perhaps more than his face so youre him and youve been having a hard time of it right well since you seem to understand whats going on here jake answered perhaps peevishly why dont you tell me his dream might be working something out for him resolving a problem and the other nodded very well im telling you youre having a hard time of it but thats just as much your fault as mine you have a very defensive mind and me i dont have much of a mind at all or i do but not all in one place not all at one time oh i know a i mean ive known a a lot of things but what i remember and what ive forgotten are completely random like a kind of amnesia or a bad case of absentmindedness except its not for you see im really not all here or putting it more sympathetically all of me isnt here which means that while i wont get things one hundred per cent wrong i may not get them entirely right either thats why i need a focus but now since you seem determined to reject me it looks like it may be hard for us to get along and harder still for me to get it together so how long do you plan to keep slamming the door in my face jake who are you jake asked him then feeling a weird tingle in his scalp an unheardof sensation of negative dйjа vu that it wasnt him but the boy who had been here a or somewhere a before and jake felt he knew where hed been but the other frowned and now seemed as uncertain as jake iim all sorts of people and things he said im alec nestor nathan take your pick theres something of faethor in me or has been or will be and something of me in a whole lot of people it all depends on the time the date the place and time is relative what will be has been ask any precog thats why we have to be sure it works out right dont you see youyoure harry keogh said jake shivering without knowing why a until he remembered what harry keogh was youre the ghost theyve been telling me about and youre the gadget said harry but i dont want to be jake felt himself riveted to the river bank he wanted to leap away but couldnt move it was the dream the nightmare a one of those nightmares a where try as you might you cant escape from the thing thats chasing you im not chasing you the young harry protested you are chasing me chasing me away and in fact he was wavering physically wavering his figure a mere outline his face and form thinning towards transparency but youre after my mind my body jake cried the boy the dreamharry the ghost gave a desperate shake of his almost immaterial head thats not me jake its the wamphyri who want your mind body and soul i am the one a or rather we are the ones and maybe the only ones a who might be able to stop them so dont send me away jake dont fight me off and suddenly jake realized that he could that he was actually doing it fighting the other off sending him away and ii can cant i he said his fear retreating you very nearly did said harry sighing as he firmed up again okay so perhaps this is too strange for you the wrong time and place the wrong me i didnt think youd see any harm in a small boy thats all what in a child who talks like a man jake felt himself shivering again but less violently a boy whose eyes are innocent as a babys yet old as the ages a boy capable of metempsychosis a whos in my mind right now a while im the helpless intended vessel youre by no means as helpless as you think said harry perhaps admiringly that mind of yours stubborn as hell with good shields youve never had reason to use nor even suspected you had them anyway mind transference isnt something that ithat i have in mind ive had my time jake my lives and im still having them a but i do get your point so very well lets try something else a moment ago it had been warm in evening sunlight that came in flickering beams fanning through the trees on the far bank and setting the water sparkling out towards the middle of the river where the current ran fastest now in a single instant it was cold and dark frost lay thick on the ground and the river was a ribbon of ice frozen and motionless a full moon hung low in a windswept sky and a trio of gardens fronted rich houses that reared to the right of jake and the boy where they walked along the river path except jakes companion was no longer a boy but a youth jake started away from the stranger a stumbled might have fallen into frosted brambles on the overgrown river bank a but harry was quick to take his arm hold him steady its okay he said to still jakes cry of alarm its a different time thats all an older me but the same place more or less the same river we were back there he thumbed the air indicated the path behind them a few hundred yards downriver sitting on the bank it was summer and i was talking to my mother when you came by now itsoh quite a few winters later im a little closer to your own age now so perhaps well be able to get along that much better closer to my own age jake thought but youre a good deal firmer too thats a ml of a strong grip you have on my arm and how much stronger on my mind but harry the youth only shook his head in disappointment hiding your thoughts wont help im in here remember well at present i am anyway while you accept me jesus jake gasped its like something out of a christmas carol when i wake up i wont believe it thats what im afraid of said harry worse still you may not even remember it thats why we have to get things done while we can and hope they get fixed in your mind things until you trust me the other answered until you allow me a little permanency well have to move in stops and starts well get nowhere until i know the whole story and i wont be able to help you until you believe believe in a ghost but im not not really and jake you wouldnt i mean you really wouldnt a believe how often ive been through this before oh ive had trouble convincing others before you while harry talked jake looked him over it was the same boy for sure but hed be nineteen or maybe twenty years old now wiry he would weigh some nine and a half stone and stand seventy inches tall his hair was an untidy sandy mop that reminded jake of glint eastwoods in those old western movies of more than thirty years ago but his face wasnt nearly so hard and his freckles were still there lending him a naive and definitely misleading boyish innocence more than any other feature harry keoghs eyes were especially interesting looking at jake they seemed to see right through him as if he were the revenant and not the reverse but they were oh so blue those eyes that startling colourless blue which always looks so unnatural so that one thinks the owner has to be wearing lenses more than that there was something in them which said theyd seen a lot more than any twentyyearold has any right seeing but still jake felt a little easier with all of this now after all it was only a dream and since this ghost or whatever it was was conversational why not talk to it or humour it as the case might be so if convincing people is as hard as you make out why do you put yourself to the trouble he asked his strange companion they had come to a halt before the gate in the garden wall of the central house lights in the downstairs room adjacent to the garden sent angular black shadows marching over the brittle shrubbery arid garden paththe shadows of men glimpsed only briefly before the patio doors were slammed and curtains jerked hurriedly across the wide windows for a long moment harry made no answer to jakes question he stood as if transfixed looking in through the gates horizontal bars but the house was mainly dark where mere chinks of light escaped at odd angles from the corners and joins of poorlyfitted curtains then the youth started blinked his eyes in the pale moonlight and breathlessly answered why do i keep putting myself out thats easy jake its because i was the beginning and i have to be the end then he gave another start and said we cant stay here that house there is where i was born my stepfather has visitors a boris dragosani and max batu a and later ill be visiting him too tonight is the night i killed him but there are things you mustnt see not yet youyou killed him and now the cold that jake felt wasnt entirely physical if it ever had been i will said the other but i dont want to see it and i dont want you to see it so now we have to go another place and time are you up to it do i have a choice you can always wake up but i wouldnt advise it it was hard enough getting into you this time and if youre as badly frightened asa frightened jake cut him off his pride surfacing maybe i am but im also interested a very i want to know where this is going want to find out what its all about and since they wont tell mea they ben trask and his people jake answered ah said harry nodding his head and smiling knowingly i might have guessed in fact i suppose i knew you mentioned them before and obviously ebranch hq was where i aimed you that first time when i first became aware of you but that was then and this is now and we have to move on since this was my home for so many years well probably be back butmy timing was years off and i cant think why it must be my memory which is incomplete you see im incomplete im not entirely here actually im not entirely anywhere it seems to be only the strongest of times and places to which im drawn maybe its a variation on the old theme said jake the killer returning to the scene a and time a of the crime very clever said harry and you could even be right a in a way the lure of powerful times and places yes i can see that but a killer he shrugged cant deny it and i wont try to explain it not now its like i said this isnt a good time for me so ill ask you once againa and yes jake nodded tm up to it i think very well the other nodded but this time ill try for a place of innocence er before we go jake quickly put in can you answer a question or two i mean while im still steady on my feet im surprised you havent asked them sooner harry answered his eyes still anxious where they peered through the bars of the gate at the house why me jake said why not one of these people you seem to know so well the ebranch crowd surely they would have accepted you that much more readily from some of the things ive heard them say about you they hold you in some kind of awe but youre young said the other youre strong enough to face whatever it is thats coming ben trask and the others theyre old now and they dont needa yes aredemption no thats not it lets just say theyre not troubled theyre straight in what they have to do but you are troubled theres a lot of anger in you jake an explosive strength and thats what is needed its what we have to find a use for but the right use so i was chosen out of nothing jake frowned because i need saving what if i dont want saving you see i still have a job to do and one way or the other ill do it what im saying is youre taking a chance with me i might not work out the way you want me to there was a certain element of chance in it yes harry answered but there were also things i couldnt ignore in the mobius continuum down future timestreams ive seen your blue lifethread crossed with the red of vampires where youre going to meet up with them but where some of them blink out expire your blue thread goes on dйjа vu jake i just couldnt ignore it i want to make sure that blue thread goes on and on thats all bewildered jake shook his head none of which makes any sense at all to me but it will when you understand the continuum when you command it and when youre able to doother things command it thisthis goingplaces thing youre saying theres some kind of order to it i can control it and as for doing other things frankly that worries me youre beginning to sound a lot like these ebranch people hows your math the other turned his back on the house looked out over the starshot river of ice my math jakes bewilderment grew apace your numbers your reckoning i dont get shortchanged if thats what you mean we should talk to mobius said harry except we cant for hes long gone thats a problem so i suppose youll have to learn it parrotfashion from me and that could be a problem in its own right because what i do now is pretty much instinctive intuitive and not very accurate said jake and probably dangerous too what goods all this jumping about if it doesnt get you where you want to go but it does but not this time jake waved a hand at the house you said so yourself uhuh harry shook his head youre all confused you keep forgetting that this is only a dream a and your dream at that i can guide these subconscious thoughts of yours i can aim them but im not flying you im just the copilot deep inside you want to know about me my times places and history thats whats driving all of this your need to know so give me a little help to move on wont you i cant concentrate to best effect in this location im not at all comfortable here you didnt need help the first time jake reminded him when you moved us from daylight to night from the river bank to this place anda aand when you didnt expect it the other pointed out but its this mind of yours it resists me a resists psychic or metaphysical interference a and its resistance grows stronger all the time maybe thats another reason why i was drawn to you because you were a rare one with a talent of your own if not all your own just waiting to be developed in fact a great many people have one sort of espability or another in most of them its usually stillborn incapable of further development but i suspect that as esper begets esper the powers of the mind will come more and more into their own evolution jake that was how it happened to me and also how it happened in sunside szgany shields are powerful too they have to be or the szgany would be extinct in you it was dormant waiting for an opportunity to break out but now that it has been awakened a perhaps by contact with me my dart a or then again by ebranch your dart that really was you then jake was managing to absorb some of this at least part of me something of me awareness jake awareness do you know the easiest way to magnetize a piece of iron you throw it in with a lot of big magnets thats how and as for youa i was thrown in at the deep end said jake the other nodded apparently so now if youll only relax a little well move on and jake relaxed to anyone else these time and location shifts might be unnerving from a summer day on the river to a moonlit winter night to a nightlight in a tiny garret room unnerving even if they worked as intended but this time it seemed something had gone wrong for in the little room where the dreamer now found himself he was on his own and there was no sign of his host but jake a one of those rare types who can often distinguish between dreams and reality a wasnt too concerned if anything he was pleased or rather he was glad on the one hand and a little disappointed on the other just when hed thought he was getting somewhere learning something but you still are said harry startled jake looked all about but he looked too quickly and saw nothing and at the same time it dawned on him that he hadnt so much heard harrys voice as felt it telepathy he said does that mean you didnt make it in which case where the hell are you im over here said harry sucked into the most innocent of places innocent for the time being anyway the over here was a directionfinder as clear as and clearer than any voice and now that jake looked again he saw what hed missed the first time a cot standing on rockers in the corner of the small room where the eaves came down low and lowering his head a little he stepped towards it within the cot an infant the baby had kicked himself free of a soft woollen blanket lay naked and chubby exposed except for diapers his face was angelic and his eyesa you said jake different times different harry keoghs said the other but a baby you well i was once upon a time but what youre looking atno it isnt me on the other hand i am in here for this is a time when i was incorporeal jake and my sons mind was like a black hole it sucked me in saved me until i could become someone else hehe has your eyes said jake because there was no other way to answer what hed just heard and yet it did ring a bell for lan goodly had tried to tell him something similar he has my mind too harry told him gurgling happily a or unhappily a in his cot his and mine both and unless im mistaken weve arrived at a very bad time what again i was looking for innocence and found it but if im right thats just about to end you see this is the time almost to the moment when harry jr moves on becomes the dweller which in turn meansa a womans voice cried out from an adjacent room in the garret flat a cry of uttermost terror but dont panic said harry despite that his own mental voice was filled with urgency now thats his mother but things are well under control and were almost out of here before that thoughjake i need the names of these invaders the creatures ive seen crossing your lifethread in mobius time if you know who they are i can probably trace their histories to discover their weaknesses maybe work out some way for you to deal with them their names cried harry in jakes mind names jake answered his eyes on the door where it stood slightly ajar lords malinari and szwart and the lady vavara wamphyri out of starside he might just as easily have uttered an invocation almost wrenched from its hinges the door crashed inwards and in a moment jakes dream became a shrieking hellish nightmare what he gasped and yulian bodescu the necroscopes revenant sighed in jakes mind the thing framed in the doorway was or had been a man it wore a mans clothing and stood upright however forwardleaning its arms werelong and the hands at the ends of those arms were huge and clawlike with projecting nails the things face was something unbelievable it could have been the face of a wolf but it was almost hairless and there were certain anomalies that suggested a batlike origin the monsters ears grew flat to the sides of its misshapen head they too were batlike and projected higher than the rearwardsloping elongated skull its nose a or rather its snout a was mobile wrinkled convoluted with black and gaping nostrils the things skin was ridged looked scaly its yellow crimsonpupilled eyes were deepsunken in black sockets and as for its jaws its teeth the creature a yulian bodescu a ignored jake loped to the cot and crouched over it and the light in his or its eyes had the glow of molten sulphur the fires of hell fuelled by eager anticipation taloned hands were already reaching for the helpless infant as jake tried to snatch at a gun that was no longer there uttering a strangled curse he leaped to the attackor would have except his limbs seemed locked in place a nice gesture but useless harry told him and anyway in the waking world it would only serve to get you killed this is a scene from my past jake obviously we survived it myself and my son both but i fancy your dream wont so one last word before we part next time try to be easier to reach the scene warped began to melt away even as jake strove to move his body a a single muscle a fingertip a and failed miserably he stood poised inert desperate to go to the infants aid despite what the necroscope had told him he tried to shout a warning managed a hoarse croak a clotted gurgle and all in vain for everything was dissolving away terror utter horror can bring a man awake even when he knows hes only dreaming the last thing jake saw before he surfaced was the beast on its knees beside the cot mad with frustrated rage tearing the bedclothes to shreds but of the baby harry himself nothing at all and jake gave a small glad cry and woke up for somehow in the moment before waking he knew a hed been given to know a where the infant had gone along the mobius route to ebranch of course where else part three the start of it chapter seventeen second thoughts and others less mundane noticing jakes distress liz had scrambled from her gunners seat into the narrow cargo area crouched down beside him and was now hauling on the lapels of his jacket roughing him up a little jake jake wake up then a as his eyes snapped open startling her and lightning reflexes and hands worked in combination to slap her wrists aside then grab them a you were shouting she explained and now youre hurting he let go of her dragged himself into an upright seated position among the jumble of packs and mumbled what shouting of course he had been shouting because hed been nightmaring but what about already the waking world in the shape of liz was obliterating his dreams consigning them to innermost recesses of his subconscious mind but realizing something of their importance jake was reluctant to let them go what was i shouting about he demanded harshly but too late for even as his head cleared the nightmare was retreating shrinking to nothing then he looked about a at the piled packs the choppers interior the faces of the men up front looking back at him a and remembered where he was and as the fear went out of jakes eyes it was replaced by a worried frown his face was damp with sweat despite that it wasnt any too warm inthe aircraft in the jetcopter yes his orientation was still a little off making everything feel and sound unreal then it dawned on him that the hiss of the horizontal jets was absent and the crisp chop chop chop of rotors had taken over they must be descending into alice springs i dont know what you were shouting about liz answered him most of what you said was pure babble until just before you woke up she went back to her seat and buckled herself in then you mentioned szwart malinari and vavara but you were doing a lot of twitching too it was a nightmare jake a killer of a nightmare id say a killer yes she was right a grotesque thing a wamphyri a its taloned hands reaching to snuff the life from an innocent baby boy and yulian bodescu jake gasped aloud starting as if hed been slapped in the face does anyone know whowho yulian bodescu was but that final scene too was fading away following the rest of the nightmare into limbo in their seats up front however ben trask and lan goodly exchanged secretive but mainly wondering glances and said nothingnot until they were on the ground and theyd stretched their legs and made their way to the lounge and the airports watering hole jake and lardis sat at the almost empty bar chewing nuts and nursing large beers liz trask and goodly had a small table smaller drinks and ate from a plate of sandwiches huge overhead fans did their best to stir the sluggish air and keep the atmosphere bearable but even the local aussies were sweating it was that kind of summer el nifio drying everything to kindling lardis smacked his lips in appreciation sighed and told jake this has to be one of the few true benefits of your entire world and then noticing how the bartender was giving him curious looks he added er of australia i mean one of the true benefits of australia they certainly know how to brew a good beer these australians the bartender looked lardis up and down and said i saw that movie too me old mate way back when i was a little kid but it didnt influence me mode o dress eh said lardis crocodile bleedin dundee the other shook his head and moved off along the bar jesus what is it with you tourists do yer think we all live in the bleedin outback lardis looked down at his clothes lizardskin belt machete shadhide sandals and scowled have i been insulted he wondered out loud but jakes thoughts were elsewhere lardis tell me about harry keogh he said i mean ive heard trask talk about his compassion warmth and humility which you have to admit makes him sound like a pacifist but if he was so humble how come he ended up as a a a what a vampirekiller and i gather it wasnt only vampires he killed as for harry dwellersires history in this world the old lidesci answered having first made sure that the bartender was well out of earshot i dont know the entire story thats why i was only able to talk about sunsidestarside but from what i saw of himwell i wouldnt be too sure about harrys humility or his compassion either after all nathan kiklu was a humble one too upon a time anyway i only met the necroscope towards the end which wasnt a pretty end then abruptly lardiss tone changed and peering at jake suspiciously he snapped now do me a favour and stop trying to wheedle things out of me okay what am i anyway but a bleedin tourist eh while at the table also out of earshot goodly liz and trask were considering something else yulian bodescu trask looked at liz youre sure he said yulian bodescu we thought so too but we were too far away to be sure now tell me how in hell did he come up with that name if hes read it or perhaps remembered it from something someone has said why has it chosen to surface now in a dream liz could only shrug and ask is it really that strange i mean its hardly the most common of names now is it to be honest its just exactly the kind of name that would stick in my mind but trask was out of sorts with himself and it showed i put you in that gunners bucketseat close to him so that you could listen in on him he said in ebranch we know how important dreams can be but you say you got nothing to start with lizs voice hardened as she began to flare up ir t j i don ta but the precog quickly cautioned her sw keep it down well i dont understand why we cant tell jake about the entire bodescu affair she continued in a lowered but emphatic tone and whats more i didnt much like what you asked me to do to start with its not ebranch policy to spy on our colleagues anda dont go lecturing me about branch policy a miss trask glared as for jake cutter he wont be a colleague until im one hundred per cent sure hes on our side the man vacillates sits on the fence im not even sure he wont make a break for it the first chance he gets aand liz continued determined to be heard the last time i tried it hehe knew he what goodly stared at her jake knew i was listening in on him liz said deflated now he was dreaming a something sexy erotic yes and frightening too a and when i broke in on him it woke him up so how can i ask him to trust me when he thinks im constantly in his mind so you didnt try trask said thats not so she shook her head i did try but i was blocked i couldnt get in or i could but it was like walking through a fog all dismal and distorted i didnt get one single clear picture precisely what i didnt want to hear trask grunted so now ill tell you why im not ready to tell him the entire yulian bodescu story you know that a vampire isnt safe even when hes dead and buried if there was anything we learned from the necroscope it was that even as we burned the very earth where thibor ferenczy had been buried still the bastard was instructing yulian bodescu telling him about ebranch after that the damage yulian caused us the deaths the pain he paused and shook his head and goodly said so even at this stage youre not entirely certain that this is the necroscopes work you think that jake might be under the influence of someone or something else just as thibor got at yulian so someone might be getting at jake we have to remember what harry was and what he became at the end trask answered and not only him but his lover penny sanderson and what both the dweller and harrys other son nestor became vampires liz said with a small shudder wamphyri said trask all of them the necroscope died on starside and now something a three somethings a have come out of starside to infest our world and jake is being influenced by a remnant or revenant of the necroscope himself lets not forget that just as harry sired nathan kiklu he also fathered nestor two sides of the same coin do you see and do you wonder that im cautious why of course im cautious i should let something like that infiltrate ebranch get in amongst us learn our secrets use them against us no i dont think so and if youre wrong said liz i hope im wrong trask answered i believe im wrong and i want to be wrong but if im right ill be alive and so will you liz look youve read about harry but you never knew him you havent seen what he could do not the other things he could do i have and i dont want to see powers such as those fall into the wrong hands that could mean the end of us all he sat back in his chair let his brooding eyes rest speculatively on jake and lardis at the bar but only for a moment then he finished by saying so thats that for now let it go lets all of us let it go but liz try to remember what ive said and the next time i ask you to do something dont be so damn quick off the mark to question my motives meanwhile at the bar jake had asked the bartender for a sedative something to help him sleep during the next stage of the journey and after the man had gone off to fetch him something havent you had enough of sleep lardis asked him jake looked at him sleep is a funny thing he said do you know what my doctor told me when i was laid up in hospital in marseille that time after id got myself trampled on but how could i possibly know lardis answered as yet a long way from mastering the vagaries of the english tongue it isnt as if i was there with you now is it anyway said jake i had things to do and wanted to be out of there but they wouldnt let me go and this doctor told me i needed to rest get some sleep he said there were different kinds of sleep a kind that comes from physical exhaustion and another from mental and that even when youve done no physical or mental work theres the kind that tells you your body and brain have been mobile for too long without a decent break sleep is a medicine a the best you can get a following injury or mental trauma yet too much of it can be debilitating rather than curative you can walk and talk in your sleep and in some cases solve intricate problems sleep can be induced resisted prolonged or interrupted but no one can do without it for too long as he fell silent lardis said phew ask a simple question jake nodded his agreement said im not usually so longwinded but its been on my mind a not so much what that doctor said about sleep but the things he left out at the time those things didnt apply to my case now they do tm learning a lot about sleep lardis grunted tell me more it produces dreams said jake often theyre enigmatic insoluble and theyre usually unremembered because they dont mean anything are you with me and im learning a lot of new words too lardis sighed but go on go on but from time to time jake went on from time to time they do mean something theyre like a i dont know a clearing houses for all the jumble of our waking hours and when the rubble has been cleared away sometimes theres a silver nugget or two left over and youve been prosa er prospeca er prospecting right right aboard the jetcopter jake answered tm sure my dream a my nightmare a meant something and i want to get back into it he offered a weary shrug i must be crazy right to look forward to returning to a bad dream but anyway what the hell i may have been sleeping but i didnt get much rest im still dead on my feet its the heat said lardis it drains a mans strength im tired toowe all are on sunside id probably be under some tree right now asleep in a deep cool forest but ive had trouble with my dreams too jake the fact is id probably be nightmaring about the hell thats brewing in starside and that kind of sleepwell youre right it cant cure anything me ill risk it anyway jake muttered just as soon as im back on that chopper when the pilot declared the jetcopter refuelled the two technicians were the first out across the asphalt jake and lardis were next and tailing them trask goodly and liz they had at least one hundred and fifty yards to walk to the helipad funny thing goodly reported as they left the embarkation building and set out into the sizzling sunlight but what liz said suddenly makes sense theres jake in plain view not forty yards ahead and i cant read a thing of his future not any longer but isnt that normal trask was immediately concerned arent you always telling us that this talent of yours isnt controllable that you cant just switch it on and off goodly nodded and said right but i should at least be aware of something my original prediction that jake would be with us for some time to come hasnt changed the future doesnt chop and change like that what has been foreseen is inevitableor it should be its how it will be its circumstances that can change but now with jake i cant sense a damn thing its as if there were nothing there like hes shielded now trask was even more concerned suppose so yes said the precog huh trask grunted its the same for me i thought i was imagining it i still know the truth of him the reality but im no longer sure whose truth it is harrys dart goodly wondered the necroscope had powerful shields has he perhaps passed them on to jake yes harry was shielded trask answered him and the traitor wellesley too but nathan also has shields and likewise a and especially a the wamphyri so harry isnt the only one who could have passed this on whatever it is and i cant help thinking maybe it hasnt been passed for the best possible reasons i mean why should he want to keep us out and liz put in maybe its not deliberately or aggressively active but justactive like something new feeling its way trask said well its possible i suppose you could always check it out the precog said david chung can locate us a any one of us a just like snapping his fingers hed soon tell us if we have something of that nature travelling with us mindsmog said trask by which time liz was thoroughly alarmed or it could be just his taint she now broke in harrys taint i mean for he was after alla awe know what he was trask quickly cut her short and we knew then what he was goodly said taking lizs side and we accepted it you especially ben it was you who let him go remember when harrys house a his last vestige on earth a when we burned it to ashes you could have killed him then i could have tried said the other but you didnt we all have our talents trask argued maybe mine told me it wasnt possible and maybe it told you to let him live said goodly i was younger then trask answered gruffly and a sight more foolish the necroscope could have been lying when he said he was quitting earth for starside talent or no talent i didnt have the right to take that chance but i did foolish as i j ve said younger i remember the precog nodded but foolish if harry hadnt lived what then who would have stopped shaitan and given his life for us in the vampire world and what would have been our fate then the chance that you took paid off but now the jetcopter loomed with jake leaning out and down offering a helping hand to liz and well just have to let it go for now trask murmured his voice almost inaudible even to his companions as the engine coughed into life and the rotor blades began slicing the air overhead but that doesnt mean well stop watching and sooner or later well see what mi we see what he didnt tell them keeping it back for the moment was that in fact he had already contacted david chung by telephone from the airport from now on they wouldnt be the only ones who were watching and while chung the branchs top locator would still be far distant in the purely physical sense psychically he would be very close indeed a and closer in both senses when he found a relief to take over his duties allowing him to join up with his colleagues in brisbane damn hard to get in the hinted question but definite exclamation rang like a shout in jakes sleeping mind startling him but he immediately recognized the voice and said you i was hoping youd come by you could have fooled me said the exnecroscope but for that tiny piece of me that will be with you always i wouldnt know where to find you even with it its hard to get through your shields still maybe thats a good thing im sure its going to be eventually but where are you jake had been waiting for everything to straighten up but nothing had so that now he wondered and for that matter where am ip he was floating not surprising really for he had often dreamed he could fly and as often been disappointed on waking up to discover that he couldnt this must be a different version of the same thing but floating in darkness you dont recognize the place harry keoghs disembodied voice asked him a place jake answered but theres nothing here nothing at all and as he lazily turned on his own axis he could see that what he had said was literally true there was absolutely nothing here as if this were the bottom of a bottomless pit or the darkest of dark nights ora or the kind of nowhere and nowhen place that the universe must have been like before there was light yes i know said harry once experienced however theres no forgetting it so when we were here last you must have had your eyes shut i can understand that its always been the same and for just about everyone who ever tried it a including me so now let me welcome you to the mobius continuum no gravity or light or matter at all not even a sound unless we make it which isnt advisable not here and this is it your way ofof getting about this is it but its still only a dream your dream jake and the only thing thats real about it is me so how did i get here i influenced it and you dreamed it i just wanted you to see it through my eyes and maybe get used to it for you see youve been lucky on three occasions now three times when you thought you were in danger a two of which you really were a i was close enough to help you out my escape from jail jake nodded his understanding and the next time from bruce trennier right right but as my dart a lets call it my metaphysical intuition a becomes a more accepted part of you therell be less room for the actual me already youve reached the stage where youre almost able to shut me out but before you can do that you still have a lot to learn about the mobius continuum for one thing yes and thats why im here you tell me you dreamed it but its as good a starting place as any you did influence it though yes but you must have wanted it wanted to visit wanted to know to know how to use it you mean exactly and how not to misuse it eh well if this were really it the continuum youd probably be stone deaf by now you see you dont talk in the mobius continuum jake a not in a place where even thoughts have weight thoughts have weight here they do in the physical world too ask any telepath or any scientist for that matter those tiny sparks that jump the gaps in your brain jake if they didnt make the connections you couldnt think have you never wondered why geniuses have weighty thoughts but thats just an expression surely but in the mobius continuum its reality well of sorts a parallel reality at least soive no need to talk not at all thinking will suffice but here in your dream it makes no difference a because you arent talking anyway or at best youre only muttering to yourself youre making me feel like a cretin jake burst out i dont know where i am or how i got here a or how to get out of here a and youre telling me i have a lot to learn about it a lot to learn about nothing about nowhere about emptiness oh it isnt nothing jake it isnt nowhere but a route to everywhere and when let me ask you to do something for meactually for you just keep quiet for a moment or two and float and feel it feel the mobius continuum jake did and felt it itsbig he said then feeling very small itshuge it knows im here and it doesnt especially want me here but where here everywhere said harry or anywhere anywhere you want to be want to go as long as you know the coordinates come with me just come and youll see you mean follow you and suddenly jake was afraid but i cant even see you im in your head jake just let go of you of everything and jake did it let go he sensed motion in himself and also felt himself come to a halt at a door a time door said harry a door on past time and but this is even more like aaahhhh said jake because now he was standing on the threshold looking back into the past and while it wasnt deliberate he was echoing what he seemed to be hearing a concerted ahhhhhk like some unending onenote chorus the vocal product of a vast choir of angels echoing in a sounding church or cathedral and yet jake only seemed to be hearing it it was in his mind as a result of what he was seeing which must surely be accompanied by just such a sound a the sound of life of evolution from its prehistoric source to this present moment this very now more like a christmas carol harry finished it for him i suppose it is in a way but this isnt a ghost of the past it is the past a as viewed in mobiustime looking out looking back through the door jake saw what appeared to be the core of some vastly distant nova an incredible neonblue bombburst whose streamers were lines of light a myriad endlessly twisting twining frequentlytouching lines or neon tubes of blue light all reaching out from that central explosion expanding towards him rushing upon him like a luminous meteorite shower except the tracks didnt dim but remained printed on space a indeed printed on time and all jake could say was wwhat the blue lifethreads of humanity of all mankindfrom its very beginning harry told him quietly and that central nova that is the beginning the source the birthlight a quarter of a billion years ago when our ancestors crept out of the soupy oceans to evolve primitive lungs on volcaniclava beaches lifethreads jake whispered he had scarcely heard the other was merely repeating him like a man in a dream a which of course he was the tracks weve left in time harry answered like metaphysical fossils a photograph of mans snailtrail his evolution from his humblest beginnings the proof of it is there jake right before your eyes for see one of those blue lifethreads connects with you follow it back far enough and youd see it blaze into being a pure blue glow to light you on your way through life the moment you were born yesand you dont appear to have a thread said jake but since the explanation was obvious he quickly went on if i were to trip and fall through this door i might fall all the way back to the big bang no harry told him but if you willed it you might travel back through all your ancestors to the beginning of life awesome isnt it and before jake could answer back there some little way i saw your blue thread crossed by scarlet but the vampire threads stopped right there while yours sped on it was bruce trennier and his brood when they died the true death at which time jake frowned awhat just yesterday a i had already received your dart some kind of paradox he sensed harrys shrug his irritation but that was one of the reasons you received it time is relative what will be has been you think of time as having been or as being now or as still to come but the way i see it times are just different places all within reach its the fourth dimension jake and the mobius continuum lies parallel to all four as for paradoxes theyd be rife if we could actually change the past or see the future thats why precogs like lan goodly have such a hard time of it its why they are allowed to know something of what will be but never how it will be jake looked again through the door and made a futile effort to follow the track of the neonblue thread that flowed out of him where it twisted and twined its way to his origins perhaps he would see what harry had seen scarlet threads crossing it in mobiustime and coming to an end there but among all the myriad lives that had been his was soon lost to sight and all the worlds past he said this time i helped you find it said harry the next time a if you should ever need it a you could well he on your own so try to remember these coordinates as for futuretime doors thats easy they point the other way thats all youll work it out in time ii shouldnt be here said jake suddenly dizzy i mean no one should be here thats a normal reaction anyway we have to be moving on those names you gave me i found a connection someone who knew their owners nnot in this world you didnt said jake as the time door closed they were wamphyri and came out of starside true said the other hut they didnt come alone ii have been advised to look up someone who came with them and i think you should meet him too more motion a an acceleration a that jake sensed rather than felt wwhere are we going to the refuge but it isnt there any more its ruins an but why there to talk to someone who died there someone who died past tense but we cant be going into the past the pasttime door has closed thats right and anyway its not physically possible not for you you couldnt materialize there no were going to the refuge in your present your now your dream but if this someone is dead how can we too many huts said harry and anyway were there there was an awful place to be jake was up to his knees in cold water in a darkness almost as deep as that of the mobius continuum itself the water a river water from the resurgence he supposed a slopped around his legs and roved on while the unseen ceiling dripped cold moisture down his collar the atmosphere was stale still foul with a lingering stench of smoke spent explosives andother tastes and taints as jakes eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he began to make out certain features of this cavernand saw that it was more than just a cavern it was the sump what was left of it in the aftermath of zek foeners horrific heroic death now he remembered trasks story also something of what harry keogh had said that they were here to talk to someone who had come through from starside with malinari and the others and oh hes here the incorporeal harry told him causing jake to start yet again zek too but she has company good company as do a majority of the dead a great majority when zek when shes accustomed to all this then ill return and talk to her about old times remind her that well be together again a all of us a eventually but that might take some time yet for zek was very much alive she was one of my very dearest friends right to the end which reminds me of our reason for being hereto talk to the other fellow harrys voice had dropped to a low growl it seemed to jake that an unaccustomed darkness had crept into it and a very uncharacteristic threat so threatening in fact that in another moment his mind went into overdrive as he identified the source of his main concern which until now had mainly been lost among the minutiae and maziness of dreaming the fact that harry keogh was here to talk to someone who was dead the other fellow jake repeated the words of his still unseen companion i thought zek was alone down here and anyway how can a you a we a talk a to but by now everything was coming together that much faster including things jake really didnt want to think about but which were there anyway like the meaning of a certain word or name necroscope and what the precog lan goodly had told him about harry that he didnt view life and death the way others did and his means of communication was similar to telepathy but he had a different name for it like what like necromancy youre a necromancer jake gasped before he could check himself no the incorporeal others denial lashed him like a cry of rage in jakes cringing mind whatever else i am or may have been im not a necromancer never call me that again and now another voice out of nowhere but sweet as a breath of fresh air to fan jakes feverish mind and despite that hed never known her still he knew her zek foener necromancer ah no just call him harry and know him for a true friend and as for this a this blessing he gave us letting us comfort each other through the long lonely night of death a do you take it for an evil thing then youre mistaken its our one light in this eternal darkness and you may simply call it deadspeak chapter eighteen koraths story knew that youd be back harry zek said from the moment i saw you ride away on that big american motorcycle with penny on your way to starside i always knew youd be back i sensed you in nathan it wasnt really you butbut a likefatherlikeson thing this time it really is you ana youre as different from the dead now as you were from the living then zek harry answered his deadspeak voice crestfallen now i didnt mean to disturb you thats the last thing i wanted but you of all people should have known she scolded him however gently however fondly that what we do in life we continue to do in death and you were a class act jake cut in a telepath and a good one she was the best harry told him and apparently she still is except its no longer telepathy but deadspeak your ma was your spokesperson in the long ago harry zek reminded him but it looks like ill be taking over the great majority havent forgotten you and i know theyll never forget your son nathan but youll appreciate that towards the endwell there were problems problems jake doesnt know about harry quickly put in he doesnt need to know hes having a hard time accepting some of these things as it is and i dont want to ayou know a put any additional strain on his faith in me also if youre to become a spokesperson it will be on jakes behalf not mine you see i have very little of permanence here already this is taking a great effort of will as jake takes on my work therell be even less need for me and my presence will become that much harder to maintain as for nathan ive never met him he received his ultimate awareness through me its true but he was is and will always be his own man and i wont be said jake anxiously see said harry a tinge of sarcasm showing hes one very suspicious man this jake cutter if youre hiding things from me how can i be otherwise jake countered first ben trask and ebranch and now you so what are these problems that i dont know about all in good time harry answered it takes time to become a necroscope jake with me it was accidental a or perhaps it was in my genes my birthright im not sure a while with you its just blind chance but that blue thread of yours in future time anyway youre it or you will be so get used to the idea im it you mean a necroscope no i mean the necroscope the other answered you dont know how rare this thing is there will be just the one necroscope you in this world anyway and if i dont want to be the necroscope if i have my own way to go which to me is just as important for long seconds there was silence until harry said then it could very well be that you can kiss your world goodbye his deadspeak voice was very low again you dont leave me much choice do you jake answered a little bitterly why dont you just a i dont know like scan the future use a futuretime door or some such a and see how things turn out without me youre going to have to start listening said harry look you cant trust the future the past yes because itsjbced but not the future the one thing i can tell you is that youll be meeting up with vampires a wamphri the question is do you desire to meet them on your terms or on mine with your meagre knowledge or my experience and skillsassuming you can develop those skills that is jake thought about that but in fact there wasnt a lot to think about he believed harry keogh now a believed in his own five senses too a also in certain extra senses which had now been so compellingly demonstrated a and he completely believed everything that trask and the others had told him in total it left him with only one conclusion that it was real and he was up to his neck in it and up to his knees in this dark water and still not entirely sure what he was doing here but while listening to these dead voices in his head his dream jake had also looked about obtained a picture of where he was it could only be that harry was showing him this place telepathically for it was in no way dreamlike it was totally real the cavedin ceiling sagging in places and in others bulging upwards from the furious force of powerful explosives the collapsed stanchions great tangles of shattered metal and concrete cratered from the blast and blackened by fire and back there along what was once the course of the subterranean river the way completely blocked where the original caverns ceiling had succumbed to manmade convulsions and its own great weight of fractured rock dramatic but not what were here to see said harry satisfied now that jake had at least accepted his involvement if not the allimportant role he was to play in what was to come o now come this way to where he died harry was in jakes mind guiding his feet all jake needed to do was follow where the other led to the solid twelvefeetthick reinforced concrete wall of the dam which contained the dynamoes and sensitive equipment that had once supplied and monitored the refuges power the oncesmooth face of the concrete wall was gouged and pitted blackened in places but it was still intact built to withstand the pressure of the water it had also withstood the pressure of the blast that close enough harry said bringing jake to a halt where the water was a little shallower there could well beremains down there under the water that you wouldnt want to step on remains jake said but no need for the more he conversed with the other in this way the more he was given to understand that like telepathy deadspeak frequently conveyed more than was actually said the remains that harry referred to were those of the lieutenant or thrall that malinari and the others had used to block one of the outlets thus attracting attention to the sump and making possible their escape as that fact dawned jake stiffened the short hairs rose on the nape of his neck as he took a pace to the rear wrinkled his nose in disgust and swallowed to ease the sudden involuntary constriction of his throat the water seemed to gurgle more blackly yet viscously around his calves as he saw the curved rim of a steel conduit projecting from the dam wall perhaps mercifully he could only see the uppermost curve of the pipe while the bore itselfa and what it contained a remained hidden in the swirl of black water jesus christ jake thought and at once sensed harrys reproval try not to do that jake for expressions have crept into common speech that never should be butthey stuffed a man one of their own in there the concept was horrifying but not nearly as awful as the new voice that now joined the conversation a man was i a mere man then korath mindsthrall a mere man ah but dont let my name mislead you for then you might consider me a mere thrall too aye and so i was at first but all that was thirty thousand sunups agone when first lord malinari found me in sunside after he recruited me then i was his thrall next a lieutenant finally us chiefest lieutenant i stood alongside malinari during his years of power of treachery when his name was a curse even in the aeries of the wamphyri i was banished with him out of starside into the icelands and we suffered the ice together in the company of frozen beasts i was there with my lord at the freezing and at the meltand this is my reward jake had backed off found himself a dry ledge of concrete fallen from the ceiling and crept up onto it he sat there hugging his knees shivering but not from the cold that was only in his dream the real cold was in his mind in the awful voice from beyond the grave or rather from beyond death for korath mindsthrall had never known a real grave and is thisis this your secret jake was appalled as much by the cold dread the loathing in his own voice as by anything else is this what it means to be a necroscope the necroscope to suffer deadspeak and talk to things like korath his thoughts arecorruption not the things he says but the way they feel i cant feel you harry youre there in my head but unobtrusive not so much an intruder as a guide but korathi can feel his thoughts like slugs oozing in my head polluting my mind he sensed harrys grim nod of agreement exactly just as his rotting body polluted this water before his flesh sloughed from his bones but this is where he died and this is where he is now maybe you can understand why ben trask was reluctant to tell you everything its not every man who could bear to speak to the dead jake it certainly isnt this one jake gave his head a wild shake in fact all i want right now is to get the hell out of here but no no wait korath mindsthrall begged dont go dont leave me before you there was nothing only darkness and loneliness and the sure knowledge that i was shunned i have listened to the teeming dead whispering in their endless night and i know they whisper warnings of me that i am a vampire a terrible creature best left to its own devices well and so i was a vampire but nowi have no devices i have nothing why even my flesh has melted from my broken bones and is gone from me have you no pity you warm ones i may not harm you i am nothing dont leave meeeeee and just as suddenly the loathing was gone and jake found himself pitying this thing until harry told him that too is a mistake vampires are the greatest cheats and liars imaginable devious beyond measure this one korath is no exception later well ask him why malinari chose him a his chiefest lieutenant a to block this pipe when he had at least three others to choose from on a whim hardly you dont indenture or instruct someone far as long as korath mindsthrall claims he was in thrall just to kill him out of hand malinari had a reason no korath howled that is a lie no no aforgive me a not a lie butbut a misconception malinari had no reason he was never required to reason he was the mind and whatever he willed would be done flesh was needed to block this pipe and myjleshit was pliable and available that was enough say no more so said harry yourjlesh was pliablea but not that pliable the vampire cut in you cannot possibly imagine the agonies that aand you were compliant i was not did not know lord malinari sent out his thoughts they touched upon the man who tended this place and understood machines but the mind was clever and careful in sunside there are szgany who know when the wamphyri are near they close their minds think no thoughts and so hide themselves from the great vampires perhaps in this strange new world there would be men like that ever stealthy malinari ensured that his presence went unsuspected and he took knowledge from this engineer and learned the ways of the sump which was my downfall my master told me the pipe was a way out he bade me crawl inside to make sure the way was clear when my shoulders would not go he and vavara and szwart summoned their furious wamphyri strength to break the bones in my back and shoulders and drive me home like a stopper in a bottle zek jake said harry and there was something new in his low deadspeak voice they knew what it was that he spoke only to them that he was shielding his thoughts from korath mindsthrall let me handle this zek it probably isnt going to be pleasant so by all means leave it entirely to me korath will say things you dont want to hear and so might i ill absent myself she answered him at once ive had my fair share of dealings with vampires as you know and i dont need reminding jake i look forward to working with you if or whenever you need me meanwhile there are others i should talk to and let them know youre here you wont be alone jake before the dreamer could answer there was an emptiness in his mind where zek had been or not so much an emptiness as an awareness of her leaving and how about me he asked harry any chance that i could perhaps absent myself too none at all harry told him you dont have to join in if you dont want to but you should at least listen if i can ill get korath to tell us his story or more importantly his masters story and those of vavara and szwart too if youre going to defeat your enemies jake you need to know them why dont you just take it easy this time out and listen in learn something about the wamphyri and their ways and learn it from the horses a or the vampires a mouth without waiting for an answer he spoke again to korath ive a mind to leave you to your own devices yes just as the teeming dead advise but that would make me as cruel as the master who crushed you and left you here to die and so im tempted to stay with you a while and converse with you in your loneliness which you must know will last for ever and ever but on the other hand a having had to do with vampires before a i see no point in talking to one who is bound by his very nature to tell me nothing but lies koraths answering cry immediately went up ah ah have mercy have mercy pity me i pray for a moment then i thought that you had gone i thought you had left me then i felt your warmth a though yours is not so obvious as that of your friend er jake a and so knew you were still here now hear me i am a gruff and violent vampire that is true but i was not always this way i was made what i am by malinari made by him and now unmade by him so what more harm can he do me who or whatever you are talk to me only allow me to bathe in your light which burns like a candle in this intolerable darkness and ask of me what you will i shall not lie as men are known to speak the truth on their deathbeds so i shall speak it from beyond i want to know about malinari said harry and vavara and szwart i want to know all about them from the beginning and korath eagerly answered none knows their stories better than i butsuch tales will take time in the telling i have time said harry well within certain limits and so do you you have an eternity of time one question said the other ask it wry because would exterminate them and all that they stand for harry answered truthfully and ruthlessly their kind are not wanted in this world and good said korath his voice gurgling with phlegmy anticipation why should they have life having deprived me of mine in starside we acknowledge four states of beingunbeing these are one the void before birth two the time of warmblooded life such as the szgany of sunside enjoy it three a higher condition known as undeath when a mans existence might possibly reach to eternity and four the true death which is nothing less than a return to the primal void but i korath have found the last to be a lie it is a darkness aye but never a void the true death is an absence of motion but not of mind i think i ami but immobile forgotten lost in the long long night i have no peace so why should the ones who put me here have peace why should they have anything no i will not lie to you necroscope then get on with it said harry begin with nephran malinari since he would seem the most dangerous wrong said korath for each is as bad as the others why do you think they were banished out of starside doubtless im about to find out said harry but ill warn you now while time is not of the essence dont try to spin it out im not long on patience and could be about better things is that understood it is indeed the vampire answered then without pause korath got on with it and by virtue of the nature of deadspeak a also because the exlieutenants tale was illustrated with vivid mindpictures a jake found himself listening in along with his mentor he soon became absorbed in the narrative it was hundreds of years agone though to me having spent so much time in the ice a frozen and stilled and preserved even in my thoughts a it stands out in my memory like yesterday or perhaps yestereve i was of the clan vadastra indeed i was the son of the chief dinu vadastra our place was in the forest many miles to the east of the great pass into starside we toiled in gathering and growing in the breeding of domesticated livestock and in hunting and fishing being settled a unlike the majority of the szgany who are nomads a there were no bounds for my father to beat in any event we were not troubled by foreign settlers indeed our land was shunned by all the neighbouring tribes for you see my people were supplicants who gave of their goods to lord nephran malinari called malinari the mind out of malstack in starside now do not ask me if i enjoyed our situation i was born to it and knew no other way likewise the vadastras as a tribe only the old men of my people had been travellers who in their time had known the ways of the true nomad the life of the supplicant suited them to perfection the wamphyri had no use for ancient withered flesh or desiccated blood and so the elders were safe so long as they could work gathering the wild honey and fruits of the woods my father was also safe for while he had not as yet grown long in the tooth still he was the chief of his people whom malinari had appointed keeper of the tithefor which reason he was greatly feared and in most matters obeyed without question in most matters aye and my father dinu vadastra was a hard man tall broad and a bully when lesser men complained of the theft of their wives sons or daughers taken in the tithe he would deal very harshly with them why they might even find themselves listed as troublemakers and regardless of the draw destined for malinaris great aerie when next his tithesmen did their rounds there was a girl i lovedat least i think i loved her but all such things are a mystery to me now love that is for the warm ones now there is a or there was a only lust when my master and his lieutenants hunted among the socalled free tribes of sunside oh then there was lust ahhhhhhh but please forgive me my meandering mind for i see that you do not wish to know that as for this young girl whom i may or may not have loved more anon let it suffice for now to say that she was my downfall the first of them anyway now understand malinari was not greedy a at least not when the wamphyri were at peace with one another and no bloodwar was raging a but he was ever choosy his tithesmen lieutenants all knew that he wanted only the best out of sunside no curdled honey bitter plums or scrawny beasts for malinari and no snaggletooth boys or bowlegged girls either and my father was always hard put to fix a fair tithe he might on rare occasion slip in a barrel of lessthanbest plum brandy a crippled shad or a brace or two of game left hanging just a day or so too long but never anything outrageously offensive and he was the same in his dealings with human flesh loners if they saw our campfires in the night and came down from the barrier mountains to warm themselves were ever welcomed they would be given food and drink a aye and a lot of the latter a before being tapped on the head and laid aside for the tithe and if the cart or caravan of some lone travellers family group should happen onto vadastra territory well that was reckoned a bonus for then fewer of our own would be needed for the list we were some three hundred and eighty the number rarely rose by more than a dozen or so and when it did was as readily reduced in any given year perhaps fifty babies would be born with any luck half would grow to adults while the rest would be borne away into starside my lord nephran malinariwas reputed to have a sweet tooth for basted infants but i must not jump ahead of myself for at that time he was not my lord as such or rather i was not as yet in thrall to him where was i ah yes the tithe married men who sired no children for a year or two were wont to find themselves shortlisted and as for women who were barren their future or lack of such was guaranteed likewise any troublemakers of course thus the tribe maintained itself barely and the tithe saw to it that we were never too large or too small once in a threemonth malinaris tithesmen would come on their flyers over the mountains from starside and now and then the master himself would accompany them on their visits and now to this girl whom i may even have loved my father kept her back from the tithe for me alas that he had crossed so many of his own people who suspected that he was biased in certain of his duties a in the quarterly drawing of the tithemarkers for instance a and there were plenty who would have paid him back who would like to have seen his loved ones on the list or rather his loved one this selfsame korath whose poor mother had died giving birth to him but the girl nadiashe and her mother were gatherers as were most of our women and both of them were among the comeliest of vadastra females nadias father had been a talented hunter until nine months agone when his marker came up in the draw that had been that if not quite as easy as that for he was young and strong as a bull shad he had to be knocked down bound in all his limbs and even gagged before he would be still and because of accusations hed made concerning my father a the way dinu had looked at his wife a there might be some who suspected that their chief had fixed certain matters in his own favour make of that what you will but i wont deny that from then on nadias mother was dinusor should i simply say that she submitted to dinu and leave it at that but his his property his obedient woman ah wait and see the fact was that melana zetra had loved her husband and when she was over the horror of his being taken in the tithe a and when she was close to my father and after she had covertly investigated the way he worked the list a then she made up her mind to act i cannot state melanas reasons for doing what she next did perhaps it was madness brought on by grief but if so she had hidden her condition extremely well or then again she may have been crazy like a fox and simply biding her time my best theory is that she would be with her husband banos again regardless of the conditions and had determined to sacrifice herself to that end banos had been taken by malinari of the wamphyri now melana would be taken also but along the way she would settle a few old scores the szgany can be devious in their own right and i cannot help but wonder if that is where the wamphyri get it is it perhaps in the blood for the blood is the life after all but if this secretly incensed or maddened melana would be with her husband in starside why not make it a family affair what of her daughter nadia would she be safe on her own with the szgany vadastra or better off in starside with her mother and father being comely it was unlikely shed be fodder why given time she might even become a lady could it be any worse to be undead with the wamphyri than to live under the constant threat of being stolen away or eaten by the wamphyri and what of an informer might not he or she a as a supplicant in the fullest truest meaning of the word a gain favour in the redlitten lamps of their eyes i suspect it was a mixture of all of these imponderables that motivated the maddened or scheming melana to do what she did next the time of the tithe was at hand and dinu vadastra had calculated correctly that malinari would come with his lieutenant tithesmen out of starside it had been some time since the mind himself had deigned to venture forth from malstack across the barrier mountains into the velvet of sunsides night the skies were clear and the moon tumbling on high all the familiar constellations were twinkling in the smoke of our signal fires while low over the barrier mountains the star of illomen a the northstar which lights the aeries of the wamphyri a bathed the peaks with its silveryblue icechip gleaming a fine night aye for some as it might have been for me had it not been for my now barelyremembered love of nadia zetra still i cannot blame her for i am sure that nadia knew nothing of her mothers plan if she hadits more than likely we would have fled from our fate becoming loners or we might have journeyed west and joined up with some band of true travellers in their constant evasion of the wamphyri or perhaps we would have been happy simply to be free a while together she and i and let the future take care of itself oh a great many possibilities if nadia had known as for my father if he had so much as suspectedthen melanas life were forfeit long before the first of malinaris flyers touched down on vadastra soil but of course none of us knew except melana herself and so to the preparations all was in order as the dusk settled in dinu had called for the tributes to be displayed on trestle tables to one side of the clearing where he had tallied them as was his wont six barrels of oil six of white wine and six of red six of good plum brandy and six more of wild honey a pair of young bull shads freshly butchered fifteen brace of pigeon and five of wild boar and a very special prize indeed a live caged wolf of the wild a bitch at that and pregnant to boot the wamphyri are especially fond of wolf cubs basted in their mothers milk and of heartofwolf and wolf meat generally which they swear by as an aphrodisiac and positive aid to their longevity as if they needed such and meanwhile dinus specially chosen squad of bully boys was out and about to ensure that certain other tributes a of the human variety a were not fled for while the tithemarkers were already drawn the unfortunate parties had not been named for fear that they would make off into the night thus as the time drew nigh the wailing of mothers and daughters the curses of men and the sobbing of their sons could be heard in and around the camp as one by one the various listed names were informed of their misfortune by dinus tithetakers some were already known of course the troublemakers in their cages and outsiders who had wandered inadvertently onto vadastra territory but the three males three females and six infants of the clan itself their naming was left to last for the reasons stated then they were gathered in by dinus bully boys chained and gagged before they could voice any great complaint or cause commotion and tethered to await the coming of the tithesmen and their vampire master lord nephran malinari as for the babies they were wrapped in bundles on the trestle tables along with the other wines victuals and sweetmeats myself i was with nadia safe in my fathers caravan from peepholes in the withe walls silently and scarce breathing we watched and waited as instructed for my father liked to keep his prized ones well out of sight of the wamphyri so as not to arouse their interest likewise nadias mother melana zetra dinu had advised her to remain out of sight hidden in her caravan lest being comely she attract unwanted attention and in the fifth hour after sundown they came the skies had been clear as told and only a warm breeze like the breath of the dreaming forest to tease the flames of the campfires and stir the branches of the trees about the central clearing but the wamphyri have their own weird ways with nature they work their will on air earth and water as acid works on metals etching them to their design we had seen it all before the mist gathering on the high peaks and rolling down like some vaporous avalanche all milkywhite in the moonlight the sudden flurry of cold air down from the barrier mountains beating on the flames of our fires as if to smother them and lashing the gentler winds of the forest to frenzied flight and suddenly from behind the peaks the first stain of dark clouds writhing blindly out of the north feeling their way like snaky fingers and obscuring the glittering northstar as they came and in those clouds riding on high swooping and fluttering like withered leaves caught in a flurry a yet unlike leaves directed and with purpose a the scaly flyer mounts of the wamphyri and oh the moaning and gibbering of those plague winds as the creatures that rode them a and the ones who rode them a came on gliding descending trapping the air in the scoops of their webby membrane wings and settling to the foothills over vadastra territoryexcept as by now you have surely reasoned these lands were vadastra in name only for in fact they belonged to lord nephran malinari of the wamphyri and malinari had come to collect his tithe chapter nineteen malinari in the gloom of the wrecked sump in the dark of jakes dream a which was in fact much more than a dream indeed a metaphysical connection through harry keogh to an exlieutenant of the wamphyri a korath mindsthrall continued his story there were vampires and vampires in starsides great aeries of the wamphyri as were i saw some who were hideous beyond description too monstrous to look upon even through a thralls eyes in general they would keep to their manlike outlines but would shape their various parts to their own design their ears were often carved and fretted into fanciful sculptures convolute nostrils might be pierced and hung with rings of gold arms lengthened to extend their reach in battle and teeth permanently enlarged until speech itself was difficult lords frequently kept battlescars as trophies a flayed cheek might be made to heal so that the white of the bone showed through a gouged eye could be grown elsewhere than on the face in those days there was a young lord called lesk the glut because of his appetites stolen as a child out of sunside he grew to a youth became a lieutenant eventually slew his master for his leech but lesk was a madman and the stolen leech only enhanced his madness when his murdered masters familiar warrior hesitated to answer to lesks command he actually did battle with the thingand killed it he won the fight but lost an eye which he grew again upon his shoulder organs such as these were rudimentary some lords deliberately affected an extra eye at the nape of the necksufficient to give warning of an attack from the rear and these eyes would be lidless so that they could never close in sleep i mention these things so as to illustrate the hideousness of which i have spoken but in fact those lords a and occasionally ladies a who affected such alterations or mutilations were usually the weakest of their kind they only made themselves to look ugly so as to present more fearsome facades in battle and so perhaps to avoid battle entirely take for example volse pinescu called lord wen which was surely the greatest possible misnomer what just one wen when in all likelihood volse was the ugliest of all the lords of the wamphyri for it was lord wens habit to foster hairy blemishes running sores and festoons of boils all over his face and form in order that his aspect would be that much more terrifying do you see no clean man or thing would strike him for fear of the drench which must surely ensue even amongst the highestranking vampire lords there were several such as lesk and volse but then again there were also those who had no need for such deceptions and affectations and nephran malinari was one of them for he was vain and he was handsomeah but this too was a faaade in its way for the mind was a monster underneath even as monstrous as his mind if youll forgive this puny play on words but at least in his appearance lord malinari was less the beast and more the beautiful human being more truly well lordly as it were but for something so very terrible to be so beautiful surely that were the ultimate deception back to that night seven great flyers had landed on the rim of a broad ledge a false plateau in the foothills overlooking vadastra territory i malinaris mist rolled down to flank him and his then spread out and descended to the forest it was met by a lesser mist that sprang from the soil and woodlands themselves so ringing in our rude homes and their central clearing and all about us a sea of whitelapping mist and in the clearing itself a ground mist a but unlike any natural mist sentient and sickfeeling a writhing and twining about the cabins and longimmobilized caravans where the latter were all propped on their empty axles malinaris thoughts were in the mist they felt things out searching for treachery but there was none or at least not towards malinari the wind had fled south and the night was still again as the mist slowly dispersed the flyers launched from their foothills ledge and came gliding on stretchy membranous wings now the flying mounts of the wamphyri are monstrous creatures though not so much for any kind of malevolent activity on their part as for their appearance and nature for while at first glance they seem like giant longnecked and longtailed bats on closer inspectionplainly they are made from men their wings have enormous span with the alveolate oncehuman skeletons of arms legs and grotesquely extended fingers and toes all visible through the sheathing greygleaming membrane of their envelopes the creatures have massive hearts to fuel the muscles that power their great wings other than that they are little more than airfoils of flexible cartilage and hollow bone in sheaths of light lean meat in short they are mainly wings with very little of mind built to fly and obey a with their tiny walnut brains linked invisibly mentally to their riders a they do nothing but what their masters will oh they have bits in their mouths and reins for guidance but only for emphasis when mental commands go lacking a ready response so now you understand me when i speak of flyers descending towards our clearing on their stretchy membrane wings as for their riders these soon became visible three of the seven a those in the middle of the vformation a were at ease arrogant haughty in their ornate leather saddles the others were young lieutenants eager forwardsleaning and feraleyed it was probably the first time they had been allowed to venture forth with malinaris tithesmen but the figure to which every eye was drawn was that in the dead centre of the aerial tableau to him and to his mount that central flyer was by far the largest strongest and most elaborately fashioned a handful of good men a perhaps as many as six or seven a had gone into its construction in malinaris vats of metamorphosis in malstack in starside gliding down towards the clearing the huge but human eyes in its halfhuman head at the end of that long snaky neck swung this way and that seeking an acceptable landing place while black and seemingly vacant saucer eyes in its belly lidded themselves in preparation so as not to suffer damage in the landing ah but when i speak of eyes do not let me forget those of the rider where they glowed like small scarlet lamps in his face of course they did for this was lord nephran malinari a malinari the mind himself his flyers wings formed themselves into airscoops its tail a the elongated knuckled spine of a man a swung this way and that keeping balance coiled tentacles like springs extended down from belly cavities their sensitive tips tracing the contours of the ground then with a sighing of air and a folding of wings the thing set down light as a feather and flanking it six lesser beasts likewise touched down their lieutenant riders out of their saddles and striding to their masters side all in a few liquid moments while for those same moments malinari sat there as if in contemplation reins loosely clasped one elbow on the pommel of his saddle and chin in hand then stirring himself up he swung lithely down from his mount sighed and said well and here we are simply that the merest murmur of a sound yet powered by malinaris mentalism every man woman and child in the entire vadastra settlement heard it and to every mind he touched a despite that his voice was brandydeep and honeysweet a a certain fetor clinging for with all his powers of deception even malinari could not hide the underlying stench of blood his mentalism had its limits spread thin as this it was good for seeking out enemies or szgany in hiding but for very little else so that having displayed it he now dispensed with it and the swift withdrawal of his probes felt like water clearing from ones ears after surfacing from a dive in a deep pool and now too he called for my father dinu in a voice both rich and strong but while the brandy depth was still there the sweetness was all used up for now it was time for the business the vadastras were gathered as a clan on that side of the clearing farthest from the barrier mountains so positioned that all eyes had been enabled to follow the arrival of malinari and his tithesmen my father who stood central and to the fore of this gathering came with all speed in answer to malinaris call and prostrated himself before his acknowledged master and the vampire lord stood there a little while looking down on him perhaps enjoying his grovelling but ahhhh a this malinari was handsome he was all of an hundred and sixty years old but looked no more than forty his hair was black and shone like a nighthawks wing a as well it might being greased with the fat of vadastra women swept back from the broad dome of his head behind pointed ears which were not as large or misshapen as the webby conchlike ears of most lords and with its jet ringlets curled on his caped shoulders while its gleaming black curtain fanned out down his back like the hair of a young girl or the decorative head plumage of the black eaglewhy it loaned him the haughty looks of a great hunting bird a a veritable nighthawk aye and for once it was no deception for as much as he was anything malinari was certainly the bird of prey and his face its deathly pallorthe deepsunken eyes under arcing eyebrowscheekbones juttingthe high brow risingslightly flattened nose whose convolute flanges were almost imperceptiblethe lean cheeks and perfect bow of his bloodred lips the red of blood aye to match the fire of his eyes in any other man or vampire the fiery lamps of malinaris eyes would be less than ornamental but they suited the mind to perfection indeed they loaned his cheeks a ruddy semblance of warmth of life while in fact he was the cold and cruel master of something other than life but not yet death and tall he would be two long paces tall and then some and slim as a wand yet strong as a dozen of our best who were only men i knew this last for a certainty for there never was a weak lord of the wamphyri but malinaris strength wasnt of the flesh alone not only brawn but brain not merely muscle but mind he was the mind and up he finally commanded my father up and show me my tribute there was no kissing of sandalled feet nor yet of hands as my father came erect no touching of any sort such were the minds powers that even a touch could prove harmful draining a mans knowledge or erasing part of his memory and anyway dinu was malinaris trusted servant who would not dare hold anything back from him this was how it had been between them for many a shameful year shameful aye for if ive not already said that i loathed this cringing subservient existence surely by now i have hinted as much anyway my father was big burly bearded and blustering rumour had it that he was a bastard too but i never heard it bruited in his presence puffed up with his own importance yet somehow managing to bow and scrape he led malinari and his men to that side of the clearing where the trestle tables were bowed a little from the weight of the tribute here dinu vadastra had been as clever as he dared to be so arranging the trestles that the centre spans were bound to bow a little under any extra weight whether or no his ploy fooled anyone it certainly looked good and indeed malinari seemed impressed then he and my father conversed and because dinus caravan stood very close to the trestle tables and the night being so still now nadia and i heard their every word dinu chief of the clan vadastra malinari spoke to my father it appears you had word of my coming i would even say you must have had since youve responded with this ohsoexcellent tribute whats more try as i might i cannot remember the time when my tithesmen brought home so handsome a bounty what why i could even be forgiven for thinking that perhaps theyve been robbing me all this time my own lieutenants like ungrateful dogs thieving from the house that shelters them he stared at his men glared at them with eyes of flame lengthened his jaws and yawned at them a little a so that they all drew back a paceuntil he grinned a wolfs grin at them then threw back his great head and laughed until his hair shimmered all down his back ah but see i have made a joke he said for all and all my lieutenants thralls and familiar creatures know that to thieve from me is to bid farewell to all this my rules are made simple so that even a dullard may understand them in my manse in starside dwell many starveling warriors who have their needs no less than men from time to time they enjoy the occasional tidbit and to a monster they are especially fond of tidbits that kick and shriek and spurt red and after a pause turning to my father dry work this joking he said are we perhaps thirsty dinu vadastra and he beckoned to his side a junior lieutenant by then as might well be imagined my father was very thirsty he produced a tray of beaten gold and three goblets of that same common metal which he filled with white wine from a barrel this was ever the ritual that dinu play the part of one of lord malinaris foodtasters for like all of the wamphyri but more so than most the mind was susceptible to silver in however small a measure a indeed to granules of silver to the very dust of silver a and likewise to garlic whose mere reek was guaranteed to cause nausea and copious vomiting thus dinu would take the first sip which would provide him with an early opportunity to declare the wine fouled next the tithesman who being a vampire would not only taste any poison but react violently to it and finally malinari first inhaling deeply of the wines bouquet through his snouts fleshy runnels before gulping it down for however much he affected lordly airs and on occasion a flowery or delicate mode of speech still lord malinaris table manners were dreadful so on through every barrel a taste from each the brandies too and even the honey and while my father was sensible enough to drink but sparingly still he was staggering a little towards the end as for the foodstuffs a the wild grain roots and fruits animals and such aye and bairns too a they were not tested though for a fact malinari lingered a while over a fat boy child whose black eyes smiled at him in all innocence while the monsters own crimson orbs flared that much brighter in his face then on to the wolfbitch in her cage a prize indeed malinari approved i may keep her and her whelps both and he made as if to stroke her through the bars but growling low in her throat she snapped at him and malinari withdrew his hand with no room to spare saying or perhaps not for wolves are plaguy treacherous beasts at best but fine strong meat dinu vadastra ill grant you that and on that same subject where pray are the rest of my animals a the ones who walk upright with which the unfortunate ones all sorted and chained in a row a a man a girl a youth a woman and so on a were trooped out for malinaris inspection they had been caused to void themselves then had been washed groomed and clad in good fur robes fastened with golden clasps and there they paraded most with bowed heads but a few of the younger men muttering and the adult women sobbing and this or that young girl far too prideful too aware of her lithe szgany sensuality head tilted and dark eyes fluttering daring to gaze on malinari and even hoping to impress him ah but the mind was not easily impressed he walked the line a or rather flowed along it with that deceptive grace of the wamphyri a and his tithesmen with him senior men to the fore and juniors well to the rear and whenever malinari paused to look closer at one of his male acquisitions then his senior lieutenants would step forward and take hold of the man forcing wide his jaws so that the great vampire could examine his teeth then they would unfasten his gold clasp displaying his naked body and sometimes malinari might indicate his approval of a youths long limbs and broad shoulders murmuring this one is for the making i think in malstack my vats stand empty or this one is a fighting man tall and well muscled aye or again he might say nothing at all but simply shake his head for there was always the provisioning in a while he came to one of those tooproud girls who dared to gaze upon him and paused again his senior tithesmen moved forward one of them reaching for the clasp at the girls throat to open her robe but she was a beauty and the lieutenant too eager noticing this lord malinari caught at his hand and stayed it then narrowed his eyes in a frown saying ah but see how your blood courses stefanu why i can feel it pulsing through your veins like a raging river and so youre a lustful one are you but you know a now that i think of it a i have often wondered why when i send you out to collect my tithes i get so few virgins master ia said stefanu trying to back off but malinari held him saying ah ah be still and he touched the index finger of his free hand to the mans brow stefanu groaned jerked began to lift his right hand where it was sheathed in a murderous gauntlet this was a wholly reflex action nothing more but malinari had seen it his eyes blazed up at once like coals under the bellows and as his jaws elongated and his lips curled back from scythelike teeth so stefanu fell to his knees and begged for mercy then for long moments malinaris index finger trembled on his lieutenants forehead and his face writhed in a passion as he read the mans thoughts at least the ones that were important to him until suddenly straining as if from some enormous effort of will he snatched back his hand and snarled oh you miserable lecherous man consider yourself fortunate for while i have had your thoughts ive left your mind intact not out of any love for you stefanu mindsthrall a ravisher of my women before ive so much as seen them a but because i may soon have need of you and treacherous did i not see you raise your hand your wargloved hand against me did you dare think to strike me perhaps you did and so for nowbegone remove take yourself from my sight get to your flyer and wait for me there and consider your treacherous ways what you have done this night and to whom and what it would be like to live out the rest of your life floundering and drooling mindless in a pit of your own wastes a which might yet be your get from all this he released stefanu and when he had wriggled away stumbled to his feet and fled malinari said to the girl my dear give me your hand she obeyed him at once and using his mentalism he saw what only he could see then asked her are you truly a virgin oh yes my lord she answered and malinari nodded and smiled had you said no he told her i might have made you a lieutenants woman for your honesty but i abhor liars however pretty a especially little whores who would attempt my seduction by trying to hide their thoughts from me whereforeno high station for you young lady but there are common thralls in my manse who will enjoy instructing you or you them whichever and wrinkling his nose he shrugged and turned o ao away from her malinaris inspection was over and now he told dinu vadastra i am not displeased not with you and yours but youve seen how i deal with them who would deny me my due so now tell me truly was this the best you could do the vadastras have never made finer wines or brandies my father answered as for the foodstuffs no better flesh may be bred or hunted no purer honey or sweeter fruits foraged on my word my lord this is our best and what of the tithe in human flesh malinari glanced at the robed ones in their chains are these also the best you have to offer or do you hold something in reserve again ive done my best dinu told him but certainly i must have a reserve a of good blood good flesh for breeding a lest the vadastras falter and become useless to you and malinari nodded and said this was always our understanding aye but dinu take heed hard times are coming and my needs are great do you see this dark cloud hanging over us like a portent of illomen what say you chief of the vadastras it seems to me it bodes not well and when my father glanced at the heavens a indeed there was a dark and hovering cloud which until now had gone mainly unnoticed it turned slowly in the nightdark skies over vadastra territory and within its writhing mass riding the laden air darker shapes seemed hidden so that dinus voice was less certain small and faltering as he inquired wwwhat does it mean my lord but the minds cultured tones were grown very deep and menacing now and his scarlet eyes more truly aflame as he answered it means that despite our a what our friendship a and despite that you have been a true and honest man at which point there sounded a small commotion a fluttering figure appeared at the rim of the tableau and what a true and honest man this dinu vadastra this socalled chief this great thief i say wait give me but a moment to show you that you are wrong my lord the voice was shrill and female and nadia where she huddled close to me in my fathers caravan started and gasped her hand flying to her mouth for she had recognized the voice that of her mother melana zetra who came hurrying now from her hiding place and but what is this malinari arched his eyebrows and his forehead creased in a frown someone dares to raise her voice to interfere and to command nephran malinari to wait for a moment dinu vadastra was stunned likewise the rest of the clan including nadia and myself but as melana came in a rush her hair awry and her face gaunt with fear a the terror of what she was about a it was observed that she wore a robe of offering and indeed she was offering herself of her own free will to malinari and his tithesmen ah but she was offering a deal more than that what said malinari again in utter amaze as she threw herself down before him clawing the earth at his feet is she a mad thing that she interferes with the tithe mad with grief melana cried tearing her hair throwing off her robe and kneeling there naked mad with rage and with outrage for i have been cheated and used badly my people too and even you my lord cheated all of us a by this man and she pointed a trembling finger at dinu it was the beginning of the end and any observer could be forgiven for thinking that dinu was himself wamphyri a the way his eyes popped out like plums in his face and the way he bared his teeth a as he threw himself upon melana and bore her down his knife rose over the tangle they madeuntil malinari took it from him tossed it away then grabbed dinu by the scruff of the neck and drew him upright and speak up he commanded nadias mother how have i been cheated oh be sure i could learn it my way but the process is harmful and your chief might easily lose all powers of reason moreover i would like him to hear for himself what may yet harm him even more so say on woman tell me how dinu vadastra has betrayed me he looked at my father dangling in his grasp his sandalled feet barely touching the ground then grunted and thrust him away sending him sprawling to the earth dinu would have attacked melana again at once but a pair of lesser lieutenants were at his side their gauntlets ready and so he kept still then melana spoke up and the complaints she listed were the selfsame grievances that every decent vadastra man woman or child capable of reasoned and intelligent thought had carried in his or her heart for long and long without ever daring to give them substance she spoke of the chiefs many prejudices and of his favourites a such as herself a who remained hidden away secret and undisclosed to the great lord of vampires when he sent his tithesmen out of starside to collect his tribute and of dinus treachery to his own tribesmen how if he were jealous of a mans prowess or if he should be bested in some piddling campfire argument then the better man might expect to find himself listed for the tithe so that for long and long no one had dared say dinu no melana went on and on as if she would never end for as my fathers odalisque she had been privy to a great many wicked things in his caravan a all of his conspiracies with his cronies a in the time since her good husband banos had been taken in the tithe and so she lashed dinu with her unforgiving tongue which all the while gathered fire and passion for melana knew that one way or the other it was all done with now and so she might as well do her worst then towards the end she spoke of her man banos zetra but here she broke down sobbing her heart out when telling how banos a a hunter whose contributions to the tithe had been significant a had been carried off to malstack in starside simply because dinu vadastra had fancied his wife for himself and for no other reason and here i kneel before you she finished at last the living proof of all that i have said but my man is in starside and theres no place here for me now for which reasons i would venture over the barrier mountains with you and yours into the dark and what of the ones that dinu has hidden from you great lord my daughter whom he saves for his own worthless son aye and that selfsame son korath who skulks like a whipped dog in his fathers caravan there at the last she threw herself flat on the earth sobbing and clasping malinaris feet and malinari was silent for a while as he considered all that he had been told but meanwhile his men were not idle two of them were at the withe door of my fathers caravan finding it barred from within they tore it from its hinges and one of them poked his head in and saw us calling out they are here my lord a youth and a girl huddled in the dark like mice the woman spoke the truth so said malinari and his voice was doomful quiet now even as quiet as the strange dark clouds circling overhead if she spoke the truth then someone has lied bring these mice to me but my father cried out my lord have mercy i beg you he is my son and the girl is his woman and andyou kept them from me said malinari silencing him with a glance i was not shown them nor asked if i wanted them you desired no mercy of me then only now like the child who steals a plum then asks if he may have one or in this case two plumsor three if we include this good brave woman he stooped and caught up melanas robe took her shoulder and drew her to her feet cover yourself he said i believe there may be a position for a hardworking woman a as an overseer of women a in malstack in starside moreover i know of a certain thrall called banos who has not taken any woman of the manse in all the time he has served me and banos has served me wellunlike several i could name he gloomed on dinu vadastra then across the clearing to where a certain senior lieutenant sat all morose astride his flyer and though melana fastened her warm robe about her still she shivered she had felt the weird cold when malinari touched her the tendrils of sentient ice that flowed from his fingers yet still she was the brave one what of my daughter my lord my beloved child still innocent despite this unworthy koraths vile embraces malinari looked at her and raised an eyebrow you should be aware he said of the thin line between bravery and utter folly im not much known for listening to complaints and even less for granting wishes but then he sighed and said first let me see this girl thisa nadia melana told him as you will malinari nodded this nadia and for that matter this unworthy korath too and his lieutenants dragged nadia and myself before him thus i came face to face with lord nephran malinari of the wamphyri are you your fathers son he questioned me eh er pardon eh pardon he mimicked me are you a cheat and a liar like your father dinu vadastra well i wasnt like my father to that extent but big and brawny i was and perhaps a little stupid too im no cheat i told him and no man calls me a liar when he moved i did not even see it but i felt his clout the thud of his backhander against the side of my head making my ears ring and knocking me off my feet well it seemed plain to me that i had offended him now it was time to die a but not without a fight i sprang up a and was at once pinioned by the men who had brought us from the caravan but struggle as best i might i couldnt shift them or throw them off and malinari he laughed saying hold still and listen you are big and handsome and you are strong as a bull shadand you are mine unworthy well maybe well wait and see if blood runs true but first theres work for you a chance to prove yourself in starside he turned to nadia youre the image of your mother but are you as brave will you come into starside of your own free will to be a vampire with your father and your mother there i have no other life lord she answered but you will have malinari told her for you shall be a stablemaid tending my flyers in their pens in malstack then in a trice in a flowing motion too fast to follow he leaned to her neck and bit her it was the work of a moment to put his life a or undeath a into her then into her mother so that swooning they collapsed on the earth and finally malinari turned once more to me held fast by his men and stiffened by my terror i could do nothing but stand stockstill like a shad in the slaughteryard with my eyes halfshuttered but no he merely wrinkled his nose at me and his lieutenants did the rest chapter twenty dark lords of starside korath mindsthrall was in jake cutters mind as surely as his own thoughts so that rather than having the story related to him it was as if jake lived it and thats dangerous said harry keogh awakening jake to his true position in the wrecked sump of the deserted romanian refuge except that wasnt the true picture either for in fact he was only there by courtesy of harrys mindlink jakes living sleeping dreaming body was airborne in a jetcopter flying east somewhere over the australian simpson desert dangerous jake said hugging his knees where he sat on a slab of concrete fallen from the ceiling watching the black waters of the sump gurgling by what is to let a vampire a even a dead one aget that deep into your mind harry answered darkly thats whats dangerous and i think our friend korath is stretching things out a hit but am telling it the way it was you have asked me to tell you about malinari the mind how may i comply without describing his deeds defining his wickedness very well harry told him thats accepted but im sure you can do it a little faster our time is limited here i shall do my best korath answered grumblingly but in any case the rest of that night is a blur for i had been bitten vampirized by malinaris lieutenants the scenesthey all flow into one in the eye of my memory perhaps i desire to forget them for what remains of them isnot pleasant and the vadastras were my people after all then he was silent for a moment or two until in a little while he picked up the thread of his story the bite of the vampire brings about a weakness a lethargy a heaviness of limbs and thoughts alike if malinari himself had taken my blood a and in the process transfused something of his essence a then i would remember nothing at all until much later but i was strong and his lieutenants were only thralls oh they were powerful men and each and every one an aspirant but they were not yet wamphyri nadia and her mother i saw them carried off towards the flyers while i reeled between the two who had recruited me and malinari seeing that i was conscious nodded his approval a of me my strength i suppose but my senses were swimming as from drinking too much brandy if one of his lieutenants had let go of an arm im sure i would have fallen theni rememberor i seem to remembermalinaris voice raised calling to my people the entire vadastra clan where they huddled at the far side of the clearing come join me he called eat drink partake of my tribute for i shall free you of tyranny this night this hated chief this dinu of whom ive heard complaint a he is no more nor shall i require any more of you from now on for i perceive that you have given enough i free you to be as you will to do as you will and to go where you will malinari has spokenso let it be and his eyes burned brighter yet as he used his mentalism to reinforce his message sending out his vampire thoughts to touch upon their minds and drugged though i was a or rather tainted with the essence of vampirism which now flowed in my veins a even i saw the pictures that malinari painted in the minds of the people indeed i may even have seen them more clearly because of that essence but by that selfsame token i knew that those pictures lied the glad bright faces of the young ones where they wandered hand in hand through the woods the campfires where musicians played their bazouras and tambours and meat roasting on spits while the menfolk clapped and young girls whirled in the dance and wheeled caravans trundling through the woods as of yore bearing a people as free as the air or at least free of nephran malinari if not the rest of the warnphyri true travellers again aye in the forests of sunsidea aand all a lie come bring your cups malinari cried come drink with me to your freedom and his men went among my people leading them to the tables laden with tribute but supported between those who had converted me with my poor sick head lolling this way and that i saw how the strange dark cloud a that cloud of illomen a was settling towards the clearing and how a ground mist was once more gathering in the earth as for my father it cannot be said that he had been a good man but where he grovelled now under the sandalled foot of a brawny lieutenantwho can say what thoughts passed through his mind one thing for sure he knew malinari for a great deceiver and his mindpictures for lies also he knew that he was done for or in malinaris own words that the hated chief of the vadastras was no more wherefore what had he to lose at least he might make a quick end of it squirming free of the lieutenants foot dinu sprang up pointed at the hovering cloud and cried he brings his warrior creatures he calls them down upon your heads he destroys the vadastras entire flee for your lives flee too late for again lord malinari was employing his mentalism and now his pictures told the truth warriors circling in the shrouding cloud held aloft on their fullyinflated gas bladders extended airscoop mantles and spiralling updraughts from sunsides night forests now they channelled gas to their propukors trimmed their mantles came sputtering and issuing their poisonous vapours descending towards the woods about the central clearing and flanking them controlling their tight aerial formation a host of manta flyers their eager thrall riders gauntleted to a man and their purpose all too obvious the tithe hah dont talk to me of tithes never such a tithe in all the history of sunside the tribute but malinari had come to claim the greatest tribute of all an entire clan the people fled coughing choking sickened by the vile exhaust fumes of malinaris warriors they fled for the forestbut again too late for the night was now a greater nightmare than ever hideous beasts were descending on the caravans and rude dwellings about the central clearing flattening them to the earth vampire thralls slid down ropes dangling from the flyers the people were surrounded there was no escape and through all of this that demon lords laughter tinging out and my father on his knees now wringing his hands and asking but why lord why tell me this is not of my doing above the thunder of raging warriors the cries of lusting lieutenants and thralls and the screams of the doomed people lord malinari heard him he swept back his robe took his gauntlet from his belt and thrust his hand into it answering your doing yours dinu do you truly think that anything you could do would be of any moment in this world because you were devious is that your meaning no you fool nothing is of your doing why there never was a supplicant chief in all sunside a from here to the furnace desert a who was not an enormous liar and cheat it is your nature even as its mine but lord if not to punish me why do you do this thing towards what end dinus jaw had fallen open his eyes were wide in a face that craved understanding and it is the provisioning malinari told him but a great provisioning my manse is a fortress where in times of peace we do well enough but soon the peace will be ended i am building an army dinu and my needs are great for in starside m a bloodwar is in the offing and bloodwars are built on blood in this case yours with which he flexed his hand inside his glove until all its hooks and blades stood out and he cried out to his men and monsters take the young and healthy alive as best you can as for the children the middlingold and the dodderers a they are fodder then to my father and you dinualas youre middlingold his gauntlet of bright metal made a downwardsweeping arc in the smoky firelight then gleamed red a dripped red a where he held it up to the reeking night almost as red as his eyes and after that i saw no more until i awakened in malstack my lords manse in starside now an aerie is an aerie and all of them much alike or at least they were in the olden times since when it seems some terrible vengeance has visited itself upon starside for i have seen the cadavers of those same vast dwellings like the skeletal spines of giants lying sprawled and broken where they fell on the barren boulder plains and only hollow stumps remaining mute revenants of castles that once were mighty however and in the time of which i speak the minds manse stood far out on the plains at the rim of that great clump of carven stacks spires and towers whereof the vampire lords were wont to fashion their homes guarding its lower levels a in the scree jumbles at its foot and in its highwalled gantletted approaches a malstack had many flightless warriors faithful only to lord malinari who was after all their father lean and hungry they were ever watchful within there were wells in the aeries basement flabby siphoneers in the stubby turret of its roof and in between all manner of levels to house malinaris men and monsters his vats of metamorphism and other workshops stables for his flyers and warriors alike launching bays barracks for the soldiers kitchens workplaces and quarters for specialist thralls such as weavers metal and leatherworkers and even musicians music aye for the mind had something of an ear for szgany tunes the stringed bazoura with its swift sweetly liquid notes was like a balm to ease the pain of his troubled head for his mentalism was all things to malinari a blessing and a bane one thing to hear the mere voices of men a when you have the power to stop them with a command or simple gesture a but something else to hear their very thoughts so clamorous loud in your mind that you must struggle not to hear them that was the curse of malinaris mentalism that it was there whether he wanted it or not that while giving it direction controlling it took a great effort of will shutting out its generally useless babble a the tumult of an entire aeries thoughts a were almost impossible and when the sun was up and the barrier mountains rimmed in gold many a sleepless day for my master if not for the musicians who laved his mind with the songs of sunside but i fear i have strayed for i was speaking of malstack and now have returned to malinari or perhaps not for this was what you wanted to learn about the mind and his ways and anyway and as ive said an aerie is an aerie and all much of a kind enough of malstack so what else can i tell you of my master as was let me think a moment his origins oh yes i know of them also for with time after i had proved myself as a thrall rising through the ranks to become a lieutenant a and when during the bloodwars i became the first of his lieutenants a we got to be close malinari and i well as close as master and slave can get and upon a time during a brief lull when we took respite in malstack i remember he said to me do you know but what is in the blood usually comes out in the flesh to which i replied master your father he said do you know how he became chief of the vadastras i was a child at the time i answered but yes i remember you made him the chief my lord and do you know why i have no idea lord several reasons one because he desired the job among szgany supplicants it takes a strong man a a man with a strong stomach a to be a chief and give away his own people two because he was big and insensitive and a bully born which i suppose is much the same as one and three because dinu was rare among men one of a small number that i could bear to converse with or rather with whom i conversed on a level without concerning myself whether or no they lied and so not caring i am trying to understand master i told him since it seemed he required an answer i divine mens thoughts malinari explained when they think against me then i amangered and when i am angered then i lose good men wherefore it sometimes serves me well not to read them and i tell you i lied to your father when i told him that his devious ways were known to me suspected perhaps but never known for a fact not until the night when that woman hed used betrayed him not that it mattered greatly the vadastras were doomed anyway fuel for my bloodwar let me make myself plain your fathers mind was closed to me as is yours mine lord indeed for what is in the blood comes out in the flesh you are heir to dinus mental processesyour minds are much alike so that your thoughts too are vague and shadowy things to me which i read as through a writhing mist oh i could get to them more directly should we say by contact with the very brain that holds them for as you are surely aware these fingers of mine are especially gifted in their own right alas but that would probably mean the loss of yet another good man that is a luxury which i cannot afford no lord i said and i admit i backed off a pace no indeed lord but malinari merely tuttutted and shook his head then winced and twitched a little as was sometimes his wont saying no no have no fear korath for while the rest of this manse of mine is filled with men and creatures a creatures with minds that make noise and babble and uproar in my bead even when all else is silent a you seem as empty as those great dark spaces out between the stars oh yes and i like you for it then in the privacy of my masters chambers we would sit and listen to his music together a and i would try my best not to think he told me of his beginnings his father was wamphyri giorgas malin who sniffed out even the craftiest of the szgany by tracking the aura of their fear he wasnt a mentalist as such a he read no minds a but he was sensitive to sentience and knew when intelligent fearfilled minds were close by he sensed the shuddering and trembling of the very brains of his prey even when they themselves were still and silent wherefore sunsides nomads feared malin worse than any other lord for despite their skill at cloaking their thoughts he was usually able to discover them in short his talent had been similar to that of his son indeed it had been the source of malinaris mentalism or it was one of the sources for of course malinari was right whats in the blood will out in the flesh but it takes two to make a bloodson a vampire born of woman and the minds mother was a szgany healer whose power was in her hands do you understand the principle she could cure the sick and the fevered by holding them stroking them by balming them with her lullabies and her loving touch ah but i see that there are such in your world toofaith healers yes and i also see that some are fakers here as in my world but illula was the real thing so hunting in sunside one night giorgas found illula the healer a who had no man for she had given her life over to her calling a and saw that she was beautiful he had heard of her the wamphyri had their spies in sunside and little escaped the notice of the starside lords however there was no requirement for a healer in giorgass manse or in any of the aeries for common ailments were unheard of among the wamphyri whose systems are so imbued with evil that lesser evils can gain no foothold i exclude of course the various mutations autisms metamorphisms and madnesses with which the great vampires were ever afflicted if afflicted is the right word for apart from lunacy a oh yes and leprosy the socalled bane of vampires a these other conditions were rarely considered illnesses at all they were simply facts of life and longevity for where men in their old age are prone to aches and pains vampires in theirs are prone to all manner of weirdness at any rate while illulas skills were of little use to giorgas her beauty a not to mention her virginity which was a rarity in females of an age even in sunside a was a sure fascination and of course he had the latter from her then had her to wife yes for giorgas wanted sons to manage his aerie and where better to get them than from a handsome woman according to lord malinari his sire was not without good looks himself which perhaps accounts for the minds darkly handsome appearance ah but the rare combination of malinaris parents talents accounted for a lot more than his merely physical attributes so illula the healer was vampirized and of course suffered the sleep of change when she awakened she was wamphyri and giorgass manse now had both master and mistress but if men should be careful in choosing their wives how much more careful in the making of vampires especially great vampires anyway illula was wamphyri and a deal of giorgass essence was circulating within her even the first nodes and filaments and foetal foulness of a parasite leech gathering to her spine to suck on its marrow that is ever the way of it but as if to compensate for such depredations the burgeoning vampire invariably accentuates the senses of the initiate not only the five mundane senses but also a when such enhancement is of benefit to the parasite any additional senses illula and giorgas shared a bed and of course being his wife now and a great vampire in her own right a she clung to him through long starside days when the spires of the tallest aeries glowed golden in the seething rays from sunside and when her lord started or moaned in his sleep then she would employ her healers hands to soothe his brow and her softcrooned lullabies to drive away whichever terrors invaded his dreams but in the twilight before the night a when despite her ministrations he would come awake showing little or no benefit from his rest a then illula would be nonplussed and lord malin he would laze around malstack as if suffering from a crippling malaisewhich he was and she was it the fault lay in her oncehealing hands her oncecalming songs her oncebalming presence for now enhanced by giorgass vampire essence and her ascension her healing powers were reversed before where illula had given life a or at least given it back a now she drew it off she battened on it likewhy like a vampire naturally for even if she would have it otherwise her vampire would not and there never was a vampire who gave of life nor would there ever be thus giorgass lifeforce was drawn from him and while he grew weak she grew strong and her vampire stronger still wamphyri aye and what a monster she would have made except that wasnt to be for she was pregnant by giorgas and on the day he died gave birth to a boy child whom she called nephran because that is the szgany word for a wrong that may not be righted and she knew that bringing this child into the world was wrong but her mothering instinct made her keep him as for his surname certain tribes used ari as an alternative to son thus instead of malinson he became nephran malinari and as he grew to a man so the strange mixture or mutation of the joint skills of both of his parents a that which had been in their blood a came out in his flesh and grew with him but unlike his fathers halfmentalism nephrans was whole and wholly monstrous and unlike illulas healing touch his was an evil lifedevouring power right from the beginning and in combination these altered talents matured into the form which made him what he was and what he still is malinari the mind his love of music he got that from his mother likewise his blinding headaches she also passed those down to him for as a healer in sunside that had been her payment a or lack of payment a for the good works she did something of the illnesses of her patients transferred to her presumably so that they might be cured but in nephran these migraines were made worse complicated by the tumultuous pounding thoughts of others well and there we have the man as for his mother as time passed illulas mind slowly slipped from heror at least the problems started with her mind but gradually she developed so many illnesses in her body boils and bruises cankers and gangrenes aches and pains and general disabilities that her vampire was hard put to keep up let her parasite cure one disorder another would spring up in its place in illulas more lucid moments she would try to explain these things away they were all the ailments she had cured in sunside now coming out in her for her capacity for good had been robbed from her and with it whatever was in her that kept these evils at bay she might have died a slow death or malinari might have seen fit to put her away but it didnt come to that illulas time was up and she knew it when her son was eighteen she gave him malstack took a flyer and flew back to sunside in the twilight before the dawn over the barrier mountains the sun found her and she and her flyer both paid their dues in smoke steam and stench well and so much for nephran malinaris beginnings with which finally korath was finished for a while at least korath youve done well so far said harry but his deadspeak voice was noticeably fainter now and before the extinct vampire could begin preening jake queried are you all right harry i amcalled to many places the other answered i can be me as a boy and as a man or i can stand off and watch myself as i was but im not much for doing whats already been done and there are places to be where i need to be a lot more completely than i am here none of which will make much sense to you i know but physically i can effect very little here except i do it through you and korath added hopefully and through me but harry shook his incorporeal head you are less than i am you can affect nothing unless someone were foolish enough to let you get too deep into his mind into his bonesa which isnt going to happen jake be warned this korath was a fourhundredy earold vampire if you should ever need to speak to him again dont open your mind to him not all the way never let him in or you could end up carrying him with you forever and jake shivered hugged himself and said dont let it worry you i cant see me returning to this place without damn good reason and the water gurgled darkly and the sump stank of nitre and stale explosives of horror and death and crumbling shockstressed concrete thenyou are finished here koraths doomful voice trembled and is this my fate to be left alone down here forever why you have not even thanked me much less pardoned me for being what i was made to be thanked you harry said his voice still fardistant and faintly echoing pardoned you how many women did you rape and vampirize when you and your master unted the szgany in sunside how many good men have you killed with your gauntlet and your bare hands agghhh korath cried and ah no dontdont remind me he pleaded that wasnt me or it was but i was driven to do these things i was driven bydriven by my by your leech harry finished it for him your leech korath and then to jake do you see what i mean nothing more devious than a vampire even when hes dead this one had developed a leech and was ready to ascend and malinari was right to recruit him for he was obviously the right stuff but he is dead now jake answered and being dead what more mischief can he possibly get up to i sometimes wonder if you listen at all harry told him can only hope youll remember some of this when youre awake lord who would want to jake replied then shivered and hugged himself tighter yet and talking about being awake a or if not awake at least out of this place a arent we just about finished here jake try to get this foxed in your stubborn head im not sure ill be back i may not be able to come back so while i am here you had better be taking in everything you can and whatever else you do remember that in future time ive seen your blue lifethread crossed by the red of vampires so like it or not one way or the other its coming and harrys deadspeak voice a despite that it was fainter yet a was so sincere so urgent and fraught that finally jake had to take note of what it was telling him with which he resigned himself yet again and said sowhats next korath isnt finished harry answered with something of a sigh a but different this time because it was a sigh of relief not one of frustration we still dont know how he a how they a ended up here weve only heard half of the story and we still dont know very much at all about vavara and szwart jake might have contradicted him for he had learned something of vavara and szwart himself from lardis lidesci before he could speak however nor are you going to know much about them not from me anyway for you are ungrateful and i have spoken my last but not your last and not nearly enough harry told him bluster all you like koratl but i say you will speak oh and are you then a necromancer after all korath queried sarcastically if so perhaps i should point out that ive neither living nor dead flesh for you to worry with your pincers and hot irons thats very true harry replied but i think i could probably find a bone or two washed clean in this pipe a if i were a necromancer but im not and anyway theres no need for you know as well as i that as little as you are now if we take our leave of you then youll be even less or is our company worth nothing in which case we must assume that you prefer this endless darkness this eternal silence and leave it at that and leave you for ever and ever after a long moment it seemed that korath sobbed but very quietly until finally he answered but youre a cold and cruel one harry keogh and harry told him ah but i had good teachers and they were vampires too so say on while you still have the chance korath and while we are still here to bear you out chapter twentyone a dark ladyand a darker lord fuelled by blood nephran malinaris bloodwars were a terrible scourge on humanity korath picked up the threads of his story for as long as he ravaged on sunside to provision fortress malstack so must the rest of the wamphyri forage lest malinaris army so outstrip theirs as to whelm them under thus the szgany suffered as never before at least not for sixty thousand sunupsa since the mythic and immemorial time of shaitan the unborns great wars before he was unseated and banished north to the icelands the minds foes were many his friends few even the latter were not his friends in the human sense of the word that sort of comradeship being so rare among the wamphyri as to be a myth in its own right but at any rate his dubious allies were vavara a lady in all but name for she would not accept that men call her lady for fear it might damage her status by making her seem less than a lord and szwart which was the only name that suited a thing such as he szwart which means darkness for indeed he was darkness literally the darkest of all the lords of the wamphyri something which i shall endeavour to explain in a little while but for now so much for malinaris allies oh there was a handful more but nephran szwart and vavara who insisted upon the status of a man despite her obvious indeed devastating feminine charms and attributes they were the generals the triumvirate the big three then there were the minds foes the enemy proper first and foremost drama doombody the most powerful of the wamphyri of that period some thirty years earlier at the pinnacle of his power drama had contracted leprosy from a comely szgany woman in whom the disease had seeded itself but was not yet manifest since when he had accepted to be known as lord doombody for of course his body was doomed no matter how long it might take the great bane of vampires to run its course as to dramals surname prior to his longterm but inevitably lethal error i have no knowledge but i do know that his aerie dramstack a one of the most massive of all the stacks a was generally avoided as a pesthole even in my time nathless before dramals leprosy began wearing on him a which is to say for the duration of malinaris war a he shared his stack with a lesser colleague lord zaddok zangastari who had the topmost ramparts and the aeries penultimate level for his own not that zaddok was in any way careless of his health but this sharing was an expedience of war since dramstack stood close to darkspire lord szwarts manse near the centre of the clump it were better that two armies occupy dramals vast aerie thus presenting a powerful front across the dividing gulf and threatening szwarts forces with a partial siege at least but as for battle tacticsi cannot admit to any great authority these things i mention were overheard and remembered from those occasions when nephrans warcouncil of three a himself szwart and vavara a met in whichever of their aeries to consider and order the ongoing hostilities so let me not stray but get on with naming names after dramal and zadok came lord belath a young lord who had just the one name with no sires name and no cognomen perhaps there was some secret in his ancestry that he did not wish divulged as for a descriptive name or device which might best characterize him a there were some who fancied him belath the beast though im certain that no one ever suggested it to his face need i say more but if belath were beastly then what of lord lesk known as lesk the glut for lesk was a young berserker only recently ascended who was given to abandon himself as totally in battle as in his gluttony easily offended he had even been known to take umbrage at his own personal warriors if they were idle in answering his call lesk would work himself into a frenzy challenge them to combat and beat them soundlybefore returning them to their basics in his vats of metamorphism and when his fury was in abeyance and his mood improved then he would find time to rebuild them all over again thus while the glut could never be reckoned one of the great schemers he was most certainly a mighty engine of destruction nor were the vampire lords alone in their awful strength and monstrous habits many of starsides ladies were certainly their peers in malign intent and a deal more devious and treacherous in their scheming vavara who took sides with malinari was only one such there were plenty of others who came close equals in malevolence for example lady jemma freydaskith of hagspire but surely the name of her manse says it all jemma was a hag and a lustier more ancient wicked and withered hag there never was similarly and where the name of her aerie describes her nature surely the ladys surname describes its origin for there was only ever one freyda among the wamphyri and that was freyda ferenc in the days of shaitan the unborn jemma freydaskith knew the myths associated with that ladys name she likewise associated them with her own peculiarities of habit a her idiosyncrasies a and so claimed direct descent from that ancient line now normally this would be disputable the wamphyri were bad recordkeepers living so long some of them history was yesterday to them they saw no point in looking back beyond their own immediate forebears but jemma was reputed to be more than seven hundred years old since no one else had memories of that primeval time who was there to dispute her claim anyway while true histories pedigrees and lineages were scarcities among the wamphyri certain myths were such as would live forever just so and the myths surrounding freyda ferenc a while the lady herself was long gone into oblivion a were of that order obviously she had been a ferenczy which in itself loaned authenticity to jemmas claim insofar as the ferenczys were present in every starside myth and legend even the most ancient of them and what with jemmas a predilections a it seemed certain that something of freydas blood had found its way down the ages to her for freyda ferenc had been gross of face and form a veritable troll with the thick skin of a trog and the fangs of a warrior men even the most powerful of lords shrank from her person since for her hideous pleasure she was known to suffocate male and female thralls alike with her sex which of itself was surely quite enough to make her a legend in her own time and a mythical figure in minebut there was more freyda was that merciful rarity a mother of vampires who when she was ripe and in her final confinement produced an hundred eggs being so depleted during the which that she withered to a wisp and expired but her spawn all save one egg was diseased and likewise died the lone surviver fused with bela manculi a szgany thrall and bela became heir to freydastack and so to the final proof of jemmas lineage if such were needed her sire had been lord bela belari or belas son a an ancient in his own right a which might well make jemma the greatgranddaughter of freyda ferenc anyway and having eschewed her fathers name freydaskith was what jemma had called herself for thirtyfive thousand sunups during which her lifestyle had more than adequately supported her claim to the noxious ancestral connection in which she revelled i have digressed yet by your silence im encouraged that i have interested youa abut on the other hand i sense your impatience too so now let me get on with it a which i would gladly except there is one more lord of that era who was or is worthy of mentionshaitan the unborn before his banishment had spread his spawn far and wide in starside and in those mythic times there were even lords who were more trog than manwhich in itself speaks of shaitans depravity but there again among the wamphyri miscegenation incest bestiality and other perversions could scarcely be considered uncommon and anyway who am i to criticize for shaitan was after all the first of all with no one to show him the way when he strayed or say him nay when he erred thus despite that he was gone his line lived on bloodsons and a few daughters bore shaitans name and likeness down the march of years and each and every one of them proud of the connection even as he had been proud in his time with a pride that knew no shame for which ultimately he had paid the price but his heirs cared nothing for that cared only that they were spawn of the spawn of shaitan the unborn the first great vampire the one true lord and sire of the wamphyri and just as the first of his vampire progeny had borrowed from their illustrious forebears name in the earliest days of starside mythology so in my time his descendants a or perhaps i should say descendant for by then there was only one of pure or direct line of descent a continued this great vanity and that ones name was shaithis shaithis was a young lord then little more than a hundred years of age but of course he could be as young or as old as he willed it simply a matter of rigidly controlled metamorphism and lord shaithis a who took no other name or sigil but deemed his titular connection a blazon and statement sufficient in its own right a willed himself forever young and handsome so he was indeed beautiful despite that he was as evil as any of the great vampires and probably more so than most of them and clever too skilled in controlling the lesser lords who were a rabble adrift and of little strategic consequence under drama doombody and not only men but shaithis was also good with monsters his vats bred many a nightmarish warrior these and other attributes of leadership were proven during the course of malinaris bloodwar of a thousand sunups so that shaithis rose even to the rank of dramal himself becoming his righthand man and equal and while many lords were lost in that holocaust of blood shaithis went from strength to strength until everyone supposed he would be a power one day and he probably was but alas i was not there to see it for my master and his allies were the losers malinari vavara and szwart they were whelmed under their great aeries sacked their possessions looted and their thralls and creatures converted well as was the way of it in those days they were banished north to the icelands forever and i korath mindsthrall my masters chief lieutenanti went with them of course as to how it happened in the beginning nephran malinari was short of friends and this had always been the case ever since his mother illula flew off into the sun and left him malstack for his own it was his weird talent that cost him the companionship of the other lords and ladies they could not trust him they even feared to be close to him who could be into their minds so easily also his stack was a mighty fortress filled with men and beasts and it was suspected that his ambitions reached beyond his station which of course they did like the ambitions of all of them who were lords for lust greed and territorialism were ever their way of life but isnt it true that a man who cannot make friends will usually make enemies and as easily as that the rumours sprang up that malinari was searching out allies and making ready his aerie for a bloodwar to rival the mythic wars of yore but when i say easily that is not to say quickly i would remind you that time is of small concern to the wamphyri and in fact the enmity that developed between the mind and the others took decades in its shaping thus when malinari ravaged among the supplicant vadastra clan on the night that i was taken and my people destroyed his terrible tithegathering venture wasnt solely of his initiation or invention lord doombody was also provisioning and likewise the rest of the vampire lords aye for the simple truth of it was that they each feared each other and fear fuelled fear do you see so naturally when the mind first observed how his mentalist talents had isolated him indeed he commenced searching out others who might also be under threat to enlist their aid nor were they hard to find the lady vavara for one but i use the term lady where she would not because i have seen and been close to her and to see herthere never was a more perfect definition of femininity though whether or no she affected her outward appearance of that i have no knowledge but i find it hard to ascribe so much beauty to nature alone yet if she was natures handiworkthen why was that work so perfected in a female of the wamphyri it is a paradox to which i have no answer so i have seen and been near her a too near and once too often for i believe it was vavara bade malinari ram me in this pipe a yet i cannot recall her clearly to memory perhaps that in itself defines her beauty that its power is such as to maze common men and no less common women but here another paradox for despite that she was that beautiful a a beguiler a gorgeous witch a sensuous sorceress a still she was unsure of herself uncertain of her beauty i can offer no other explanation for her habits that a goddess such as she was so offended by the concept of beauty in others that she could not bear it and so was wont to remove the breasts lips noses and other parts of her female thralls to make them ugly there in a nutshell we have vavara and just as my vampire world was separated in two parts that were opposites sunside and starside so was she separated her luminous exterior from the dark and swirly deeps within she was malinari the minds first choice as an ally not because he lusted after her but because he knew that certain of the other lords did and vavara had determined she would not be any lords woman nor would she ever take a man until she found one who was at least her equal in desirability an unlikely occurrence for she was the one who had described shaithis a generally considered godlike a as a mere lump of a man oh she took men be sure but they were her thralls and easily disposable in the unlikely event of complications and vavara too had heard rumours of a bloodwar in the offing and also how lesk the glut had been boasting of what he would do to her after hed sacked mazemanse her spindly fretted manyspired aerie where it stood not far from malstack and lord szwarts darkspire how he would put out her rubyred eyes to kill their fascination singe her eyebrows her long lashes and the hair of her head to make her a hag then fuck her every opening into great holes fit only for shads in the rut hah so much for vavaras beauty if lesk the glut had his way is it any wonder she sided with malinari and finally there was lord szwart but if i have found it difficult to describe vavara how then shall i portray szwart who was and still is literally indescribable for of course all three of them are extant still i see by your silence that you would have what i know despite that i know so little so be it what knowledge is mine shall be yours no more nor less as to who or what szwart is the best that i can offer a he is wamphyri but he is the essence of wamphyri distilled or filtered by the foulness of his forebears mutated beyond recognition not by nature but by necessity more leech than lord and a flythelight in the fullest sense of the word the flickering light of candles torchlight firelight a the light of manmade combustion a these are the only kinds of light his eyes can bear and even then not with complete impunity but if the light matches the fire of his eyes he is fairly safe brighter than that he knows pain and any who would give szwart painlet him first pierce himself with silver dipped in kneblasch fasten boulders to his neck slit his wrists and leap from the topmost battlements of the tallest aerie then he might be safe from szwart and only let someone declare enmity towards szwart a let him broadcast his aversions or discuss them with his peers and then have his words find their way back to the nightblack master of darkspire a and no matter who this loudmouth might be whether high or low in the wamphyri pecking order be sure that szwart would do his damnedest to put a stop to such mutterings aye and when szwart did his damnedestthere was one narkus stakis lord of narkslump a collapsed pile on the western fringe of the clump who from the onset of all the rumourmongering and sidechoosing had voiced abroad his detestation of lord szwart precisely why he held szwart in such low esteem who could say perhaps hed had wind of lord doombodys provisioning and other preparations for war and the accompanying rumour that drama intended to root out all deviants from the ranks of the wamphyri if that were a fact then the proximity of szwarts darkspire to dramats dramstack in the core of the clump would seem certain to make szwart just such an enemy for if lord doombody wished to expand territorially he must first annex darkspire szwarts gloomy shadowshrouded manse across too small a gulf of air and so and also because drama controlled a large percentage of starside power the very inferior narkus stakis had determined to side with him a whether or no dramal required him as an ally alas for him that he made known his decision especially his disinclination towards szwart lord szwart was black his aerie was black and shadowed for the most part by mighty dramstack his warriors and flyers were black and the black of night was his medium lord stakiss narkslump more a great cleft knoll than a stack proper stood in the western fringe of the cluster and low to the earth and its silhouette against the northern auroras was more a ragged hump than a fang gloom was its constant companion on the night that narkus died a great drift of cloud obscured the moon and stars and starside was never so dark the clouds sweeping north out of sunside were black and swollen in their bellies pregnant with rain that lashed at the aeries of the wamphyri there had been fantastic lightnings over the barrier mountains and the wide forests of sunside would be awash in the aftermath of the storm not a good night for raiding on the szgany not with the air full of ozone when careless flyers and riders might so easily attract hellfire from the sky to singe them and send them plummeting for which reasons most of the lords and ladies stayed to house most of them but throughout the night several watchkeepers in aeries near the western rim where they looked down on narkslumps split dome had noted how lord stakiss nightlights a the braziers within his battlements behind the merlons and embrasures and the torches in his watchtower turrets a were going out one by one as if extinguished by the torrential rains except they were still going out long after the rains were done came morning the wamphyri stayed abed while the accursed sun rose up and up to its zenith when the spires of the highest stacks were lit by its rays and manylayered curtains were drawn against its lethal heat the day passed as all days must soon it was night again and the lords and ladies up and about lights burned in all the aeries a except narkslump and slow but sure the truth became known a small handful of thrall survivors came on flyers and on foot over the barren boulder plains to neighbouring scarstack and lurelodge begging refuge from the master and mistress respectively of those middling manses a body of men flew out from scarstack to narkslump and down into its landing bays and later in the midnight hour they reported back to lord oulios the scar on narkslumps condition as they had found it also on narkuss condition as they had found him his three lieutenants and the body of his thralls word spread swiftly abroad to all the stacks of the wamphyri and now certain things were remembered from the previous night in dramstack when the rains were at their worst how the aeries desmodus colony was startled from its roost a thousand great bats all chittering and panicked for no apparent reason whirling colliding and scolding where they circled the fretted ceiling of their cavern lair and lord dramal doombody nodding in his private chambers startled awake by confused mental messages from these bat familiars a dark shadow a a stranger doubtless an enemy a has passed close by though he was cloaked in darkness we sensed him his eyes burning on dramstack they seethed and were full of hatred but dramals watchmen huddling miserably in their draughty turrets and cold stone niches and his flightless guardian warriors rumbling behind the earthworks and on the boulderstrewn approaches to towering dramstack had seen nothing but a fleeting shadow that of a cloud they said and cold wet and dull they failed to wonder why the shadow had sped west rather than north and so dramal had ordered his familiars go back to sleep you nightmared the pounding rain and lightning shook you loose from your dusty perches no stranger is come to harm me or mine in dramstack not him or his no a similar disturbance had been recorded in karl szorkalas karlspire and further west in the grounds of lady sasha lureswains lurelodge one of her earthbound warriors had reared up and buffeted ineffectually at a dark blur of a shape that fluttered to a landing just beyond the bounds of sashas demesne a in lord stakiss territory aye so to the report of them that flew from scarstack to narkslump when they returned to oulios the scar in his high place narkslump was intact as were its flyers and warrior creatures all dutifully in their places however nervous unattended and unfed vampire thralls however a male and female eunuchs and fighting men alike some twenty in all a lay dead in their beds or at their various places of duty in the walls and corridors on the causeways and in narkuss harem likewise narkus himself and his three lieutenants all dead in their quarters well narkslump was scarcely a fortress such as towering dramstack and narkus lorded it a or he had used to a over a mere dribble of men and monsters compared to the greater lords in their lofty aeries even a small invasion force if its components were stealthy and well ordered could have infiltrated narkslumps defences under cover of the storm but that wasnt the way the survivors in scarstack and lurelodge told it according to one of them a sentry on the night in question the night was dark and overcast residual rain dripped from roofs buttresses causeways overhangs i was cold wet uncomfortable in my niche and i admit that i stayed well back to avoid getting wetter still but it was also a night of shadows when i came out one time to scan abroad i looked down on the lower ramparts where a colleague was keeping watch failing to see him i assumed that he too was avoiding the worst of the drench but i did see a shadow a or i thought it was a shadow a that flowed swiftly along the walkway and disappeared into a niche then returned and continued along the ramparts a stain a blot on the stone a shadow ayebut mobile there again the clouds were fleeting and there were so many shadows and i have only a thralls eyes a lieutenants eyes might have been keener better suited but lieutenants do not guard the walls my lord stakiss eyes would certainly have noted any weirdness or peculiarity but he was in his chambers when next i looked out and down my colleagues brazier was out a hiss of steam rose up i assumed that there had been more rain or my friend had been negligent of his fire and the night was even darker my duty station was lit fitfully by twin torches ensconced under slate awnings that fended off the rain i replenished them with fresh faggots before returning to my niche and snuggling deeper yet time passed perhaps i heard a grunt or call a a gurgled cry a from the north flank but in any case i ventured out again to the northernmost point of my picket where i leaned from an embrasure to look down on the adjacent flank in the misted gloom of a landing bay there was no watchman to be seen but the steam of his extinguished brazier rose up it was time i made report but only recently recruited my vampire skills were weak i was not yet linked to my master if i cried out with my mind alone lord stakis would not hear my alert and deep within the rock he couldnt possibly hear my voice wherefore a dilemma should i desert my position and go to the lieutenant of the watch who i knew to be a very difficult man and if i did and nothing was found amiss what then i leaned out again and looked downand at once drew back for traversing the scarp directly below me a coming diagonally upwards across the treacherous rainslick face of the rock and scarcely pausing to negotiate the way a i had spied a lumpy shadow like a dark blot against the lesser darkness but did i say dark the shadow was block and where it merged with other shadows it disappeared completely only to emerge a moment later always climbing towards my battlements station now i knew to run and make report a or at least to run if nothing else but already the shadow was stretching itself groping like the fingers of some phantom hand towards the merlons between myself and the entrance to narkslumps east wing even if i ran this unknown thing would be there first perhaps waiting for me neither was there any other route of entry a nor of escape a from my position on the outer face now i am not a man to shrink from any normal darkness murky gloamings and the weird nebulosities of sunside bogs had never frightened me but this was no ordinary shadow there was something sinister knowing clever about it it moved as on a mission and in my heart i knew i couldnt stop it only let me tryit would certainly stop me but as yet it didnt even know that i was there or at least i hoped that was the case and as quietly as possible i crept into my niche drew as far back as i could go among the spiders and beetles a then farther yet until the sharp rock of the split scraped my chest and my back a and finally held still so very still there in the dark and the dust and eventually something came do not ask me what it was but it came and was a part of the darkness and while i couldnt see it i knew it was there thena indeed i am here a voice came to me like the rustle of leaves so close i felt the breath of it and it continued i see you are afraid and that is good be afraid my friend and make no outcry stay here for long and long in this tight crevice while i go about my business and i wont harm you but if you come outah that would be a brief but very unfortunate affair so then do we have an understanding i could only nod and though i saw nothing at all still the shadow saw me good it husked and spoke no more then i was alone again a and pleased to be alone a for long and long how long i cannot say but when i dared to come out i saw that my torches were expired and looking closer i saw they had been capped a put out a deliberately and not only my torches but all the lights in narkslump till tip to toe the aerie stood in darkness most utter then when i went inside i found what i found and discovered the hidyholes of a handful of others with tales to tell much like my own following whichcan you blame us that we fled that haunted place and came with all dispatch here that was the thralls story and the other survivors with him agreed with everything he said but survivors of what since the answer to korath mindsthralls final question was obvious a reply seemed unnecessary but harry keogh answered him anyway saying survivors of lord szwart of course harrys words a more definite decisive in jake cutters mind a startled him from the reverie induced by koraths narrative from what had seemed like a dream within a dream where everything that the exvampire lieutenant described had seemed as real as if jake himself had been there in another time and another world and what where jake gave himself a shake and looking all about he saw debris the buckled stanchions and shattered concrete slabs fallen from the ceiling the partlygleaming scorchscarred rim of the monitor conduit rising from the sullen swirl of dark waters that was where this fragment of the history of a vampire world had its origin that ugly pipe where korath had died the true death which still contained his bones sloughed clean and washed white by the water and jake shuddered harry sensed his unease and asked are you all right no jake answered and i dont think ill ever be all right again you will lie the other told him you have to be anyway we still arent through here i want to know more about szwart a what he is and how he came to be a and i think korath knows it all but i sense that hes slowing up holding back to which korath immediately replied and you are correct for it dawns on me that i do myself no good here when you have learned your fill what then of me no forgiveness shunned by the living and the dead alike washed away to nothing and dispersed across an alien land hah surely i can do better you are dead said harry these things are what happen to the dead in circumstances such as yours and korath answered ah cold cold no said harry not entirely merely truthful i wont lie to you that theres anything in this for you only our company for however long it lasts but korath said yet your dead converse i know for i have heard them whispering in their graves when they sense me listening then they keep quiet or exclude me so why cant they converse with me they dont like you said harry can you blame them being dead they hate death and they know that you thrived on it i did what vampires do is there no pity for you none then i have none for you korath sulked you dare to go up against vavara szwart malinari without knowing all there is to know about them good luck to you you are dead men and may think of me again some time when you lie broken or drained or minced into warrior feed then perhaps youll wish we had spoken at greater length but too late until that time youll hear no more from me he fell silent but you have no idea how weary i am of all your bluff and bluster harry told him what do you expect of me what can i possibly do for you you are dead korath you too korath answered and yet you have mobility companionshipa future my case is different said harry and as for the future i never underestimate it and jakes case his future there was a slyness in koraths deadspeak voice and harry didnt like it he wondered if he detected some hidden innuendo or more likely some kind of threat jake is a dreamer he said right now he is no more and no less hes my apprentice if you like and for the moment knows very little about such things a but he will learn and huh jake snorted even if i dont want to it seems yessss said korath and i can feel your apprehension but still harry is right and you shouldlearn if not from him then perhaps from me harry was at once alarmed you know what we want from you and thats all we want so whats it to bep szwarts origins and more about malinaris bloodwar a how you survived the icelands and how finally you came here korath sighed and said very well for i am forgiving even if you are not he was silent for a moment then sighed again and said the rest of it then chapter twentytwo survivors i cant swear to szwarts origin korath commenced the final chapter of his story i can only repeat what i heard of him in the service of my master malinari of malstack all those years ago and of course i can report what i have seen of him for he was after all malinaris coconspirator along with vavara and shared with them in their banishment when they were whelmed by the forces of dramal doombody as for szwarts visit to lord stakiss narkslump while that had occurred as a prelude to the actual hostilities obviously it was an important factor in the heightening tension between the soontobewarring parties i recall that soon after narkuss demise as angry rumblings from the aeries grew louder malinari arranged the latest of several gettogethers with his future partners vavara and szwart by then when they ventured abroad from their respective stacks all three outsiders a rejects as it were excluded or ostracized by the rest of the wamphyn a were constantly on the alert for trouble the imposition of restrictions over disputed airspace skirmishes over boundaries even ambushes were by no means unlikely but since by chance their stacks formed a close triangle in the centre of the clump and the space within that triangle was theirs flights between were generally accomplished without threat or interruption and of course the close proximity of their aeries was yet another good reason for forming their alliance back to back they presented a more formidable foe anyway szwart and vavara came on flyers across the respective gulfs from darkspire and mazemanse to meet with my master in malstack and that was the first time that i saw szwart for contrary to certain szgany campfire tales of the time lord szwart was visible when he so desired in any reasonable degree of light and when he chose to assume an acceptable form he could be seen though he much preferred not to be but in his conditionwell that was surely understandable but i sense that ive whetted your curiosity you are wondering what condition i speak of and what do i mean by acceptable form we shall get to these things so then lord szwart came from darkspire and i was sent to bid him welcome to malstack and organize the stabling of his flyer just as i had seen to vavaras when a little earlier she had arrived from mazemanse her castle of vertiginous balconies and fretted spindly spires i remember the time was several hours past sundown when only the last faint rays of a dying sun limned the peaks of the barrier mountains in gold this vestigial glimmer posed no real threat to the wamphyri in general but it was a problem for szwart who dreaded to be seen and there we have it lord szwarts fear of light wasnt that it might destroy him but that it made him visible this weird photophobia wasnt so much a physical as a mental disability which perhaps serves to explain his reclusive nature his rumoured celibacy and the fact that he so rarely went abroad from his aerie and never mingled with other than his thralls or creatures of his own device in lonely shadowcursed darkspire but it wasnt only in his mind this ugliness that szwart couldnt bear to display it wasnt merely imaginary rather it was very real and hereditary he arrived in a malstack landing bay his flyer was black as night swooping across the gulf it had been clearly visible but in the shadow of malstack it simply disappeared i stood in the gape of the landing bay waiting a and suddenly szwart was there a black shape buffeted nightblack air in my face as the shadows that were szwart and his flyer alighted then while he dismounted i called for thralls to see to his beast and looming close szwart said you lieutenant a take me to malinari his voice was a gasp a pant a flurry of wind through a narrow crevice and there he was szwart himself all cloaked in black a a blot of a figure that showed neither features nor anything else of its oncehumanity a standing before me in the flickering torchlight of the landing bay but while szwart himself was featureless carved from jet and his voice a flutter of batwings his presence was awesome as solid as the great rocks on starsides barren boulder plains and his aura in the night that was such as to make even my vampire flesh creep a and i was a lieutenant so that i could well understand how narkslumps lowly thralls had felt when confronted by lord szwart he gloomed at me through eyes like slits of fire his only parts that werent black well and am i to be left to find my own way for i was so startled i had made no effort to attend him no lord i answered i am your guide but here in malstack protocol demanded that i stood silent until commanded by you fool he said i did so command you and now take me to malinari or perhaps i strike you asodd in some weird way is it so with which he flowed closer and his outline became less manlike even more a blot or a shadow like a lump drifted from the darkness in the unlit deeps of malstacks basement not at all lord i backed off i was simply in awe of my masters honoured guest a so much so that my tongue clove toto the roof of myof my mouth it was scarcely a lie you must consider yourself fortunate that you still have a tongue szwart whispered withdrawing something that was not quite a hand from where it had been reaching for me also fortunate that my protocol forbids the killing of an allys lieutenant on his home ground yes lord i bowed and before things could go even more awry turned and forced my numb legs to bear me in the direction of my masters chambers lord szwart followed on behind me and i could feel him there silent intense and seething though i fancied it wasnt his thoughts that seethed so much as his person perhaps it was so i cant rightly say for i never looked back when szwart left i was there to see him go though on this occasion there was no contact when the keeper of malinaris pens handed him the reins of his flyer i was situated in a window a little higher in the sheer wall of the aerie from there i watched him mount launch and fly away aye and i also saw his manlike outline melt to a liquid blot of a shape that hunched down and became one with the silhouette of his black flyer and i saw the burning eyes a but far too many eyes a that gazed back on malstack from that hideously humped shape as if their owner suspected that someone watched then he was off and flyer and rider both black on black disappeared into the yawning gulf like a scrap of burned cloth or a tattered pennant slipped from its staff fluttering on the winds that whine around the aeries of the wamphyri that same time having seen szwart off from malstacks lofty premises i returned to my master and the luminous vavara a the very opposite of szwart a where they continued to talk in malinaris private chambers in his absence szwart had become the subject of their conversation hearing his name mentioned and because my interest had been piqued however morbidly i slipped back into the shadows and listened it was in his blood malinari was saying and what is in the blood always comes out in the flesh a or in szwarts case what passes for flesh and he went on to explain seventy years ago a a little before your time vavara a szwart was born to a lord and lady of the wamphyri that alone would make him an exception to the general rule for as you are well aware when the time is right the wamphyri transfuse their eggs to make eggsons or daughters or we take szgany women a er forgive me or men a and so beget bloodchildren but its rare that a lord will take a lady to wife or vice versa rarer still where lord szwart is concerned whose father was also his mothers brother incest a not so strange among the wamphyri but incestuous marriage between twins to find a reason you must look back in time but not too far szwarts grandsire his bloodgrandsire was cursed with a certain disorder which our kind dont care to mention oh as a skill a a fearsome talent a we mention it with pride but when it runs amok then it becomes wnmentionable metamorphism aye but note my voice is hushed such matters are not to be spoken of lightly before he knew that this weirdest and most loathsome of diseases was upon him lord szwarts grandsire got twins out of a szgany girl brother and sister they grew up in their sires aerie a mittelmanse as it was then named for its proximity to the centre a and ascended they were wamphyri by then their fathers curse was known to all and sundry he had practised his metamorphic flux beyond reasonable bounds putting too great a strain on a leech which finally rebelled or went insane whichever his flesh was out of control once in a thousand years this will happen that instead of remaining symbiont and host a two mutually dependent creatures in one body a the flesh of both mingles and a resultant thing emerges as a mindless loathsome hybrid but the process was a slow one the lord of mittelmanse was not immediately a madman and knew as well as his children what was happening to him the horror of it played on his mind as his flesh gradually succumbed he would come shrieking awake from nightmares to find his limbs like ropes draped all about his room or he would wander abroad in his sleep to trap and convert his own loyal thralls by means of absorption and assimilation instead of the blood whole bodies were the life and he grew gross when at times his flesh was soft as mud and at others horny and corrugated and even his colour was changed a no longer that of undead flesh but the mottled and leprous hue of the leech and when he was lucid he made his children promise that they would not spread this thing abroad great vampire that he was and malicious still he would not wish this on another man or creature for he knew what was in his blood and in theirs and that given the opportunity it would out wherefore it must not be given the opportunity the twins grown up now planned to put their father in a pit for according to the lore or history of starside a what little has ever been recorded a that was usually the best way or they could kill him out of hand by trapping him in an inescapable place and setting fire to him before he became totally ungovernable but it didnt come to that fond of flying he formed an airfoil and flew out upon the gulf one night this involved of course a great effort of will a which he relaxed perhaps deliberately high over the boulder plains and thing that he was his immediate devolution into something less than airworthy was instantly fatal he fell like a stone and even protoplasm will only stretch so far so much for him his sibling children made a pact they would not go with others to spread the curse abroad but cleave to each other and so keep the thing to house and all the while year after year they lived in fear that it might be in them too a which indeed it was but because they kept their flux under strict rein and used it sparingly the curse skipped their generation a only to emerge in the next it came out in the young szwart aye having been suppressed in his parents the vampire essence they passed down to szwart was of an entirely different order how best to explain when a man is born blind his remaining senses may develop more fully in order to compensate for the loss in szwarts parents the normal functions of their vampire leeches had been suppressed a which served only to magnify the essence that they passed down to szwart szwarts will has kept him sane within limits but he is a totally devolved creature he sleeps alone to ensure that no bloodson of his will carry this thing into the future his ugliness is such that men might easily go insane if they saw him in the worst of his myriaddesigns tonight he maintained something of a manlike outline in order to be here with us but normally he cant bear to be seen which is why he shuns light and companionship this last is no great hardship we wamphyri were ever loners but let any man speak out against him as a freak a or shrink from the horror of him a its as if his phobias were reinforced and despite that he knows his ugliness well enough knows the truth of it still he will kill the offender if only because his action or reaction reminded him of his infirmity and vavara said yet you say hes not mad not yet malinari told her though it must come eventually perhaps in a hundred years or fifty or maybe less but he was here tonight you saw him he reasons i have seen him yes vavara answered and his reasoning is as warped and fluctuating as his flesh he looked like a mad thing to me or close enough have it your own way my master told her but if he is a mad thing then for the moment hes our mad thing also hes the lord of darkspire commander of men and monsters and darkspire guards our flanks then for a while they were silent until vavara inquired what of his parents the incestuous twins szwart was born beautiful and seemed perfect malinari answered at seventeen he ascended and at eighteen his father found him in darkspires desmodus colony hanging with the bats from the fretted ceiling a but hanging in flaps and folds like a blob of dough such as the szgany use when baking their bread in his gluttony he had absorbed a great many bats before falling asleep father and mother both they tried to trap and burn him he trapped and burned them so the story goes my advice never treat szwart with disdain because he is not pretty and as for his quirks we are wamphyri and we all have quirks a even you vavara or so ive heard it rumoured but with the exception of our mutual enemies no one takes us to task over our littleidiosyncrasies as for szwart who is our ally neither slight nor scorn him and dont underestimate him either korath had been silent for some little time perhaps he brooded on the past whatever harry prodded him with a thought korath and he responded with a grunt huh my time fare grows short now and jake isnt far from waking weve come a long way in more senses than one but were by no means finished when i go your contact with jake goes with me then you will be alone if you ever want to hear from us again afor who knows we might yet find some mutual benefit in renewed contact a then youd fast get on with your story but make it as brief as possible heres how it goes malinari and the others they lost their bloodwar and were banished then for four hundred years you survived the icelands and eventually returned to starside and finally you came fare thats the story now fill in the details and korath answered ah but the details may take a little longer but not too long said harry as for jake this time he voiced no complaint he was so into starside now a koraths story had so intrigued him a that he wanted to know the rest of it no matter how ugly it might get and very well said korath then lets be done with it so then malinari vavara and szwart they were made out to be the weird ones the freaks the outsiders but in fact they were no more freakish than many of the lords and ladies in the camp of dramal doombody ah but lord doombody had problems of his own for the time being it seemed he had his leprosy under control true but what of the future even a man as mighty as dramal has his limits and likewise his vampire leech he knew it was time to consolidate his position against a dubious future when he might become weak and vulnerable since his aerie towered close to the centre of the clump dramal had resolved to annex all of the neighbouring stacks and so make them his own or at least give them to allies with whom he had unbreakable pacts this way a as he became less capable over however long a time a he would be surrounded by friends as opposed to enemies and there in a nutshell we have the real basis of what was falsely termed malinaris bloodwar in fact it was forced on the mind and the other freaks by dramal himself anyway my master and his allies were determined to make a good long fight of it and they did briefly then malinari vavara and szwart they set to and strengthened their earthworks in starsides bottoms and manned them with every sort of vicious atrocity from their vats the triangle of barren earth accommodating their aeries became their first line of defence as for the stacks themselves malstack wasnt altogether impregnable but still malinari felt fairly secure the landing bays and walled ledges were few and well defended and the gantlet approaches terrible in their severity over every possible avenue of invasion corbels carved in the likeness of vomiting warriorheads threatened boiling piss and flaming tar vavaras mazemanse was more problematic but it had good points as well as bad in silhouette the aerie looked like the roof of an ancient cave upended with spindly stalactites going up instead of down causeways and buttresses stretched between and various levels were roofed over with timbers out of sunside and slate tiles from the scree slopes of the barrier mountains towards the centre the many rock spires were joined by massive mortared walls to form the bulk of the aerie externally radiating ribs of timber the boles of sunside ironwoods supported slate rooves and timbered battlements and boulder walls built by ancestral inhabitants protected the whole from attack up the sliding scree shambles of the bottoms when the war came mazemanse suffered its greatest damage from aerial warriors driven to crash headlong into the delicate outer spires thus bringing them down on the inner walls causeways barracks and other habitations smallminded such creatures as were crippled in these deliberately contrived collisions would then sacrifice themselves by smashing down on roofs to break them in sometimes this worked but on many occasions the roofs were false and hid needle spires or stakes of mountain pine impaled warriors would then be set on fire and fried in the fiery jets of their own gasbladders their molten fats and noxious liquids would be drained off as ammunition for the castles corbel chutes szwarts darkspire proved the most obstinate of dramals targets and szwarts men the most furious fighters for there was something of szwart himself in all his creatures his warriors in the stony rubble at darkspires foot were nightblack things that could not be seen by footsoldiers until too late his men manning the gantlets never retreated but fought to the death others where they fed the corbel chutes a in the event that blazing fluids or whitehotboulder ammunition should run low a would hurl themselves down on the invading hordes rather than quit the machicolation such dedicationbut a rather simple explanation men and monsters both they had been given a choice deal with the enemy or be dealt with by szwart well there you gothe picture i paint is inadequate but you require that i make a speedy end of it we fought well but a losing battle three stacks against the combined might of starside still i suppose it had to be avarice bloodlust and territorial expansion such things are life itself or undeath or the true death to the wamphyri but at least we were spared the true death had we died in battle then that were something else but we didnt when the end was inevitable and we huddled in the blazing bulk of malstack a szwart blinded by the fires vavara smudged bloodied and wilting and malinari almost mindless from the sheer force of the telepathic demands he had made on his last few defenders a finally dramal called for our surrender what else could we do but accept following which and in short order we were spat upon buffeted generally humiliated and banished we were allowed one small warrior for escort our flyers and a handful of lieutenant and thrall survivors that was all not much by way of a retinue but beggars cant be choosers and so we headed north for the icelands at first a distant shimmer and then a hazy grey blanket that flickered on a horizon warped by weaving auroras and icechip stars and from the moment of setting out not one of us knew if we would make it or plummet into some frozen ocean and drown but make it we did below us the landscape changed however slowly first the bitter whiterimed earth then the bluegrey lakes whose cold and sluggish waves seemed to crawl to shore finally the endless white drifts that went on and on as far as the eyes could see sprawling ever northwards the snow wasnt entirely strange to us we had seen it before however rarely on the higher ridges of the barrier mountains a but never like this no earth showed through we could not know if we crossed land or icedover ocean deeps we fed ourselves and our beasts on the blood and flesh of great white bears a and only occasionally on thralls a and forged on we had no other choice if we tried to sneak back into starside that would mean the true death for all of us it was hard when there were no bears we sipped sparingly from the stoppered spines of our flyers one of vavaras lieutenants let his greed get the better of him when his exhausted flyer spiralled down to an icy hummock we followed him down to feed we fed on him too for without his flyer he wasnt going anywhere another time a blizzard came up we could not afford the energy required to climb above it landing we sheltered behind the bulk of the warrior one of malinaris then it was that my master took from me a took more than was good for me so that i was weakened but at the same time i received of his strong vampire essence which helped in my survival a the tenacity of the great vampire aye where the auroras soared highest we came upon mountains a lesser range than the barrier mountains of sunsidestarside a and never a tree to be seen a but with crags gulleys and icecastles even rivers of ice frozen in position on the mountain slopes and if nothing else the endless boredom of our passage over this white wilderness was broken but we were broken too and exhausted we put down worst hit by the journey malinaris warrior was ready to give up the ghost we saw to it that the beast didnt go to waste only its bones would be left where for a while its ribcage would form the frame of an icehouse that we would build but before then while still the warriors shrivelled flesh provided sustenance we had time and strength for exploration to the south a crack of fuzzy light showed on the horizon sunup on sunside so faint and distant that even szwart made no complaint and making use of what little warmth it brought the four of us a szwart and vavara malinari and myselfa flew off to investigate the range of icedraped mountains my master and i we headed west vavara and szwart went east when total darkness crept in again and the writhing auroras returned we would join up and make report at the carcass of the warrior the rest of our men and beasts would live off the carcass until we got back in the bitter cold the warriors meat would keep for long and long we flew for many a mile malinari gaunt where he sat tall in his ornate saddle only a wingspans distance from my own flyer gaunt and silent aye so that i wondered what he was thinking a perhaps that he was hungry and that he had had enough of stinking warrior meat and indeed the mind was thinking though mercifully his thoughts were not of me no for i could feel them probing out and ahead of us searching for other lives in this white waste and he pointed and called out to me that way an ocean where mighty fishes cruise the deeps only surfacing to break the thin ice and breathe but these are great hotblooded things and never a szgany hook and line that could pull them forth then he shook his head and said this place a this land these mountains at least a are cold and barren and yet and he frowned master i said something he answered still frowning something up ahead and in another mile or sosmoke a distant puff several puffs and a smudge going up and still we flitted across the windcarved icecastles and frozen fangs of the mountains but now malinaris concentration was rapt on that column of firesmoke rising ahead i saw what he saw or so i thought a firemountain black against white where the snow had melted from its flanks then suddenly malinari hauled on his reins rose up and to one side and climbed in a spiral i quickly joined him but when i might have questioned him a or rather as my mind framed its concern a he held up a hand to silence me and now his mental probes were venting in such powerful bursts from malinaris mind that i could hear his questions which he asked of some unseen other who are you in the mountain there what do you here is this your territory and if so by what right by right of conquest or simply because you are here and the answer came back with such force in such a doomful cadence that we knew my master and i this was no middling intelligence or power which he had discovered it is my territory because it is mine that is my right if you dispute it then come on by all means i have creatures to shatter you in pieces or go away and i shall perhaps leave you in peace a and in one piece as to who i am i am who i am as to what i was i was the first even though i may not be the last i have been here a thousand years which is my sole right to this place and sufficient so begone then with a hiss malinari ceased all telepathic sendings and i felt his guards go up as he turned and gazed wideeyed at me i know him he said his jaws agape something of him is in all of us and for a moment that was all he said then i spied a pair of great white bears at the edge of a frozen lake they had broken a hole in the ice and were fishing in the black water i pointed them out to malinari and he took us down to hover over our prey the bears startled by our sudden arrival took to the water and vanished under the ice malinari was quick to dismount he waited at the hole until one of the bears lifted her head then my master struck a struck with the strength of three or four men a and his gauntlet crushed in the bears ear and the side of its head brained the huge creature was dead in the water we dragged it onto the ice in time to see the bears mate surface this time in the moment before malinari delivered his devastating blow the great white beast roared its fury and raked his forearm containing his pain my master wrapped his torn limb then as we ate bearheart while our flyers sipped blood he said my wound is slight and it will heal quickly his wont ever the strongest survive you are a strong one korath and quicksighted so you survive if you had not seen these bears perhaps you would not survive for i wish to stay here a while to explore these icecastles and blood and flesh are the fuels i burn if not the flesh of bears what then and his red eyes gloomed on me understanding him well enow i deigned not to answer and explore we did but what we found korath my master said as we entered an iceencased cavern before i sensed the greater power in yonder firemountain a if it is a living firemountain for i fancy the smoke is of mans making rather than natures a i sensed lesser thoughts dreamier thoughts from this frozen cave aye and from others near and far who sleeps i wonder in such places we soon found out locked in the ice where he had frozen himself solid a completely encased indeed buried in the clear ice a we found the muchreduced body of what was once a lord of the wamphyri wrinkled he was his skin as white as snow whose deep corrugations were like some strange pale leechs and so we knew that he had been here for long and long but strangely his eyes were open however glazed over and here we have one such dreamer said malinari and even his voice was hushed in this cold and echoing chamber except he doesnt so much dream as nightmare a dreamer master i said but surely he is dead eh he raised a scornful eyebrow where is your faith korath is it likely that nephran malinari is mistaken and for that matter where is your faith in the wamphyri in their tenacity their longevity i heard this ones thoughts i tell you a and i sensed his fear no he is not dead now look there i looked where he pointed the ancient sat behind twelve or fifteen feet of ice but level with his ribs a row of holes some two to three inches in diameter had been drilled a third of the way through to him on the floor the accumulated ice chippings were heaped into small mounds directly beneath the holes and malinari said i dont think we need puzzle over the look of horror on his face something has been busy here doing its best to get at him but this ice is centuries old and hard as iron and he chose his niche well when it is time to freeze ourselves a when our food is used up a we must do the same time toto freeze ourselves i repeated him he looked at me in this cold place only one way to survive the centuries like this one we go down into the ice but first we put some distance between and like a fool i repeated him again between but he only nodded musingly and said between ourselves and shaitan aye a thousand years ago and more he was banished here and now lives in that firemountain others like this one who came before or since have found their own ways to live out the years they sleep in the ice but shaitan is awake can you doubt it was a creature of his did this drilling well he has the mountains warmth and shelter and no doubt defends it with just such beasts as did this and here we are starvelings with just one dead warrior to sustain us so its the ice for us be sure but not here not this close to shaitan in his firemountain following which we returned to the bears and loaded their drained carcasses aboard our flyers then flew back to rendezvous with vavara and szwart malinari told his colleagues what we had found he convinced them that indeed shaitan the unborn held dominion in the west and they agreed however reluctantly with his longterm plan of survival as vavara pointed out we shall only know if we are successful when we wake up and if we dont we werent the warrior lasted some little time while we gradually stripped the flesh from its bones eventually its flensed ribs formed the framework of an icehouse which in the next blizzard became one with the landscape but towards the end malinari vavara szwart and the others were weary of all this and ready for iceencasement meanwhile they had explored the local terrain discovering an icecavern that suited their purpose there in a niche broad at the front narrowing to nothing in the rear we positioned ourselves in front the three lieutenants then the flyers all in a huddle and behind and beneath their shielding wings malinari and his wamphyri colleagues myself i was positioned on a ledge overlooking the rear of the niche so stationed the lieutenants would be the first to feel any exploratory stab from outside the ice with any luck their physical agonies would transfer mentally and be heard by malinari he and the others might then be able to melt themselves free by will aloneif they retained sufficient strength but the surest way to remain alive and intact down all the unknown and unguessable years to come would be to fashion such an iceshield as could not be broken into and looted to this end the wamphyri trio willed a mist like none before it swirled up from the icelayered floor down from the festoons of jagged icicles in the caverns roof out from the crystallized walls but mainly from their own pores and drawn down by their massed will to where we sat in our places the mist solidified to form layer upon layer of ice thick and thicker far than the sheath we had seen in the hideyhole of the ancient for long and long i watched it forming a until my eyes were frozen and i saw no more we woke up the ice was melting and the airwas wanner still cold but warmer two lieutenants were dead a the true death aye a and three flyers well the third and last lieutenant barring myself was useless without a mount he was szwarts man and though his blood was pale and slow still it floweduntil szwart stilled it forever then the three great vampires drained him and i had my fill of his shrivelled flesh shrivelled desiccated sunken in such was the case with all of us our flyers too but at least we lived and the great cave dripped with running water and outsidea such a transformation over the far southern horizon a glow as was never before seen from the icelands it could only be the sun but visible in the sky however low to the horizon malinari and vavara felt its rays at once not so much a burning as a severe irritation it was the great distance and the dimness of the glow through a mist over the ocean but it must be said that lord szwart suffered until he covered himself in his robe averted his eyes and retreated into gloom his suffering was more mental than physical i fancy there were bears in some profusion many with cubs and even a fox or two snowy white where they scavenged for sprats at the waters rim and great fishes as big as warriors spouting in the sea more than sufficient of food said malinari to fuel us on our journey home and szwart wanted to know what has happened here a freak in the weather my master told him it is the only answer and it is our freedom to return to starside we were banished said vavara who had been a hag but already was regaining much of her former beauty aye long and long ago said malinari and he took her down to the icehouse in the ribs of our longextinct warrior gnawed on by bears wolves foxes whatever its bones had collapsed to nothing and lay flat to the cold slurry and a hundred years said malinari or two or three a or maybe more and our enemies in starside killed off by now in their bloodwars and that diseased old tyrant dramal doombody by now he is no more sloughed away to rot and ruin but we the forgotten of starside go on we are survivors vavara and we shall return and we did but before then we flew west to explore shaitan the unborns firemountain this was only made possible by his absence malinari no longer sensed his presence in the extinct volcano and the smoke of his fires no longer rose up we found mighty vats of plasma once frozen they were now rancid crawling with maggots and gave offence these and other signs of fairly recent habitation told of a being not long moved on it seems that he too has returned into starside was lord szwarts opinion but be that as it may we never found him there chapter twentythree nathans war in the sump of the oncerefuge harry keoghs deadspeak voice once again startled jake from the weird reverie induced by korath mindsthralts story youve done well korath and we are almost finished now harry said almost the vampire answered gloomily by now perhaps resignedly what more can you possibly want of me well we know what you failed to find when you returned to starside the exnecroscope or rather his revenant a or better still this facet of him a answered you didnt find shaitan or any others of the wamphyri and you certainly didnt find their aeries instead you found the hollow stumps of those oncegreat stacks which you your master and us colleagues were obliged to use as temporary dwelling places then once again you commenced raiding on sunsides szgany you can take it from there but it scarcely seems worthwhile korath protested for it appears you already know it all not all of it how didmalinari and the others fair on sunsidefor instance we would like to know how the szganywelcomed them also we want to know what made those three great vampires desert starside risk their necks by venturing into the illomened subterranean gate and come here and since you were involved who better to ask very well korath grated his patience all but used up if it would please youa ait would harry told him and it would serve to keep us here a while longer at least then with a sigh korath put the finishing touches to his tale we flew home to what had been our home you are correct the aeries were gone like vast stone corpses fallen on the barren boulder plains and arriving in the hour before sunup we were obliged to find shelter in their shattered stumps the desmodus colonies were still there and we found ourselves greeted by descendants of the descendants of our former familiars at least they were the same and like the bats themselves we sheltered from the sun in their lowly crumbling caverns in the echoing basement levels of the shattered stacks night came and with it the fear that perhaps the szgany were no more that they too might have succumbed to whatever disaster had befallen here but when we flew to the higher ridges of the barrier mountains and looked down on sunsidea aah but the szgany were there and in such numbers their campfires a and in many cases more permanent town or settlement fires a lit the night like so many glowworms in the dark of forests which in our time had not seen so much as a nightlight but only the telltale smoke of cottage or caravan stoves and here they were all joyous juicy and fearless our beloved szgany of sunside the sounds of their music drifted up to our keen vampire ears and the smells of their cooking a and of them a to our wide straining nostrils ah that was a beautiful moment and malinari said the wamphyri are gone we three alone of all the great vampires survive do you see vavara we are survivors the only survivors and so i was right and now we go down whispered szwart to the feast but ah no not so said the mind holding up a cautionary hand those tribes down there they do not know we are back if we raid here now then they will know and next time will be that much harder but we have aeries to build and furnish lieutenants and thralls to recruit warrior creatures and flyers to breed in our vats a hah when we have first discovered or dug vats in the wreckage of those shattered stumps also you must ask yourself what happened here did the wamphyri destroy themselves or were they destroyed and if the latter by whom the szgany ah no lord szwart having survived the icelands i am in no great hurry to show myself here for my thoughts have gone out and found an odd sense of security and freedom in the szgany why they are unafraid perhaps because they no longer have reason to be afraid which in turn might mean that we do wherefore we must be cautious and first discover the secret of these changes in the scheme of things so what would you suggest szwart hissed that we sit here all night and admire their fires malinari shook his head those tribes down there closepacked in this central area of sunside if we raid on one then by morning all of them will know and we need time to reestablish ourselves so this is what we will do tonight we split up vavara raids in the far west you in the east but this side of the great pass i shall raid beyond the pass and we glut aye but mainly we recruit a we recruitfuriously taking as many as we can we share our spoils equally building together allies by circumstance as we have always been this way gradually we shall discover whats what here how things stand and why they seem so different now is it agreed after some small haggling it was so agreed and as malinari had decreed we recruited furiously we converted men into thralls from whose ranks we chose lieutenants these were soon able to make more thralls a and so on and we stockpiled drink and foodstuffs out of sunside and put a task force to work digging in the rubblestrewn stumps of the old fallen stacks building walls around our chosen habitations and roofing them over during all of this construction occasionally our workers would uncover vats gasbeast chambers or cocooned matter from yesteryear of course the greater mass of the onceliving material was putrid no longer usable some of it however contained a spark and was digestible assimilable by newer fresher material out of sunside and so we progressed but time passed and word of our presence also passed a from tribe to tribe and clan to clan a until all the peoples of sunside knew that the wamphyri were back in starside it didnt take long say ten or twelve sundowns meanwhile we had recruited some eight hundred men women and children moreover deep beneath the foundations of a toppled aerie our workers had discovered a cache of wellpreserved metamorphic liquids requiring little more than imprintingaan infusion of essence and a few nodes of rudimentary intelligence a to stimulate growth and now we could fill the vats with vampiric life first we made flyers successfully and later we tried for warriors but that was when the trouble started it was a tribe known for its aggressive nature in the olden times and no less ferocious now the szgany lidesci whose territory lay midwest of sunside in fertile forests under cavernriddled foothills apparently the lidescis had found a hero a youth or man called nathan kiklu who had ventured into forbidden places and returned with awesome weapons it was a story we heard over and over again from thralls recruited in sunside how this nathans brother had been wamphyri a lord nestor of an aerie so mighty it could only have been dramstack or whatever it was called in his time a and how he had contrived to hurl his szgany sibling into the helllands gate well the gate was a legend in our time it had been used as a punishment and no man or creature who entered banished into the white glare of the starside gate had ever returned to tell of his adventures but that was then and this was now and for a certainty this nathan was extant all too soon we would begin to experience his works at first hand he was of the szgany lidesci no longer nomadic the lidescis had built a sprawling town or fortification called settlement and the first time we raided on them a which was also the last time a ah but then we discovered the meaning of awesome weapons our warriors a which were far more complicated constructs than flyers a were not waxed as yet we went in with a force of flyers and thrall riders and a handful of lieutenants to guide the men into battle except it wasnt planned as a battle but a rout when the szgany would flee and we would pick off the hindmost vavara and malinari between them made a mist but be that is it may the mist rolled down out of the foothills to swallow settlement whole we could see the fitful glow of the lidescis communal fires deep in its clammy heart then our flyers launched and settled towards the townand flew straight into the teeth of hell fortunately we leaders were not in the forefront of this offensive instead alerted by my master who was suspicious we had held back to observe the initial lidesci reaction for when malinari had sent his telepathic probes deep into the mist over settlement he had sensed something strange a a mental silence an awareness a threat and he was right the night came alive with deafening explosions brilliant flashes of light and shrill screams a not szgany screams these were the shrieks of our thralls and the hissing deathcries of stricken flyers and echoing up to us from settlements wooden walls came sharp spitting cracks of sound one after the other like stones breaking in a fire or saplings snapping in an avalanche and great dazzling balls of fire came soaring up out of the mist into a body of flyers that was still descending wherever they hit destruction followed flyers bursting into flame and blazing thralls leaping from their saddles and finally more aerial fireballs this time aimed at us where we looked on in utter disbelief from our safe foothills ridge then enough and uttering a curse szwart spurred his mount aloft and climbed into the night a true flythelight he had seen and suffered all he could bear now he retreated from the blinding flares of manmade fireballs malinari and vavara they used wamphyri mentalism to call off what handfuls remained of our forces many of whom were too badly damaged to make it back across the barrier mountains into starside and as that sorry scorched and blistered rabble came limping through the mist a glad to escape from the roil and the reek a so we launched and rose on sulphur thermals and headed for home and for the surprise of our lives as we fell towards the triangle of rubble wherein we had commenced to build our new empire we saw what could not be a such devastation our central gasbeast chambers blown asunder and their occupants in tatters all strewn about exploded in the blast of their own gases and warrior vats ablaze with liquid fire that burned blue to melt the mewling monsters and even as we circled overhead in stunned amaze a thunderous explosion that tossed shattered vampire thralls and debris aloft over the battlement walls of one of malinaris unfinished constructions bursting the walls themselves outwards with its force we landed hurriedly in unaccustomed disarray and without ceremony my master and his colleagues hurled themselves in their fury upon those thralls who had been left behind to mind our works but before a single question could be fired a single thrall executed ho there a strange voice from on highabut not the harsh tones warning growl or threatening hiss of the wamphyri no this was the voice of a young man and entirely human he stood on the ledge of a shattered stump his back to the sheer rock wall there was no way up from his position and none down not without he encounter the wamphyri or their lieutenants and thralls and he was tall but slight with nothing of the bulk of a vampire or the leaden look of a lord he was quite literally a man a szgany who are you said malinari this nathan perhaps and is this your work if so you are a dead man i felt my master concentrating the waves of animosity beating out from him to enter the strangers mind and befuddle it but young as he was and obviously mad he only smiled a knowing smile shook his head and said ah no my mentalist friend a my mind is shielded and if maglore the mage could not get to me what chance have you and youre right i am nathan and this is my work nor have you seen the last of it malinari gestured thralls crept towards the broken stairway that led to nathans position he glanced at them saw them coming appeared to ignore them meanwhile the voluptuous vavara had stepped forward she was almost physically aglow and issued her ultimate aura of feminine allure her mouth blew a kiss and a promise in nathans direction she smiled up at him on his ledge a the knowing smile of a whore yet one to cut into a mans soul if he had one a and lit the night with the lustful heat of her jewelgreen crimsoncored eyes tipping back her hood and opening her collar she shook out her raven hair then let her long batfur cloak fall open her blouse was a simple band of cloth crossing from shoulder to waist cupping one breast and leaving the other bare her flesh was marble in moon and starlight and that proud naked stifftipped breast shone with the oils she used she twirled to send her skirt of ropes flying then came to an abrupt halt tantalizing she stood with her cloak poised on the air and the ropes of her skirt outflung her sturdy legs were spread wide thighs like pillars buttocks as round as an apple darktufted in its dimple where the stem has been plucked and a leaf or two remain and i stood there drooling my lust for i had grown just such a stem as might replace it then vavaras cloak floated back into position and she was covered but the picture stayed printed on every eye i felt my blood pounding i might myself have rushed upon her a to my doom a but malinaris hand was on my shoulder he held me back and this tall pale szgany whelp this nathan he looked down on the priestess of lust looked down on vavaraand curled his lip vavara was astonished she felt her aura repelled as this mere man scorned her saying as for you you should know that i have been tempted by real ladies my mind is closed to you no less than to the mentalist there and by the way i know all of you you vavara malinari and szwart you were legends and now you are reality come back from the icelands but if i were you i would return there and now theres nothing for you here but the true death and like my father before me who brought down these evil stacks to shatter into pieces on the boulder plains so shall i bring you down that is my vow as a man of the szgany lidesci through all of this szwart had melted himself to a dark shadow on the strewn rubble now flowing like a black and sentient lichen a a living stain a he moved towards the crumbling stairway by now too malinaris thralls had climbed halfway up which was as far as they would ever get and you szwart said the youth from on high perhaps fifty feet up the stony skeleton of that ancient stairway do you think to sweep over and devour me as the legend goes you are akin to the night and can disappear into it but you and i know that men a and monsters a cannot simply disappear its true szwart isnt it while he spoke he took something from his szgany jerkin twisted it in his hands lobbed it down to bounce from step to step and he said well perhaps its true for you at least but as for me i must be on my way you may not see me but youll definitely be hearing from me so saying he stepped back into the shadows where the wall angled lord szwart flowed over the top of the wall where nathan had stood and onto the ledge from which hed taunted all three of the wamphyri szwarts darkness gathered there shifting and seething then rolled on into the selfsame shadows that hid the madman from view and i knew that it was the end for nathan kiklu whoever he had been lord szwarts protoplasm would envelop him its strange metamorphic acids would work on him he would shrink devolve and dissolve to become one with nights master or rather his liquefied flesh would add to szwarts bulk for a while until it was converted into fuel the eggshaped item that nathan had thrown bounced again into the group of three climbing thralls and there it exploded in a flash of light as bright and momentarily brighter than the sun itself light heat and a blast of alien energy that lacerated the flesh of the unfortunate thralls and blew them off the stone stairway down into the rubble they were in pieces dead before they hit bottom and szwart hissing and shrieking reeling on the high stairs where he tried to regain his manshape failed and collapsed again to a slithering stain all of this shocking aye but none so much as what lord szwart called out to us as finally he reformed shaping himself into an airfoil and launching in search of some nightdark place in which to regain his composure he was not there he shrilled he is not here no man that one but a ghost perhaps the spirit of all the szgany we ever took in our lives all combined in one vengeful ghost and malinari turned to vavara and said szwart is right not that nathan is a ghost but that hes no longer here for a moment i touched his mind a real in the field of my probes as real as the shields he raised against me a and in the next moment gone so if you think we have seen awesome weapons at work this night well now we have seen a real weapon the man nathan himself but all of this bears thinking about and i shall give it my gravest consideration and despite that the mind had chosen his words carefully perhaps because he felt he must retain at least a measure of control still his sprouting scythe teeth were awash in his own blood where he ground them deep into his lips and riven gums and malinari did give it his gravest consideration as did we all but no amount of thinking could compensate for our losses or dream up a successful defence against future depredations by the demon nathan thus that entire night was a disaster and no guarantee that things were ever going to get any better we went subterranean unthinkable eh a that the wamphyri should ever flee from a man from the sun aye but not from a single man a yet such was the case if we could not build on high then we must build below where the stumps of the toppled stacks were riddled with tunnels caverns and places which in the olden times were only ever fit for bats and beetles and despite that our work force was reduced a our flyers too and our warriors boiled in their vats a still we had several hundreds of thralls and provisions aplenty the thralls were put to work they cleared the debris from ancient diggings moved our provisions to safety and built defensive positions on the surface new vats of metamorphosis were discovered or dug into which we sacrificed a third of our manpower the raw materials of our future flyers and warriors and we commenced keeping a watchcan you believe it the wamphyri vigilant against any further sabotage attempts by this mere man moreover it was more rigidly enforced than any watch that our vanished ancestors had ever kept against each other but this last was a necessity for from then on whenever we raided against the szgany we could be sure that retaliation would follow hot on our heels and nathan kiklu a man or ghost or whatever he was a he was everywhere if we raided in the far western reaches of sunside he would soon be there with a party of lidesci fighters with guns grenades and rockets setting fire to the wings of our flyers blinding them with silver shot and knocking our thralls out of their saddles before they could even touch down thus for every man we recruited in sunside one of ours was killed by nathan and his szgany soldiers and every forward step was followed by one to the rear east west wherever we struck nathan and his men could be there in a trice how it was beyond us moreover lie would snipe on us from afar and shoot our thralls dead in their defensive or watchtower positions until my master and his colleagues were obliged to devise a new strategy instead of inhabiting just one central area of starsides olden ruins now we spread out and stationed men in every shattered stump and heap of rubble for one thing was certain whoever or whatever nathan was and for all that he could appear almost magically anywhere in extremely short order he couldnt possibly be everywhere at once and so we maintained something of our equilibrium despite that we made little progress one night my master flew out alone returning shortly he complained bitterly that this damned szgany bastard a he has spies in the barrier mountains hah that is how he knows where we will raid they watch us fly up from the boulder plains the direction we take then make report to him i tracked them with my mentalism a which is how i discovered theirs what they are thoughtthieves these men vavara found it hard to believe mentalists malinari laughed like a madman and answered even as we are mentalists aye so says malinari the mind the greatest of them all butthey are not men not men and now szwart was baffled not men you say then what a trogs malinari gave a wild shake of his head and waved his arms in consternation not trogs no a but dogsht said wolves of the wild that think like men stranger still they call this nathan uncle he is their kin then he is a doglord said vavara its the only possible solution this hated enemy of ours is wamphyri he dwells in the mountain heights rules on sunside and keeps the szgany for himself his needs are so slight that the tribes suffer him for his protection i must be right nathan is a changeling and szwart said but a doglord with powers such as he commands and as for suffering him for his protection against what what was there before we came my master threw up his hands crying i dont know i no longer know anythingexcept that i am sick to death of this nathan of this ruined place and of all this endless work performed without reward this work that gets us nowhere we took to raiding separately but simultaneously in locations far apart and we covered our movements with great stealth for again the principle applied that nathan couldnt be everywhere at once and at last a small measure of success a which didnt last long he couldnt be everywhere but his weapons could from thralls freshly converted we learned how he had disseminated his destructive devices a his guns and grenades and so forth a among as many of the tribes as possible and he had taught them how to use them but these weapons and the ammunition they used were not in unlimited supply from time to time nathan must replenish them by venturing into the helllands that in itself posed a question how was it possible for nathan to make these trips to the helllands without using the starside gate for the gate was no longer accessible where in our time it had rested in the bottom of a crater in the lee of the foothills not far from the great pass now it was raised up and stood in the centre of a lake and that lake of white water had many small whirlpools to suck a swimmer down often in our forays across the barrier mountains into sunside we had seen it there that fountain of water all lit from within rising up high into the night and falling back into the lake in order to solve that problem we flew out one night or rather malinari and vavara flew out and a few lieutenants and thralls in attendance for lord szwart would not consider going anywhere near such a brilliant source of light despite that it was cold ah but that was indeed a fortunate trip a for the wamphyri at least if not for me though of course i could not know that then anyway during the long day previous while we vampires slept or carried out our subterranean duties beneath the stumps of the old stacks apparently the lake had run dry and there stood the gate raised up in its crater socket like the blind white eye of some fallen cyclops shining up into the night but as for the lake and its fountain of milky water they were no more not even a trickle the earth was dry caked and wrinkled into channels that showed how the water had disappeared down circular boreholes that angled into the bedrock like conduits to hell a weird thing this gate weird as the tumbling moon or icechip stars and just as inexplicable malinari vavara and their men had left their flyers in the shadowy foothills between the gate and the great pass well away from the gate itself facing downhill on a moderate slope the flyers were positioned for immediate flight it was a safety measure to ensure a quick getaway should such become necessary and so it may be seen that even among the great vampires the helllands gate was held in no small measure of respect and separating into small widespread groups we applied the same caution to our method of approach a moving from boulder clump to boulder clump and always sticking to the shadows a as we drew closer to the gate but we were still some distance away when suddenly my master threw up a warning hand and issued a mental alarm that reached out to all of us something is coming through the gate his voice hissed in our minds as we melted back into darkest shadows and he was correct of course he had sensed their alien minds these men of the helllands as they stepped forth onto the surface of our world far more importantly however malinari had sensed their unpreparedness oh they had weapons as devastating as nathans but for protection as opposed to open aggression also they had little or no idea what to expect in starside and to a man their minds were preoccupied with greed for the heavy malleable yellow metal that you call gold which in my world is common they were thirtytwo in number half of them being soldiers who took up positions on the flanks as the rest formed into an unruly excited and chattering body then they marched for the great pass two of the soldiers rode noisy wheeled engines that cut the darkness with beams of cold white light they went ahead to pick a route through the many boulders that litter the area keeping still and silent in the shadows we let them pass right through the various groups of our divided party then it was that malinari apprised us these men are not like nathan they are like infants with little or no knowledge of what they are about those on the outside a the soldiers a they have weapons when we strike we take them out first kill them with dispatch they barely outnumber us and shouldnt be a problem this time the advantage of surprise is on our side as for the central body these are the minds behind the musclepuny things by my reckoning and not a mentalist among them so be it they are weaklings and we must take them alive for questioning now make ready a in the next few seconds your destiny may change beyond all recognition which of course it did i cannot describe what next took place as a battle nor even a rout for none of our victims had time to flee surprise was indeed on our side and add to this our flowing lightningstrike speed and our vampire strength equal in each of us to that of four or five strong menthe result was overwhelming helllanders they were but they had never seen hell such as we delivered that night there was some gunfire soon silenced we lost a lieutenant and three thralls the helllanders lost everything a their socalled fighting men anyway as for the two on their motorcycles when they returned to see what was the trouble and having seen it didnt stop but headed out onto the barren boulder plains we picked them off later the freshly dead were carried back to fuel our vats the living were taken for questioning by malinari i cant honestly say which group was least fortunate the living or the deadthe living i suspect in the long run it would make no difference the one group would join the other what my master learned however a ah but that made a big difference sufficient to excite malinari and his wamphyri colleagues beyond measure and for me it was the beginning of the end korath had fallen silent for a while when next he spoke it was similar to a sigh in jake cutters sleeping mind and deadspeak in the metaphysical harry keoghs the rest you know in a while when malinari had extracted and assimilated all he could of knowledge from the minds of the scientists and their military leader it was time to take our leave ofstarside before doing so the mind vavara and szwart made a great many lieutenants they took them down into undeath and brought them up again as burgeoning wamphyri and they divided between them all the remaining thralls flyers and waxing warriors and all territorial holdings provisions and so forth it was done for spite out of malice if the three great vampires could not have sunsidestarsidefor their own then neither could nathan and the lidescis nor the szgany as a people a not without they jightfor it for long and long and pay for it in blood and so you may be sure that even now there are new lords in starside while in sunside the bloodjlows as of yore finally korath was done and harry said from all you have told us your lot was not a happy one and your end was unfair to say the least i am glad you finally agree said the dead vampire but afrom what you have told us at least said harry but i am more concerned with what you havent tom us which is probably more important than all the rest put together the wamphyri have been here in our world for some time but it would seem theyve achieved very little what are they up to korath what is their plan you were one of theirs and so you must know ahhhh said the other slyly in a tone that suggested the shake of an incorporeal head and so to the crux of the matter but no what you ask is for me to know and for you to discover or to guess at for a long long time until it is too late for after all it is my only remaining bargaining pointa the last trick up a poor dead things sleeve and when you have that i shall have nothing at all bargaining point said jake just a little surprised by his own voice after keeping so long silent but youre a dead thing what can you possibly bargain for a what can we give you a apart from a little companionship a little cold comfort well that might be a start but the exnecroscope intervened and said you have already had that companionship and cold comfort and probably too much of both it isnt a healthy thing to spend too much time in the company of vampires no theres no bargain you can strike here korath mindsthrall also i sense that your will is strong you are dead but your tenacity is very much alive jake its time we were having i thought youd never get to it jake answered only hope you remember some of this said harry tm still not a hundred per cent sure i want to jake vacillated well get sure said harry his fading deadspeak voice frustrated and angry your entire world depends upon it and if you cant remember anything else do try to remember this an incredible wall of numbers a like a computer screen run riota evolved in the eye of jakes mind its symbols and equations marching and mutating until they reached a certain critical pointand formed a door a mobius door and jake knew without knowing how that all that remained of harry was passing through it moving on to another place perhaps another time iim supposed to remember that he said as the door collapsed and left him on his own in the dank and gurgling sump of the oncerefuge on his own but not quite alone for do not concern yourself jake cutter korath mmdsthraus leering deadspeak voice came to him out of the sudden inky darkness that enveloped him and the sump and everything a darkness that was prelude to the light of the waking world no for i am sure that well be able to work something outa aer between us jake made no reply or if he did it was left behind as he went spiralling up and up to the waiting light chapter twentyfour synchronicity liz was leaning over him again remember what she said eh jake blinked sleep out of his eyes groped to brush grit from their corners you were rambling on about having to remember something she told him and while he was ordering his thoughts to frame a reply she quickly went on and before you ask a no i wasnt snooping on you i came back here to give you a shake you were mumbling and i thought you were speaking to me well he hadnt been but he had been speaking to someone harry korath but who the hell was korath the name so familiar one minute was already meaningless slipping from the edge of his mind so that now just a moment later jake wasnt sure it meant anything at all well get sureget sureget sure and numbers a a swirl of numbers equations symbols like a mathematicians nightmare a all collapsing to a big zero nothing where before they had meant something numbers jake croaked forcing the word out of his dehydrated throat liz handed him a can of coke that she was drinking from and he sat up and swilled his mouth out then let the fizzing liquid burn and cool and sting all the way down numbers liz repeated him what about them awake now he frowned at her are you sure you werent in there with me then seeing that look on her face okay okay just checking he took another swig climbed unsteadily to his feet i think i was dreaming about a hell i dont know a all sorts of stuff he looked at his boots then stooped to touch the bottoms of his jeans and wondered why he thought they might be wet i cant remember a damp place voices numbers but liz only shrugged you tell me she said and turned away so that he wouldnt see the look she flashed at the others up front and over her shoulder she told him were on our way down brisbane next stop ben trask lardis goodly and the others were looking at jake where he worked the stiffness from his joints and followed liz to her gunners chair as she strapped herself in he indicated the gun ports and asked is it okay to open one of these up and which side is brisbane one of the technicians answered him sure a you can open the doors but you better hook yourself up first brisbanes to port there were safety straps dangling from the ceiling jake pulled one down hooked it to his belt jerked on the portside doors handle and slid the door open air blasted in the downdraught from the big fan and immediately the whup whup whup of the rotors was a deafening throb liz hooked up joined him at the door have you been here before she inquired but her words were whipped away it made no difference he heard her anyway and answered no i havent and youre getting good at that she only looked at him and said but im not a natural a not at sending not yet anyway a so maybe youre the one whos getting good at it no he shook his head to give his thoughts emphasis its all you liz its your talent getting stronger all the time and maybe some kind of rapport we seem to be developing which was the closest he had yet come to admitting any kind of serious involvement their eyes met locked just for a moment and each of them knew that the same thought was in the others mind that out of the blue jake was accepting telepathy that much easier a as if hed been getting in some practice and they both knew where he had been getting it it was as hed explained to lardis sleep the subconscious mind was a strange thing and dreams could be stranger yet sometimes they could even be more than dreams then they looked down on a small airfield six hundred feet directly below them and two or three miles to the east central brisbane brisbane was big and sprawling but it didnt lack order on the contrary for if anything it was too symmetrical ultramodern its streets were too broad with too many parks pools green areas it should have looked as cool and fresh as an oasis which in all this heat when even the downdraught of the rotors felt as hot as hell would have seemed very welcoming but the river instead of being a fat winding silver eel was more a thin snakelike whiplash most of the pools were empty down to their liners and all of the green places had yellow tints jake frowned and might have commented but the horizon was rapidly narrowing down as they watched brisbane came up level finally disappearing behind the airport buildings and just a moment or two later they bumped down when the rotors went into braking mode their whine became unbearable grimacing jake slammed the door to shut it out the small airport a more an airstrip really a belonged to a private flying club for welltodo members of brisbane society the choppers pilot had been directed to it by air traffic control who in turn had taken their orders from higher authority it might seem odd if a paramilitary jetcopter was seen to land at a main international airportespecially carrying the ebranch contingent whose members were by now beginning to look something less than reputable trask had radioed ahead before decamping on the other side of the continent discreet arrangements had been made while the chopper was still in the air met by a pair of cleancut immaculatelyuniformed chauffeurs the drivers of limos with onewayglass windows trask and his people were soon on their way into the city as they left the airport heading for a main arterial road they passed a small parking lot sitting on the hood of a battered bluegrey range roverstyled vehicle a tall angular male figure in jeans opennecked shirt and broadbrimmed hat gazed intently into the sky over the airport through a pair of binoculars with his hat shading his face his features were blankly anonymous under the brilliance of the midafternoon sunlight except to liz there seemed nothing special about him liz had noticed him shed seen how at the last minute before the car threw up a screen of dust in their wake the man had turned his binoculars on the two vehicles now with a frown she tapped trask on the shoulder where he sat in front of her that man back there she said hurriedly they were negotiating a bend and the parking lot was already disappearing in the drivers rearview trask turned his head looked back where liz was indicating he saw nothing but a dustplume and a distant shimmer of heathaze a man he said what about him the intercom was on and the chauffeur a a special agent a asked something suspicious miss a man did you say back there what was he doing sitting on a car liz answered he was watching the sky through binoculars a planespotter through the plateglass screen that divided them they saw the driver shrug a wannabe flyboy member of the club hull some hope flying is for rich folks but liz leaned forward and quietly right in trasks ear said the last thing i saw he was looking at us they were turning onto the main road and picking up speed let it go trask told her it may have been nothing and in any case its too late now if weve been made weve been made but if weve been made then obviously someone was sent to make us a sent by someone now all we have to do is find out who and where liz nodded said andhe was wondering about us thats all you got yes trask shrugged but not negligently maybe he was simply curious but by the same token maybe this wasnt as discreet as it might have been two chauffeurdriven limos doing reception at a small private airport i mean turn the situation around and i might be curious myself do you think youd recognize him again probably she answered there was something unpleasant spidery about him well if you do see him let me know said trask once is coincidence twicethis spider might need stepping on and the cars sped for the neardistant city back at the parking lot the long thin man got into his car and called a number on his portaphone a disinterested female voice said xanadu reception i want to speak to milan the thin man told her there was a pause and she said your identification now she was a little more animated mind your business the thin man replied with the emphasis on mind but with nothing of rebuke or unpleasantness in his voice it was simply a code just a moment sir said the girl and the phone played some indifferent musak while he waited the thin man coughed to clear his throat mopped sweat from his brow got his thoughts in order his employer a mr milan to whom he was about to make report a had a liking for ordered minds he much preferred to hear and understand things clearly and precisely the first time around and in a little while milan speaking a deep accented seemingly cultured yet vaguely threatening male voice replaced the musak what do you want and the thin man told his employer what he had seen of the jetcopter gave him brief descriptions of the people hed seen getting into limos outside the flying clubs main building and closed by saying they drove off towards brisbane there was a brief pause before the other queried and you didnt follow them it was the chauffeurs the thin man answered they were too good to be true no one looks as neat tidy and as cool as they looked a not in this weather a without theyre trying real hard they looked like government men and if they were theyd be on me like flies on shit as soon as they spotted me in their rearviews i see said the foreign mediterraneansounding voice of mr milan and in a moment would you know these people again sure good i think this may be what ive been waiting for you can call your other observers off mr santeson let them report to you in xanadu from now on i think you will find your duties more to your liking up here at the resort just be sure to come and see me as soon as you get in im on it the thin man said and under his breath when the phone went dead what are you a some kind of mindreader but anyway youre right a thats just exactly what i wanted to hear after a day spent sweltering in all this heat sweating my balls off watching waiting and trying not to look suspicious shitty work in weather like this but up there at the pleasure dome up at the pleasure dome he thought putting the car in first and turning out of the parking lot life is sheer luxury the pools the broads in their bikinis the good food and drink a even the casino huh a where i can spend my money almost as fast or faster than mr fucking milan pays me and he grinned but on the other hand no one could call milan mean garth santeson a private investigator for twenty years and then some had never had it so good what milan mean no way shady definitely a how else would you describe a guy who only ever comes out at night but never mean a hell no the way aristotle milan throws money around its likelike tomorrow therell be no use for it never knowing just how close he had come to the truth and in more respects than one santeson headed his battered vehicle for the ring road south around brisbane then he would look for the signpost for the town of beaudesert which would put him on a heading for the macpherson range right on the border with new south wales eighty miles of good road and hed be up into the mountains yes and finally xanadu on the way into town jake said now i remember what you were dreaming about said lardis lidesci eh jake looked at him on the plane you were dreaming about something when liz woke you up you couldnt remember jake shook his head no not that he said im talking about brisbane a im remembering about this place looking down on the city from the chopper i thought it looked too neat too new well thats because it is new jake and lardis were travelling in the first limo with the teams top technicians a pair of young whizzkid computer and communications types who were fullyfledged members of ebranch but not espers as such one of these jimmy harvey a a compact prematurely bald man of perhaps twentysix with lush red sideburns and bushy eyebrows that together were trying hard to make up for his baldness grey watery eyes and a genius for electronics a wanted to know jake where have you been hiding out these last three or four years i mean on the richter scale of national disasters brisbanes great fire of ranks several notches higher than the sinking of the titanic and very nearly as high as krakatoa there was little or nothing of sarcasm in harveys comment just surprise jake sighed shrugged apologetically and said yes that was what i remembered as for where ive been mainly ive been doing my own thing my world has been a i dont know a kind of a small place for a long time ive only had room for personal problems things that i need to get sorted out aye lardis grunted your vow i can understand that my vow jake frowned at him as usual he found the old boy full of indecipherable statements but now in sunside lardis deciphered when a man has something to do a a wrong that needs righting a he makes a vow usually in public and he holds to it until its done i made just such a vow one time and it still isnt done but if i cant be killing the bloodsucking bastards there at least im helping to kill them here jimmy harvey despite that he wasnt privy to jakes past believed hed got the drift of it so how about you jake he said you mentioned things you need to get sorted out present tense so like lardis youre not finished yet right not quite no jake shook his head but theres plenty of time yet and to change the subject why dont you tell me about brisbane fill in whatever it is ive missed the other wasnt about to start prying the one thing hed learned in his time with the branch was that these people hated to talk about their private lives almost as much as about their weird talents and as far as their powers were concerned the majority didnt see them as bonuses at all just extra baggage jake hadnt been around too long and was a new one on harvey still he was on the team and so must be an esper well no one can be expert in everything butthe great fire of brisbane something like that had escaped his notice jake had to be pulling his leg but he didnt look like he was and so it was about this time of year harvey started out and what do you know was another el nino year just like this one a synchronicity or something anyway these freaky weather years have been coming around far too often a and again in and finally in and this current one of course in an el nino the currents in the pacific go all to hell they circulate the wrong way or something like that the water gets warm where it should be cold and vice versa since everything is connected to ocean temperatures a like you know the ecosystem a the weather goes to hell in a bucket everywhere everything and everyone gets affected add to this the depletion of the rain forests soil erosion acid rains holes in the ozone the notsogradual melting of the ice caps earthquakes volcanoes blowing their tops left right and centrethe whole thing seems symptomatic of planetary and climatic upheaval or maybe i should say seemed past tense because these arent just symptoms im talking about but the actual disease in short were in it up to our necks and finally people are beginning to sit up and pay attention to the ecologists and environmentalists the guys who used to get tagged as sensationalists and doomsayers back around a was when it became really noticeable now hey were only talking a timespan of maybe twelve or thirteen years here but the speed at which things have changed you really wouldnt know it like a thousand years worth of climatic damage packed into just a decade and a half so lets go back to the years leading up to and including and the antarctic pack ice had already started breaking into icebergs bigger than large english counties there were grasses and mosses and flowers where before thered only ever been ice similarly in the arctic the sea ice was getting thinner every year the socalled permanent ice simply wasnt permanent any more and the cap in general was shrinking so all that water had to go somewhere right my guess into the air the atmosphere jake and as the old saying goes what goes up must come down again a in precipitation and brother did we get rain the netherlands flooded to hellso badly that for a while it looked like all the major dams would go germany and poland all the rivers breaking their banks greece unseasonal hail with hailstones as big as pingpong balls that flattened the crops the usa jesus the mississippi all that water trying to get out of there and god help anything that got in its way and in right here in australia first they had fires that scorched people out of their homes a destroying thousands of acres of prairie woodlands and national parks and killing people livestock wildlife galore a and then monsoon rains to match anything the rest of the world had suffered it was just crazy fucking weather but the hell of it was these were only warnings the el nirios are warnings the melting ice is a warning and likewise the ozone layer like planetwide alarms that have been sounding for a long long time all in vain because no one has been listening or rather no one was listening to the ones who were listening in the far east they wouldnt stop burning the rain forests the americans took the hump when people said their carbon dioxide emissions were off the scalebut they werent half as snooty in the summer of when texas turned into a desert heat wave theyd never seen anything like it as for the russians well as usual they hid or disguised or denied any and all wrongdoings whatsoever huh what else would you expect of the people who turned the aral sea into the aral pondthe folks with more toxic nuclear and chemical garbage per acre than most countries have per square mile in ebranch a during my three years with the branch anyway a weve been monitoring the hell out of the russians ask ben trask about it some time and jake cut in well at least i know something about all that the way they dump their clappedout subs et cetera thats part of it harvey agreed but the rest of it is just as bad anyway all thats away from the main subject and in fact we were talking abouta athe big fire jake reminded him until you went a bit off track harvey nodded yeah the great fire of brisbane it was around this time of year and el nino was up to its unusual tricks the weather had been freakish everywhere especially in the uk england for fifteen years the various water boards had been moaning about declining water tables it could rain all it wanted during the winter but given just three days of good old heartwarming sunshine in july and these jokers would start leaping up and down and tearing their hair and sticking in meters and standpipes and demanding that people should save water by cutting down on their bathing and putting bricks in their water closet cisternsand so on and so forth ad infinitum what a load of crap zfyou could afford to take one it was nature all those years warning us that the big one was coming well in in england it came and that year we didnt have a summer it was washed out jake felt obliged to ask it was drowned out harvey told him i seem to remember something about that jake said but i missed it i was on the continent but you must have read about it seen it on tv i told you i was doing my own thing on the continent yeah harvey agreed about the only place in the world where the weather was moderately normal you were lucky but in england it rained and rained and rained and as for declining water tables forget it theres been no shortage of water ever since anywhere below sea level turned into a swamp the thames barrier failed and high tides combined with a flooded river to drown the city six feet deep through july august and september a shit there were gondolas in oxford street okay so im exaggerating a maybe it wasnt quite as bad as all that but it was bad enough and i could go on and on except he paused again except that was the uk jake helped him out and the people had plenty of warning and there was little or no loss of life yes i remember it now but we were talking about brisbane not quite so close to home not just brisbane the other told him in it was australia as a whole now youve got to remember that in australia the climate works backwards to how wed expect back home its way hotter in january than in july the difference between summer and winter right oh really well in everything went wrong from february on the summer weather held there was no winter and it didnt get any colder just like now in fact exactly like now they had the freakiest of freak weather turning his head harvey gazed out through the limos oneway windows at suburbs becoming city i mean just take a look out there jake looked lifted an enquiring eyebrow well dry brittle parched those gardens that should be green are more like miniature deserts the grass is withered to straw and the leaves are dead on the trees and bushes almost all the swimming pools are empty and you wont see anyone watering any lawns it should be a maximum of sixty sixtyfive degrees fahrenheit out there but its well over eighty and this is late afternoon and naturally its an official drought perfect perfect for what now jake was really puzzlednot to mention tired of this circuitous route they were taking to the great fire earth year said harvey the big conference that starts tomorrow right here in brisbane billed as the ultimate ecological summit meeting synchronicity at work again or maybe not naturally they chose this place because of the fire well youve lost me again jake told him and we still havent got to the fire itself the other shrugged apologetically im sorry a its this grasshopper mind of mine start me on a subject it devours me okay the fire it was the weirdest thing ever a a oneofakind sort of thing or at least everyone hopes so and we thought wed seen it all the worst tornadoes the usa had ever suffered the worst floods the strangest fluctuations and reversals of climate right across the world with australia taking the brunt of it but no we hadnt seen it all brisbane was like a tinderbox the whole east coast from rockhampton to canberra a normally a green strip in the lee of the great dividing range with no water shortage and an excellent annual rainfall a was bone dry from this drought that had lasted for eighteen months oh theyd had rain but all of it had fallen on the wrong side of the great divide and daily the temperature was up in the hundreds and it was then that it happened it was likewhat a tornado an almighty tornado a whirlwind yes but a whirlwind of fire ma nature jake getting all hot under the collar it started in the gidgealpa and moomba oil and gas fields but how or why it started no one knows there are various theories but like i said no one really knows though miles apart suddenly the oil wells and gas installations became the epicentre of an enormous fireball that in itself was a disaster but nothing like what was to come a fireball vast hot rushing up on its own thermals and sucking in the air to fuel itself sucking the air into a selfperpetuating spiral a superheated whirlwind it swept east out of the sturt desert its base widening out as it came a column of fire five and then ten miles across at more than a hundred miles an hour it hit a place called dirranbandi and burned the entire town just took it out and everything it burned fuelled the fire that got hotter and hotter and on it came the thing moved like a drunkard never in a straight line but just exactly like a tornado a a pillar of fire reaching up through the clouds of course it was monitored thousands of people reported seeing it it came terrifyingly close to some towns scorching them but leaving them intact then again it seemed to swoop on others tossed them into the sky in blazing rags firefighters tried to plot its course from the air some airplanes flew too close and got sucked in incinerated and rotating ever faster it rushed east to refuel itself on the alton oil field so it goes and i cant remember all of it but who would want to anyway the whole thing was on every tv channel every aussie there ever was watched it happening couldnt do a thing about it the authorities thought the mountains would stop it a they were wrong it blazed across the divide leaving a smoking track twelve miles wide in its wake with secondary fires still ranging outwards the latter would burn for weeks until torrential rains stopped them and with only an hours warning to the people of brisbane a an indefinite warning at that for no one could say for sure what this thing would do a finally it hit this firestorm from hell such as the world had never before seen never before and never since thank god everything that could burn burned if it couldnt burn it calcined and if it couldnt calcine it melted as for the brisbane river forget it it was running at a trickle and had been for a ninemonth the firestorm took what was left of the river water turned it to steam in a couple of seconds and kept right on going and that was it a onehundredmilesperhour blast furnace had killed a city and everyone it it who couldnt or hadnt tried to get out following the warning they hadnt all died by burning a great many people gone underground or into cellars suffocated because the fire needed their air all of it then the thing hit the sea and sucked up a waterspout into its raging funnel the water put the fire out turned to steam and formed clouds the clouds drifted inland and rained on the raging inferno that had been brisbane finally it was over end of story and after a while christ jake said under his breath and a moment later that is some encyclopedic memory youve got there jimmy what are you an authority on world disasters harvey shrugged a little selfconsciously a perhaps sheepishly a and said me no a but i know a woman who is before we broke camp i had to talk to hq about a couple of communications problems millicent cleary was on duty officer shes our current affairs lady she has that kind of memory keeps a mental record of just about everything thats going or gone down as lan goodly knows the future she knows the recent past but of course she has a big advantage like its already happened and unlike lans her knowledge comes in amazing detail so when i told her wed be setting up next in brisbane she clued me in on the city the fire the earth year conference and there you have it the fires still fresh in my mind from my conversation with millicent cleary harvey sat back and looked out of his window after a moments silence he said but actually i wish it wasnt in the other limo the episode of the tall thin planespotter had been forgotten by everyone except liz merrick she too was trying to put it to the back of her mind but knew shed be able to recall it if or when it was requireda ahis silhouette etched on her memory his angular shape and the tilt of his broadbrimmed hat that kept the sun out of his eyes the way his binoculars were trained ontrained on what a mainly empty sky that was what had been bothering her that and the way those glasses had suddenly dipped turning towards the limo that was when lizs mind had been closest to his the moment when shed sensed his interest in the vehicle and its occupants so how about it said ben trask causing her to start as he reached over her and switched off the intercom connection to their driver eh she said and oh im sorry ben i must have been daydreaming how about what jake on the chopper what was going on did you get anything and now the image of the thin man with the binoculars vanished completely from her mind as the other question arose the one liz had known she would have difficulty answering at first it had seemed simple even exciting in a strange and morbid sort of way the answer to not just one question but many but after thinking it over she had seen the enormous hurt it might cause so that now she had to find a way around it if trask would let her but i thought we had an understanding on that she said i dont like spying on jake anda what he cut her off but on the chopper you seemed to indicate that youd got something so why are you holding back liz what the hell is going on here the look on trasks face was one of incredulity hed been sure theyd hammered this out and from now on it would be plain sailing so what had happened to change her mind iim not sure what i got she blurted it out lying so unconvincingly that even without his talent trask would have known and she saw in his eyes that he knew and in the way his lips tightened butbut hes my partner she quickly went on the defensive hes got to be able to trust me he saved my life anda oh for christs sake spare me trask barked but before he could say anything else damn you liz snapped and then more quietly even desperately cant you see im trying to spare you ben which set him back a little because he saw that that was the truth too and despite that trask was still frowning his tone was less severe when he said all right so dont try so hard and after a moment when she remained silent he went on look whatever this is theres only you me and lan here to share it so lets have it out in the open here and now while we can still deal with it in private for if it has to do with me a and if its got anything at all to do with the branch or the job in hand a then obviously i have to know but its so very little she answered and his shields were up like a blanket covering his mind anda liz i have to know trask insisted it doesnt matter how small a thing it might seem to you it could be allimportant to everyone else in its way im sure it is liz said its just that i would have liked to find a way to tell you a i mean a different way to tell you a without this this what said trask and liz if you lie to me again ill know she looked at him looked at lan goodly sighed and shook her head i didnt want to lie but i didnt want to hurt you either you see itswhere jake was a in his dream i mean a and its who he was speaking to go on trask nodded he was down in the wrecked sump of the romanian refuge she blurted it out but ben it had to be much more than just a dream because from what i saw of it a despite that it was so dark and shrouded a it was all so very real the refuge trask repeated her jake dreamed he was in the wrecked sump and he wasspeaking to someone to more than one liz corrected him and now that shed got started she quickly went on but you know how dreams are supposed to happen in the last few minutes before you wake up well not this one it started the moment he fell asleep went on until he woke up and it was more than just a dream ben the others face was grey now gaunt with the sudden sure knowledge of what liz was about to tell him he knew but asked her anyway who was jake talking to to harry keogh she answered and to someone else who i didnt know and dont want to know ever i couldnt read him a he was a complete blank a but i could sense his presence like a sick taste in my throat and just the opposite to him a little earlier thered been a third presence likelike a breath of fresh air she was someone id never known who i wish i had it was zek trask groaned he was talking to zek jake was talking to zek through harry and clasping lizs hands in his liz what was she saying what did zek say i dont know she shook her head wanted to put her arms round him but couldnt for fear it would crack him up and anyway they wouldnt be zeks arms i got something of what jake was saying a though very little because he didnt say much a but nothing of what the others actually said that was a void lan goodly said of course it was you heard jake because hes alive that was your telepathy working liz but harry and the otherstheyre a different category and they were in a different mode deadspeak yes trask murmured gaunt and visibly shaken where he let his head flop back against the seats headrest and closed his eyes and whether i like it or not it looks like i now have to accept it jake is our new necroscope and harry is introducing him toto people wholl be able to help him as for this numbers thing that jake was talking about when he woke up a the difficulty he seemed to be having a i think that can mean only one thing trask looked at the precog and goodly nodded his confirmation despite that jakes future is beyond me uncertain now he said still i can only go along with you it was the necroscopes sidereal maths his numbers that gave him the edge and now it looks like the old master is trying to teach his apprentice the tricks of the trade chapter twentyfive synchronicity again the safe house set aside for ebranch use was in the new marchant park district north of the city an ugly twostorey affair it had aluminium cladding designed and painted in a rather poor imitation of timber brisbane no longer favoured wooden structures of any kind the house was set back from the road up a short palmlined drive its gate was remotecontrolled from inside the lead limo and opened into a featureless garden two mediumsized innocuouslooking saloon cars stood on a gravel drive in front of the house in fact they were fitted with bulletproof windows heavilyplated bodywork hidden rollbars and other anticrashantiterforist devices short of a bombblast or a headon collision at speed no one was going to come to harm driving one of these vehicles they were for the use of trask and his people laid to lawn and enclosed within high stone walls the garden was on a level and surrounded the house on all sides every inch of grass was clearly visible from the windows of both storeys of the house itself it had bulletproof heavily curtained windows and a securityintruder warning system second to none in plan the ground floor consisted of four long rooms one on each side each furnished and decorated in a slightly outofdate style with little or nothing to show that the place was anything other than a fairly expensive private dwelling house the central room however which wasnt visible from the gardens was an operational and communications nerve centre of screens and computerized equipment the sleeping quarters were upstairs and overhead on the roof a bank of solarheating panels concealed an array of hitech communications aerials and dishes the agentchauffeurs showed trask and his crew of six over the house asked how they could help them settle in or if there was anything else they needed trask checked with jimmy harvey and paul arenson a in their element as they switched on and got acquainted with the gadgets in the ops room a and arenson told him were fully compatible throughout give us ten minutes to hook our stuff up to this lot and well have the hqduty officer up there on that big screen so clear youll think youre in london scrambled trask wasnt that easily satisfied as per sops yes said the other at which trask thanked the asi men who headed back to the airstrip to connect with incoming chopper twos military commanders and three more members of branch ground staff once they were in and until the slower backup squads of australian sas types had arrived and taken up their tactical locations the advance party was on its own in fact it took the technicians half an hour to complete their hookup meanwhile an uncharacteristically subdued liz had brewed a pot of earl grey for trask and herself coffee for jake and the others goodly had taken his coffee through into ops trask was enjoying his tea in one of the living rooms while poring over a smallscale map of the queenslandnew south wales border areas it was somewhere there in the vicinity of the border that the locator chung had detected mindsmog probably due to the mental activity of a master vampire wamphyri probably but not definitely not with one hundred per cent certainty the branch had long since discovered psychic hotspots where a proliferation of lesser human esp talents could produce the same result it had been david chungs hunch however that this time it was the real thing which the synchronous coincidence of vampire lieutenant bruce trenniers death had seemed to confirm jake took his coffee over to where trask worked watched him use a red highlighter to plot a dotted line along the border from stanthorpe to coolangatta then circle the whole area in a ring of pale red ink as trask looked up from what he was doing jake lifted an enquiring eyebrow if our target is here trask explained and if he has established himself then hes somewhere inside this ring personally i fancy he is ive known david chung for a long time and he doesnt make too many mistakes it was chung who discovered trennier once we had an approximate location we checked with the local police and picked up on a handful of disappearances a trenniers recruits those creatures we killed at the old mine gas station that one was fairly easy in a region as thinly populated as the gibson desert people are wont to take notice when their kith and kin cease to exist but here in the east on the coastal strip he paused glanced again at the map shook his head densely populated jake nodded and that circle youve drawn covers what a maybe five six thousand square miles closer to eight trask corrected him glumly and folks disappear around here every other halfhour about the same as they do in similar areas of population all over the world lardis lidesci had been talking to liz now he came over put a gnarled finger on the map and growled these mountains trask answered huh lardis grunted thought so and the border follows the mountains right in part trask nodded a natural boundary yes an wnnatural boundary in sunsidestarsidef lardis said but there again the barrier mountains are different entirely and they never knew sunlight such as these mountains have seen but beggars and even the wamphyri cant be choosers not in a world like this so there you are and now maybe you can narrow it down concentrating on the map trask was only halflistening to what lardis was saying but in another moment he looked up from where he sat at the table eh mountains lardis said understand em and so do the wamphyri if this ones a lord where do you think hell be where do i thinka trask frowned looked again at the map then came erect and snapped his fingers in the mountains aye lardis anticipated him scowling in his fashion in his aerie of course thats a logical cona er conclusion a wouldnt you say and heres another if it is one of them it isnt szwart what in all this heat and light no way a not a chance its too much for me let alone for lord szwart huh darkness himself that one and damn youre probably right trask husked at which point lan goodly returned from the ops room up and running he said and ben david chungs onscreen wanting to speak to you i have some hotoffthepress news for you chung told trask as he seated himself within the screens viewing arc big deal trask answered wearily with a touch of sarcasm but no real malice just about any news fits that description weve been busy airmobile and only just got settled in here so whats going down in your neck of the woods thats such hot stuff chung shrugged in my neck of the woods not a lot but in yours an opportunity to speak to an old pal of ours maybe if thats of any interest and then more seriously its gustav turchin hes going to be there at the earth year conference in brisbane the time in the city is nowa he glanced offscreen aa little after eight am but just an hour ago turchin himself was onscreen unscrambled from moscow he was interested to know if youd be attending the conference he was very careful ohsopolite and diplomatic as usual but john grieve was doing duty officer and read him like a book premier turchin is eager to see you ben it was a lastminute call probably monitored before he boarded an aeroflot vtol atmozkim to brisbane and john says turchin stressed the fact that he would be accompanied by several members of his staff thats very interesting trask answered his bodyguards will be special police kgb lookalikes a watchdogs for the real leaders all the military types like mikhail suvorov a who will be making sure he doesnt step out of line so maybe turchin is on his way out his days of power at an end but of course ill see him i have a few questions for him and while he still has some pull theres a favour i need to ask of him trask glanced at jake perhaps musingly then turned back to the screen so thanks for the information david he continued and you can be sure ill act on it but now id like you to tell me something about our main problem how is the search going have you picked up anything new to corroborate your original lead chung pulled a wry face theres something there i would swear to that but its too distant too shielded literally on the other side of the world your side of the world ben which is where i have to be if you want any kind of accuracy i mean how can i be expected to locate someone or something through eight thousand miles of solid rock and whitehot magma you want in on this trasks face was a blank absolutely and you wouldnt be playing on your talent simply so you can come swarming around out here chungs face showed his confusion for the truth was that he would dearly love to go swarming around in australia with his ebranch colleagues a and if he denied it trask would know he was lying so after letting his face work its way through a number of mutually contradictory expressions finally he said but isnt that the wrong question what you should have asked is do i think ill be better placed to find what were searching for if im out there with youto which i would have to answer yes at which trasks stony expression broke and he grinned i know he said im good at asking awkward questions right too true chung rubbed his chin and looked hurt a until a moment later when trask said okay so how soon can you be out here the fact is youll come in useful apprising premier turchin firsthand of all that youve discovered about the russian navys illegal pollution of the worlds oceansand in earth year at that which in turn will afford me a little more leverage on what i would like from him thats if leverage is required which i doubt for in fact gustav turchin isnt a bad sort of bloke watching chungs face come alive with anticipation on the wall screen jake thought synchronicity again like some kind of weird wordassociation ebranch gustav turchin the downatheel russian militarys systematic pollution of the oceans the earth year ecosummit and all of it coming together right here and now in brisbane a along with a whole hunch of other shit possihly and meanwhile with a smile as broad as his face the locator was saying i er already mentioned the possibility that i mightbe needed to john grieve hes happy to take over here and therell be no shortage of staff in support sowhen is the next flight out trask nodded knowingly im sure youll be able to check that out for yourself he said er if you havent already and chung laughed and said i have an hour and forty minutes to make heathrow i thought so trask said very well lan goodly can get his head down now and pick you up in the wee small hours at the airport youll travel under an assumed identity of course of course and chung was still grinning his delight when trask broke the connection chung wasnt the only one who was met at the airport in the wee small hours premier gustav turchin was there first along with his minder entourage no one paid them much attention russia was no longer a world superpower a in fact she was rapidly crumbling held under siege not by the world community but from within her own borders by political and ideological intractability corruption organized crime and desperate poverty a but still turchin was recognized as a world leader of sorts if only a figurehead without any real power in any case the earth year conference wasnt diplomacyconscious it wasnt that kind of venue the ecosummits organizers were not so much standing on ceremony as requiring action australia now a republic and a very powerful nation in its own right was still viewed as a clean country and was determined to stay that way while the all too frequent el ninos and other ecological disasters were not caused by australians australians were suffering their consequences now they and other likeminded a indeed rightminded a countries were considering real action political legal and economic against nations with badtocriminal ecological records since russia was reckoned more than merely suspect in this regard and since premier turchins attendance had been an eleventhhour decision no redcarpet arrangements had been made for him and his party a limo and driver had been arranged a which was literally the least that the organizers could do without being seen to be rude a but trask had seen to it that these had been called off this hadnt been the easiest thing in the world to arrange but trasks connections were second to none diplomatic immunity saw the russian premier and his pokerfaced party of four clonelike minders through the international airports redtape entry procedures without too much fuss each man carrying his own spartan to modest luggage until they were met in the arrivals lounge by a pair ofchauffeurs who introduced themselves as mr smith and mr brown swiftly escorted to the carport by smith and brown turchin was bundled into the back of the first limothe doors of which immediately clicked shut and locked all except the drivers door which stood open and before the jetlagged traveldisorientated quartet of greysuits could even begin to object mr smith slid into the drivers seat and drove away as the minders got into the second limo one of them growled a concerned heavily accented who was that man sitting in the front of the first car er that was mr smith said mr brown i believe hes an important convention official it seemed only right that a person of stature should welcome your premier personally oh indeed yes said the other gruffly and then with a frown but erwasnt the driver also mr smith thats correct said brown quickly recovering from his gaffe we have an awful lot of smiths you know a and browns too for that matter why we even had a prime minister called smith once over and anyway whats wrong with that i imagine its much the same with ivans and ivanovs in your country yes certainly i understand pardon me ahem to cover his embarrassment the minder coughed into a handkerchief over the intercom mr brown chuckled and said lets face it this is australia i mean who did you think would be meeting you a marx and engels oh ha ha ha ha the minders laughed woodenly almost in unison no not at all indeed no but when theyd quietened down their head man cautiously enquired er how long will it be before we get to the hotel eh said mr brown grinning well i dont really know mate all i know is i have orders to tail the car in front and thats it about an hour at a guess a maybe more maybe less but now if youll excuse me i have to concentrate on my driving yes of course just as long as you stay right behind the car in front but the car in front was already out of sight oh dont worry i wont lose him no fear of that but i do understand your concern it must be very daunting having to keep an eye on someone like gustav turchin what dodgy is he but now mr browns familiarity was getting to be too much whats that the leading greysuit said stiffly did you say dodgy something about keeping an eye on him now you listen to me mr well thats what you are arent you brown cut him off i mean just how long have you lot been special policemen anyway a or kgb as was a or whatever you call yourselves now but suddenly the four were very tightlipped scowling at each other and with his mouth twitching in one corner and his eyes like black marbles their leader slowly answered we have been ah shall we say specialists a lot longer i fancy than you have been a chauffeur mr brown at which brown looked back grinned and then switched off the intercom out on the airport service road trask got out of the front of the limo and into the back with turchin then they shook hands and turchin hugged him in a typically russian greeting funny but weve never met person to person turchin said then yet it seems i know you a meeting of minds perhaps said trask and listen i apologize for the subterfuge back there but your friendsa no friends of mine turchin cut him short indeed they are only here to make sure i dont talk out of turn but before you askyes i do know about the despicable and destructive activities of our armed forces they are like dogs fouling someone elses garden but trask understand this i am not the one who let those dogs off the leash in todays russia my friend they roam wild indeed ive been lucky to hold on to what small degree of power still remains to me but if i were to tell this conference everything i know then even that would be lost and our currently uneasy eastwest relationship would slip a little bit farther downhill trask nodded i understand and its much as i suspected but premier you dont have to explain to me not about that at least and i know that you wont be able a wont be allowed a to explain it to the conference so why are you here he fell silent wanting to let the other do the talking maybe he would learn more that way how long do we have turchin inquired the drivers are taking the scenic route trask told him ive asked for half an hour at least an hour at most in fact we could be at your hotel in twenty minutes but i wasnt quite sure what degree of privacy youd have later half an hour turchin nodded good im sure its going to be enough but well need to get on as for privacy later a huh my fault said trask i should have been more subtle i didnt want to compromise you but i simply didnt have time to make any other arrangements no turchin shook his head its just how things are i have made myself unpopular with certain people if a country is rich and strong and its people are well fed then maybe the man in charge can afford to be unpopular and do things his own way me i cant afford to do anything my own way the only reason i hold on is in the hope that things will change but change is a long time coming trask had been studying him the russian premier wasnt by any means the same man hed known previously even though trask had only ever seen him in television broadcasts or onscreen at ebranch hq still he had radiated a lot more power than he did now and trasks mind took him back to a time all of five years ago when he had negotiated a course of action on the perchorsk gate with this selfsame man then gustav turchin had seemed unshakeable he had been a rock of a man blockily built square of face and short in the neck with a shock of black hair bushy black eyebrows dark glinting eyes over a blunt nose and an unemotional mouth a he had been a veritable bulldog but even then the premier had had problems coinciding with trasks they had served to bring the two together in a mutually beneficial understanding nowthere had been changes turchin was a lot thinner greystreaked where his hair was brushed back from his temples less bright and sharp of eye even his voice had lost something of its former authority the intellect was still there a still lethal trask supposed a but the drive was failing seven years of political power and nothing to show for it had taken their toll of him but the way the russian premier was studying traskthe head of ebranch couldnt suppress a snort of selfderision if he found turchin changed what must turchin think of him as if reading his mind the other said the years havent been kind to us and trask smiled wrily and answered its not so much the years as the mileage then he stopped smiling and said weve not long had definite evidence about what your navy is doing i certainly wont be saying anything about it here in brisbane i wouldnt embarrass you like that in fact im not here on earth year business at all and i doubt if ill attend a single session but you should know that sooner or later a probably sooneraill have to bring it to the attention of our minister responsible and that he has obligations too i appreciate that er benjamin ben then by all means call me gustav but you are not the only one whose purpose here is other than it seems indeed i am here simply because you are here oh they have been badgering me to attend these things all over the world but so far ive managed to hold them off the admirals generals despoilers et cetera requiring me to lie for them a huh well and now that im here i shall lie for them telling brisbane and all the world of the marvellous efforts russia is making to clean up her act but you and i we know the truth and as you have pointed out so will everyone else in the not too distant future unfortunately that is the least of my worries a or if not the least it is not my major concern no for that is something else entirely trask nodded he remained silent and thoughtful for a few moments then said perhaps i can anticipate you i think its only fair to tell you that im also aware that mikhail suvorov has led an alleged expeditionary party of soldiers and scientists through the perchorsk gate into sunsidestarside nathan keoghs world now it was gustav turchins turn to smile wrily ah he said the opposition and sharp as ever yes and you are correct that is my problem but alas its also yours probably more than you suspect said trask but perhaps i should hear your side of the story first my side is simple said the other five years ago when turkur tzonov escaped justice in perchorsk by fleeing into starside some of his dupes were taken prisoner that was a mistake on my part i should have had them shot for mutiny conspiracy desertion of duty sabotageoh half a dozen charges but i didnt and one of them talked to mikhail suvorov not the best possible move for fehad them shot or rather he saw to their disposal there were several very unfortunate accidents trask understood and said which left general suvorov as the sole heir to whatever he could steal from sunsidestarside he knew that the gate would lead him into an alien world knew about the gold and wanted it for himself the gold and whatever else he could find there turchin answered a whole new world which he would annex and rape for its riches and he would have control of the gate why in retrospect it seems perfectly obvious if suvorov had wanted these things for the good of his country for russia a which was what he told me a then surely he would have explained his purpose to everyone to his military colleagues and the whole country and not justnot just to me he turned his face away he told you he was going through the gate and you didnt try to stop him trask believed he understood something of the predicament turchin must have faced but wanted to hear it from the horses mouth how could i stop him turchin threw up his hands after the perchorsk complex was flooded a task force of military engineers was sent in to strip and salvage lead from the shielding in the ravine that was what i was led to believe though later it turned out that wasnt all they were there for anyway many of these men were longterm criminals from the punishment garrisons at beresov and ukhta handpicked by mikhail suvorov they had been given the choice of serving out their sentences or serving him his first step towards securing perchorsk in return and after the job was done and everyone else had moved out suvorov let them stay on and turn the dry upper levels into living quarters serviced by hydroelectric power from the dam they had vehicles and documentation that allowed them to resupply themselves from beresov from then on they were the official team of engineers responsible for servicing and running the dam as for the dams continued existence that was easily justified in that the bulk of its electrical power had been rerouted to the service of local logging camps and other communities and you were in the dark about all this despite trasks respect for the other a and the fact that so far the premiers every word had been the truth a still he was relentless in his pusuit of all the answers i was kept in the dark about it turchin told him ben i dont control the armed forces and i never have if they want me to know something then they tell me and if i require their services i tell them and thats it bringing a democracy to life isnt easy trask said neither is killing communism said the other then went on to explain oh they are still there the hardliners and so were a how do you say it a between a rock and a hard place the old guard on the one hand and all the greedy opportunists like suvorov on the other do you know what happens to a russian bank if it runs out of money trask shrugged it goes bankrupt no they turn it into a pizza house huh among the muscovites that is currently a joke heres another thats not so funny what does a general do when theres no money to fund his parades or pay his troops and his pensions only good for cheap vodka and cabbage soup and trask nodded he goes goldprospecting but you know no one lives forever not me and not you somewhere there must be documentation on the perchorsk project the gate the complex and everything that happened there while were alive of course well do our best to protect such records such secrets but when were dead or no longer in office a what then if not suvorov sooner or later someone else would have tried it i thought of that a long time ago said turchin also i liked nathan and im sure i would like his people there was something about him that was very russian you know and in my way well im a humanitarian tooyoull just have to take my word for that so i took what precautions i could precautions long before mikhail suvorov found out about perchorsk i was destroying everything i could find on that place every bit of documentation records reports you name it not the experiment you understand not the projekt itself a for its better that men should learn from their mistakes a but the horror that came after it the very knowledge of a vampire world and i was quite successful perhaps even too successful for nowwhy even the socalled opposition knows a lot more about it than i do and certainly more than anyone else we always did said trask of course you did yes a and of course you do a for you have even been there to nathan keoghs world in an alien parallel dimension but isnt that a peculiar circumstance in itself since perchorsk and the gate lie deep inside my homeland and if you were me wouldnt you feelleft out not really trask shook his head no one who saw what i saw experienced what i experienced would ever want to go back there believe me you must consider yourself fortunate and as for general mikhail suvorov well you can consider him unfortunate hes dead gustav oh and turchin lifted a great bush of an eyebrow does that explain it then the accident or vandalism or whatever it was at the romanian refuge was that suvorov you know about the refuge i have my sources turchin shrugged for the moment at least trask let that one slide and said no it wasnt mikhail suvorovabut it was as a direct result of his invasion of sunsidestarside that was what brought it about and he quickly told the russian premier everything that had happened including the fact that three great vampires were now at large in the world and that he and ebranch were trying to hunt them down and that is why youre here we believe that one of them is here in australia yes and turchin said ah then that would explain why initially you were on the other side of the continent and not here in brisbane and so its a pure coincidence that the trail has led you here you think that he your man shall we say is close by hes not far away thats for sure said trask and now i have a question for you go ahead if you knew we were in the west in the gibson desert on the other side of australia why did you ask my headquarters if id be attending the conference also how did you know we were in western australia in the first place thats two questions turchin smiled trask nodded yes but please dont spoil things by lying to me on either one of them to you turchin raised that eyebrow again do you think thats likely ben no because i know it isnt possible said the other i was reminding you of that fact thats all i dont need reminding the premier told him and i say again im not here to lie to you but to ask for your help and now you ask how i know so much very well then listen when our russian equivalent of your ebranch failed a and failed so very spectacularly at the hands of harry keogh a then esp as a weapon was largely discredited and the russian organization disbanded or at least it was officially disbanded for our military commanders downtoearth fellows who would rather put their faith in conventional spying techniques wanted nothing more to do with it which made it an ideal tool for a premier whoa awho was pretty much powerless but desperate to keep an eye on things trask finished it for him you yourself gustav you are now in charge of the opposition covertly yes whats left of it turchin nodded and youve been using your mindspies to watch us dont look so hurt ben havent you been watching me and mine trask thought about it and grinnedand was serious again in a moment but you still havent told me why you asked my hq if i was attending the conference the other smiled it was my way of telling you that i was attending without spelling out a request to meet with you still sharp as a tack trask said and okay so as you now know i too have a problemshit i mean the whole world has a problem three of them and big ones but yours has to be urgent too and probably personal else you wouldnt be taking chances talking to me obviously we need to make a deal and we will a mutually beneficial arrangement but i cant do or promise anything until i know what your problem is urgent yes definitely said turchin but personal not any longer not after what you have told me for it seems to me our problems mesh becoming one and the same very well i know one of yours a or ours as it now appears a and the worst of them at that that there are vampires in our world but somehow i think theres a lot more than that to it am i right a tangled skein yes trask nodded but synchronous all coming together at the same time and meanwhile our time is flying so okay you first just what is your problem comrade chapter twentysix dilemmas dreams and deadspeak my problems plural are not so simple said gustav turchin suvorov told a handful of his military cronies that he was onto something big also that hed probably be incommunicado for a while but in the event he was gone for too long they should come to me for answers well some eighteen months ago they started to ask questions not too many for with suvorov out of the way they had been playing their own hands these are people with small armies of their own funded by the drugs trade i suspect for they certainly cant be getting it through official channels why not because the bank is broke anyway sooner or later theyll become more insistent and im the one whom theyll squeeze for information obviously i dont want to tell them anything about perchorsk so what can i tell them next problem the perchorsk complex is still dry the gate stands open and the wamphyri are back in sunsidestarside which means of course that the gate has to be closed but how since mikhail suvorovs gang of criminal engineers are still in control up there standing guard on the place and waiting for his return which brings up another question how long before some of them decide to follow him through the gate well despite that the complex is isolated remote still i cant attack it even if i had the military muscle i wouldnt dare use it for fear of attracting the rest of suvorovs colleagues to perchorsk there you have it its a vicious circle and frankly i cant see any easy way to break out of it me neither said trask frowning but that doesnt mean its hopeless in ebranch i have a good many firstclass problemsolvers and i promise ill do what i can but first let me get it straight no one else knows about sunsidestarsides mineral riches now that suvorov is dead no not that im aware of and there are no documents to lead anyone in that direction none that i know of turchin shook his head then what it boils down to is this youve got to find a way to tell mikhail suvorovs cronies hes dead while simultaneously ensuring that they dont go looking for him what turchin was at once alarmed and without telling them how or where he died surely a that is if you would save nathans world from uttermost destruction for if you think for a moment they wouldnt go searching for suvorov youre wrong they would and they would see what they would see and having seen itthen they would turn a whole world into a nuclear chemical and biological wasteland zfthey managed to get back here to tell about it said trask but in any case youre right eventually well have to get into perchorsk and close the gate for good this time precisely until which time the problems remain trask was silent for a moment then said as for the one weve just formulated how to get into perchorsk and close the gate i may soon have the answer to that one at least but not right now its something im working on harry keogh could have done it said turchin knowingly perhaps wistfully harrys dead said trask but nathan isnt said turchin and he owes me trask shook his head no nathan cant help us not right now he has problems of his own in sunsidestarside and there isnt any way we can contact him but didnt you say you were working on something something someone yes dont ask me any more about it turchin nodded i see but dont lose hope trask told him like i said well do what we can meanwhile youll have to sit tight play dumb play dumb turchin snorted i may be the premier but i cant hold these people off forever suvorov and a good many men scientist and soldier both have gone missing and they believe i have the answers and when i wont supply them then theyll think im involved then keep out of their way for as long as you can i intend to said turchin that is the other reason im here in brisbane because it keeps me out of russia and thats why those friends of mine in the other car thosea those goons awhy those goons are here yes turchin tried to smile but it was a futile effort to make sure ill find my way back home again hub you could seek political asylum which might solve my problem but it wouldnt solve ours yours russias or the worlds so what will you do these conferences look like theyll go on forever certainly for the rest of this year here and in london brussels rio de janeiro calcutta you name it i shall attend them all one after the other if thats at all feasible and of course i shall sweat and worry and wait for you to come up with an answer and at the same time do something for me said trask ah yes your problems said turchin i had almost forgotten that this isnt a onesided affair so then what can i do for you its all part of the same problem trask told him remember that and it might give you an incentive first call off your mindspies if were to work together a or at least on the same wavelength a you dont need to be watching me but on the other hand i do need them to be watching out for me or rather for vampires but theres more than one kind of bloodsucker involved here you mentioned the illicit drugs trade its no big secret how the socalled russian mafia are flushing your people and your country down the toilet but in another way a different way theyre also connected with our problem in general so heres what i want you to do and he quickly explained what he wanted information from turchins side on the moscow mafias connection with marseille with specific reference to luigi castellanos organization and its operation in the northern mediterranean and this man castellano is of particular interest to us he finished up hes a dark horse indeed my people in the branch havent so far been able to pin him down and interpol has next to nothing on him i mean its not unusual for a drugs boss to keep a low profile but this ones nearinvisible and frankly i want his backside in a sling turchin looked doubtful but doesnt this smack of common or garden police work how does it fit into the big picture im trying to help someone who may soon be in a very good position to help me a or us trask answered if i scratch his back with a bit of luck hell scratch ours and turchin nodded til see what i can do is there anything else you can try to find out just exactly what well be going up against if or when we do try to take perchorsk trask said the russian premier looked at him indeed his dark glinting eyes bored into him as he inquired with a british force do you mean in which case you might require a route of access not to mention one of egress an escape route good idea said trask you can look into that too by all means and you can think how to give us cover in the event of political flak that is if we were seen to be involved but at the moment i dont see it as a problem its like you said perchorsk is remote isolated oh and you can come and go into foreign lands and alien places at will can you and now turchins gaze was even more intense but trask only said weve talked enough and our times up then he switched on the intercom and said mr smith the hotel if you please in a little while turchin said well it seems our business is done for now but if thats all you want and if things eventually work out it would appear i get the best of the bargain trask looked at him and shook his head i understand what youre saying gustav but i think its a very narrow viewpoint the way i see it the whole world gets the best of the bargain which is to say we all come out of it aliveand as men turchin shrugged and answered yes yes of course youre right still on a momenttomoment basis ones own skin is oddly precious but trask only said how about ones soul and a little later while turchin thought about that a if he thought about it a the limo arrived at his hotel and trask was long gone before the second limo drew up where turchin stamped angrily to and fro waiting for his minders tfw he grunted as they got out of the car couldnt at least one of you have made an effort to stay with me but premiera the senior man began to protest no buts turchin snapped i shall report your inefficiency back in moscow and ill also be making a strong complaint here a complaint the others jaw dropped of course fool no no not about you but my driver and this bloody conference official this mr era smith indeed yes both the driver and the official were smiths eh yes i know that you idiot please try not to inform me of what i already know but damn youd think that at least one of them would know the way to the hotel wouldnt you by the time the precog lan goodly picked up the locator david chung from brisbanes international airport trask was in bed asleep but he had left a message not to be disturbed with a note that said david welcomea but im afraid you will have to start swarming in the morning right now were all badly in need of a few hours sleep i imagine it must be pretty much the same for you what with jetlag and all lan make sure the do knows to wake me if anything important comes in during the night other than that give me a shake when the suns up and theres a pot of coffee on the go thanks jake cutter had had his fill of sleep en route so he thought he sat up downstairs and played a quiet game of poker with the warrant officer commanders of the military contingent from the second jetcopter by three in the morning however they were all yawning then deciding to call it a night each of them went off to his cramped sleeping quarters jake didnt know it but on the other side of his bunks thin plasterboard panelling liz merrick had taken the cubicle next to his acting on trasks instructions she was intent on getting into his mind and following his progress through whatever esoteric activities might take place in his a and whoever elses a head or heads still not keen on what she was doing liz had nevertheless come to realize its importance frustrated when jake stayed up she had tried to wait him out and failed but as finally he went to his bunk and tossed and turned a while before settling down she was disturbed and came awake following which it became a matter of establishing telepathic rapport as jake grew still and his breathing deepened so liz concentrated on strengthening her now instinctive connection with his subconscious mind inviting his detached thoughts to mingle with her own then for a while there was nothing just a vague uneasiness of psyche as jakes shields relaxed and his thoughts automatically sought to rearrange themselves into typical dream patterns or perhaps into something else and before too long liz found herself nodding again until she came starting awake to an unnatural psychic stillness or pent awareness which had its origin in jake next door he was motionless and physically asleep but psychically his mind was something else it too was still a breathlessly still a like a cat watching a mouse emerge nervously from its hole or more probably like someone in an empty house suddenly aware of an unusual sound in the night he was listening to something a but so intently a and for a moment liz thought he had detected her presence but no while jakes attention was definitely rapt upon a subconscious something it wasnt focussed on liz at all on what then and so for an hour liz listened to jake as attentively as he was listening to some sensed but unheard other or others but with little or no result on occasion he would come alive and ask who are you or he would say i know you are there a i hear you whispering a so why not talk to me instead of about me but even though liz was given to understand something of this she sensed rather than heard what he said because jake wasnt speaking to her directly and his recently discovered shields while they werent fully engaged were neverthless shrouding his thoughts until unable to bear the notknowing any longer she tried to break in on him and ask who is it jake do you know them what are they talking about at which the doors of jakes mind at once slammed shut and she found herself locked out entirely for a while at least but lying there on her bed liz believed she knew who he had been trying to talk to and that was knowledge that sent a shudder down her spine so that even in the oppressive heat of this el nifio night still she felt cold and she also knew how he had detected her and shut her out it was the difference for the precog lan goodly had had it right when hed said when you heard jake speaking or thinking that was your telepathy working you heard him because hes alive but the othersthey were in a different category using a different mode deadspeak yes the difference between a live conversation and a dead one they were talking a arguing among themselves a about him jake cutter and jake knew it more than that he knew or suspected who or what they were which was something he had yet to remember and admit in his waking hours perhaps because no sane man would ever want to admit such a thing well with the possible exception of a handful of dubious psychic mediums the dead in their graves were talking about him and jake could hear them like the buzzing of bees in a clover field or more properly the rustle of dry leaves on a wintry garden path for bees and flowering clover are redolent of burgeoning life while the rustle of fallen leavesisnt all of the voices belonged to strangers he didnt know a or hadnt known a a single one of them and while it was quite obvious that they heard him no one bothered to answer jake on the few occasions when he felt galvanized to break in on their conversation but his brief bursts of eager questioning invariably found longdrawnout silences following in their wake and the worst of it was that these voices seemed afraid to talk out loud they whispered so that he found it difficult to follow what they were saying but they seemed to be arguing the pros and cons jakes merits against his drawbacks to what end he couldnt rightly say we dont a we darent a let them in among us one of the voices said quite clearly while another mumbled but he isnt one of them see his light hums like a lantern in the dark and we feel its warmth only the necroscope a only harry keogh and his sons were ever like this a beacons in our everlasting night or places to warm ourselves in the presence of the living our only contact with the world and all the loved ones we left hehind and another voice said but in the end even the necroscope succumbed is that what you would have us dop befriend this one and give him access to the deadpandifhe too were seduced a what then a vampire in our midst and one who knows our every thought and secret but the difference between a necroscope and a necromancer vast andmonstrous said yet another whose voice shuddered we cant risk giving such a gift to anyone who would misuse it but he already has the gift said the voice or its owner who spoke in jakes defence and given to him by harry himself if we can believe what she has said ah but shes not long cold naive in the ways of the long night what can she know she knew harry and what good did that do herp like so many others before her and like harry himself she too became a victim no shes no guarantee and as for harry dont speak of him the teeming dead know all about him but harry never harmed us he was our friend and champion right toto the end but here the defending voice grew very quiet and uncertain and what an end said another small voice when the necroscope must jlee his own world in order to keep faith she was the last of the living who harry spoke to the one who was unafraid came back she says he made promises a and he kept them true said another more doleful voice but harry isolated himself for the sake of the living not for the dead i say we should trust the woman the other insisted no said the doleful one for in the end she brought down a doom upon herself why she was fortunate that she only died and nowa if we trust this one on her word a perhaps she will bring a doom on all of us at which point zek jake tried again to cut in is it zek youre talking about zek foener and again a long cold silence until out of nowhere i presented your case jake and now we must let them talk it through talk what through im not with you if the great majority the teeming dead decide that they dont want you to have or to use deadspeak zek explained then you can talk all you like and they wont listen theyll simply ignore you oh theyre drawn to you a were all drawn to your warmth jake a but at the same time theyre afraid of you they were afraid of nathan too once upon a time but nathan proved himself showed them they were mistaken if he was here nowwell he could far better plead your case than i can and what about harry jake said where is he couldnt the necroscope er plead my case a whatever thats supposed to mean a even better nof any longer zek answered he did something to upset them somethinghappened to him she answered carefully so jake tried to reason it out harry is dead but the great majority wont have any truck with him yet you get along okay with him and that thing in the sump was positively clinging to him all very weird ifebranch or harry himself had wanted you to know certain things then im sure they would have told you said zek but jake was still puzzling it out trask lan goodly and lardis a yes and liz too a theyve all had a go at hinting at something without being specific they seem concerned that once i know the whole thing or when i can see the big picture then ill run from it but surely it would have to be something terrible to scare the great majority who have absolutely nothing to lose yet even the dead wont spit it out up front they speak in whispers as if afraid to even talk about it not only that but harry keogh a oncepowerful metaphysical mind is now an outcast among his own kind so what in hell did he do jake sensed that he must be close now but so did zek who was anxious to divert him and jake she cut in youll have an explanation all of this will be explained eventually a or youll work it out for yourselfa but for now let it go and let the teeming dead deliberate the wisdom of the ages is down in the earth jake i cant see that theyll make a mistake on your account know theyll let you ineventually huh he snorted in a way theyre just like trask even like you zek everyone seems to think i should want to be in a that i should consider it a privilege a but all of these ebranch types will tell you their talents are a curse so why is it different for me why should i accept a curse and just what sort of a curse is it anyway i mean that is what this is all about isnt it the stuff that trask isnt telling me the bottom line the downside then for a while there was silence in the psychic aether until zek said i cant ask you to trust me cant promise you anything for the dangers are enormous but one thing is certain you can be the new necroscope you are the necroscope if only youll accept it i would accept it he told her then i have accepted it in a way for how can i deny what is but if theres a short cut to myawell to my being a then why cant i take it now and as for the drawbackssurely its my right to know what they are i mean whats the big mystery jake zek answered harry keogh was born with his skills or with some of them at least but youve had them thrust upon you what came naturally to harry is coming unnaturally to you but some things are so unnaturala and the very possibility of others is so frightening a as to make deadspeak and the mobius continuum seem mundane by comparison now if that was intended to give me confidencea jake started to say only to be cut off as zek broke in personally you wouldnt have been my choice but you were harry keoghs choice which has to be good enough for he must have had good reasons and now there are others i have to talk to others to convince a on your behalf yes a on the far side of the world before i go however it seems only fair to tell you youre not making it easy jake that seems to be one of my big problemsa he started to say then realized that she was gone but i am here jake always said another voice phlegmy lustful and darkly sinister close and even too close to hand the voice of korath mindsthrall fading to a distant bubbling chuckle and in a little while coming to jake as if from far far away the whispering of the teeming dead started up again but it was now more fearful than ever morning found jake in an introspective mood but before he was up and about liz took the opportunity to have a word in private with trask about her experience of the previous night they were out in the grounds walking under the high wall breathing easy while still the sun hung low in the east it was early and the dawn chorus of various parrot species was clattering in the still air another hour or two the air would be dry and subtropical brisbane baking in furnace heat trask heard liz out was silent a while thinking it over then he asked her he was definitely using deadspeak i dont think sobut does it matter i mean the way i understand it as a necroscope a or the necroscope a his very thoughts are deadspeak unless hes shielding his thoughts the dead will hear him thinking and they will always know where he is its like an extra sense their only sense they cant see hear feel taste or smell but theyll know when hes near trask shook his head defeatedly i probably know as much about deadspeak as anyone else he sighed indeed more than anyone else but i still dont know about it i talk about it yes a i know it exists a but sometimes its hard to believe in it so dont ask me about it because i dont know hell liz youre the telepath it was deadspeak she said or at least he was listening to deadspeak listening to a my god a to dead people conversing in their graves and they were talking about him that was all i got the fact that he could hear them and was trying to join in their conversation but they wouldnt let him huh trask grunted who can blame them neither would i let him in if i could help it his bloody attitude but to mature to be the necroscope he has to be able to talk to them right thats part of it yes well lets just hope it comes to him as everything else will have to come to him a the good and the bad and meanwhile you keep an eye or an ear on him youre still hot sure of jake are you liz said trask shrugged im not sure hes sure of us and despite what he has said i know he still has his own agenda anyway i spoke to premier turchin about that and im hoping he can come up with some answers if we can just find a way to lay that one ghost a kill off the one thing thats burning a hole in jakes brain this revenge thing this course hes set onamaybe it will leave him with an open mind you mean with castellano out of the way jake would more easily be able to concentrate on the job in hand right so turchin will try to dig some dirt on this fellow see if he can get something solid on him if we could lock him away it would be a start but lan doesnt think that would be enough not for jake and the hell of it is i understand i know how jake feels think yourself lucky liz that you dont know the kind of hatred were all capable of what if i should tell you that i would gladly give my right arm at the shoulder just to see nephran malinari writhing burning on a cross and to revel in the stink of his smoke well now im telling you and i mean it and jakes no different she said with a small shiver neither was the necroscope harry keogh trask told her and neither am i few men are when the crime and the pain it brings are nasty enough an eye for an eye liz but in fact jake hardly knew that girl he knows that she was raped and tormented and died horribly because of him he knows it was fixed so that hed take the blame and that castellano tried to have him killed in the jail in turin thats enough it would be enough for me too yet youre still hard on him you think hard on him but the other shook his head hes hard on himself anyway let it go now and lets hope turchin comes up with something hearing footsteps on the gravel drive they looked toward the house it was the precog lan goodly he came in his accustomed longlegged lope a with a long face too a for all the world a cadaverous mortician fresh coffees on the go he said in his piping fashion and did i hear someone mention turchin what about him said trask it was on the early news the precog answered hell be attending a couple of conference sessions this morning but tonight or tomorrow hes out of here and back to moscow what trask frowned moscow is the last place hed want to be right now what happened a fist fight apparently goodly answered in turchins hotel bar last night an australian delegate got drunk accused the premier pointblank of lying about russias soft ecological policy went on to call him a puppet mouthpiece for his industrial and military masters back home which right now is true as far as it goes trask nodded mainly because he has no other choice so what else turchin got a drink thrown in his face before his minders stepped in and started throwing their weight around the upshot is that hell speak today a state russias case protest about his treatment and what have you a and take the first plane out tomorrow tonight if he can get one turning it over in his mind trask stroked his chin that doesnt sound like gustav turchin to me he said long before he made premier he was a diplomat could talk his way through a minefield something like this happensi just cant see him letting it happen he shook his head not unless he wanted it to happen in which caseit has to be a ploy a ploy goodly looked surprised an excuse to get him out of here trask said he has a couple of things to organize in moscow i made a deal with him gave him one or two problems to solve on our behalf its possible that the only place he could work on it is back in russia and isnt there another earth year conference starting in oslo in just a few days time acid rain or some such ill give you odds thats his next stop hes something of a fox gustav turchin im betting hell go home set a few wheels turning then head for oslo and of course with the rest of the world baying at his heels it will make him something of a hero with his own people a temporary thing but it ought to distract his enemies a while anyway and whatevers going on wish him luck gustav has come through for us in the past and he probably will again ill brief you on our conversation later gustav said goodly firstname terms right said trask its called detente my friend and with the opposition as it happens well it wont be the first time tell me more said goodly wideeyed later trask said again as they headed back towards the house chapter twentyseven mindsmog in general trasks briefing would be the very simplest thing as yet he wasnt speaking to a full team a and he wasnt about to mention his private arrangement with premier gustav turchin to any others than core members of ebranch a but in the current lull he knew that he needed to keep his people sharp keep them in the picture and give them some sort of incentive thus while he intended to stick to a loose broadscreen scenario or overview still he would remind them of what they were dealing with here emphasizing the extreme dangers of the job in hand his audience included everyone available which left only the technician jimmy harvey doing duty officer in the ops room but in fact trasks words were directed mainly at the australian military contingent dressed in casual lightweight summer civvies and while for the moment they didnt much look like soldiers in fact these young specialforces officers were the best that their vast country had to offer which was to say they were bloody useful in a scrap mate i know weve been over some of this before trask began but i just want to make it plain what were dealing with that job we did in the gibson desert bruce trennier and his creatures it wasnt big stuff trennier was a lieutenant a righthand man but he wasnt the boss by any means just what he and those others were doing out there in the middle of nowhere we still arent sure maybe that entire setup was just a bolthole somewhere that the big chief could run to if things went wrong but as for the boss himselfa who incidentally could as easily be herself a he or she is here not far away from us even as i speak at least thats our belief its what our experts are telling us now that night when we camped out in the gibson desert after the fireworks were over one of you a no names no pack drill a asked me a question normally it would be a perfectly reasonable question why couldnt we take a lesser creature a thrall captive in order to talk to him study him and try to see what makes him tick which as ive said would seem reasonableif we were dealing with an entirely human enemy but circumstances being what they are and our enemy being what he is your question told me that you were either poorly informed or you hadnt understood your original briefing or you really didnt appreciate what youd been dealing with that night and for all i know it mightnt be just one man im speaking about here but all of you could have the same problem so despite that ive had experience of these things in the past a or maybe because i have a and you people are newcomers to the game i tried to put myself in your shoes maybe it had seemed too easy unpleasant yes but not really difficult and i began to see what the problem was youve probably seen yourselves as men with a nasty job to dobut someone has to do it right i mean maybe it seemed to you that these people you were killing were like what a escapees from an isolation ward somewhere a and you were putting them down simply to ensure they didnt pass on the infection a pretty effective preventative measure certainly but perhaps a bit drastic to your way of thinking so lets go back to that perfectly reasonable question why dont we just immobilize these things lock them away and study them and wouldnt that be a far less drastic solution well let me tell you again a let me remind you a about vampires oh they can be downed shoot at them with bullets especially silver bullets and you can knock them downeven if they dont always stay down burn them a burn them entirely a and they die lock them up in silver cages and keep their systems topped up with garlic so that they cant work up a head of steam and you might even manage to confine them a for a little while but as for studying them only make a mistake a your first mistake just one a and you become the prisoner and you dont get a second chance think of it this way men have devised chemical and biological weapons toxins and living viruses that could wipe us all out a destroy mankind itselfa if they were to get loose we keep these things in secure laboratories where we study and even develop them well when i say we i mean men scientists in outlawed lands mainly dabbling in a mainly outlawed science for happily a majority of governments have long since banned all such agents they deem them simply too terrible for study or development and theyre right but the unpleasant fact is that because some people continue to experiment with this stuff our people are obliged to follow suit in order to find vaccines and antidotes they dont want us to be caught with our immune systems down as it were so yes these terrible poisons still exist in just about every country thats capable of handling them but by god youd better believe they take damn good care not to spill this stuff so then why am i bothering to tell you what you probably already know and what does it have to do with vampires and the wamphyri well its this simple if you think of the wamphyri and their works in just such terms of reference you wont go far wrong that is you have to think of them as something that must be destroyed but whatever you do dont think of them on the same scale of danger i mean we all know that the richter scale is a yardstick for the power of earthquakes but if it was a scale for all potential disasters then to cover manmade biological weapons it would have to stretch from the current nine to ninety and to cover the wamphyri it would need to carry on from ninety to infinity thats by my personal scale of reckoning and i am not wrong and remember our manmade toxins and viruses arent bent on escaping they cant thinkrut only imprison a vampire and from that moment on hes thinking of ways to get free he wants to be free like you and wants you to be a prisoner like him the prisoner of something growing inside you that will gradually make you someone a something a else something other so then now maybe you can see why we cant suffer a vampire to live the point being we really wont suffer a vampire to live be sure of this if you get infected theres no cure which means well kill you oh itll be clean but it will happen so remember a moment or so after one of us a i include myselfa shows up positive he also shows up deadand on that point enough saidnow lets move on we think its likely that our quarry has a hideout somewhere in the mountains where they come from the wamphyri are very fond of their aeries a the places where they live a and the higher the better unfortunately that doesnt tell us very much doesnt narrow down his or her location for as you know as well or better than i do there are mountains galore around here but theres also a paradox in that the wamphyri dont go much on sunlight and right now weve rather a surfeit of that too weird wouldnt you say that our alien friend has chosen to set up shop here well maybe not you see hes not dumb he knows that we know his habits and that weve known about his invasion from square one that means he also knows that normally this would be one of the last places wed expect to find him so where better to hide himself away and do his thing whatever that thing is the only problem is he might also know that we found and dealt with bruce trennier and by now he could well be expecting us to come looking for him here indeed he could already know that weve arrived and if so hell be doubly dangerous because therell be little or no element of surprise okay we have a couple of days before our backup squads and the big ops vehicle are in situ and that has to be one of our first priorities to find suitable and preferably nonobtrusive sites with access to principal mountain approach roads where we can harbour these men and vehicles as they arrive so as of noon today well be airmobile again but not in the jetcopters that youve grown used to they may have been great in the desert but to brisbanes civilian population a not to mention our quarry a aircraft that look like they do are bound to attract attention so for the time being theyll be on standby in hangars at the airfield where we came in so theres a firm in town that does aerial sightseeing trips by helicopter north along the coastal range to gladstone and south over the macphersons and along the richmond range as far as grafton which is ideal for our purposes in that it covers the ground were interested in and the pilots know all the routes by heart and have firstclass local knowledge alas that we cant simply commandeer this firm its men and machines but no that would be to give the show away and so well be paying our way but i will try to get us a bit more clout than the average tourist obviously we have to have the final say on where we fly and what we look at so later this morning ill speak to prime minister lance blackmore and see if he can sort something out for us very well so assuming were airborne again what will we be looking for military commanders youll be looking for naturally concealed campsites for your contingents harbour areas and access routes and youll also be checking your maps doing an aerial reconnaissance of the entire area as for my people well be scanning the mountain heights for our quarry in truth we dont really know what were looking for we can only hope well know it when we see it but it isnt all blind luck two of my men lardis lidesci and david chung are specialists in this regard one of them will travel in each chopper okay thats it from midday or soon after we should have these planes at our disposal get your maps cameras and whatever else youll need sorted out now as for myself well much as id like to be going with you my duty for the time being is right here someone has to watch the shop a final reminder this is a covert operation try not to give anything away to these civilian pilots have a set of answers ready to hand for instance you could be fire chiefs carrying out preliminary aerial surveys ensuring there wont be a second great fire of brisbane something along those lines im sure youll think of something thats it and i hope i didnt bore you too much gentlemen thanks for your time and attention brisbanes skytours helicopters were small conventional pleasure machines custombuilt for the job capable of carrying four passengers they had wraparound plexiglass side windows which allowed for superb viewing but would prove a shade vertiginous for people with height problems as the old lidesci would later describe it it was like flying in a bubble a and he didnt much like it the only other problem was their range two hundred and eighty miles was their safety limit without refuelling which meant that a chopper on the northern route must land at a small airport in gladstone and on the southern route in grafton the good side of that was that it gave the passengers time to take on food and water to see them through the return trip the pilots were isolated up front behind seethrough bulkheads and they communicated with their passengers on headsets but since in the main their commentaries consisted of monologues learned parrotfashion over years of flying the same routes pretty soon the drone of their voices became one with the whirring of rotors and ceased to have meaning if passengers didnt want to listen they removed their headsets when they wished to converse or ask questions they replaced them a simple system in the early afternoon jake flew south toward the macpherson range with lan goodly the old lidesci and an australian major whose rank was never on display or used to unfair advantage he had his job to do and was simply another member of the team but truth be told it was a strange team the precog was there in the uncertain hope that should they fly over an aerie a in whatever shape or form a he might catch a glimpse of some significant future event and recognize it for what it was the sas major had his own tasks to perform he understood that jake goodly and the old man were specialists in their own right but in what specific areas he neither knew nor cared as for jake ostensibly he had been sent along so that he could get a good look at the lie of the land but he assumed that in fact it was to keep him out of trasks way and he was partly right trask hadnt wanted him around cluttering up the place asking awkward questions generally getting in the way but that wasnt the whole story mainly jake had been sent out with lardis and lan goodly in the hope that something of their team spirit might rub off on him and truth to tell jake was actually developing a strong feeling of kinship with the old lidesci and he already acknowledged a growing measure of respect for goodlythis despite that the precog seemed as enigmatic as ever as for the australian major jake wasnt about to mention his own brief career as a member of the original british special air service for after all he had been required to leave in rather short order and compared to this professional would seem the veriest amateur but at least he had remembered some of his trainingthe useful more deadly bits anyway and there they sat scanning the beautiful sunbleached coastal strip far below the valleys and hills but especially the rearing mountains as the skytours helicopter whirled them south and their pilottourguides monologue droned on and on in their headsets flying north along the coastal range the locator david chung shared a second skytours helicopter with two sas warrant officers and liz merrick it said a lot for their personal discipline and commitment that these fit young australians were able to concentrate on their work with liz along for her part she was aware of the occasional appreciative glance at her curvaceous figure in tightfitting jeans and loose shirt but while the sas men found this british sheila easy to talk to frank and friendly they also knew that she was a member of ebranch and so must be special in ways other than the purely physical and she was treated accordingly with the utmost courtesy liz was part of this second team in her capacity as a telepath not that her talent was in any way specific to vampires but if david chung were to detect mindsmog that might provide her with a target area a direction in which to cast her mental net if only to corroborate the locators find before letting her go however ben trask had cautioned her that that was as much as she could do and had warned her liz youd better know what you could be up against that stuff with bruce trennier childs play by comparison with what you could expect from a real lord of the wamphyri i remember once over a oh it seems like a million years ago a how harry keogh wouldnt hear of zek using her talent anywhere near janos ferenczy janos was a powerful mentalist too but according to what lardis has said about malinari janos couldnt have held a candle to him and it might well turn out that nephran malinari is our man that hes the one were dealing with here its unlikely to be szwart were fairly certain of that so it has to be either vavara or malinari but if its the latter and if he really is better than janos listen twentyodd years ago i had a friend called trevor jordan he was ebranch and a telepath janos ferenczy caught trevor spying on him and got into his head a i mean literally and later at a distance of some seven hundred miles janos was able to invade and even inhabit jordans mind and just to show us how good he was he made jordan put a gun to his own ear and pull the trigger now thatis mentalism o but this nephran malinari isnt just another telepath in his own world in starside four hundred years ago his own kind the wamphyri called him malinari the mind doesnt that say it all anyway weve learned the legends from lardis and the old lidescis word is good enough for me and even if it wasntwell i know ill never forget the things that zek showed me on the night she died that bastard vampire thing trying its best to leech on her mind so im asking you liz please be careful youyoure very special and in my time ive lost too many special people i just need to be sure you fully appreciate the danger i dont want you locking on to something and perhaps receiving something that you dont want and cant get rid of that had been some three hours ago but now trasks words were still echoing in lizs mind when the pilots voice climbed a notch in her headset to declare were going down now folks gladstone next stop so if yerll excuse me ill just radio a pal o mine on the ground tell him to get the beer out o the cooler and slice up a fresh batch o sarnies by the time yerve all freshened up ill be done refuelling and well start back a slightly different route this time if yerd like we can stick more closely to the coast anda no liz interrupted him tm sorry but were especially interested in mountains on the way back it would suit us just fine if youd show us some mountains that we havent seen yet and then perhaps a little selfconsciously er sorry to be a nuisance the pilot glanced back though his window looked from face to face shrugged his shoulders and said suit yerself miss fellers im to accommodate yer as best i can so whatever yer say is okay with me at which liz craned her neck and looked for confirmation from david chung where he sat behind heronly to find that the locators attention indeed his concentration seemed rapt on something that no one else could see with his jaw hanging slack he gazed as if transfixed eastward out across the open sea it lasted for a single moment only then chung started as he became aware of lizs eyes upon him the unspoken question that was written in them his gaze met hers and he halfnodded halfshrugged then said ii dont know i cant be sure it was so faint they were settling fast towards a small airport the locator snapped out of it put his headset on and asked the pilot whats out there i mean east er the sea exactly mate the others tinny voice came back seeming to vibrate as the pitch of the rotor vanes changed to landing mode the sea a handful o little rocks and stretching a thousand miles to the north the great barrier reef and then a laugh sorry but all thats way out o our itinerary they freshened up drank icecold beer out of glasses dripping with condensation ate prawn sandwiches and barbecued chicken and talked while they waited for their pilot to call for them they were in a private skytours suite that overlooked the small airport through a soundproof panoramic window while eating they had watched a handful of planes coming and going not said too much been glad of the overhead fan that struggled o oo to waft a stream of warm sluggish air around the room oo but eventually curiosity had got the better of the military men liz was aware of it but didnt find it intrusive and anyway they were all members of a looseknit team and the fact was that apart from trasks briefings a and that these men had been ordered to accept all branch members as voices of authority here a there hadnt been and could never be a great deal of understanding of ebranchs role not to disparage the military but it would have proved extremely difficult for entirely military minds to grasp the concepts motivations and operating practices of an esporiented intelligence agency and indeed they werent required to but now here in the intimacy of a much smaller grouping these young soldiers had been presented with an opportunity to dig just a little deeper on the other hand and on behalf of ebranch both liz and chung were sworn to a modified version of the official secrets act and so had to be be circumspect in what they revealed youre a psychic right one of the warrant officers a slim wellmuscled crewcut redhead in his early thirties asked of david chung i mean dont take offence but isnt it a bit strange using a what do you call it parapsychology a against bloody awful things such as that nest we burned out in the desert no offence taken said chung but youd do well to remember that im the one who found those bloody things out in the desert and ive been dealing with such things on and offa but mercifully more off than on for some twenty years currently however were definitely on again and likemost of the others in ebranch im getting past my sellby date oh were recruiting young blood all right such as liz here but the years take their toll so on a job like this were obliged to call in different kinds of experts we like to be sure theres plenty of muscle behind the mind like us said the other and chung nodded smiled raised an eyebrow and said no offence but a psychic i mean how can you simply think the location of these creatures like you read their thoughts or something and though he was polite up front in his talking to chung liz couldnt help reading that he was more than a little sceptical she read one or two other things too such as never kid a kidder mr chinaman old red isnt buying it red a nickname no one had used since his teens and one which he wouldnt accept from anyone else despite that it fitted him so well and was how he continued to think of himself so before chung could answer liz told herself to hell with the rules and said whether youre buying it or not my friend mr chung here a who is in fact a fourthgeneration brit despite that his roots are oriental a isnt kidding red the young soldier jerked in his seat instinctively touched a hand to his crewcut and stuttered er my hair right but liz shook her head your thoughts she replied and red the next time i walk into a place ahead of you please try to remember i cant help how i walk and find somewhere else to lookokay fuck me thought the other and liz said no thanks im spoken for jjesus im sssorry the other gasped its okay liz told him but maybe we should change the subject now and yes youre safe i promise not to peek whats going on asked the other soldier genuinely puzzled nothing much liz told him i was reading your friends thoughts thats all yours too if you like oh really the second wo was older and less inquisitive but he did have something on his mind in the chopper liz said just as we were landing you were wondering what was wrong with david like me you noticed the way he was looking out over the sea his expression you saw that the wo said no said liz i overheard it joe a in your head and joe accepted that she had because they had only ever been introduced as warrant officers bygraves and davis let me have one of your maps chung said deciding that liz had gone far enough this area and smallscale covering as much ground as possible red bygraves spread a map on the table and chung began poring over it while he searched he explained im a kind of bloodhound its nothing weird though in fact it was just a knack sort of instinctive but sometimes i can sense where these things are hanging out in the helicopter i got a feeling that there just might be somethingout there he stabbed his index finger at the map their current location then drew it in a straight line east and a little north in that direction anyway and you know its still there but so very faint chung shook his head narrowed his eyes in a frown what we could use really is a little triangulation now that i understand said red let me see the map they let him jostle into position watched him point out a location sandy cape on the northern tip of fraser island and we cant ask the pilot to fly us east and out to sea he went on because that will add air miles and run him low on fuel to get us back to brisbane but theres no reason why he cant fly us over fraser island which lies south of here he did suggest a coastal route right good said chung and as soon as we get over the northern tip of the island i can a well do my thing take a bearing north a and see if we come up with something red looked at liz and youll do what or does this part include you out now liz saw the error of saying anything at all but since it was too late now if david senses anything ill try to well hitch a ride on his probe she said but since this looks like a longdistance thing i really cant be sure get a reading and joe asked chung did this talent of yours really lead your people to that gibson desert nest i mean we havent seen you around until today a and you werent out there a so bruce trennier had a very powerful aura chung answered but as a comparative newcomer among these creatures a even as a lieutenant a he wasnt too good at hiding himself away when he slipped up myself and some other ebranch people we picked him up from london since when the rest of them seem to be masking their presence a a kind of mental camouflage you know so i came out here to get a little closer to the action well and now we might have found some you picked trennier up from london joe said the locator nodded and thought yes like a dense bank of jog on a sunny day fog thats there one minute gone the next minasmog but out loud he only said yes we did to which there was no answer and the two wos could only look at each other and shake their heads in wonder in the other helicopter an hour later jake cutter was lost in his own thoughts somewhat moodily enjoying the mountain scenery when lardis lidesci reached across the narrow aisle jogged his elbow and said something um jake murmured a response he had long since removed his headset and so had lardis i said whats that the old lidesci said again pointing out of the window on his own side of the aircraft why not ask the pilot jake grumbled how am i to know what something is but loosening his belt he stood up leaned across and looked anyway lan goodly was seated in front of lardis feeling the movements he looked back saw where the others were looking they were on the return trip covering different mountains than on the outwardbound leg a thousand feet below a massive geological wrinkle in the macpherson range had left a tightly angled dogleg fold in the westfacing lee of the fold a saddle or roughly oblongshaped false plateau maybe two and a half by four acres in extent stood out in stark contrast to the surrounding heights for it wasnt naked rock anything but at an elevation of almost three thousand feet someone had builta small town no not a town but a complex of sorts with gardens pools fountains a monorail tennis courts bowling greens even a small skislope up against the mountainside and terraced chalets to house the guests the walkways between concentric rows of redtiled chalet accommodations radiated out from a roughly central location a circular garden surrounding a great silvershining bubble of a structure with windows on three levels and a smaller dome on top lardis was lost for words he found it too fantastic but jake only grunted and said you should see las vegasf while in his own mind he wondered a holiday campp a fantastic hotel complex for the jetsetters and beautiful people or maybea an aerie sighed lardis now wouldnt that make a wonderful aerie er without all this sunlight of course the precog was still wearing his headset and he had been conversing with the pilot now he put a hand over the mike and said xanadu and the centrepiece therewhy that can only be kubla kahns pleasure dome put on your headsets the pilot knows some stuff jake and lardis complied heard the pilot tail off there were some private homes here hence the road up the mountain but after the fire some kind of tycoon bought up the land and built this place hes a philanthropist uses the money from this for other good works allegedly huh a typical tax gimmick if you ask me all of these fatcat rich bastards are the same xanadu yeah thats what its called the domes a casino all three floors of it the fire said goodly you mean the brisbane fire nah not the great fire said the other this was back in an earlier el nino the place was a tinderbox and the fire must have started in one of the weekend homes they were simple timber cabins holiday homes you know went up like so much kindling take her lower can you the precog was plainly interested so whats on your mind boss with a chuckle the pilot leaned his machine into a descending spiral you want to wave at the girlies around those pools er something like that said goodly and certainly the girlies were there and sunbronzed fellows too there were three pools situated equidistant from the central dome they glittered like dazzling blue jewels in mediterranean settings and were surrounded by low windbreak walls and mosaicpaved sundecks the sundecks were dotted with chairs and sunbeds and sure enough as the chopper circled lower the girls were sitting up tilting their mirrorshades at the furnace sky waving lazy arms at their imagined aerial admirers thats low enough lardis muttered nervously the next thing you know ill be swimming and the major said mightnt we attract a little too much attention he was on the headset and the pilot heard him so whats the problem he inquired are you worried the people who run the place will complain nah its good free advertising and we do this all the time tourists who can afford it sometimes take time out after theyve seen it to come up for a few days relaxation a though how anyone with red blood in his veins could relax up here is beyond me then the precog said thatthats enough wed better get on our way now and there was a certain edge to his piping voice that had jake looking at him across the aisle he saw that goodlys face was suddenly drawn and noticed how his hands gripped the armrests of his seat part four the hell of it chapter twentyeight here be vampires that evening at the safe house when trasks people had eaten he got them together in the ops room to debrief them and start them working on the correlation of their findings for he knew by then that they had been partially successful a or at least that theyd detected something out of the ordinary a and that a lot might soon depend on their observations for instance the military contingent it was most likely that the siting of the sas backup teams would be based on the as yet unproven suspicions or hunches of trasks espers and in just two days time those men and vehicles would start arriving and moving into harbour areas whose locations were as yet undecided time was of the essence after trask had settled his people down david chung described his temporary contact with something during the landing at gladstone and went on to talk about the system of triangulation that they had devised taking gladstone as the centre of a clock face the locator said the first reading would see the minute hand at some thirteen minutes past the hour or a few degrees north of east as for the second reading over sandy cape that would be about twelve and a half minutes before the hour or northwest chung stood before an illuminated wall map of the area and used his index finger to point out the coordinates then traced the directional lines to their junction some sixty miles out in the open sea which puts it a whatever it is a right there he said but staring at the map he could only offer a baffled shrug the last place on earth that wed expect to find a vampire or vampires right in the middle of an ocean with nothing but water and lots i mean lots of sunlight for miles around but you got readings said trask you got mindsmog so how do you explain it the locator looked at him frowned and said explain it but if it wasnt for liz here id probably simply ignore it a glitch something out of kilter in my heada headache the evidence of the map the location its all against us i mean what would a vampire be doing out there also we know that in the past weve puzzled over similar effects from other espers from talents outside ebranch giving off vibes they dont even know theyve got so but for liz id probably settle for someone on a ship out there a maybe a cruise liner a using precognition to place bets in the casino or maybe telekinesis to drop the ball on his numbers at roulette someone whos extraordinarily lucky who doesnt even know he has a skill a who thinks he has a system a but whos nevertheless been banned from half a dozen mainland casinos thats what id be tempted to think except he paused and looked at liz liz doesnt think so but there again no matter what anyone thinks nothing can change the fact that its sixty miles out to sea trask said but so were those russian nuclear submarines and you havent been wrong about those and i remember the time when a certain jianni lazarides had just such a ship the lazarus out on the mediterranean yes but his real name was janos ferenczy he was wamphyri too one of the very worst and remember just because theres a lot of sunlight it doesnt mean our man has to go out in it he turned to liz david says it might be nothing but he also says you dont think so so what do you think liz looked anxiously from face to face bit her lip and said ben are we right to place this much faith in my talent right now i mean at that kind of range riding davids probei could easily be mistaken im not really sure thata no no no trask cut in waving his hand dismissively impatiently just tell us what you got and let us try to figure it out it isnt the first time weve done this liz and it isnt as if were vying with one another to see who will be first to find these damned things but while no shame attaches to being in error still we do have to find them which means anything is better then nothing so whatever it was you sensed out there lets have it liz trask and chung were on their feet the rest of the team were seated and now liz sat down too and thought about it for a moment casting her mind back she asked herself exactly what it was that she had experienced when the locator took his second reading from the helicopter as it circled high over sandy cape chung sjace a us slightly damp skin gleaming a pale yellow his nostrils pinched eyes slanted more than usual in deep concentration agazing out of his window northwest at the distant curve of the world the horizon the seas wide expanse then his gaze becoming a vacant stare and his eyes almost glazing over as his mindas his mind went out no not his mind but a probe and liz merrick a part of it a riding it like a carrier wave a sharing telepathically in the emptiness of the locators search his farflung probing of the psychic voidor what should be a void but there was something there afaint so very faint but definitely there a and she felt it likelike an emotion as opposed to a conversation like something spiritual or lacking in spirit for it was shivery cold this thing where it walked on her spine with icy feet and now she knew its name well trask was leaning over her and fear liz blurted it out i felt fear the look on her face her great green eyes wide in sudden knowledge where they stared into hisand trask took a pace back from her you were afraid not me no liz shook her head he they a whoever they a were a were afraid thats what it was ben terror gnawing at them eating their hearts out them more than one im sure uncertain a moment ago and now youre sure she shook her head i just wasnt willing to believe that there could ever be such hopelessness such utterly black despair i suppose i thought it was the emptiness the psychic void before davids probe found a well whoever they are a and that the fear was in fact mine but now yes again she shook her head searched for words i know that i personally have never been that afraid that i couldnt be that afraid a unless something happened to cause me to lose all hope all faith trask nodded grimly in short unless youd been vampirizedf ii dont know i imagine so but now trask took a different tack or could it possibly have been fear of discovery had someone detected davids probe and reacted to it liz shook her head no i dont think so it was simply or not so simply a an aura of overwhelming doom good trask grunted and on both counts one that you werent detected and two that therefore whoever it was couldnt have been afraid of you but they were afraid and i think we can all imagine of what he looked up from liz from face to face around the room and paused at lardis lidesci and lardis said thralls these were thralls and fairly recent thralls who dont have much contact with their master but who know hes there nevertheless aye and they have every right to fear him another nest trask nodded why not its entirely possible then he frowned but out at sea my point exactly said chung maps trask said turning to jimmy harvey where he sat at a keyboard jimmy see if the computer has an even smallerscale map of that area and blow it up on the wall there ive been working on it said the other tapping a key consider it done the wall screen turned blue if not entirely blue for in the specified area there were the dotted outlines of reefs and other irregular shapes islands or islets and a legend identifying them as heron island and the bunker and capricorn groups the latter because they lay on or close to the tropic of capricorn other lettering at the top of the map said that this was the capricornia section of the great barrier reef marine park and very quietly trask said so not necessarily a ship after all but looking sick the locator david chung could only shake his head and remark what a fool he is who has no faith in his own godgiven skills trask might have denied it but lan goodly beat him to it not at all the precog said when we use talents like these its against nature i mean even we appreciate that what were doing isnt well mundane is it any wonder were sceptical of our results or that we occasionally fail to see their significance and then trask said youre right lan and i was on the point of making much the same remark but as ive already said this isnt a skills contest how we get there doesnt matter a damn only that we get there where these monsters are concerned the end always justifies the means any means huh said lardis and in starside whenever a man ascends to a vampire lord and becomes wamphyri they have much the same saying a its not the route but the getting there in that respect and except that their evil has been made ten times as great these monsters are much like men you know because they were men said trask and god knows were none of us pure very well now lets get on a but as soon as were done here i want the duty officer to contact our aide in prime minister blackmores office we need authority for liaison with someone high in the administration of the reef marine park we need to know who or what is out there on those islets in the bunker and capricorn groups a moments pause and he turned to goodly lan you and lardis were in the other chopper party and just like david here i know you too have a problem time now to have it out in the open get it cleared up the precog stood up tossed a pamphlet attached to a tourist map onto the table i picked this up at the skytours helipad he said its a freebie a giveaway route map into the macpherson mountains and a colour brochure describing the wonders and benefits of the xanadu health and pleasure resort but thats not all i picked up there was a or i should say there may have been a something else when we flew over the place sitting at the table jake remembered the odd strained look on the precogs face a the way his hands gripped his seats armrests a after theyd descended to have a closer look at the resort and now his interest focussed more definitely on goodly as he saw once again the same nervous tension in the mans face and attitude the thing is goodly went on i have precisely the same problem as david the location all that unhampered sunlight i just cant see how the kind of creature were looking for could exist up thereif thats what it was about seeing trasks face he held up a hand placatingly yes all right i promise i will get on with it but there are complications first as we were descending toward the place so that we could get a better look at it our pilottourguide mentioned a fire that occurred during the el nino back in and i found some of his descriptions vivid and perhaps evocative the place was like a tinderboxit went up like so much kindling et cetera also while weve been here ive heard quite a lot of talk about the great fire of brisbane and what with this awful heat and alla you saw a fire trask cut in goodly nodded but i didnt see its cause and i couldnt tell when it was happening i mean it could have been a mental response to what the pilot had said for example when someone says do you remember this or that other thing you are made automatically to see it relive it in your minds eye do you see it could be that our pilot had evoked just such a response in me and ben if this was one of my things then it was only the very briefest glimpse smoke and leaping flamesgouts of yellow fire roiling up to a night sky and a full moon hanging thereand someone shouting to me to me listening to him trask displayed a kind of amazement as if hed only just realized something that should have been obvious for a long time how long have i known you he said it sometimes seems that ive known you forever and yet ive never thought to ask you a do you sometimes see the past the precog raised an eyebrow said i remember the past just like anyone else and then a wry chuckle its just that i sometimes remember the future too but he was serious again in a moment thats what we have to consider ben the future and we know just how devious that can be or is it perhaps my talent thats devious ive never been able to figure it out okay said the other so you dont know whether it was the past or the future its just one of those times when your talent leaves you in doubt but theres one clue at least oh again goodlys eyebrow you said it was nighttime when xanadu went up in flames anda not xanadu goodly stopped him just a handful of weekend or holiday homes on the false plateau where xanadu stands now whatever trask waved a hand but you did say there was a full moon yes well thatis one hell of a clue he turned to harvey where he sat at the computer keyboard jimmy can you get into the local libraries on that thing harvey looked up from where he was working and smiled but before he could say anything trask said i know dont say it youre way ahead of me the newspapers for the fires of harvey nodded towards the wall screen on the screen just about any timenow and gadgets and ghosts thought jake as headlines sprang into life on the big screen and harvey brought the small print into focus the location date and time everything was there written into the report and trask said good now then jimmy can you crossreference that date with phases of the moon it took but a moment but then trasks shoulders sagged as he slumped into a seat and said damn it all to hell the last thing i wanted a bloody full moon and looking at the precog so maybe you can see the past and not just remember it after all and maybe he cant said jake it was the first time he had spoken and now everyone looked at him and after a while well go on then said trask shouldnt we take the next step jake said the same as we did with david chung i seem to have been hearing about synchronicity coincidence and what have you ever since i collided with this outfit so couldnt this be exactly the same thing i mean just because there was a full moon on the night in question back in that doesnt mean the precog wasnt seeing the future up there at xanadu or arent there going to be any more full moons me im wondering when the next one is due trask frowned stared at jake then turned again to jimmy harvey do it he said and in a very short time the answer was up on the screen three days time trask husked then openmouthed staring at the date and fullmoon symbol and goodly cautioned but does it mean what were thinking are we going to do it or is it our old friend el nino again will it result from us attacking the place and burning out a nest or from a freak of nature a terrible disaster i still cant see how its possible for our quarry to exist up there and jake said neither could the locator see how a vampire could live out on the ocean and maybe im stupid or a lot less bright than you people but i cant see there being a fire up at xanadu without were the cause surely the first thing we do if xanadu isnt what were looking for well warn whoevers responsible about the fire and well be able to tell him when so therell be no loss of life the precog shook his head youre not at all stupid jake in the dark its always the blind who see best but believe me you dont understand the future i dont understand the future and i say again its not knowing what will happen that counts but how its going to happen the only sure thing is once its foreseen then it will happen as for loss of life i did hear that voice calling to me to me rescuers said liz or one of us pulling the teams out said trask didnt you recognize the voice goodly shook his head not over the roaring of the flames the shattering of glass glass said jake did i miss something or is that something you didnt mention before i just this minute remembered it said the precog there was plenty of glass in that topmost dome jake said in the pleasure dome itself black glass from the look of it covering everything but the windows no said the precog not black glass but solar panels a a sort of glass i suppose the upper dome was covered in them a very startling effect but the windows themselves they were glass certainly and they circled all three lower floors trask was looking at the colour brochure you think that the casinos going to burn but goodly could only shrug his defeat its all speculation dont ask me what i think i still dont know for sure if the fire was in the past or the future and im damned if i can see how any kind of vampire could live up there but i can said jake watching harvey searching for xanadu and finally putting that area of the macpherson range onto the screen and as before jake was suddenly the centre of attention it was something lardis said that got me thinking about it he explained me said lardis looking surprised when you said now wouldnt this make a wonderful aerie without all this sunlight of course thats right said lardis i said that look at the map jake told them that dogleg fold and the false plateau sitting in the middle the mountains are much higher and steepsided the fold goes north to south and then backtracks certainly xanadu gets plenty of sunlight from say am to in the evening but the rest of the time its in the shade and during the night the darkness must be utter a except for electric lighting of course artificial lighting cant harm them said trask szwart doesnt like it but it cant kill him only natural light sunlight itself can do that not quite true lardis barked the dweller harry helllanders changeling son used artifa er artificial light yes a in the form of ultra er ultraviolet lamps when he battled the wamphyri in his garden in the mountains west of starside but thats sunlight lardis trask told him artifical ill grant you but sunlight nevertheless and to jake maybe youre right for sixteen or more hours a day the sun isnt in fact shining directly onto that place when it is shining however its doing it very brightly and jake answered but dont they sleep during the day and again lardis in starside when the suns rim came up over the barrier mountains the lords and ladies usually ran to their northermost apartments and there they slept a but even there with drapes at their windows but if they were caught out in the open sunside of the mountains as occasionally happened then they had to find caves or deep holes in the earth til nightfall jake nodded and said to trask so do you think there are no deep holes in the earth in xanadu but that brochure says it all fancy fountains swimming pools saunas and gymnasiums an aerial monorail and a casino i mean do you think that all of that stuff is above ground no a complex like that is like an iceberg you only see its tip all the cellars and conduits the pipelines tunnels sewerage and water systems the reservoirs pump boiler and storagerooms and refrigerators a theyre all underground a or rather theyre on the old bed of the plateau while the resort has been built above them thats why the place looks so clean and uncluttered trask blinked shook his head as if to clear it and said do you know i believe you could be right this creature were looking for could be right there in or under xanadu he tossed the brochure onto the table a place like that where we would least expect to find him then once more he said three days and we have a lot to donot least to prove our point clear the way before we can take any real action prove our point liz looked at him make sure were on the right track trask nodded so we can be certain when we go in that what we want is there and as for clearing the way well the gibson desert job was one thing but xanadu is quite another all of those people well have to find a way to get them out of there before we go in a and without arousing anyones suspicion then offering another curt nod right so lets get to it this night is still young but there may be only three of them left heading for a door leading to an outer room where the sas commanders were poring over their maps trasks heart was a little lighter for now at least he had something to tell them but before leaving he turned and said lan david liz and you too jake im very grateful youve all worked well despite initial doubts but today was only your first time out and youre not finished yet i want you all back in those skytours choppers again tomorrow so maybe we have struck it lucky this first time but who knows what else could be hiding out there then he looked at his technicians the gnomish harvey and the gangling paul arenson but there are more skills than this freaky stuff that we espers use a or that uses us whichever he said our ghosttalents may serve us well but without your gadgets for backup they wouldnt be nearly as effective so well done all of you and now get your thinking caps on and try to look ahead jimmy dig up some plans of xanadu its subsurface systems et cetera lan please draft a comprehensive record of this meeting paul its late now but first thing tomorrow ensure i have access to prime minister blackmores office so that i can organize a liaison with someone on this marine park thing turning away he offered one of his rare smiles and said and that i think is that now i have to speak to our australian friends ill see you all in the morning the next day a saturday they split the teams up lardis jake and liz were together on the northern routes goodly and chung flew south each of them hoping to complement the others strange talent the trips were mainly uneventful the precogs mind was a frustrating blank at least where the future was concerned and the locator darent get too close to xanadu in case someone or something should locate him but in any case and as per trasks orders they were looking at different mountains this time out as for trask himself he had a very satisfying day and when the teams returned to the safe house he was waiting to speak to them this time he brought the sas in on it at least for the first stage of his briefing for while it wasnt his intention to explain his findings in their entirety still he did have to display those targets and advise these men as best possible on what they would be up against this was done with the aid of the wall screen trask supplied the narrative this island in the capricorn group a its grid reference is shown alongside a is our secondary target now ive called it an island but in fact its little more than a rock or coral reef it has a few trees some other tough vegetation nothing much to mention it was a marine park conservation station some years ago but that moved to heron island forty miles away all thats there now is the reef a shallow lagoon a private villa on the island and we presume our enemies but i have to emphasize that they are probably lesser enemies which is to say we dont think theyre of the order of unpleasantness that we were obliged to deal with in the gibson desert however and having said that you should remember that they will be vampires how many of them no more than five or six which is six too many but with a chopper a hired vessel and half a dozen or so of your men a along with jake cutter here and lardis lidesci from our side a that should be sufficient you which is to say the military will have command but youll listen very carefully to lardis and youll take his advice in thethe handling of whatever you find on that island take my word for it lardis is the foremost authority in these matters very well what can you expect to find in the villa the master of the house for one a man of some fiftyeight years of age easy but hell be a vampire and as strong as any four or five of your men then therell be his married daughter and her husband also his son and possibly a woman friend the worst of them will be a fourth man not family who we think will be acting in the role of their keeper and he will be dangerous much more so than the others now the problem is this some if not all of these people will look and act perfectly normal a bit edgy perhaps but if you were to strand your boat on the beach there theyd probably help out they might even call the coastguard for assistance thats because they want to appear normal because they darent be discovered for what they really are a not until their master decides theyre no longer of any use to him or her so assuming its a him for the time being what use are they to him well for one the island is a bolthole its a place for the vampire lord to hide in the event he gets driven out of his aerie so in fact its much similar to the old mine gas station in the desert you must plan to take it out accordingly and if necessary in exactly the same way with an air strike yes if it comes down to that a though of course wed vastly prefer the kind of hit at which you people so excel seek and destroy and as quickly and quietly as possible and thats about it all you need to know about this secondary target for the time being but i would like to take this opportunity to remind you you wont be taking any prisoners which leads me to your main target xanadu the socalled health and pleasure resort high in the macphersons and so it is a resort but only as a front for the ugly thing thats runing the show and heres another problem this time we dont know a we have no idea a how many men hes vampirized the only thing we can say for sure is that when they know theyre being hit then theyll protect their master with all thats left of their miserable lives oh yes and one other thing when the wamphyri came into our world they brought thralls or lieutenants with them now an original lieutenant out of starside is a very dangerous creature much more so than our old friend bruce trennier and you know what he was like so im just reminding you its possible that one of these things is up there too the map on the big wall screen had changed trask pointed to it again said heres xanadu you know where it is for of course youve all flown over it and seen it for yourselves and anyway the bloody place is signposted a resort as weve seen the perfect cover yes which also makes it difficult for us to deal with the creature or creatures that well find there why because this time the master vampire is hiding in a crowd thats my next job finding a way to get the people a i mean the ordinary people a out of there before monday night and so gentlemen thats it for now now you can go work out your harbour areas decide where youll locate your men and vehicles as they start to come in the one good thing about it they wont have much spare time on their hands wont lose their edge or get bored theyll no sooner be in situ than theyll be in a firefight and i think i can promise you that where xanadu is concerned that last is guaranteed take it as a foregone a or at least a foreseen a conclusion the sas commanders left the ops room and trask was alone with his own people so as you can see he said the techs and i have had a busy day but fruitful judge for yourselves he gave jimmy harvey the nod and the big wall screen displayed the group of islets again and trask continued this island in the capricorn group a its such a rock it doesnt even have a name a is the home of wealthy philanthropist jethro manchester like many another rich dogooder before him hes something of a recluse five years ago in return for his patronage and a whole lot of money the barrier reefs marine park commission gave him the island to live on he owns it or as good as but thats not all he owns trask paused and glanced at harvey whose fingers tapped at his keyboard and now the big wall screen was divided centrally between the islands and a map of the dogleg fold in the macpherson range trask glanced at the screen and nodded his curt nod hands up who knows what im talking about and liz said he owns xanadu too trask looked at her used to he said but now he has a partner nine months ago manchester signed documents that transferred fifty per cent of xanadu to one aristotle milan an alleged shipping magnate of mixed greek and italian descent we might perhaps assume a or rather i believe were supposed to assume a that his surname derives from the city of his origins in the old italian fashion but i dont think so the coincidence is just too great not to mention the rest of the story first there is no record of any aristotle milan as being the owner of any ships ergo the man isnt a tycoon a though i can easily understand how the idea of being one would appeal to such as him a and as for his name not milan but malin jake came in instead of using ari as a suffix to denote son of hes using it as a prefix denoting first of meaning that on this world hes the first or highest of his kind and so for aristotle milan read malinari malinari the mind exactly said trask whats in a name eh so how did malinari make his connection with jethro manchester ah well heres another name for you martin trennier bruce trenniers brother a marine biologist employed by the marine park commission until manchester a our philanthropist conservationist recluse and latterday jacques cousteau a stole him away from them to be his very wellpaid oddjobs man skindiving companion and general dogsbody this happened about the same time that manchester and his family got away from it all and retired to the island bruce trennier would have known all of this when malinari vampirized him at the romanian refuge the said knowledge going secondhand to the mind himself which begs the same question weve all worried about before what else did malinari learn on thaton that terrible night trasks face was grey now and all of his people knew why that his concern wasnt just for zek who was gone now but also for them for zek foener had known as much as anyone about ebranch and its workings and malinari lan goodly determined to change the subject take trasks mind away from it what if were wrong and its all coincidental circumstantial this pseudonymousnames business our various hunches and observations and everything else weve come up with a hell of a lot of coincidences id say trask frowned at him but what if trask shuffled notes hed made earlier and said well there is one more thing in xanadu the pleasure dome or casino has a smaller uppermost dome like a blister on top of the main structure it sits on a spindle and revolves like certain fancy restaurants on their high towers but in the nine months since mr milan moved in half of its windows have been painted black both inside and out oh and incidentally the domes rotation was originally designed to track the sun letting in the light that the higher solarpanelled surfaces necessarily exclude so it would appear that our mr milan has an aversion to strong sunlight pausing trask looked at goodly the precog was quiet now saying nothing but his alleged concerns hadnt fooled trask one bit for in its way goodlys subterfuge had been a lie a diversion to take trasks mind off his lost zek and get it back on track and of course trask knew it a lie yes but a white one and so thanks anyway he finally continued looking directly into the precogs eyes but i think we can safely conclude that here he pointed a steady resolute finger at the locations displayed on the wall screen that here be vampires when no one had anything further to say trask finished up with very well and now we have plans to make later that evening jake was sitting on a bench in the cool of the garden lost in his own strange meditative thoughts when lardis found him and sat down beside him after he had sniffed at the air for a while the old man said carypsu oddly enough jake understood eucalyptus he answered its a tree growing outside the wall yes lardis nodded carypsu we have them on sunside and after a moment or twos thought may i ask a question whats on your mind said jake at which lardis smiled but i might ask you the selfsame thing whats on or whats in your mind jake frowned some kind of word game no lardis shook his head no word game but i have to admit im curious about what about you about how you knew that in starside in the old days a lord of the wamphyri might occasionally add ari to his fathers name denoting that he was his fathers son you mean like lord malin was malinaris father indeed and now that you mention ithow you knew that too jake frowned again deeper this time but then he relaxed and shrugged you must have told me he said or maybe ive read of it somewhere in ben trasks files perhaps but no lardis shook his head smiling in that knowing way of his no i havent told you ive had no reason to mention it to anyone and as far as i know it isnt written anywhere then creaking to his feet the old man yawned and said well goodnight jake and pleasant dreams chapter twentynine a dream and a wordgame but in fact jakes dreams were anything but pleasant it wasnt so much what had happened though that was bad enough but that he had been made to watch it happening more than anything else that was what had preyed on his minduntil hed made it up to put things right perhaps hed hoped that by killing the cause he might kill the memories too o o but such a lot of memories burninglike acid in his head until hed thought they would burn his brain out memories yes that fat pallid slimylooking bastard a the second one of those pigs that jake had got back at a the way he had taken natasha in the classical or orthodox position but scarcely an act of love rape yes and his long slender grey dick in her rectum according to his taste memories those godawful memories theyd piled pillows under her raising her hips and two of the others had held her legs under her knees to allow this fat slug standing at the side of the bed to get into her that had made it easy for him because unconscious as she was a or between bouts of consciousness and unconsciousness a shed been likely to flop and eject him but holding her like that natasha had been a lot more accessible accessible to viewing too for jake had been tied to a chair where he could see all of the action of course he could have closed his eyes and from time to time he did just that but he could still hear it even if he couldnt see it that grunting pig his dick like a long finger poking into her in and out with the heaving and clenching of his fat backside and this sweaty grunting sluglike slob a this giggling queer a oh it was obvious why he liked it like this with any normal woman in any natural act of intercourse hed be lucky if that pencil penis of his touched the sides but this wayat least he would get some satisfaction however minimal at least he would know hed had it into something and jake had to watch he had to because long before that toolong night was over hed known that if it was the very last thing he did he would avenge her but the worst thing was when it was over and the fat bastard zipped his fly and waddled over to jake saying a shame she wasnt awake eh english it would have been so sweet to know shed felt that last big bang and to feel her guts spasm as i greased her dirt chute ah well theres time yet oh ha ha ha he had a strong german accent and when he laughed he put his face close enough to jakes to cause him to recoil from the stench of cigar smoke and senf hot german mustard but jake didnt even know the pigs name a didnt know any of their names a except castellanos and jean daniels well jean daniel was dead now of an unequal argument between his soft guts and the alloy core of a plastiquepropelled steering column and the fat faggot had been number two jake knew the route the fat man took from castellanos place on the northern outskirts of marseille to a gay bar on the rue de carpiagne which he visited regularly on friday nights he knew too that the fat swine was a little shy to admit openly of his predilections which was why he invariably approached le jockey club down a narrow side street it was raining on the night in question and jake had parked his car so as to block off one side of the rainslick cobbled alley on the fat mans approach route the other side was liberally sprinkled with inchandahalf spikes which jake had laid down with malice aforethought and in great deliberation jake was waiting in a recessed doorway when the fat mans fat tyres blew and he was quickly into the alley as the expensive fiat slewed to a halt and its cursing driver slammed open his door got out and creased his belly as he bent to hear the front nearsides last gasp a moment more and jake was standing over him the fat man was suddenly aware of him he had time to say uh bitte was istp before jake sapped him behind the ear in a deserted copse on a wooded hillside over the motorway near st antoine jake wafted a small bottle of smelling salts under his victims nose until he twitched moaned and came out of it with a series of useless spastic jerks useless because he was tied up a literally tied up a and spastic because he was tied by his ankles and wrists so that all he could do was shake and shiver like a great globular white spider in its web jake had woken him up because in his position upside down the fat kraut might easily die without ever regaining consciousness of his own accord and that was the last thing jake wantedthat he should die easily the mans legs were spread wide at a height of about seven feet his ankles were roped to a pair of springy saplings which were just strong enough to hold him in position his wrists were likewise tied to the bases of the twin trees which formed his body into a fat totally naked x he was gagged with his own underpants tied off at the back of his neck and the rest of his clothing lay in a neat pile close by at first the fat man struggled a little but since that was pointless he quickly gave up and hung still watching jake pour a hip flask of fiery asbach uralt brandy over his heaped clothing a waste of good german liquor eh jake said but thats not the only german thing ill be wasting tonight then stepping closer you dont remember me do you the fat white spider had begun to shake its web again however hopelessly but now it paused to say umph uhumph but ill bet you remember the girl that night at castellanos place the russian girl natasha hearing that name and finally recognizing his tormentor the fat man commenced yanking on his ropes with a vengeance his eyes blinking rapidly in a face as round as the moon all bloated with pooling blood oh sure you remember her jake said as he got to work though it had stopped raining he was still wearing a lightweight raincoat from one side pocket he took out a small paper parcel and from the other several indeterminate items the fat man being inverted couldnt make out what they were but perhaps he recognized a certain marzipan smell when jake unwrapped the stained paper parcel and weighed a blob of grey doughlike stuff in his hand at any rate he began shaking the trees furiously and did a lot more serious umphumphing but jake wasnt listening he wasnt the least bit interested in his victims complaints stretching a pair of thin surgical gloves onto his hands he stepped closer and began molding plastic explosive into the fat mans anal cavity and i might have expected it he said finishing the job just as quickly as possible that a fat ugly thing like you would have a hole like a horses collar youve done your fair share of time in the barrel right but this time mean this last time its a little different eh he showed the fat man a small brass cylinder the size of a pencilslim torch battery with copper wires protruding from one end said detonator and rammed it home and connecting the wires to a miniature timer he said which gives you maybe oh fifty seconds as of rightnow and he pressed a tiny button then in no special hurry he stepped to the neatly piled clothing stooped and applied the flame of his cigarette lighter the pile caught with a small whoosh and blue flames flickered on the hillside and starting to count five six seven jake set off through the damp undergrowth down the uneven wooded slope to where his car was parked on a rutted farm track twenty twentyone twentytwo he looked back up the slope thirty or thirtyfive yards away the fat white spiderthing vibrated in its web looking luminous in the darkness of the wooded hillside and jake who had fairly danced down the slope his face fixed in a mad grin as he counted off the seconds through clenched teeth suddenly jake felt nauseous but at a count of thirtytwo he realized he was probably too close and couldnt afford to be sick it had been his intention to stand there and shout back up the slope remind that poor fat sod of what hed said that night something about natasha feeling the last big bang and her guts going into spasm but there wasnt enough time left a and maybe not enough hatred left a for any of that now or could it be simply that he didnt want his car covered withwith whatever feeling his gorge rising but still counting he started up the car and nosed off down the track thirtyeight thirtynine forty and when he was on the level heading for the motorway he applied the brakes and looked back a felt obliged to look back a like the night when he had looked without wanting to at something else looked back because this was what he thought was needed to burn that memory out of him fortysix fortyseven forty but that was as far as he got obviously hed been counting just a little too slowly jake saw the ball of fire leap up and out from the trees on the hillside pictured in his minds eye a hideous rending and then heard the bang the only mercy was that the fat queer himself couldnt possibly have heard it and there had been no time at all for a spasm then for a time jake just sat there in his car until the sweat began to turn cold on him but damn it to hell the horror and the hatred were already creeping back sated for a while but by no means done with and jake knew that they always would be there until he tracked down the rest of those bastards and finished what they had started he gave himself a shake put the car back in gear and made for the motorway buta asomething was obscuring his interior mirror something that had got itself stuck to the rear window something round that once was fat but now was flat dripping scarlet from its ripped rim and its eyes hanging out and its mouth still stuffed with its own underpants a face but just a face jesus god jesusa agod jake came awake with a small cry and a massive start the sweat still dripping and that mask of a face still printed on the darkness but fading as he realized it was only that awful nightmare again and that while the rest of it was all too horrifyingly real the last part had never happened except in the dream it always happened in the dream every time but then while he sat there trembling his heart hammering in his chest utterly alone in the darkness of his cubicle someone very close quite clearly said ahhhhh what stuff you are made of jake and what a host you would make but together well make a very fine pair you and i jake recognized the voice at once a only this time he was awake had been shocked awake a and the knowledge saw him fumbling for his bedside light switch with rubbery fingers as the damp short hairs at the back of his neck stiffened into spikes but as the light came on so that evil chuckling deadspeak voice was already receding was being driven away because acting instinctively a almost without knowing he had done it and certainly without knowing how a jake had erected mental shields against intruders blocking them from his mind for as well as korath mindsthrall he had sensed someone else there and possibly many someones listening to his thoughts or was it all a bad dream for now that they were gone he couldnt even be sure that his intruders had ever been there in the first place and jake flopped panting back onto his pillow wondering if perhaps it had only been a part of his dream after all one of those dreams that crashes the barrier of consciousness however momentarily to cross over into the waking world he wondered about it but was by no means certain while just a few feet away trying desperately hard to keep still as a mouse liz merrick crouched shivering and shuddering on her bed in the farthest corner of her cubicle with a sheet drawn up under her chin she hung on tightly to that sheet and even more so to her thoughts and tried to forget what she had seen but much like jake himself that night at castellanos place gripped by some kind of morbid fascination voyeurism of a sort shed found herself unable to look awayuntil now damn ben trask that he had ordered this surveillance but it wasnt only trask for liz too had had to know well and now she knew she had seen a shed even experienced jakes passion his hatred and the resultant nightmare a and knew how far he would go in his vendetta and just exactly what he was capable of in his craving for justice or for a kind of justice at least but such justice on the other hand perhaps that was why harry had chosen him because an eye for an eye had always been the necroscopes motto the eye yes that most vital and vulnerable part of the body an eye for an eye why the thought itself was horrific but now as liz was witness and as it had been brought forcefully home to her she realized that other parts of the body could be just as vulnerable and their use or misuse even more horrific jake hadnt thought he would sleep again but after tossing and turning for an hour a and listening though for what he wasnt quite sure a he did in fact sleep and as he relaxed his shields a a natural necessary relaxation born of mental fatigue from listening so intently for an unidentified something a so korath mindsthrall was alert and waiting for him jake felt the exvampires gradual insinuation like a slimy creeping mist or a damp shroud settling over his mind but at the same time he also sensed something of urgency a desire to speak to communicate with him and if for no other reason than his own curiosity he allowed it i know youre there jake said as the others hesitancy his toocautious approach began to irritate him so why do you hold back if youve got something to say get it said for answer there came a sensed sigh of relief and but i thought that you would shut me out send me away i thought you would reject me korath said that didnt stop you the last time jake said when you spoke to me after my nightmare you seemed to have enjoyed spying on me as if you approved of what you had seen of what id done or perhaps you got carried away and broke your silence in error when i wasnt supposed to know you were there was in factwell speaking to myself said the other defensively we might even say that you eavesdropped on me speaking to yourself jake answered deadspeak in which case youre as new to it as i am for a thought is just as good as the spoken word korath to such as you and i and to all of the teeming dead said the other which makes you the odd man out but as for eavesdropping jake continued it sometimes has its uses what was it you said that together we would make a very fine pair what exactly did you mean by that that were alike in certain ways no i dont think so or did you perhaps mean that youd like to team up with me but that is precisely what i meant korath answered just a little too eagerly for after all if youre intent on tracking down and destroying the treacherous malinari who could possibly be of greater assistance than one who was as close to him as korath mindsthrallp so close that he killed you jakes sarcasm dripped exactly and i know what you are thinking that the necroscope harry keogh found it peculiar that the mind should murder his first lieutenant out of hand as if it were nothing to him but it was in factsomething he had good reason is that what youre saying well he thought he had said korath he was concerned that one day i would usurp him that i might have the means to usurp him yet when harry questioned you you said it was just malinaris nature you were there to be used and so he used you and so it was his evil nature which caused him to so use and abuse his righthand man aye korath answered but in addition there was this other thing something of his own making which given time he feared would turn on him and it might yet so why do you mention it to me a this thing whatever it is a when you withheld it from harry because it was my secret said korath and even a dead man should have something he can call his own a something private a which might even be of value to the living and with which he might seek to bargain ah but harry keogh is one thing while you are something else entirely jake and it was never my intention to keep anything secret from you not if you require it and if it should proveuseful to you something you have jake mused which might benefit me but not harry and in a while when korath remained silent so whats the difference why would you help me and not him the difference but isnt it obvious the necroscope harry keogh can do nothing for me and even if he could he wouldnt a you have seen that for yourself he is obstinate despite that i never harmed him and he never knew me still he hates me but the greatest difference is this that he is dead while youa while im alive said jake and you walk among the living my only possible instrument of revenge against him who put me here and the others who have gone out into your world with him aye and thats all youd expect out of it all youd want for yourself all but it is everything said the other through you i would live again a er metaphorically of course through you i would strike back from beyond the grave a or in my case from this dank and dreary pipe in the bowels of a strange place in a foreign land far from starside what more could i poor dead thing that i am ask of you and what more could you give what more indeed said jake who hadnt forgotten harry keoghs warning that even dead vampires are dangerous and well and perhaps there issomething said korath and now we get to it said jake hear me out said the other is it too much to ask that in return for my gift to you you shall give me your companionship a albeit rarely however infrequently a when little else intrudes upon your time a wordgame said jake is that what this is the devious nature of vampires for here i find myself bargaining a all caught up in it beginning to go with it a when as yet i dont even know whats on offer then let me tell you korath was eager barely able to contain himself but in the next moment he slowed down paused and said and yethow best to explain now listen do you remember i told you that in our icelands banishment when food was short and malinari thirsted he supped on me but it was no mere sip he drank deeply so deep indeed that i was weakened nigh unto death aye that was how much my master took from me but in taking he also gave now malinari is special even among the wamphyri his bite is virulent well so are they all but his even more so under normal conditions a man is recruited becomes infected in the space of a single starside night a or two or three days of your time a following which he is his masters thrall in thrall to whichever lord or lady seduced his blood but when malinari bit deep it was a matter of hours he could turn a man in hours it was in his essence his strong wamphyri essence and it was the same with the making the making this was a new one on jake the making of creatures korath explained monsters why things waxed in the minds vats of metamorphosis in days rather than weeks and months i have seen flyers jlop from their stone wombs in the space of a single day and a nighta a starside day and nightyou understand a and even an ugly warrior wax mewling in its vat its armoured scales hardening to chitin in little more than four sunups so efficacious is malinaris essence of metamorphism and all of his men and creatures alike stamped with something of the mind himself imbued of his arts made in their masters likeness do you see imbued of his arts jake repeated the others words and tried to fathom his meaning are you saying you got malinaris skills something of them aye said korath and after a moments pause and you will also recall the reason why my master found it so easy to talk to me because as you have inherited the necroscope harry keoghs mindshields so i had inherited my bestial fathers malinari found little to fault in my thinking because i was able to keep him out which suited both our purposes the minds because while by nature hes suspicious still he needed a strong first lieutenant mine because even the most loyal and obedient of thralls may on occasion harbour this or that small grievance against his master or on occasion a notsosmall grievance said jake he sensed koraths shrug in my case not so much a grievance as an ambition that was it i harboured an ambition and looked for an opportunity for that time in the icelands malinari had gone too far oh he had glutted on mebut what he had given back a albeit involuntarily for in his hunger he was made careless a would soon be much stronger than what he took from which time forward i knew that i was different i felt the germ of a leech growing in me but darent disclose it i could not admit that soon i would bewamphyyyrrriii the pain a the terrible longing a of koraths cry shocked jake to his very soul like a shovel in cold ashes or chalk on a new blackboard it grated on his nerveendings set his scalp tingling and it brought him a new awareness the certain knowledge that what he was dealing with here was far from a simple uncomplicated creature dead it was yes but it hadnt by any means accepted that fact it resisted death with every fibre of its longsince sloughedaway body and would cling to life a to any life to his life a with that same tenacity and i thinki think its time you were out of here jake said his voice shuddering as the echoes of koraths cry of anguish did a drumroll in his nearmetaphysical mind you or me but one of us has to go aye go if you will said the other but best that you go bravely to your death jake not whimpering as you whimper now go on face malinari the mind for you may be sure it is him in the mountains go against him with nothing but your puny human muscles nothing but your puling childlike mind a which even i can enter as stealthy as a thief in the night oh oh really and how do you think youll fare against such as malinari eh and this woman who you keep in your mind this liz of whom you sometimes dream a what a mentalist you say but how unfortunate for how will she fare against such as him as for vavaraah but she has her ways with pretty women aye vavaaara oh ha ha ha haaaaaaa koraths deadspeak laugh reverberated into a throbbing silence but jake knew that he was there waiting and korath knew that jake was hooked to a point at least and he was right how can you be sure that its malinari in the mountains jake said in a little while what can you know of that ah no too late the other cried was the fair one and told you a secret now you would have more but what is my get out of all this but you still havent told me what you want jake answered not everything that you want and until you do im not going to be signing any blank cheques korath and because deadspeak conveys more or other than is actually said because it translates much as telepathy translates korath understood him well enough you are afraid that i would take advantage but how may i take advantage im only a dead thing drowned in a pipe korath mindsthrall is no more except he acts through you ah but jakethe acts we can accomplish and the things i have to offer such as everything i know about malinari vavara szwart youve already told me those things both me and the necroscope harry keogh but can you remember them when youre awake i think not for i have crept into your waking mind too jake and found it blank of all such knowledge of everything i told you now tell me who do you suppose it was reminded you of how malinari came by his name did you really think you were so clever as to work it out all by yourself that the name aristotle milan was a disguise a pseudonym but itit was obvious said jake caught momentarily off guard as it must also be obvious that i was there with you korath pounced else how would i know it ever happened and when we flew together you and i in that aerial machine that helicopter with its twirling wings did you once suspect that i was there with you no never not for a moment but i was jake was shaken but he was also jake so youre a sneaky bastard he said what does that prove except i cant trust you it proves that i can help you a as i helped you with malinaris name and then grudgingly also it proves that you are no slouch no easy adversary when it comes to wordgames more of the necroscopes inheritance i should think and jake wondered could korath help him what harm could it do to call on the vampire for advice in a tight spot surely it wouldnt be that much different from calling on harry whose help was uncertain anyway and these thoughts too a unguarded as they were a were deadspeak exactly said korath and at all times i would be on hand toto advise you aye not at all times said jake hearing warning bells for when we started this conversation you were happy with rarely or infrequently when little else was intruding on my time so how come you now arrive at being on hand at all times a figure of speech korath protested meant whenever you called for me of course and how would i do that i mean call for you why by thinking of me of my situation down there in that cruel conduit and by calling for me by name korath but the dead vampire was getting ahead of himself believing that he was winning jake over his deep voice had become semihypnotic more phlegmy glutinous and sly than ever jake gave himself a shake and woke up to that fact what like rubbing a lamp to call out the genie he said and what happenes when ive had my three wishes eh he sensed the sad shake of an incorporeal head jake jake were you always this ungrateful this misgiving no jake answered not misgiving not yet just cautious but lets get on what else is on offer for after all you did say things in the plural so said the other esoteric knowledge is not enough it is too ethereal a too immundane afor a clodhopper such as you you would have something more physical no small feat said jake feeling stung and retaliating for someone as far removed from physical things as you are hurtful said the other hah and you accuse me of taking advantage but argument gets us nowhere while what im proposing would be of mutual benefit very well you ask what else is on offer what other thing i have in mind and that is exactly where it is in my mind now say do you remember the necroscope asking you about your numerical skills in connection with the mobius continuum yes said jake o then and how are your numbers jake im not innumerate if thats what you mean odd said the other for i was in my world jake mathematics went no further than the count of a mans thralls or the beasts in his pens numbers i had no use for them nor have i even now though i may have shortly but in starside addition was a recruitingforay into sunside and division was what happened to the spoils what are you getting at we come to it said korath do you remember those numbers that the necroscope showed you before he took his leave of us and do you know what they were they were a formula jake answered they were the numbers that govern all space and time harrys gateway to the mobius continuum but do i remember them he thought back on it that incredible wall of numbers a like a computer screen run riot evolving in the eye of his mind a its symbols calculi and incredible equations marching and mutating until they achieved some sort of numerical critical massand formed a door a mobius door remember it he would never forget it it was like watching creation itself but duplicate it no you cant said korath but i can i can make it but i cant use it not without you and you cant make it without me and there you have my offer tempting if it were true said jake it is but how you said yourself that numbers were practically unknown in your world just so but didnt i also say that malinaris essence is strong in my blood and now jake understood his photographic memory thats what you got from him and its why he killed you because one day you might know as much as him now you have it all korath said and i await your answer whats it to be can we work together for malinaris downfall but theres something else still jake was cagey and korath sighed his frustration what now the secret that harry keogh was searching for or in your own words the crux of the matter which is probably more important than all the rest put together the wamphyri a malinari and the others a have been here for some time now but it seems theyve achieved very little so like the necroscope before me im asking you what are they up to korath whats their plan you were one of theirs and so you must know oh i do i do but as you have repeated the necroscopes words now i shall repeat mine that is for me to know and for you and yours to discover a through me it is my only remaining bargaining point the last trick up a poor dead things sleeve and before i give you that we must be far far better acquainted you and l that said i can tell you this there isnt too much time left and what they have started will run its course unless it is stopped before you can stop it however you must know what it is jake pondered that a while then said til have to think it over all of it but try not to take too long over it said the other your world hangs by a thread and the thread is unwinding til keep that in mind said jake but for now leave me be theres something i must do before i awake or all this has been for nothing o be it said the other without further comment and jake sensed his departure like a waft of fresh air the way the shadows crept back from his mind then experimenting a making sure that korath was gone a he attempted to close his mind to deadspeak and turned to telepathy instead liz if you are there and i think you probably are try to remember this name korath if its possible you might even write it down but in any case remember it and tomorrow remind me of it it could be very important that done jake relaxed and let himself drift free on the tides of his own subconscious mind and in a little while he felt himself buoyed up taken by far less ominous dreams the disjointed meaningless flotsam of his waking hours chapter thirty the lull sunday was a busy yet paradoxically quiet time work was being done but in a kind of vacuum chamber people moved about with purpose within a oddly surreal atmosphere of nearsilence it was jake thought a sensation similar to being on an airplane during its descent in the moments before your ears pressurize when sounds are flat and distant and you feel as though youve suddenly gone deaf in short it was the lull before the storm when the hatches are battened down and jake felt completely out of it apart from an ogroup hed been scheduled to attend in the evening he had nothing to do which was as well for he didnt think he would be able to concentrate on anything much there was something on his mind in the back of his head desperately trying to push its way to the forefront it had to do with last night a something lingering over from his dreams perhaps a but apart from that he was at a loss jake remembered his nightmare of course he always remembered that it was a recurrent thing that came back to haunt him maybe two or three times a month it had used to be far more frequent but time is merciful and was doing its job this thing in the back of his mind however was other than that he found himself listening for an unknown something and at the same time dreading it so much so that he was shielding his mind to shut things out and doing it consciously holding at bay those whispering voices of which he was becoming ever more frequently awarewhich might perhaps explain something of the eerie atmosphere he was in fact isolating himself and also from the living it was a shuddersome thought and deadspeak was a terrible thing jake found himself wondering if perhaps that was it was it harry he was listening for harry keogh and the great majority was his neurosis growing spreading out of control or was it something else not fear at all but the simple need for privacy some kind of persecution complex with liz merrick a his partner a taking on the role of the inquisition or of a spy at the very least but in any case she was giving him the cold shoulder this morning odd because he also felt that there was something she might want to tell him jake wandered about the safe house through the ops room and other rooms trying to interest himself in something a in anything a that was going on around him and feeling more and more the outsiderat least until lardis lidesci joined him and jake saw that he was in the same boat jake really felt for lardis because he was a genuine outsider not even of this world on one occasion when they spoke to each other the old man told him dont fret so were men of action you and i thats all it is but well get to it never fear unlike jake however the old lidesci made no complaint instead he prowled the safe house in tandem with the younger man and kept his feelings to himself the long hours passed slowly hours of tactical and logistical planning and correlation concentrated poring over maps and the making of battleplans in general the techs were feeding questions to the computers and supplying trask and his sas commanders with the answers apart from catching the occasional break they would probably still be working well into the eleventh hour surface plans of xanadu a together with schematics of the resorts subsurface labyrinth a littered tables in the central ops room detailed diagrams ordnance survey maps and aerial photographs of jethro manchesters island in the capricorn group were scattered over the floor of a room with tightly drawn curtains warrant officer class two joe davis was on a radio in the ops room logging in the task forces vehicles as they arrived in groups or as individuals across the mountains and down onto the coastal strip they had kept radio silence until now even now they voiced only their callsigns a and then just the once a received coded gridreferences of their destinations verified their receipt and disappeared again into the aether soon they would be arriving at the designated operational locations in which they would maintain low profiles and wait for orders the big articulated ops truck wouldnt be in until the dead of night or early morning but everyone would be and must be in situ by midday tomorrow monday the night of the full moon by six in the evening ben trask was about ready to start pulling his hair out over his main problem with xanadu it was the one thing he couldnt request help on from higher authority how to evacuate the civilians from the resort before attacking the place for lan goodly had forecast blood and thunder in xanadu and whether or not this was an accurate prediction or some scene from the past that the precog had somehow witnessed trask wasnt about to risk having his operation compromised delayed or possibly even shut down by the objections and vacillations of jittery political powers it was nerveracking for from trasks own point of view and while it had been one thing to personally authorize coordinate and take part in a firefight in the badlands of the gibson desert setting fire to xanadu would be something else entirely and since he didnt have time to argue the toss with the powers that be it meant that should anything go wrong tomorrow night he would be the one to carry the can trask was desperately in need of a plan of evacuation and it would have to be one that wouldnt alert nephran malinari to ebranchs or any other enemys hand in things but with little more than twentyfour hours to go no such plan seemed likely then came the televised evening news report a of the first cases of asiatic plague showing up in brisbane and half a dozen other australian ports a and with it the germ of an idea and a possible reprieve it was liz merrick who heard the report formulated the idea and brought it to trasks attention at first he was doubtful the notion seemed too contrived too hollywoodbut it was the sort of idea that can grow on you and as it grew on trask so he got to work on it for after all it was all that he had to work on later in the early hours of the night when it was cooler and liz went outdoors for a breath of fresh air jake took the opportunity to corner her and have a word in private youve been avoiding me all day he said sort of peculiar behaviour for a partner partner or is it wearing off seated together on a bench they were close but not touching liz gave him a wary look and said umm wearing off i thought we had something special going jake said er businesswise that is i mean psychically if not physically she smiled and said perhaps physically too under different circumstances so dont underestimate yourself jake cutter but youre carrying a lot of baggage around with you and the extra weight is taking too much of a toll on you you havent been the most sociable type you know and even if you were this isnt the best of times which disposes of physically he said but theres still psychically to consider i thought you were interested in that side of me too a or should that be at least with which he felt her shy away from him as her expression became a lot more serious but then she gave a shrug and said out in the desert that first job of ours was like an initiation a baptism by fire a for both of us as we were working together and it was part of our job it seemed only fitting and sensible that we develop something of a rapport buta which we did he cut her off so is that finished now abut liz went on for this thing tomorrow night weve been split up and since were not going to be working together there seemed little point in us well working together i mean with this twin operation about to go down xanadu and the capricorn group island thing together letting anything else get in the way would have been too much of a distraction so i havent been trying to avoid you jake its simply that weve all been very busy you have all been busy said jake moodily and abruptly im notnot having a good time of this of this conversation and of everything else he answered then shook his head and said christ do i come off sounding like a crybaby and suddenly liz found herself melting it was the first time that jake had shown any open wounds a in his waking hours anyway a and here she was pouring salt in them with her deliberately detached overly cool attitude and so what is the problem jake she said with which he felt that ohsotender telepathic aura probing in his direction and immediately raised his shields she knew it drew back from him said is that what its about but i cant help what i am jake if someone close to me is hurting surely its only natural that i should want to know why and anyway isnt it a contradiction you were the one who brought up our telepathic rapport this special thing that we have going but you cant expect anyone to be close to you concerned for you on the one hand while deliberately pushing them away on the other youre shielding yourselfa and from contact with me jake he nodded and said and if contact suppose we can call it that for now instead of spying a if contact gets to be a habit what then look liz last night i had a bloody awful nightmare a piece of the extra luggage you were talking about thats the result of something ive done it was an act of vengeance but a very terrible act you say its only natural you should want to know whats hurting but please believe me you really dont want to know about something like that at which she scarcely managed to keep from biting her lip for she already knew about that a all about it but before she could say anything and perhaps give herself away jake went on i thinki thought that maybe you were there with me that you had seen and that was why you were avoiding me no liz shook her head i wasnt i didnt it isnt and she thought damn you ben trask i know its your job but this is killing me and at the same time she knew how fortunate she was that it wasnt trask himself she was talking to but even so what she had told jake was only a halflie or at worst a white one for the real reason she had been avoiding him was because she knew that sooner or later she must remind him of that name korath it would be the right and proper thing to do after all for with all the emphasis that jake had placed on it it might well be important to everyone but now she had gone and complicated matters making herself an even bigger liar for as soon as she mentioned that name to jake and he remembered it he would know that she really had been there after all sneaking in his mind like a thief right there and then she might have done it blurted it out and accepted the consequencesexcept at that precise moment ben trask appeared in the door to the house calling liz and is that you jake ogroup time come and get your orders heading for the house suddenly liz found herself hating it all but especially hating her weird talent her telepathy and more clearly than ever she understood why most ebranch espers thought of their skills as curses again and again her condemnation of herself rang in her mind but she heard it as an accusation as if spoken by jake sneaking in my mind like a thief a like a thiefa like a thief and she hated it yes for the fact of the matter was that liz valued him far too much for that and not only psychically either then it was monday by midday an observation post had been set up on the single approach road that angled up the mountain to xanadu in a treeshrouded layby it looked like a party of picknickers was enjoying the view and the mountain air a table had been set up and a small barbecue stand sent up smoke from where it stood on the stump of a tree cubes of meat sizzled on skewers and a camera and sixpack of beer sat on the table two of the cans had been opened one of which lay on its side all very casual three men in light summer clothes ran the show one of them was sitting in the car with the windows rolled down apparently listening to the radio in fact he was using a radio or would be when it was required another soldier sat at the table casually watching the road where it zigzagged up into the wooded heights he wore binoculars round his neck but only rarely used them the third member of the team carried a guitar he perched on a stool in the shade of a pine his broadbrimmed hat giving him a little extra cover as he strummed an inadequate mainly tuneless tune out of his instrument which was in fact capable of far more serious music he was the teams minder and the soundbox of his guitar housed a deadly mm machinepistol so far the man in the car had registered their callsign and reported their situation only once clearly and succinctly stating that they were in situ also at midday lizs warrant officer class two red bygraves and the tech jimmy harvey had bought day visitor tickets at xanadus gatehouse reception desk by i pm having cased the joint but ohsocarefully they were sunbathing on opposite sides of the main pool both men had taken an armful of local morning newspapers with them with frontpage spreads that dealt with the incursion of asiatic plague these had been left in strategic locations where they were bound to be picked up and read of course the resort had its own newsvending outlets trasks newssheet ploy was intended as a supplementary incentive once his evacuation scheme got in gear as for the scheme that was simplicity itself at precisely pm bygraves got up and strolled round to harveys side of the pool stepping carefully around or over the many tanned bodies lounging there the two men were total strangers of course jimmy harvey saw bygraves coming adjusted his dark glasses and stretched his arms up above his head letting the sun caress the pale underarm areas and christ said bygraves going down on a knee beside him staring at the dark purplish blotches under jimmys arms eh harvey sat up what sir said bygraves would you mind if i examined those marks that pustule marks pustule under your arms sir because if theyre what they look like harvey glanced under his arm looked concerned is that something new he said and who are you anyway doctor bygraves said the other prodding beneath harveys left arm where he obligingly lifted it and by now the people at the poolside were interested in what was going on a doctor harvey was starting to look worried specializing in communicable asiatic diseases bygraves nodded im up here for the day before reporting for duty in brisbane and while i dont want to frighten you right now it looks like ill have my work cut out he pushed harveys arm down by his side and asked how long have you been up here just a fortnight harvey was on his feet now tm taking my summer break so what the hells wrong but suddenly bygraves became aware of the people gathering to watch the show and he leaned closer to harvey bending down to whisper in the smaller mans ear what harvey yelped but havent you heard the news read the newspapers bygraves looked astonished and more than ever worried you say youve been up here for two weeks then its here it has to be here have you seen any rats have you noticed any other people with these marks jesus it could be in the water plague the word burst loudly from harveys mouth hey did you say plague but how in hell can i havea dont say it bygraves cut him short glancing anxiously at the concerned faces all around listen we have a serum it isnt that serious if you get it seen to early a but i do mean right now all of the medical facilities in this area have been supplied with the antidote unfortunately i dont have any with me and this isnt a registered medical centre so i cant give you any shots that will help here in xanadu buta as he set off in a hurry with harvey in tow back around the pool to his sunbed a small anxious crowd began to follow on behind harvey caught up grabbed his arm and said but his jaw was beginning to flap but what bygraves picked up a briefcase went to open it and accidentally spilled some of its contents pamphlets describing the symptoms of asiatic plague a new strain of bubonic they fluttered to the crazypaved pool surround and were quickly picked up by the gathering crowd and looking hopeless frustrated bygraves said look i think were probably too late to stop it spreading through this place but you are already short on time pulling on a pair of shorts over his swim trunks he said i have to get you out of this place now and as for the rest of you people he glanced at the milling gawping faces all around this thing will work its way through this place like wildfire so pass the message you should all get out go home report to your hospitals doctors medical facilities and you should do it now then to harvey my cars this way but my clothes harvey whose clothes were in fact in their vehicle started to protest its your clothes or your life said bygraves pushing a way through the crowd ten minutes later they were out of there and fifteen minutes after that the general exodus began and red bygraves was right the thing worked its way through xanadu like wildfire by that time ben trask and david chung were at the observation point they were on hand to greet wo ii bygraves and jimmy harvey when they came tearing down the road from xanadu in a cloud of dust and heatshimmer pulled into the layby and braked to a halt behind the other car how did it go trask was anxious he sluiced sweat from his brow glanced up and down the road up there the mountains and down below the coastal plain reaching to the vastly curving horizon of the south pacific normally it would be a beautiful exhilarating view but trask had no time for that right now some people were piling into their cars even as we pulled out of the place jimmy harvey said keeping well down and out of sight inside the car the dust was still settling i think we made a good job of it thank god for amateur dramatics eh would you believe i once played romeo trask looked down at him and couldnt help but smile no but id believe a munchkin eh harvey grimaced as he pulled a blob of purplish cosmetic putty from under his left arm the wizard of oz trask answered probably before your time how about the place how did it look like a resort nothing odd about it no the other shook his bald dome of a head unless you consider all those wellheeled people and all that tanned flesh odd but me i felt like a right whitey from blighty trask shook his head chewed on his upper lip why is it im not happy he asked of no one in particular why is it so quiet i dont knowbut something doesnt feel right and to jimmy time you got some clothes on and wear a hat were out of here as soon as people start to exit the place or well get snarled up in the traffic that is if people start to exit the place the locator david chung was at the side of the road lowering binoculars from his eyes he called out ben here they come a whole stream of cars on the high zigzag up there ten minutes and theyll be here he came at a run across the laybys gravel surface wo ii bygraves had changed his tshirt put on a baseball cap and sunglasses he slid out of the drivers seat and trask got in now bygraves would take over as the commander of this subsection making its numbers up to four and theyd be here until they were ordered on up to xanadu there were sufficient armaments in their vehicle to start world war iii trask spoke to chung what do you make of it hes up there definitely said chung at this range i cant be mistaken mindsmog and dense but its so steady a i mean it registers like steady breathing you know a that at a guess id say hes asleep which at this time of day shouldnt come as a surprise but ben hear me out i think theres more smog than just his vampires said trask emphasizing the plural lieutenants thralls how many him and maybe two others i cant be sure but theyre weak too weak to be lieutenants again im guessing but id say theyre raw recruits thralls trask shook his head it still feels wrong too easy i have this feeling he knows about us that this whole scenario is a i dont know a a lie chung shrugged but not negligently thats your department boss i cant help you trask gave himself a shake tried to tell himself he was wrong and anyway there was nothing he could do about it now tonight was their window of opportunity and it had been foreseen by lan goodly so from now on it was all go go go david trask said i wont be seeing you until i come in with chopper one after dark take care to stay tuned old friend and lead these people right to their target right youve got it chung answered as the first car out of xanadu sped in a cloud of dust past the layby and on down the often precipitous road youd better be on your way chung nodded good luck ben but then a strange thing a car coming in the other direction up the mountain road pulled in sharply onto the laybys gravel surface and skidded to a halt the driver cursed out of his open window said did you see that if it wasnt for this layby id be over the fucking edge i mean god damn it to he had been forced off the road by someone trying to overtake the lead cars in the exodus from xanadu what the fuck is going on up there trask stared hard out of his own vehicles window at the speaker at his angular somehow spidery figure that seemed crammed into the seat of his battered bluegrey range roverstyled vehicle and for a moment knew a sensation of dйjа vu the man wore an opennecked shirt and a widebrimmed hat and the way he crouched over the steering wheel like that he had to be pretty tall tall and spidery and his vehicle was trask stared harder and the tall thin man stared back but only for a moment then his eyes went wide and the back of his vehicle fishtailed as he slammed her in first revved up and slewed back out onto the road and damn trask shouted getting out of his car as the dust of the others departure drifted back to earth dйjа vu nothing that car and that man a they fit liz merricks description of the watcher at the airport where we came in even as the suspect car had fishtailed out onto the road so the sas type with the guitar had yanked open the boot of the observation posts vehicle and hauled out an evillooking piece of artillery quickly assuming a firing stance behind a stunted pine he rested the rifles long barrel on the gnarled stump of a branch and sweeping the steeply snaking road he made adjustments to the telescopic sights then mr trask he shouted up there where the road zigzags i can take him out as he rounds that last bend the range isnt too much maybe five hundred yards and this weapon is lethally accurate to fifteen hundred thats to assume a stationary target of course but im qualified with this gun and wont miss once hes over that ridge though hes gone with the wind you have maybe thirty seconds to think it over trask thought it over he knew he was right a but what if he was wrong what if the spidery man was an innocent but then again why had he taken off like that and the look on his face a probably shock as hed realized he was face to face with his masters enemy in which case hed be on his way to make report to malinari even now but if trask was wronghow to balance one life against the security of a world the man with the sniperscope yelled hell be coming into view any time now and trask thought the die is cast weve got nephran malinari trapped up there he cant come out until sundown and lan goodly has forecast shit and hellfirefor tonight the night of the full moon so what difference does this make one way or the other what was it that the precog was always saying a something about the future being as immutable as the past what will be has been and all that yes that was itbut it was always coupled with theres no way of telling how it will be thats all trask started towards the marksmans position and in his minds eye he saw the knuckle of the mans finger turning white on the trigger as if that were some kind of invocation the marksman called out i have him in my sights now mr trask there was no time left and trask skidded to a halt shouting do it take him out but skit said the other his finger went slack on the trigger and beads of sweat sprang into being on his forehead letting his weapon slump he said cars out of xanadu a fucking convoy they were in my way shielding him ordinary civilians no way i was going to risk firing on them trask had been holding his breath now he let it out in a long phew and then said take it easy it isnt your fault and it wasnt meant to be the future can be like that what said the other relieved but frowning some kind of fatalism forget it trask told him but tonight if you see that car or its driver in the resort then you can fire on them with all youve got and ditto should they try to come back down out of there then it was time for a final word with bygraves and chung before the downhill traffic got too heavy even now the thunder of fleeing vehicles was becoming deafening it looks like our little scheme is going to work trask told bygraves stay on it and when the traffic thins out flag down a car see if you can get some idea of how many people are still up there as for that fellow who slipped through our fingers a moment ago dont let it worry you ill do the worrying for all of us and anyway what can he tell malinari other than what hes already figured out for himselfa or will figure out just as soon as he pops up from his hideyhole then he turned to chung david stay tuned if that mindsmog gets active starts moving about let us know at once but whether it does or doesnt and unless something really drastic happens well probably be going in as planned okay after the wo ii and chung had nodded their understanding trask got back into the car with jimmy harvey and drove to the side of the road there he waited for a break in the stream of traffic gave a final wave and set off downhill the vast bulk of the exodus was still to come and in a xanadu that would soon be empty of entirely human life there were just three and a half hours of lifegiving or wnlife threatening natural light left then the sun would dip westward the shadows of the mountain range would lengthen and xanadus lights would blink on one by one holding the darkness and the long night to follow at bay or at least that was how it would be under normal circumstances it was some eighty miles back to the safe house along the way jimmy harvey radioed ahead to give the people back there their eta he also passed a brief coded message concerning liz merricks watcher and likewise passed on the locator david chungs expert opinion that lord nephran malinari was indeed in xanadu at which the team at the safe house held a final ogroup then went into action to ensure that everything would be fully operational and ready for trask on his return radio messages went out with the exception of the xanadu observation post the various sas units began converging on the flying club where chopper two had been checked over refuelled and was warming up for the long flight to gladstone the other machine stood idle for the moment its flight to xanadu would be of much shorter duration meanwhile in the harbour at gladstone a fullyfuelled coastguard vessel and pilot had gone on immediate standby and every man who formed a part of the team was fully aware of the details of the job in hand pm in xanadu and for more than three hours now private eye garth santeson had been trying to get to see his employer aristode milan but santeson wasnt the only employee and the two wellbuilt young men who saw to milans privacy in daylight hours had been proving obstinate for three hours and then some santeson had prowled the casino and watched it emptying of punters hostesses croupiers and their overseers and finally and most tellingly the tellers for when the people who handled the cash moved out then you knew for sure that something was about to go down half an hour ago turned back yet again by milans singleminded minders from his daytime sanctum sanctorum santeson had gone out from the almost deserted pleasure dome into the resort proper by then the pools had been empty and the last cars were straggling out through the departure gate the private investigator was no fool he had long since found out what the alleged problem was but hed also made the connection between that and what hed bumped into on the mountain approach road and it was just too much of a coincidence so how come milan a who had definitely been on the alert for unfriendly visitors and suspicious activities for as long as santeson had been with him a how come he wasnt up and about checking things out for himself or was he simply unaware that there was a problem the trouble with milans goons was that they had insufficient grey matter between them to realize they should at least be doing something if it was only to let their dodgy employer know what was happening here this was santesons opinion anyway which seemed borne out by the dumb unswerving obstinacy of the pair normally he would have been able to contact milan by telephone the photophobic nightdwelling boss of the resort would usually accept calls through the dark hours from fourthirty or five in the evening until nine in the morning but not tonight and when santeson had tried to impress something of the urgency of an audience with milan upon his watchdogs a the fact that he must see him that his information was of the utmost importance a it had seemed to him that they couldnt care less hed simply been informed of mr milans instructions that he wasnt to be disturbed under any circumstance until at the earliest and that had been that but now with the time approaching pm and the resort already dark cooling under the swift onset of a tropic of capricorn night santeson was determined to have his way he had last tried to call milan just ten minutes ago from the deserted booth at the monorail boarding stage close to the casinos entrancebut the phone had only buzzed annoyingly at him because by then there had been no receptionist to transfer the call and now santeson was very angry for as the minutes had stretched into hours his sense of urgency a the anxious frustration of knowing that while something was definitely and dangerously out of kilter here still there was nothing he could do about it a had increased in commensurate degree garth santeson had his own ideas as to what was happening or about to happen it seemed obvious to him that the long arm of the law was reaching for milan and his ohsoshady employer was about to get himself arrested in which case santesons monthly and more than adequate pay cheque would disappear with him it therefore followed that the longer he kept the boss out of trouble the better his chances of collecting his next cheque due in a few days time which in turn meant he must speak to milan about the people he had seen on the approach road at least two of which hed recognized from the party that had flown in a few days ago in those paramilitary jetcopters santeson knew where milan was a his approximate location anyway a but couldnt get to him on any ordinary night milan might be found in the casino for an hour or two but much preferred the privacy of his rooms in the solarpanelled bubble on top of the dome santeson had a special elevator key given him by milan which would take him to those topmost rooms when he was summoned into the mans presence but generally during the day aristotle milan stayed well out of sight down in the subterranean bowels of the place santeson understood that his employer had private apartments down there to which he wasnt and never had been privy to his knowledge only milans goons had ever got that closea awell until tonight anyway chapter thirtyone before the storm it was almost as dark inside the casino when santeson reentered the place some electrical failure which had taken out most of the lights and no one left to fix it but even if it was black as night in there he would know where to find milans minders surrounding the pleasure domes central spindle six elevators formed a hexagonal tube of glass and stainless steel four of these serviced the casinos upper levels excluding milans bubble the fifth was for the use of casino personnel only and gave access to the basement and the almost literally bombproof fort knoxlike accountancy vaults as for number six that was exclusive to the persons of milan himself his minders and anyone else who he might choose to entertain either in the bubble or in certain unknown regions in the belly of the place but associates visitors huh damn few of those santeson thought as he approached the central area where sure enough milans bouncers were waiting to intercept him flanking an elevator door marked private they were seated in pinkmarbled leather armchairs beside slender urnshaped ashtrays but as santeson came hurrying between the unlit rows of sullenly silent slots so the minders came smoothly yet indolently to their feet and stood side by side their arms folded on their chests like a matching pair of eunuchs their expressions remained blank but the positions they had adopted said it all they were blocking the elevator doors santeson shook his head wondering what is it with these two apart from milan himself they were the only ones who had keys to that subterranean level housing what santeson supposed would be sumptuous apartments his key would only take him up not down but in any case he wasted no time in argument these zombies always reacted precisely the same way no matter who it was who approached these doors i have to see mr milan he told them and i have to see him now so dont go fucking me about because its too important they looked at him then at each other and back to santeson and he looked at them they could be twins he thought and changed his mind no it wasnt that they looked like brothers but that they had like looks the way they stood there a smartly outfitted wellbuilt sixfooters in their mid to latetwenties with sallow complexions that looked sort of grey in this indoor dusk a they could almost be tailors dummies motionless yet somehow threatening only their eyes moved and their eyeswere weird santeson was sure hed never noticed it before but now he saw a kind of yellowish almost feral luminosity in those eyes it must be the light or lack of it and he was further galvanized by that thought look he said all shit could break loose any time now and mr milan has got to be told about it now i dont want to see him on my ownhey boys if youre that concerned over security you can escort me i mean youll have to go with me anyway cos i dont know where he is or how to get there but you do and believe me if you dont take me to him right now tomorrow you could be out of work and then losing it a little when their expressions didnt change er hellop he said i mean am i getting through to you or would you like me to draw some pictures maybe your onswitches are off or something or i dont know the secret code that could lead us to a basis for some kind of mutual kindergarten understanding but in fact he had never had anything of an understanding with them not with these two the rest of the pleasure domes workers were regular folks but these twoeveryone avoided them like the plague hah even an asiatic plague santeson thought it was a funny thing because when they had come here looking for jobs a couple of months ago they had seemed like regular people too but now they never strayed far from the elevators and milan wouldnt go anywhere without them but come to think of it he never went anywhere much anyway and there was the same kind of look about him too so maybe they were blood relatives but santeson didnt think so finally one of them spoke mr santeson he said weve already told you three or four times a mr milan wont see you he isnt seeing anybody hes expecting a busy night and wants to get some rest if we take you to him it wont be you hell get mad with a well be in trouble so why dont you take some good advice and pausing in midsentence he gave a small but violent start and a facial tic began jerking the flesh at the corner of his mouth then his face took on an odd attitude of listening from the first word out of the minders mouth the spidery santeson had backed off a pacemainly from his breath the man had the worst case of crotch or armpitmouth that the private detective had ever come across his breath was so vile it literally stank like a cesspit or maybe like a slaughterhouse and now this he stood there as if hed been struck dumb with his head turned a little on one side and his strange eyes rapidly blinking but what was bothering him what was he listening to it lasted for maybe twelve to fifteen seconds until suddenly he gave his head a shake and straightened up and smiling in a twitchy nervous sort of way he said mr milan will see you now were to take you to him his eyes had stopped blinking earphone santeson thought direct communication with the boss this guy is wired definitely and in more ways than one but at least it gets the job done the other minder thumbed the button and the elevator doors opened santeson got in and the goons followed on then the one with the earphone used his key and the glass cage descended a down past the basement level then to a subbasement level where to santesons surprise the elevator didnt stop not until the next sublevel which wasnt even registered on the indicator and santeson had to admire the brilliance of it for anyone who wasnt wise to the system wouldnt even know that this nethermost level existed the elevator had lights but as the doors hissed open santeson saw that the corridor outside didnt well it did but so lowkey so subdued he might easily be in some ultralowclass hong kong brothel this way said one of the mindersand something else that had been niggling at santeson at once crystallized it was their voices voices that rumbled out of them they coughed or growled their words they fired them at you speech came bursting from them literally impacting on you or at least that was how it felt up in the casino in some kind of decent light the effect was lessened a lessend by the light maybe the accustomed surroundings a but down here in the neardarkness it was like these people belonged down here in the dark almost as if they were made for it the minders led the way santeson couldnt complain about that it was oddly reassuring to have these two in front of him and not behind but hed only taken a few paces when he stumbled and now that his eyes were growing accustomed to the gloom he saw why and also why the place had reminded him of a brothel it was the lighting the corridor was lit by a string of small red light bulbs well spacedout on a cable that was hooked up to a low ceiling but the ceiling was of stone likewise the walls and the floor natural stone hewn stone and this wasnt a corridor at all a except in the most primitive sense of the word a but a tunnel a tunnel carved from the bedrock and the floor was ridged and uneven o so santeson asked himself what did you expect down here you go far enough down and theres rock for christs sake and as he stumbled a second time mind the floor one of the minders grunted halfturning to glance back at him only halfturning but santeson got a glimpse of his eyes and he saw that they burned like sulphur in the dark he began to panic and immediately got a grip on himself it had to be a chemical reaction some kind of gas down here for all he knew his eyes might be burning yellow tool or perhaps a again perhaps a it was the lights like those fluorescent lights in the disco that made his false front teeth glow how ffar is it he heard himself say a stupid question stupidly put how long is a piece of string but for no reason at all that he could give name too santesons nerve was going and all of the smart talk lay dead in him and in front one of milans minders chuckled like a file on broken glass and answered not very ffar at all the walls had widened out disappeared into gloom the ceiling was higher and the light correspondingly dimmer ahead of santeson the broad backs of the minders were twin black silhouettes moving unerringly relentlessly through the darkness and leading him on like like what for suddenly out of nowhere there was this picture in his mind of a lamb with a noose round its neck and in his nostrils a waft of slaughterhouse breath that stung like a slap and as he tried to shut these scenes and sensations out still he wondered how do these people see in the dark now be very careful how you go one of them said and his voice echoed in what was obviously a large space but one that was filled with a powerful musk and a strange rustling and his colleague advised step where we step i cant see a ffucking thing santeson husked his voice a whisper in the darkness abruptly the minders paused so that he almost bumped into them they looked at each other questioningly then turned as a man to santeson and would you like to one of them coughed a query eh santeson stood there trembling llike tto would you like to see a ffucking thing said the minder tilting his head in inquiry his face gaping into such a grin as santeson just couldnt believe lights said his partner moving swiftly a with a flowing motion a away into the darkness camera said the one with the yawning cavern mouth giving santeson a small push in a certain direction and action came the others gurgling answer from some short distance away santesons balance was shot anyway weak as a baby stumbling away from the one who had pushed him he flailed his arms fought to stay on his feet but then he stepped on something a something that writhed or slithered underfoot a and at the same time was momentarily blinded as several neon tubes in the ceiling buzzed into life after thatmadness santeson no longer believed any of this it had to be dazzle from the sudden glare or his imagination or anything but it couldnt be real what lapped at his feetthat couldnt be real and what humped in one corner of the cave tossing and heavingthat wouldnt interface with reality at alla auntil it looked at him and said hhhelp meeeee and then he knew it was real as his eyes rolled up and he flopped so the minders were there beside him taking him under the arms bearing his weight as easily as if he were a child tall thin and spidery as santeson was his knees scraped along the stony floor as they bore him up and away out of the cave of the seething thing to malinari three hours earlier crouching low under the circular shimmer of the jetcopters fan and calling jakes name liz merrick was buffeted by a blistering whirlwind of heat where she ran across the helipad to where chopper two was making ready to take off jake shouldnt have been able to hear her over the highpitched whining of the engine and vanes but he heard her anyway sliding a gunners door halfway open he clung to a strap leaned out and down and took the fluttering envelope that she passed up to him and with a last long look into her eyes seeing the pain in them he felt the slight tremor that warned of imminent takeoff and closed the door to the merest crack the chopper lifted off rose up and turned once slowly through a hundred and eighty degrees liz came back into view shed moved into a safe position at the edge of the helipad and was waving up at him he opened the door a fraction more waved back but then as the chopper gained altitude keeled on its side a little and headed north she was lost to sight jake closed the door and took his seat beside lardis lidesci and thinking hard a thinking about liz and thinking at her a he said take care of yourself liz you be sure to take very good care of yourself you too she told him quite clearly and also im sorry jake it was in jakes mind to ask her what about but since he believed he already knew there wasnt much point in it moreover he knew that it wasnt her fault that she really didnt have anything to be sorry about it was the job that kept coming between them a ben trask and ebranch a and ebranch would always come first but a picture of liz stayed in his mind a her nightblack hair cut in that boyish bob her intelligent seagreen eyes her curves of course and her smile like a ray of bright light a standing there at the edge of the helipad waving and gradually dwindling into the distance and despite that it was all in his minds eye jake knew that in fact she was still there watching the jetcopter right out of sight he had put the envelope in his pocket now as the rumble of the choppers jets took over and he felt forward acceleration he took it out to read what liz had written on the single leaf of paper that was folded inside but as he unfolded it from liz lardis grunted mind your own business jake answered she thinks a lot of you that cuts both ways said jake can you read our language some said lardis when its printed but handwriting not a chance it looks like spider shit to me good said jake and despite the old lidescis sideways squint he read what was written jakeits a bit late but you asked me to remind you of a name a the name was korath you may not remember it but if you do youll probably think im a treacherous bitch if so well theres not much that i can do about it but it seemed to me you thought this was pretty important and since we dont know whats coming it could be a question of now or never my one chance to put things straighta aor to mess them up completely i care for you more than you know and a lot more than circumstances have let me show please take care liz jake read it through again korath the name rang a bell but it was a far and almost forgotten clamour something hed dreamed well that was what she was talking about obviously the fact that shed been snooping on him again when he slept but so what it was her job and he would simply have to learn to accept it a and liz would have to learn to accept whatever she found in there in his subconscious mind like it or not his recurrent nightmare well that would explain yesterdays coolness certainly but korath again jake heard the ringing of that distant bell a perhaps a warning bell and this time more insistently a and he frowned as he tried to recall whatever it meant back into the focus of his memory was it something that hed dreamed jake had read a few things about dreams and he knew that to many others they were of special significance to him however dreams had usually been trivial easily forgotten things the scurf or sloughedoff skin of more fully fleshedout ideas and concepts from his waking hours and he wondered how often does a man retain detailed memories of what he dreams and for how long nightmares were one thing but common or garden dreams and again he thought korath but this time it was a very deliberate thought and unguarded and it was deadspeak immediately there was someone a or some thing a there in his mind shadows sprang into being and it came with them you called said a glutinous voice that was both surprised and pleased causing jake to start and you remembered but how much have you remembered its all there jake just waiting to come back to you but i feel your sense of shock a the way you recoil from me a and i wonder do you really remember what is it jake why did you call out to me what in the name of said jake and at once instinctively brought mental barriers crashing down to shut whatever it was a this thing this other this korath a out of his mind the other fled or was banished at once and jake heard him go his frustrated cry of rage denial as he disappeared into the deadspeak aether no jake no dont send me away youll know soon enough how much you need me and you must always remember i have the numbers i have the numbers jake and i know the waaayyy then he was gone eh said lardis staring hard at jake at a face turned pale and gaunt eh what is there something you gave a start just then you said something and the way you look but shhh jake shook his head concentrated and remembered remembered it all but most of all that hed almost made a deal with a vampire and he remembered something else harry keoghs warning that even a dead vampire is a dangerous thing that you should never ever let into your mind you look peculiar said the old lidesci jake looked at him swallowed hard and slowly got a grip of himself it wasit was nothing he said nothing that i want to talk about now anyway later maybe a to liz and ben trask a when tonights business is over and between timeshe dug out a ballpoint and began to make shaky notes on lizs scrap of paper for while he still hadnt quite come to terms with everything that was happening to him and whether or not this latest manifestation was some kind of daydream mental quirk evidence of a dual personality or whatever still jake knew that it was something he must remember in detail something that he really couldnt afford to forget chopper two disembarked its task force in gladstone and refuelled earlier that day three sas men had made the long drive up to gladstone to check that all was in order with the coastguard vessel now the two units met up for a final briefing the attack on the island would be twopronged along with wo ii joe davis and four ncos jake and lardis lidesci would be airborne four more ncos would be in the boat zero hour a the time scheduled for the launch of simultaneous attacks on both the capricorn group island and the mountain resort of xanadu a had been set for pm the weather was good and the sea flat calm and with just ninety minutes to go to zero hour the boat cast off and an hour later with the light failing as the sun sank down behind the great dividing range chopper two got airborne again at the same time at the brisbane flying club chopper one was warming up ready to go ben trask and the sas major joint operational commanders were in a hangar using a radio in one of the vehicles the precog lan goodly liz merrick and the rest of the sas men were trooping out to the jetcopter their combat suits fluttering in the bluster of disturbed night air that stank of hot exhaust fumes at trask transmitted callsigns one two and three signals a over and the answers came back one okay a over two okay a over three okay a over sitreps said trask and three identical answers came back one after the other on schedule and all systems are go synchronizing watches said trask then waited a second set your watches to i say again figures sixer one seven counting down i now have a three two one zero a precisely good hunting and good luck over roger that and out and lets go said trask he and the major ran out under the gleaming vanes of the jetcopter and boarded her moments later she took off and headed south for xanadu in chopper one trask had just minutes left to talk to liz lan goodly and the major im concerned he said theres something wrong and i dont know what it is its a feeling that a i dont know a that everything weve done or were trying to do is somehow misguided as if were on the wrong track or weve been misled or theres something weve overlooked that sounds like your talent at work ben said the precog and then he sighed well im glad that someones talent is working and you trask looked at him nothing just trouble goodly sighed again just problems frustration confusion but as you know i cant force it it comes when it comes but in your caseis it anything specific no trask shook his head so it seems were in the same boat a or airplane its afeeling thats all i had it today up at the observation post on the mountain road when i looked up the road toward xanaduit was all so quiet so normal perhaps too quiet too normal a lie more like i was deceiving myself said trask this is a covert operation but it didnt feel like one especially after that incident with lizs watcher he glanced at her a a guilty look she thought a and said i should have paid more attention to you but i wasnt that sure myself liz said and anyway im the new kid on the block i could have been wrong thats what i mean said trask we all have our talents and i should have listened to yours if we had turned back and i had seen that fellow i would have known at once but we didnt and i didnt i blame myself at which the major looking more than a little concerned came in with miss gentlemen i have some difficulty following you a these skills of yours you understand a but are you saying the operation is in jeopardy trask shook his head then changed his mind and said any operation concerning these creatures is hazardous but we have to go in no matter what its all set up and we mightnt get a i a better chance but with our weapons and providing everyone remembers the drills i cant see what can go wrong liz glanced at her watch five minutes she said and as at a signal the intercom began buzzing the pilot was on the earphones saying message from callsign one the mindsmog has been awake but more or less static for some time now its on the move but only locally callsign one is also mobile his eta the target area is five minutes trask answered tell him roger that well see him there and not to forget his noseplugs then turning to the bulk of the helicopter party and you mustnt forget yours they hadnt forgotten aerosol sprays were hissing a fine garlic mist filled the air settling on everyones clothing it was almost a pleasure to insert filter plugs like fat cigarette tips deep into their nostrils in xanadu from a position some two hundred feet up the almost sheer rock wall of the mountainside lord malinari of the wamphyri looked down on the sprawling dark cobweb of the deserted resort and at the single road that wound its serpentine route up the steep mountain contours to xanadus gates malinaris vantage point was a roughlyhewn room carved from the solid rock at the head of a natural chimney when xanadu was being built it had been jethro manchesters intention to create a special entertainment here there was to have been a skilift or cablecar from the gardens up to this point and a series of aquachutes back down to the pools the chimney had been fitted with a spiralling service andor emergencystaircase behind a facade constructed to match the flanking cliffs so disguising the chimneys vertical fault and work had commenced on this room or landing stage at which point technical difficulties had caused the project to be abandoned now the chimney was lord malinaris bolthole from xanadu from this window he would fly out on the night wind and glide down to a place in which he had long since secreted a cache of clothing money and other necessaries to speed him on his way to his next venture but not before he ensured that the chase ended here and that this ebranch had suffered such losses as to finish it forever or at least slow it down until his vavaras and szwarts greater scheme was brought into play malinari looked down on xanadu and smiled a hideous smile if only he could be down there to see the mayhem but that way he might find himself caught up in all of the destruction and that was out of the question as for xanadu itself oh he might bemoan a very little the waste of this placebut not for very long for the world was a wider place far and his plans of conquest of far greater scope a shame that his garden with its special crop must be discovered a especially now that it had been nourished so recently or then again perhaps it would not be found for it was after all hidden away in the subterranean darkness that suited it so very well in which case it would lie there all unattended and dormant for now only to flourish later in its own good time for what malinari had seeded would not die unless it were put down deliberately and utterly destroyed ah the tenacity of the great vampire and of his works as for the last of malinaris human watchdogs the spiderlike gangling garth santeson was by now no more he had served his purpose the moment he warned of ebranchs arrival here an intrusion that malinari had been expecting ever since his lieutenant bruce trennier died the true death some few days ago far in the western desert and of which hed had warning apart from and since trenniers demise not alone from garth santeson a warning aye and delivered by a seeming idiot but even an idiot may have his uses malinari had certainly found a good use for that one but poor trennier the manner of his passing malinari remembered it well those last few moments of the mans miserable life the faithful servant crying his agonies and malinari the mind the master feeling something of those agonies even here in xanadu theire that awesome allconsuming withering fire that melted even metamorphic flesh exploded bone liquefied sinew and reduced all to ashes it had lasted a while a the pain too trenniers pain a until malinari had been obliged to shut it out of his mind but through the jet of blistering heat that stripped trenniers flesh from his body and finally blinded and destroyed him malinari had recognized some of the faces of his lieutenants tormentors the face of ben trask remembered from the mind ofzek foener and that of lan goodly yet another man of weird talents but if only malinari had had longer with the foener woman there had been so much more that he might have learned and so very much more that he would have enjoyedof that beautiful woman herself perhaps and not only her mind well too late for that now a too late from the moment he hurled her down that shaft into oblivion a but at least he had fathomed something of the dangers of this world especially the greatest danger of all which was ebranch and now they had found himas he had known they would against which inevitability hed long since taken ingenious and even marvellous precautions on a board bolted to the wall close to malinaris window a master switch stood in the off position beside a series of smaller electrical switches set in a roughly oblong array the array was a precise match for xanadu itself its concentric pattern of switches duplicating the cobweb design of the resort in the gloom of the mountain saddle now waiting there in his secret bolthole malinari threw the master switch there was a low answering hum of power but nothing more and his slender fingers were impatient where they fluttered over the smaller switches a those electrical messengers of instantaneous death a as he gloatingly rehearsed a certain sequence first the outer chalets to close them in then the inner structures to catch them where they run and when finally they think they have me trapped in my nightdark dome his hand trembled with pent anticipation over the central switch a pleasure dome aye but for my pleasure not theirs he laughed a coughing laugh long and lowthen paused abruptly down there coming into view along the approach road toward xanadus gates a vehicle the night was dark now a but night and darkness were malinaris greatest allies a and that vehicle with its lowered carefully probing lights the coiledspring tension in its vengeful passengers malinari sensed it their human bloodlust a or what passed for bloodlust in men a and laughed again bloodlust why nephran malinari had pissed thicker blood than coursed through the veins of whelps such as these and with his telepathic probes concentrating on the vehicle he felt what its occupants felt fear of the great unknown that was malinari oh he recognized and relished it primal fear of the night and what the night might bring its roots burrowing like worms in every human fibre revenant of caverndwelling ancestors fear in the face of an alien threat the menace of the bloodbeast but tempering the fear holding it at bay there was also a wall of grim determination and bolstering that blind determination the sure knowledge of vastly superiorfirepower oh really and again malinari laughed but a second later hissed and grimaced and clasped his handsomely alien head in wildly trembling hands it was the pain a those lightningflashes of terrible pain which ever accompanied any excessive use of his mentalism a the pain that came from searching out or listening to the thoughts of so many others and of suffering the tumult of their massed emotions their thronging dreams and fancies for weirdly mutated minds were gathering here now and the greater their talents the more piercing the pain in his head cursing vividly in the tongue of starside malinari swiftly withdrew his probes and as the pain receded so he relaxed a little and gave vent once more to strained broken laughter but strained and broken he had thought often enough about that before a even malinari a finding cause to wonder the laughter of a madman well perhaps it was at that though he preferred to think of himself as merelyeccentric and anyway what of it when a man is unique surely he has a right to such small idiosyncrasies drawing him back from his musing the fading pounding in malinaris temples was suddenly matched by a stuttering in the sky the mechanical throbbing of jets as their power diverted to whirling fanlike vanes and though momentarily startled a sufficiently so that he lifted his crimson gaze to the dragonfly shape that blurred the stars a still he felt no real concern or threat his plans were laid and every eventuality had been anticipated even this one down in the gardens in front of the casino that was the most obvious of the few places where the jetcopter could land but it was also one of the many places that malinari had mined and hah so be it he thought now let this game commence the car at the gate issued a single man equipped with a heavy deadly automatic weapon he crouched low and ran to the small openfronted chalet that housed reception a rearguard of course also a guard against anyone trying to escape these guileless fools no one would be trying to escape from xanadu a well except for these ridiculous invaders themselves as for malinari quitting the placebut that was the plan and in any case what would it serve to stay when this was all over there would be nothing left to stay for and now the flying machine was settling towards the garden its searchlight beams flickering over the dark casino the chalets the pools and suddenly the cars lights were blazing bright lighting the way as it sped to its rendezvous its rendezvous with certain deathbut not just yet first let trask and these ebranch people taste something of what they had brought down on themselves when of their own free will they had chosen to pursue nephran malinari lord malinari aye of the wamphyyrrriiii the coastguard vessel made smoke where she lolled portside on to the narrow strip of sandy beach that fronted jethro manchesters island apparently crippled she rocked this way and that in the gentle wavelets of the night surf on her starboard side hidden by the cabin an sas man aimed his flamethrower at the sky and fired shortlived bursts of flame above the cabins roof as viewed from the island it would seem for certain that the ruddily lit boat was on fire even as her keel bit into the sand so a signal flare made a starburst high in the sky also in the sky but not so very high now a indeed wheeling in low over the oceans horizon a chopper twos pilot saw the starburst and told his crew were over the island i can see the boat burning down there and the lights of the villa in the trees so this is it jump to it as soon as we touch down ill be airborne and waiting for you when you get done you can whistle me down i mean you know how to whistle dont you good luck guys dark figures were running up the beach as the chopper came down and a faint waft of garlic tainted the night air chapter thirtytwo the storming situated one hundred and sixty yards from where the coastguard vessel had beached and set well back from the highwater mark behind massively thick fortresslike rock walls in four acres of landscaped rockeries and gardens watered from a small desalination unit jethro manchesters twostorey villa was a luxurious custombuilt dwelling standing central on a jutting promontory the house was of timber and natural stone mainly fossilized coral it had been built from imported teak and dynamited rubble from a channel blasted through to a rocky inlet on the other side of the promontory in style it was part sprawling roman villa part austrian chalet manchesters yacht a by his standards a modest thirtyfive footer a was moored in a roofedover lock in the artificial channel midway between the villa and the sea these features were visible from the air where at five hundred feet chopper twos pilot stood his machine off like a hawk and viewed them through its eyes sensitive nightvision scanners every few seconds he would flip a switch to convert his screen to infrared and thermal imaging all of the men on the ground were wearing headsets the pilot was able to talk to them individually or as a group all subterfuge had been thrown to the wind now the airborne party was safely down and the boat had landed its crew without hindrance now the task force would deploy into a semicircle to isolate the promontory and move in on the house if the target group had seen the boats fire or emergency flare a or if they had heard the choppers low prowlermode throb and came out of the house to see what was happening or perhaps to take defensive action a then the men on the ground would be able to answer the threat without fear of firing on each other with his machine on autopilot the pilots attention was rapt on his viewers for now in addition to the central gently fluctuating orange glow of the house the darkgreen terrain of his screen was lit by smaller blobs of human heat he saw two figures fastmoving and crouching low about to leave the narrow strip of beach and enter an area of landscaped rocks and foliage east of the villa they were heading for one of the regular breaks in the wall and the pilot knew that the fourman boat party had split into two twoman teams this was one of them they would be equipped with their usual weapons and one of them would be carrying a flamethrower but as the pilot scanned ahead of them suddenly as if from nowhere he picked up two more figures they were in the shrubbery or under cover of the trees but they were making a lot of heat the writhing bloblike shapes on the screen merged drew apart melted together againa repetitious oddly sexuallooking activity the men from the boat were heading directly towards it and at some speed and the pilot was almost too late to advise them boat party east of the house theres some fucking thing directly ahead of you he couldnt know it but he was absolutely right on the ground the ncos spied sudden apparently startled movement it was dark but not that dark and the almost luminous tangle of flesh on a blanket under the bowerlike branches of a tall flowering shrub was unmistakable the naked figures of a couple making love or they had been but now sprang apart what thepthe man sat upright and the girl tried to cover herself and gave a small warbling cry the scene was so authentic and natural and the couple seemed so vulnerable it was the sas men who were taken by surprise bloody helli said one of them his jaw falling open and his companion actually turned aside the barrel of his weapon a little deflecting it from the pair and easing his finger off the trigger surprise yes a momentary disorientation and confusion a the only advantage a vampire could ever ask for or require and oh thank god cried the girl as she threw herself forward and sprawled at the feet of one of the soldiers help me please help me he was raping me a lie which of course fell naturally from her lips but at the same time the naked mans arm swept up to aim and fire a shortbarrelled compressedair speargun the spearhead was a trident with fourinch tines all three of them took the offguard soldier in his throat and gurgling clawing onehanded at the short spear in his crimsonspurting neck he fell over backward and let loose a burst of automatic fire uselessly into the sky the other soldier had reached down almost instinctively to lift the girl to her feet but even in the act of gathering her up he saw his colleague shot and simultaneously the feral yellow fire in the naked mans eyes as he flowed sinuously upright and drew back his arm to use the speargun as a club no further reminder was necessary the soldier cursed and put the naked girl aside then opened up with a burst of explosive shells that lifted the vampire from his feet ripped into him in midair and threw him backward into the shrub there he hung in a tangle of crushed foliage until branches snapped and he fell to the ground and as he sat there a groping among his own intestines and mewling his undead agony a so the gibbering nco cursed again and put a single shell right between his eyes the contents of the vampires head went every which way as the shrub collapsed on him meanwhile the downed man had stopped writhing and tugging at the spear in his throat he lay dead still dead of shock or from choking on his own blood and the girl had disappeared into the night fleeing sobbing gasping for air a with her sliced feet leaving a trail of blood on the often jagged stones a julie lennox somehow managed to avoid the second pair of men from the coastguard vessel and came across jake and lardis instead with her night eyes the eyes of a vampire she saw them before they saw her an old man and his younger colleague in the garden keeping low and making their way silently toward the house and she remembered some advice that shed been given when they come and they will come there wont be any mercy theyll come to kill you and while you might not believe it now you wont want them to for you have a great vampires blood in you and in its own way it is alive too it wants to live and it wont let you commit suicide a which means that you cant simply give yourselves up to these men ergo youll fight and the more of them that you kill the longer youll stay alive with which he had rammed a handful of shells deep into the magazine of an ugly pumpaction shotgun and jerked once on its heavy wooden stock to arm it before continuing now while i know that some of you are still fighting the good fight the fact is we can grow strong on our enemies a on the blood of our enemies a and the stronger we grow the better our chances of survival so thats it now you know what to do i have nothing more to say except that i for one intend to survive so go on get busy prepare yourselves with whatever grit or cunning your vampire blood has bestowed arm yourselves with whatever weapons you can find and wait its just as simple as that but in fact it wasnt simple at all simple perhaps for martin trennier one of the first taken by aristotle milan and utterly in thrall to him but not for julie not now that alan manchester jethros son was dead julie and alanhow they had loved each other and how desperately hard they had fought to cling to their humanity but all in vain alan had turned first and now he was dead and gone taken from her and these merciless invaders were responsible a werent they deep in her heart she knew they werent and yet as moment by moment trenniers words made more sense so the vampire essence in julies system worked on her turning her too trennier had done it to her done it to them all a simple bite was all it took a and time for trennier was barely a lieutenant himself and a weak one at that made by milan he had been given a minimum of essence and so hed been a thrall for long and long but as the evil had grown in him so hed taken on stature guile strength and thus hed become milans lieutenant to watch over the manchesters on their island retreat or as it was now their prison when they had known their end was near julie and alan had come out into the night into the garden to make love just one last time they hadnt reckoned on being found so quickly that was all not in their own secret place in the garden on their prison island their prison yesindeed their death cell or perhaps not for as the blood is the life so there was plenty of hot blood in these two men and without warning suddenly julie caught herself licking her lips in anticipation at which she knew that it was too late for her and that it always had been but strangely a and as swiftly as that a she no longer cared for she was now awake as for what had awakened her perhaps it had been the sight and salty smell of alan manchesters blood or that of the soldier whom hed shot with his speargun or both which or whatever it had acted on julie as a catalyst and now the good fight was over she was what she was and would do what she must do she moved like a wraith towards the two men got behind them where they crept carefully forward making for the villas lights she got closer and closer to them her hands raised with nails like poisonous claws a indeed they were poisonous claws a poised and ready to strike but in that same moment julie found herself betrayed and by three things one the full moon emerging from behind fleeting clouds to sweep a silver swath over the sea and the land two by the sharp stutter of automatic gunfire sounding from a short distance to the west and three by a watchful dragonfly spyinthesky hovering on high as it sent an urgent message to julies wouldbe victims central team why are there three of you do you have a tail fading in and out the pilots words were hard to read lardis didnt understand the message but jake startled by the gunfire and the neardistant cries that accompanied it turned and saw a girl a distraught naked girl for seeing him beginning his turn julie had drawn back shrunk down into herself begun to sob and scream i was in the house she sobbed trying to cover herself as if ashamed of her nakedness they kept me prisoner there but when they heard your helicopter they stopped watching me and iandioh she feigned a swoon and jake a forgetting all that hed seen all that hed been told a put up his weapon and stepped forward she clung to him for a moment this beautiful girl who was naked and frightened and so pale in the flooding light of the moonso pale and so cold this girl whose grip on his combat suit was like iron and whose nose was suddenly wrinkling suspiciously as she smelled garlic and whose eyes were a reflective yellow sulphurous in the night a julie held the front of his jacket bunched in one hand drew back the other hand until jake saw its nails sharpened and bevelled to gouges that would cut bloody channels in his face as easily as a routing machine and her awful smile the way her lips curled back from gleaming teeth jake tried to bring his machinepistol to bear to centre its muzzle on julies body but she was faster she knocked it away out of his grasp and now her smile was a fixed nightmarish grimace a but whether of horror or of pleasure in her own terrible strength jake couldnt say nor could he do anything about it but lardis could an old man lardis lidesci had been ignored and almost forgotten by the girl a mistake for he was an old man with a difference he was the old lidesci and not nearly as naive as jake not in the ways of vampires jake saw that slender incredibly strong hand lift up before his face tried to draw back from it and couldnt he saw the fingers crook could almost feel their rake and knew that he was going to feel it but then in a moment the look on her face changed and she sighed she sighed then smiled again but a real smile now and a dribble of blood spilled from the corner of her mouth her hand straightened out a reached out to touch his face a but just a touch almost a caress then her grip relaxed her eyes rolled up and she toppled away from him lardis lidesci stood ten feet away but his machete stood much closer than that it stood up from the girls back where it had split her spinal column get your gun lardis growled and jake began to breathe again after what had seemed like an hour of holding his breath get your gun and put it in her mouthand finish it jake was numb his hands were numb as he took up his machinepistol but he started to say but nothing lardis snarled do it and be sure to turn your face away just before jake did it julie stopped her fitful agonized writhing saw the weapons muzzle approaching her face said something that jake couldnt hear just a breath of air but he was sure that her lips formed the words thank you by then there was plenty of shouting and shooting the hissing of flamethrowers great gouts of fire and columns of smoke all of it towards the centre of the promontory at the villa itself and full moon or none it would have made no difference bright orange and yellow flames were leaping and all the shadows cast back in jethro manchesters gardens and rockeries lardis and jake were the last to get there but two of the sas men would never get there close to the house itself burning they came across wo ii joe davis and one of his men the nco had a flamethrower and was watching the house davis was on one knee looking at a pair of crumpled figures his hands kept reaching and drawing back without touching and his hands were trembling get up from there said lardis back away let me see davis looked up at lardis through moist eyes he was holding on but only just to wouldbe runaway emotions his adams apple rose and fell rose and fell as he fought not to betray himself old man he said his voice on the point of breaking i trained this man this boy he was one of mine but i didnt train him for this lardis pulled him away muttering what could anyone have taught him there is no training for this kind of thing except on the field of battle the trouble with that is we only learn when we lose he looked at the mess on the ground part of it the body of a mature woman in a oncewhite dress was a mound of raw red flesh riddled with bullets a some of which had exploded a she had been torn apart from within her face wasnt there and her lower body seemed to have burst outwards lying under her where shed fallen a young soldier in combat clothing stared blindly up into the sky his brains had been split by a bright shining cleaver that was still buried in his skull but even as lardis looked the womans arms twitched where they clasped her victim and one foot shuddered and vibrated in a shoe with a broken heel jerkily spastically her chest rose and fell as bubbles formed in the liquid red mask of her face did you touchany of this lardis looked up at davis the other shook his head then lardis stood up stood back and turned to the man with the flamethrower burn it he said the man looked at his leader who in turn looked at lardis almost pleadingly and lardis said their blood is mixed your mans corpse is contaminated take no chances burn it all as they moved away from the heat and the stench davis got hold of his emotions and said tve got men on both sides in front and at the back of the house no ones getting out of there as far as i know that woman was only our second kill my kill god help me i did that to her no lardis shook his grisly head dont ask your god for help she needed help and you gave it to her also it was the third kill weve done one too a girl back there in the garden so youre not the only one whos feeling sick and jake said who was the other when i killedthat one davis answered with a glance over his shoulder there was a scream from the house a man in a gable window he ranted and raved at us tore his hair like a madman cant say i blame him i think the woman must have been his wife one of my lads fired a grenade in there with him and it blew the gable to hell whoever he was im guessing he went with it but if he didnt hell burn anyway look they looked back and by then the front of the villa was an inferno itll be the same at the back said the warrant officer they have orders to raze it but that still leaves three to go said jake two a voice called out as a man came stumbling from the shadows he was very pale and he was carrying his own weapons someone elses and a flamethrower i got a young guy a i blew the fuckers head off a but not before he got bill powers my old mates deadbut there was a girl too she got away no jake shook his head she didnt and two to go said lardis but where are they right on cue their radio headsets came alive in a crackle of static like frying bacon and shit shit shit a frantic voice called cant anyone fucking hear me and davis said hawkeye this is road runner whereve you been whereve been the pilot at once came back his relief plainly audible despite that his voice kept fading in and out ive been sitting up here listening to you the radios on the blink im receiving but having difficulty sending now listen ive also had problems with the thermal imagingthe heat from that bonfire down there i sorted that but now there are lifesigns at the boat two of them if theyre not your people they have to be the ones youre looking for show us the way to the yacht davis snapped now fully in command again but if it gets away from us and makes a run for the sea take it out bomb the bastard right out of the water roger that and the signal faded to nothinga abut in another moment searchlight beams lanced down from on high pierced the night and converged swung west and traced a path along the channel to the sea in xanadu fifteen minutes earlier malinari had been tempted from the moment chopper one descended into the garden the way it hovered mere feet above the ground with its pontoons occasionally touching down while its taskforce contingent rapidly disembarked regrouped into pairs and fanned out toward the casino all it would have taken was a little pressure a literally the flip of a switch a and malinaris worst enemies in this world would have been gone forever or most of them only the group from the vehicle would be left alive to be dealt with at his convenience the way his fingers had caressed the array of switches a almost lovingly certainly lustfully a it had been a moment of great temptation yes but no it would have been too easy and this trask and his men would have learned nothing of terror or the merest moment of terror perhaps before oblivion and that just wasnt good enough malinari wanted them to understand something of his superiority wanted them to know they were trapped even as they had thought to trap him then if there were survivors of his holocaust and when the flying machine returned to pick them uptime enough then for the grand coup de grace the final stroke of genius and meanwhile things had progressed more or less as planned and malinari employed his mentalism to stay in touch with events as they unfurled for his telepathy wasnt without its own problems indeed it was a twoedged sword for one thing it brought pain listening to the thoughts of others was painful and for another a and most importantly a lord malinari himself his location in the face of the mountain might be detected and jeopardized if he were to give full rein to his mentalism for he had learned something of the esoteric talents of trask and this ebranch from the foener woman before hed killed her in the sump of that watercourse and he had found out a lot more since then mainly by trial and error but it had been ngreat error to open his mind and accept bruce trenniers agonized communication a his final communication a when these people had tracked him down to the gibson desert for even as malinari had felt the heat of his lieutenants funeral pyre so hed known a different kind of heat that of discovery when a probe reached out from halfway around the world to seek him out zeroing in on him like a starside bat searching for a juicy moth or a sunside hawk stooping to its prey a mind had touched his and left its fingerprint its signature there so that he would know it again and in this last few days he had come to know it only too well now it was here in xanadu but if he studied it too closely and if it were to lock on to his locationa athat flying machine that jetcopter was equipped with armaments that could cut through the false facade of this hollow chimney like a battle gauntlet through the ribs of a disobedient thrall but it all added to the excitement the thrill of the game what little it afforded him their weird talents and their puny human minds against the mind himself so this seeker bloodhound locator or whatever he was was one problem a and his talent was one that nephran malinari understood readily enough for he had used just such skills in sunside four hundred years ago to seek out the szgany in their hiding places a but the locators wild talent wasnt the only one that this ebranch commanded and it wasnt the only problem zek foeners mind had been full of such things a man who could see the future for example and trask himself to whom a lie was like a slap in the facethere would be no deceiving that one and as for mentalists no lack of those well that last wasnt so rare even the szgany had something of that in them it was in their blood a legacy of their centuries under wamphyri domination but these ebranch people werent szgany no they were adepts much as malinari was an adept but lacking the advantage of his severalrefinements and of course without the ultimate advantage of being wamphyri take zek herself for instance what a woman who could reach out her thoughts across the whole world with such crystal clarity as to be able to speak to a man like trask a not himself a mentalist a and make him to understand oh he was a loved one and so there had probably been an element of rapport in it such as is found in twins but still and all that was a talent or it had been adepts rivals enemies and bloodhound trackers who would never let go all the more reason why they must go and tonight but it would have been so useful to know more about them first such people as this precog and this locator and ben trask himselfand this girl the girl yes she wasnt an adept not yet she hadnt attained zek foeners level of achievement but to another telepathic mind she was like a small flame guttering in the psychic aether and he had sensed her there from the moment these people arrived in brisbane but at such close proximity a because she was close now and inexperienced a he might perhaps intrude for brief periods without fear of her detecting his presence of course that would leave him open to the locator but only introduce some small diversion into the game and that would take care of that men even talented men when they are concerned for their own skins have little time for casting about with their minds except that they look for boltholes of course very well then a diversion for in any case the game was moving far too slowly from his high vantage point malinari looked down on xanadu and the pleasure dome casino and chose a switch on his array down there his enemies had deployed into firstphase positions there were men held in reserve four of them evenly spaced out at the rear of the leisure area of gardens and pools that surrounded the casino these four would believe theyd secured or made safe their strategic positions behind low walls just forward of the innermost circle of chalets equipped with superior heatseeking imageenhancing weapons they would consider themselves ideally situated to engage an enemy in flight from the central area and so they would be a if not for the fact that two of the four locations were mined malinaris hand lingered over the chosen switch while his scarlet nightvision eyes swept over scanned and committed to memory the second phase of the enemys deployment in the last few minutes a large vehicle a an articulated truck marked with the symbols of a wellknown beer manufacturer a had climbed the access road entered through xanadus gates turned about and hissed to a halt in the otherwise empty parking lot a party of four heavily armed men had issued from the rear of the truck and were hurrying forward into the resort in the direction of the pleasure dome inwards a at the inner edge of the gardens toward the casino a five ncos from the helicopter fanned out to surround the huge rotunda of the central dome itself the men from the truck were now replacing the four in their rearguard positions behind the low walls which allowed them in their turn to move forward and reinforce the assault force around the domes perimeter now or when they were so ordered three of these special forces men would go in through the pleasure domes main doors the rest of them dispersed around the perimeter would create individual points of entry the casinos curving faaade of interlocking concrete panels glass and reinforced plastic would scarcely suffice to stop them malinari was sure it was after all a pleasure dome not a fortress so much for the fighting men and malinari presumed correctly that their commander would be with trasks ebranch party where they were now gathered in a group behind the smaller vehicle on the main esplanade some seventy or eighty feet in front of the steps to the casinos canopied entranceway he knew that this was them because of their mental emanations hah rut they might as well be carrying illuminated signs they were as visible to him as they must be to the pilot of their flying machineas indeed he would be if he were down in the resort so they were all set to go and the onset of hostilities which must be imminent might create sufficient of a diversion in itself allowing malinari to insinuate himself into the mentalist girls mind without alerting the locator to his presence a but he thought not much better to be safe than sorry let them be the sorry ones earlier before these people got here malinari had started a mist his body and being a even his existence here in this or any world a these things were all contradictions of nature he was a poison that worked like a catalyst on and against any natural or mundane surroundings when he opened the pores of his metamorphic body and willed it his pores would breathe a mist not only that but nature would be made to respond to answer his call and even from the dry earth malinari could call up a writhing mist like vile airborne sweat to disguise his presence in sunside it had served a dual purpose to carry his probes more surely to their target and also to hide him away should he have reason to make a covert exit a in short a smokescreen but this time so as not to draw attention to himself he had merely started the thing set it in motion and now a fine milky mist lay on the surface of the pools and formed a barely visible ground mist in the gardens but only let malinari will it it would spring into being at his command and in the holocaust to come he would call it up in earnest to carry his mentalism instil its primal terror and add to the general confusion so then it was time to set the wheels in motion time for his diversion time to let these fools know who he was he risked a quick guarded probe found one of his thralls inside the open doors to the casino issued a command and withdrewbut with no time at all to spare and even as malinari felt his probe seized upon a and as he heard chungs gasp of startled recognition what the a so he tripped the first of his switches six or seven minutes earlier inside the innocuouslooking in fact armoured estate car ben trask david chung lan goodly liz and the sas major were each in their own way concerned the major because the articulated ops truck and its backup party were some minutes late chopper one had relayed the reason for the delay the big vehicles engine had developed a fault that and the steepness of the climb had combined to slow her down the gradient trask said but it could have been any of a hundred and one other logistical problems well we made allowances for this kind of lastminute difficulty its why were made up of three contingents chopper car ops truck okay so were four men short for the time being but assuming our estimate of malinaris manpower is accurate we still outnumber him three or four to one and our firepower is awesome and chung said that bothers me a lot what you just said about our estimate for the fact is its my estimate so really its all down to me no it isnt goodly denied it its our best estimate and were each of us equally involved in this or we should be and anyway its like i told ben earlier at least your talents are working for you trask looked at him still nothing just confusion the precog answered and a feeling you and me both trask said and the others saw that he was actually chewing his top lip a feeling yesthat this is all wrong okay in a deserted resort wed expect the lights to be out a why waste the energy but the silence of the place this feeling of a pentup something and this inactivity ours or theirs said liz trask shook his head i dont know a really cant say a what i was expecting but it certainly wasnt this i mean he must know were here he has to so what the hell is he up to david he turned to the locator got any ideas is there any movement whats going on chungs high brow was etched into deep lines of concentration its weird as hell he said tm getting these momentary flashes it is mindsmog definitely but from three or four different locations and i cant pin them down up there in the dome thats one of them for sure but the others he looked out of his wounddown window at the nightshrouded cliffs where they climbed to the heights behind the resort and frowned up high and down belowthats as much as i dare venture up high would be the bubble on top of the pleasure dome lan goodly came in but chung only frowned well possibly he said for its as strong a source as any but there are shields in use im sure of that and malinari trask grunted grimly his aerie solarpanelled on the outside painted black and probably curtained on the inside for his protection well the murdering bastard will be needing all he can get of that so thats up high said liz but what about down below it looks like jake was right and according to the plans of the place its a real maze down there and turning to trask ben i wish youd let me try to corroborate davidsa ano way trask snapped turning on her at once thats right out of the question no telepathic contact not with malinari only if it becomes absolutely necessary maybe ill use you then a but not until and only if i have to liz this is a mentalist who ranks alongside janos ferenczy and its one mind youre not going to enter of your own free will trask and his team were without radio headsets as espers they needed clear heads and were better off without the encumbrance of technical equipment this was a time when the gadgets would only get in the way of the ghosts and anyway since they planned on sticking close to the sas major throughout the operation radio contact seemed superfluous to requirement but they did hear the faint crackle of static as suddenly the major held up a hand and a moment later the big artic is in sight he sighed his relief theyve had a long hard haul but theyre getting here as he got out of the car he went on its time we had a little fresh air but take cover behind the vehicle were in a direct line of fire from the casino absolutely chung agreed choking on the word because of the sudden dryness in his throat and up those steps right in through those doors thats another source youre sure the major grasped his elbow in there chung began to sweat somebody a something a is waiting and in fact and despite that it was cool and even chilly now they were all sweating abandoning radio procedure the major spoke into his headset you men on the doors had better be aware theres a reception party waiting for you before you go in there a couple of stun grenades might help clear the way a bit the rest of you if you missed it from hawkeye heres a sitrep the backup has arrived the next time you hear from me it will probably be the goahead stand by for that over roger that a multitude of terse tense replies came in then more static and radio silence seconds ticked by but ohsoslowly then there came the rumbling growl of a straining motor a hissing of airbrakes and finally the message that the major had been waiting for zero this is the backup squad sorry were late were moving into our locations now the major turned to trask said the shows about to commence anything youd like to say to them your men trask shook his head just wish them the best of luck and the major did it and trask thought damn it i dont even know this blokes name some of his men but not him but thats how it goes with these people in their way theyre much like eeranch the less we know about them the better their security there was swift sporadic movement in the night the shadowy figures of men keeping low moving forward strengthening the assault force surrounding the casino using nitelite binoculars the major watched them take up their positions turned to trask and said are we ready trask nodded lets do it he said christ the longer we wait the worse it feels right said the major and then into his headset this is zero to assault group were going in attack attack attack at which all hell broke loose a if not exactly as expected a and it all seemed to happen at once the locator david chung gave a massive start as his eyes opened wide he pointed at something a some nonspecific point high on the face of the cliffs at the rear of the resort a and gripped trasks elbow and as trask looked at him in astonishment chung gasped what the at the same time fifty or so feet behind the group where they sheltered on the safe side of the armoured car a ball of brilliant light lit the night following hot on its heels there came the deafening roar of an explosion and the death cry of a soldier the savagery of the blast was such that it hurled them all against the side of the car and rocked the vehicle on its shock absorbers all eyes blinked and hands were thrown up to shield startled faces then as debris began to rain down they looked back the sas man was in midair a human catherine wheel spinning there a torn almost in half black and burning a and quite obviously dead bricks from the low wall where the nco had taken cover a which had at least sheltered trask and his group from the worst of the blast a were showering down a jagged halfbrick struck chung on the forehead threw him a second time against the side of the car he slid to the ground in a hail of lesser debris jesus christ the major straightened up went to stagger toward the spot where his mans body lay in a crumpled smoking heap trask stopped him croaked you saw what i saw you cant help him now but what the hell the major asked helplessly of no one in particular a mortar a grenade a an accident jesus it must have been a fucking accident and meanwhile the night had come deafeningly alive from the casino a withering stream of automatic fire sent bullets ricochetting off the far side of the car and from somewhere in the night a soldier shouted im hit god a im hit it hardly sounded like the cry of a man but more like that of a small bewildered child then the casinos entrance was lit by twin balls of brilliant white light a the blinding flashes and shattering reports of stun grenades a and figures were glimpsed briefly silhouetted in the swiftdying glare there were explosions from all around the pleasure dome as twoman units hurled grenades to breach the outer wall and gain entry and covering fire as men went in through smoking holes we have to go in too said the major we need to know whats going on but first lets see to your man they laid chung on the rear seat of the car mumbling to himself the locator was already regaining consciousness the major gave liz a field dressing said staunch the blood he looks okay but stay with him wheres your gun liz took out her baby browning cocked it and laid it on the rear windowsill of the car within easy reach trask leaned inside the car to touch her shoulder youd better do as he says he said and when were gone lock the doors for the moment shaken disoriented and concerned for chung liz did as she was told through the window she watched the major trask and goodly move off towards the casino in a little while chung opened his eyes looked up at liz and said hes up thereup highmalinari he managed to lift himself up a little as she applied the field dressing he was looking at the casino the way he rolled his notquitefocussed eyes it was hard to tell the bubble on top of the dome liz answered and nodded an affirmative we know theyre going in after him now no the locator tried to shake his head not the pleasure dome but up there upup there up there liz had the dressing in place now tying off the bandage she looked where chung pointed a shaky hand the mountain the cliffs he mumbled heshes in the cliffs after that it was all instinct and almost instantaneous liz didnt think twice but sent out her telepathic thoughts to follow chungs line of sight to be guided like a laserassisted missile to his target except that in this case the target was far more dangerous than the missile and ahhhhhhlsaid a voice in lizs mind a a voice like steam escaping from a kettle or the hiss of a volcanic vent a its the sweet little telepath herself and liz could actually feel the patterns of her mind being scrutinized fingerprinted and memorized she erected shields and felt the hideous sluglike presence of malinari withdrawing dwindling gone then my god she exploded into frantic activity grabbed her gun scrambled backwards out of the car i have to tell ben but then pausing to lean back inside david ia its okay chung was really coming out of it now beginning to make good sense go find them liz and tell them malinaris in those cliffs if they call the chopper down and get the pilot to use thermal imaging hell spot the bastard easily enough he managed to sit up however groggily lock the doors when ive gone she told him and crouching down low she ran for the casino chapter thirtythree trapped chopper ones pilot had heard the majors call for action seen the explosions heard something of the messages passing between the men on the ground the assault on the pleasure dome was proceeding just a few minutes behind schedule it was time to give the ground forces a little aerial support bright searchlight beams a aimed inwards on the casino to blind anyone trying to escape from that place a swept down from above like all the rest of the attacking force liz wore phosphorescent patches front and rear of her combat suit it wouldnt do for anyone to be shot dead by friendly fire lit up like a human neon gun in hand she ran towards the doors at the top of the steps hanging askew the doors were still giving off smoke from the grenades of soldiers there was no sign but she could hear the occasional burst of gunfire from within a few minutes earlier not far inside the same shattered doorway trask goodly and the major had found a wounded nco sitting on the floor with his back to a slot machine he had taken a bullet in the leg but had seen to the wound himself this keep he told them through gritted teeth im okay here a but you should take this with you trask accepted the mans flamethrower and pack and the precog helped him into the gear the wounded man retained his machinepistol when they left he was slapping a fresh clip into the magazine housing then moving deeper into the smoky gloom of the place the major spoke into his headset this is zero my group is inside the main doors and advancing sitreps over and the answers came back zero this is alpha group were on the stairs on the far side going up one level no opposition zero this is bravo group stairs your side going up one level no opposition zero this is charlie were ahead of you toward the central spindle we have a man down inside the doors a and we just found something nasty zero for charlie how nasty charlie for zero not lifethreatening a but nasty zero for charlie we saw your man said the major hes okaybut you should have taken his flamer charlie for zero we couldnt stop were in hot pursuit our target is still in here somewhere towards the elevators we think zero for charlie wait there said the major and moved on with trask and goodly close behind throughout the casinos ground floor mainly on the perimeter several hissing phosphor flares had been lit they gave light but also made smoke which in turn made for a very eerie shadowetched atmosphere charlie group was waiting midway between the doors and the central column of elevators and indeed they had found something nasty zeroing in on their reflective patches the majors group of three found the soldiers keeping well back from their gruesome discovery hanging by its ankles upsidedown from a chandelier the corpse of a thin spidery male figure turned slowly on a triple loop of electrical cable the mans throat had been cut ear to ear and his flesh was like snow drained of blood but on the floor only a very few scarlet droplets had been spilled despite that the body was inverted trask recognized him at once liz merricks watcher he said grimly so much for working for a vampire this will have to be burned on our way out well burn this whole fucking place and the major turned to him and said trask steady up now okay now listen all of you this group is now five strong were all armed and we have a flamer we have men climbing the perimeter stairs closing them off we know our main targets trapped in the bubble on top of the casino and that he has at least one soldier guardian ora he looked to trask for help thrall trask told him hoarsely call him a thrall one thrall the major went on athe one you men were pursuing a watching his back down here which might mean that he was guarding the elevators to keep his boss safe so thats where were heading the elevators but remember this guy has the advantage of being able to see in the dark and your flak jackets only give you so much protection so spread yourselves out but stay well within sight and sound of each other as he finished the major turned and headed deeper into the casino and the others spread out on his flanks shortly the central hexagonal column of elevators became visible and at the same time the stutter of automatic gunfire sounded from ahead ripping into a row of silent slot machines the stream of bullets was like an invisible buzzsaw that gutted them and spilled their coins on the floor then the raking fire found bygraves and lifted him clean off his feet shot in the right shoulder injured but by no means fatally the wo went down in a stream of bright silver a splash of blood red and his own cries of disgust and frustration and in the central area close to an elevator door marked private there stood a flameeyed thing in human form cradling a gun that spat fire one more time before the major sent a single bullet in through his left eye swatted the vampire thrall thudded backwards against the elevator doors his feet slid out from under him and he sank down onto the floor in a seated position while bygravess subordinate went to his aid trask and the others approached the vampire thrall one of malinaris pair of minders he must obviously be deadbut wasnt as his right eye opened burning yellow in the gloom so he toppled onto his side turned himself facedown and began to claw his way erratically away from the elevators in another moment however the effort became too much for him he came to a halt coughed once or twice and slurred out the words oh fuck it he had dropped his gun and no longer posed any real threat he looked up at trask and his colleagues and his clenched left hand jerked and twitched where he reached out towards them his left eye was a gaping black hole oozing blood and pulped brains and the rest of his face was a red and greysmeared mess but as the major stood back a little and took careful aim so the thralls hand opened and he dropped a metal key onto the floor then he gurgled this is whwhat you want right so go on ffinish it then find that fucker and ffinish hhhim the major didnt have to finish it for as the mans head slumped to the floor so a gush of blood and morbid fluid erupted from his ruined eye and he jerked once more and was done trask had called the elevator as the doors opened goodly picked up the key and the major called out to bygravess subordinate try to get the warrant officer out of here and see if your number three is okay were going upstairs he got in the elevator with trask and goodly the pushbutton control panel in the rear wall of the elevator had buttons for two basement levels the ground floor and floors one and two plus two keyholes one of which was marked private a up the other keyhole was unmarked the precog looked at the key in his hand and said couldnt be simplercould it too simple by far trask growled and weve been losing men left right and centre your talent said the major youre still uneasy worried sick trask answered the whole thing is wrong but were committed now he gave goodly a nod and the precog put the key in the up hole and turned it liz had found the wounded nco inside the pleasure domes main doors and helped him out of the casino into the fresh air she had thought he might be able to call down chopper one but his radio had been damaged when he was hit when shed left him to go back inside he had told her that when hed last seen trask and his party theyd been heading towards the central elevators then he had warned her that for all he knew the vampire sniper who had shot him was still on the loose in there going back into the casino and knowing what might be waiting for her liz hadnt dared to call out after trask by that time some of the flares had burned out leaving it much smokier and a lot darker in there so that when shed heard noises from deep inside a shouting shots and crashing sounds a then shed taken a circuitous route in the hope of avoiding trouble in so doing she had somehow managed to bypass red bygraves and his man on their way out but intent as liz was on what she was doing a finding ben trask and relaying chungs message a her telepathic guard was down which was precisely the opening that nephran malinari had been waiting for ben where are you she anxiously wondered as she saw the hexagonal spindle of the elevator column looming ahead but of course trask wasnt a telepath and lizs probe would go unanswered or it should have gone unanswered but liz it was ben trasks voice his telepathic voice in her head is that you liz butcan you hear me if so please listen youve got to kip us weve got ourselves trapped down here behind a bulkhead that only opens from the other side your side that is but theres been shooting and now the place is burning well burn too liz if you cant reach us she could actually feel the heat behind his mental sos could almost see the flames it was so brilliantly clear clear like never before so perhaps jake was right her talent really was growing stronger minute by minute yes it must be so and ben she sent but how can i reach you where are you down here he answered down in the guts of the place you can reach us via the elevators its the only way in the guts of the place underground in that maze of tunnels and pipes at which she instinctively glanced at the floorand at the ghastly figure of a dead man who lay there with his brains trickling out through his eye liz jumped a foot but ben had obviously seen through her eyes and quickly said we got that one and followed the others down here but youll he safe because theyre on the other side of the fire use the elevator liz the one marked private but please hurry she had already called the elevator and anxiously watched the tiny indicator lights bringing it down to the ground floor but bringing it down well the military must have used it for of course the whole place would have to be checked out the doors opened and she got in and the voice a trasks voice in lizs mind a said is there a key in one of the keyholes he sounded even more anxious urgent now and his voice was tinged with something elseanticipation maybe but of course it was she had given him hope and he was looking forward to being rescued a key yes she told him in the up slot take it out he said use the other keyhole turn the key ninety degrees clockwise but quickly liz quickly she did as instructed and the cage descended taking her down down down on jethro manchesters island jake cutter lardis lidesci and joe davis arrived at the openended roofedover section of the manmade channel that housed the millionaires yacht a in effect a boathouse a midway between the villa and the sea hearing voices in heated argument they split up and davis took the far side of the structure while jake and the old lidesci crept up on that end of the boathouse closest to the burning villa the lock gates were open but the yacht was still tied up both the boat and the ceiling of the flatroofed structure were illuminated by their own lights on the canopied deck just aft of the cabin two men faced each other down the one was older taller whitehaired and bearded dressed in a khaki shirt and shorts he looked almost military in his proud upright stance this was jethro manchester himself jake knew the younger man who was holding a shotgun on the first was shorter stockier but his hard leathery sunbeaten features were very much similar to bruce trenniers his older brothers which jake would never be able to forget martin manchesters voice rang out in the night cant you see its all over and you cant run from these people man youre like a walking plague a pestilence a you and me both a but a far worse pestilence than any in the bible and would you take that among the people i see that you would well and why not for you brought it down on me and mine that was sheer treachery martin so say and do what you like you wont be taking my boat shes mine and she goes with mewherever manchester held a jerrycan with both hands as he had spoken so he had been splashing its contents on the deck the smell of diesel was unmistakable jethro im not forgetting that i owe you martin trennier spoke up its the only reason youre still alive while we stand here and argue like this but youre wrong to think this is the end of everything its only the beginning you were the last to be taken a after hed used your family to get his way a after hed promised that he would give it all back and cure us of this thing well hes a liar as weve seen and he made me take you too but you were the last and its still taking hold of you when it does and when it has fully taken hold a which it willa then youll know i was right so stand aside and let me get on or better still come with me and lets see what we can make of things together as he had spoken trennier had stepped to the port side of the boat to cast off a rope but manchester had taken the opportunity to pick up a second jerrycan this time before he could begin spilling its contents trennier stepped close and knocked it out of his hands and now he trained his weapon dead centre on manchesters body ive no time for this jethro he growled you can come with me now or stay here you can live or you can die one way or the other its your choice so whats it to be manchester took out a cigarette lighter from the pocket of his shorts he flicked it once a and it failed to spark trennier cursed but he wasnt about to give the older man a second chance sending the butt of his weapon crashing to manchesters face jostling him to the side of the boat finally he succeeded in knocking him overboard and as manchester swam towards the side of the channel so trennier clung to the deck rail leaned out over the water and fired his weapon at almost pointblank range which was as far as jake was willing to let it go he and joe davis acted together davis ran in under the far end of the boathouse firing on the yacht as he came and jake ran to meet him skidding to a halt on his knees to play the roaring searing lance of his flamethrower on both the vessel and the man on her deck trennier fired another shot and another a fired blindly through the shimmering fire that enveloped and ate into him a while the boat literally erupted in flames and he turned into a jetblack shrieking silhouette dancing in agony until finally he crumpled down into himself and lay still as jake shut off his lance there came the sound of feeble splashing from the channel it was manchester the flesh at the back of his head his neck and across his shoulders was a livid liquid red let me out he cried climbing sunken steps let me out and finish it then but not in the water i lived in the water a lived for the water a so i dont want to die in it and when he was out and staggering on dry land jake told him mr manchester we heard everything and were sorry i know you are manchester nodded his bloody head yes and im glad you came my familyis no more and ihave no reason or right to be here with which he held out his arms in the shape of a cross stood there and closed his feral eyes then joe davis gritted his teeth and cut the old man down with accurate merciful shooting the old lidesci went in close and used his machete and finally making absolutely sure jake finished it with roaring fire by which time both the yacht and the structure that housed it were a mass of leaping flames and the three backed away leaning on each other while they watched it all burn in a little while daviss radio crackled and callsigns began asking him was it all over he told them yes called down chopper two told everyone they could start mopping up but as he and his party began to make their way back towards the villa what said jake whirling on the balls of his feet his eyes were wide and darting searching here and there across the sculpted landscape of the gardens and his ruddilylit face was shocked and puzzled liz but then his eyes went wider still in sudden understanding it was liz hed heard calling for him yes but she wasnt hereshe was in xanadu jake jake if you can hear me then please please come and get me out of here and behind her sweet voice another a but a loathsome gurgling thing a like hot tar bubbling in some medieval torturer s cauldron ah no my little thoughtthief no one can help you now you though to use your mentalism against me but malinari has used it against you i have lied to ben trask a impossible but i have done it a and ive located and lost your locator as for your marvellous precog le senses nothing but confusion for the death and destruction that he foresaw was his own and yours and xanadus but never mine and now theres this jake ayour lover perhaps but where is he oh ha ha haaaaaa jesus jake moaned but he knew what he must do korath he called out into the deadspeak aether and about time said that one butjirst tell me do we have a deal you and i as prescribed do you wittingly give me access to your mind there was no way around it and no time to argue and so yes said jake anything only show me those numbers so be it said korath and jakes inner being lit up like a lamp as those impossible numbers scrolled in notquiteendless progression down the computer screen of his mind but not quite endlessly because he instantly recognized a pattern and suddenly instinctively knew where to freeze it then a door and go said korath and i go with you jake went a stepped in through the door a vanished from the view of lardis lidesci and joe davis and was gone what davis stood stock still frozen in his amazement and for a moment even lardis was lost for words astonished as ever by this thing but then he recovered and said pay no attention its a trick he does just an optic a er an optical a er an optical illusion daviss jaw hung slack aye something like that lardis said gratefully er but we neednt expect him back he has his own ways of getting about that one and once again with a knowing emphatic nod of his grizzled head aye he said in the ultimate primal darkness of the mobius continuum jake whirled like a leaf in a gale but where to he said and was nearly deafened as his words gonged like the clappers of a mad gigantic bell the thought itself would appear to be sufficient korath told him awed in his own right for i sense this place is the very essence of nothingness wherefore physical speech a which is something a is forbidden here but deadspeak being as nothing is permissible jake steadied himselfa discovered that he could actually steady himself a and repeated where to he could feel the continuum tugging on him and believed he knew where it would take him if he gave it the chance harrys room at ebranch hq but that wasnt where he wanted to go who is it you are concerned for korath remained logical liz of course she had called out to jake a asked for his help a and her telepathic voice had been a beacon now he remembered it remembered its coordinates and went to her it was as simple as that at least the going there was simple but the rest of it wasnt when the door formed jake didnt know how to make an exit and so simply crashed through it into a living nightmare it was a room shaft or cavern but its lighting after the stygian darkness of the mobius continuum was glaring brilliant blinding overbalanced as gravity returned tripping and flying headlong into a wall and rebounding jake landed on something soft and squirmy something that cried its terror and two seconds later wrapped its arms around him jake oh jake liz gasped holding tightly to him on the one hand but wriggling and kicking desperately away from something on the other her baby browning was clenched in her fist and she kept aiming it and pulling the trigger a click click click as the firing pin fell on blank space a pair of empty clips lay on the sandy floor where shed discharged and discarded them it was the strip lighting that had blinded jake that and his dizzying headoverheels emergence from the mobius continuum now as his head stopped spinning he saw what had turned this determined selfpossessed assertive woman into a frightened little girl again weird morbid motion the floor of the place was aliveor undead jake could scarcely take it in a scarcely believe what he was seeing a but he had to and quickly the cavern was the size of a large room a planked walkway crossed the centre of the floor and disappeared into tunnels at both ends on the other side of the walkway maybe fifteen feet away the floor wasdifferent it was humped veined corrugatedand mobile and it wasnt the floor something tossed and turned a or churned a there something throbbed and gulped and gasped it was a fleshy flopping octopus of a thing an immense doughy pancake of metamorphic flesh throwing up purpleveined extrusions that groped blindly in the air before collapsing back down into the bulk ofof it the colour of dead flesh in its main mass it squelched fumed and stank like gas bubbles bursting in a swamp and mindlessly aimlessly it worked at fashioning its ropy extensions or perhaps not mindlessly for as jake sat there cradling liz so the thing extruded a tentacle that came whipping across the walkway to rear before them in a questioning semisentient fashion it pulsed vibrated and an eye formed in its tip the eye was a uniform red lidless apparently vacant a yet it must be seeing or sensing something for as liz shrilled and started pulling the trigger again a click click click a so a second tentacle emerged and lengthened in their direction as it came a row of greedy suctorial mouths rippled into metamorphic being along its length they slobbered and grimaced those mouths a and they had human teeth but far worse some of them were reforming shaping themselves into tumescent purpleveined penises jake felt rooted to the spot for the moment paralysed it seemed to him that the whole mass of the thing beyond the walkway was now on the move edging towards him a and certainly towards liz and that was enough he unfroze fought liz off brought up the flamethrowers nozzle and squeezed the trigger to get its pilot light going a then cursed vividly as nothing happened and squeezed it again and again and yet again before it lit then gripped the firing lever and applied a steady deadly pressure first jake aimed down between his spread legs aimed at the rearing pseudopods to drive them back and his relief was immense as he watched them burst into flames and shrivel in the incandescent pressured heat of his lance then he scrambled to his feet and with liz dancing close behind clutching his combat jacket and urging him on so he advanced towards the walkway and the bulk of the thing that hissed and steamed and shuddered its agony there and as the tentacles writhed dripped their fluids blackened and shrank a and as the main body withdrew into itselfa there sprouting in the floor where its bulk had protected them clusters of small black mushrooms dozens of them were melting in the chemical fire their smell was nauseating but jake kept on firing kept cursing too as malinaris garden burned but this was vampire stuff tenacious and defiant the shrinking body of the mass burst open and a steaming head a a human or almosthuman head and shoulders a grew out of it again jake felt himself gripped by a paralysis of disbelief yet the nightmare was here and undeniably real but so was korath here and so was he real and in jakes mind as the livid vampire head took shape it is him koraths deadspeak voice hissed demetrakis mindsthrall who was malinaris lieutenant second only to myself because he had been a vampire for long and long malinari used him to make this garden it must be so for only the most contaminated flesh could ever have produced a crop such as this ah but just think if there had been no demetrakis then this would be me and so it seems i got the better of the bargain after all whoever it was its time he died said jake and aye korath agreed the true death i know he would thank you for it and jake hosed fire on the terrible thing where it mewled and melted until his torch began to sputter then he eased back on the flamers lever to see what damage hed done and if he had done enough the cave steamed and smoked but was mainly still a except in one badlylit corner there was some slight movement there and jake advanced across the smoking floor making sure as he went that he stepped only where there was no sign of contamination but as he approached the corner hhelp me the faintest of whispers reached out to him hhhelp me pleeeease a single short burst of fire from the flamethrower chased back the shadows then a longer burst to allow for confirmation of what jake had seen and indeed he needed such confirmation from the heck up the thing in the corner was a manand from there on down it had been a man but now the eyes in that purple oncearrogant oncequerulous face were bulging staring terrified a and they were filled with such agony as jake could only imagine as for the body of this thing that was a slumped naked heap of limbless alien flesh similar to the composition of the monstrous guardian of malinaris garden and jake couldnt stop his gorge rising a felt sick to his stomach a as it dawned on him in a sudden burst of loathing that this mutated abnormality had once been a man and that it or he had been converted into live nourishment for the garden and its guardian fingerthick pulsing translucent arteries a like fleshy worms a even now connected the two forms and towards the centre of the cave where jakes fire had seared and split the guardian open spurts of yellow and crimson plasma went to waste fountaining uselessly in the smoky air all of which was bad enough but worse by far was the fact that jake knew who this travesty of a human being had been that peter miller lived in his condition a if this could be called life a and that he was capable of realizing his fate and asking for help was a miracle in itself but it was also a curse that jake would wish on no man not even on his worst enemy for this was worse than any death compared to which death would be a blessing and when miller found strength to ask once more pleaseplease help me then jake was happy to grant his request it didnt take long but it used up the last dregs of the flamers fuel when it was over jake steadied himself and turned to liz but still his face was ashen as he asked where now you can actually do it almost back in possession of herself still liz clutched his jacket the mobius continuum yes he told her wei mean i can do it the bubble dome she told him ben is up there theres something i have to tell him we walked right into a trap jake all of us and i think that were still in danger malinari was in my mind imitating ben but at the end a just before he left me in this place a then for a moment i was in his mind telepathy is a twoway thing but my forte is as a receiver and malinarihe was ohsosure of himself i think that maybe hes sabotaged this place i sensed it there in his mind when you called out to me jake answered i heard something of what he said to you youre right he seemed very sure of himself perhaps too sure and liz nodded and repeated the dome on top of the casino take us there hold on to me jake told her for he had flown over xanadu and knew the coordinates and korath knew the numbers in his vantage point in the cliff malinari allowed his fingers to drift over the array of switches and pondered his choice by now the girl was being absorbed into his garden and that was a shamethat he hadnt been able to stay with her within her mind to explain what was happening to her and feel her terror but no for he had other things to do his mist was up it lay knee deep swirling through xanadu i from one end of the resort to the other it was like a spiders web that mist carrying every faintest tremor back to its master and maker a medium for his probes it allowed him to touch the human flies who were trapped within it he knew the location of every man in xanadu but there were those for whom no mist was needed the locator for one injured holding his head he sat inside that car down theresuch a pity the area wasnt mined then there was the socalled precog and ben trask together in the bubble at this close range their talents were like magnets drawing malinaris attention to the topmost dome he could feel them there but the bubble was mined all it wanted was a touch on a certain switch in his array and again his hand hovered tantalizingly over that central switchbut no he must stick to the original plan let them know the error of their ways before they died first the perimeter to let them see how truly he had trapped them and then he would work inwards leaving the bubble itself until the last and now his fingers were sure and fast as one by one they tripped the outer ring of switches through the wounddown window of the car the locator was suddenly aware of a strange figure approaching out of the mist the mist was very bad here drifting over the car and obscuring his vision but chung had been in far worse places and he was equipped with a machinepistol the strangely lumbering mistwreathed figure came closer and the sights of chungs weapon were centred upon it then he saw the blaze of a reflective patch sighed and allowed himself to slump a little it was a soldier a an nco carrying another soldier in the firemanslift position which accounted for the manyarmed monstrous silhouette as that fact dawned so chung was out of the vehicle calling out over here bring him to the car then behind the two a third figure came weaving on his feet but barely so recognizing the staggering loner as warrant officer red bygraves the locator went to meet him are you okay he got under the others left arm took his weight can i help you ill live bygraves growled and then seeing the eagerness the urgency in the locators eyes what is it your radio chung said is it working and can you call the chopper down i know where the bastard is i know where malinaris hiding bygravess eyes lit up with a fierce fighting light gritting his teeth and flicking his face mike with a fingernail to get chopper ones attention he told the locator oh ill get him down okay just tell me where you want him to lay down his fire thats all from what little trask goodly and the sas major could see of the interior of the bubble dome it was a sumptuouslyappointed splitlevel affair of marble chrome and tancoloured leather five marbleclad stanchions surrounded the single elevator tube and supported the high ceiling the elevator opened into a central well with concentric steps climbing to the living or work area the place was lit however dimly by a sprinkling of tiny blue lights which formed against the ceilings jetblack backdrop miniature constellations in a fair imitation of the night sky bluetinged the dusky velvet atmosphere reminded trask of nothing so much as a starside night which made the bubble seem even more an aerie that however was the extent of trasks and his colleagues knowledge of the place for from the moment of their arrival when the elevator doors had hissed open they had been under fire and pinned down in fact their exit from the elevator cage a which in any event had been planned as a rapid deployment had been hastened by a volley of shots that had sounded as soon as the doors were fully open and a spray of bullets that chipped splinters from the marble columns where the three had taken shelter all of which had felt very wrong to trask i he and the others had made such ideal targets in the elevators confined space he just couldnt imagine anyone missing his aimespecially someone who had been waiting for them to emerge from that precise spot yet no one had been hit though for several nerveracking minutes now they had been obliged to keep their heads down to avoid sporadic single shots thus deep down inside trask sensed that he and his colleagues were being played with or that they were simply being played reeled in like so many sardines on a single line and he knew they darent allow this stalemate to continue to the enemys prearranged conclusion now as he glanced across the well of curving steps at the dark figures of the precog and the major crouching behind their individual columns he wondered what to do next as for the sniper it seemed that he must be a man or a vampire alone all of his weapons muzzleflashes had been sighted in just the one location on the higher level and there had been no other sound or movement from anywhere else and trask sensed he just knew that whoever this was it wasnt malinari but then it came to him that indeed there had been another sound muted repetitious music that came from one glowing spot an antique jukebox in the velvet darkness of the higher level and the music a a plaintive song a was only repetitious in that it had been playing when first theyd arrived had played again while they were pinned down and was now into its second encore curtain call or whatever but curtain call a farewell some kind of message maybe and for the first time trask listened to the song a moderately fastpaced and yet bluesy ballad it was sung by ray charles a favourite from trasks youth sunshine you may find my window but you wont find me and now it seemed to trask that the coffee sex and cigarettes voice mocked not only the sun but also ben trask himself for indeed sunshine might find the high blind windows of malinaris aerie but it certainly wouldnt find malinari nor would trask the song was a message but more yet it was the mocking laughter of a monster it mocked trask ebranch the military and all their combined efforts so that now in the heightened anxiety of this sudden knowledge he used the temporary lull between shots to shout across to the major we have to get done here so whats next the major had not been idle hed been working out the snipers position for himself and now believed hed got it right lighting a flare and a moment later pulling the pin on a grenade he called out this is whats next hit the deck a now the warning was timely even with his eyes tightly closed and sheltered by the column still trask saw the blinding white light blossoming through the membrane of his eyelidsand at the same time he heard and indeed felt the terrific report that shook the floor and shattered glass fixtures into flying shards then there was a stunned silence and cordite stench and at the last a mewling whimper rising to a scream a tattered male figure came staggering wreathed in smoke himself smoking his eyes were feral in the gloom and the major trask and goodly didnt wait to see what he would do or if he was capable of doing anything but cut him down in a withering crossfire we got him we got malinari the major stood up started forward up the marble steps but as the precog and trask joined him the latter was already shaking his head that isnt malinari trask coughed a denial into the now smoky atmosphere and this isnt over yet the elevators gone and were trapped trapped by the very creature were trying to destroy his words were portentous of the sudden thunder the gouting fire and blazing light that at once rocked the night beyond the shattered windows the three men looked at each other then hurriedly crossed the floor to look out and down on a scene out of dantes inferno on the far perimeter of xanadu f disintegrating chalets erupted in red and yellow ruin and fireballs lifted dieir mushroom heads to the night sky but trask was right it wasnt over yet for as the three stood there watching impotent to act so midway between the burning perimeter and the casino a second series of terrific explosions then a third ripped through the shattered resort concentric rings of destruction were closing in on the pleasure dome hurling flaming debris aloft and turning night to day now he springs the trap trask husked xanadu is no use to him now and hell destroy it and us with it so this is it were next the place is wired mined the majors face was ashen i should have know it from the very first explosion the one that took one of my men dont blame yourself said trask weve all been equally stupid and that bastard is sitting somewhere watching us knowing that by now ve know i dont suppose theres any point asking you to call the chopper down wouldnt if i could the other shook his head no way a not into this lot but in any case my radios been out since we got into the lift some kind of electrical interference as he finished speaking so lan goodly reeled and caught at the majors arm to steady himself and jake the precog gasped my god ben its jake jake trask repeated him what about him hehes on his way here goodly answered but so is the elevator jakes in the elevator trask failed to understand but no goodly shook his head jake is in the mobius continuum the bomb is in the elevator when i staggered just now oo it was because id seen it going offa but seen it at close range even this close a and its due to happen any time now the major might have asked what they were raving about but didnt have time in a sudden stirring of smoky air jake stepped out of the mobius continuum with liz clinging to him like a leech a and at the same time the elevator pinged and its doors hissed open jake and liz were staggering disoriented the major didnt know what was going on and the precog knowing he was about to die couldnt take his eyes off the elevator ben trask was the only one who saw the truth of it and knew what to do to me he shouted to me and without waiting he swept them into his arms bundled all four of them close to himself what jake said completely out of the picture make a door trask shouted at him for gods sake make a goddamned door make a big one and i mean right now and jake and korath they made a door the blast took them right through it all five of them through the door into the mobius continuum and in the hot blast and the fire that followed them jake knew only one safe place to take them he remembered those suntanned nearnaked bodies sprawling indolently and the shadow of the helicopter dark on the sparkling water and he knew the coordinates down they went in one of xanadus pools and coughing and spluttering they surfaced in time to see chopper one at an altitude of one hundred and fifty feet wheeling to face the backdrop of cliffs steadying up and sitting like a hawk on the air and opening up with its nose cannons on no clearly discernible target in his oncesecret hiding place malinari saw it too and didnt believe it but as cannonfire ripped the chimneys facade to shreds he had to believe it and while he still had time he tripped the rest of his switches then with his thin clothing tearing under the pressure of madly metamorphosing flesh a and his bolthole hideaway collapsing around him a malinari made a headlong dive through his window of observation out into the night for a moment the pilot of chopper one saw him the jetcopters thermalimaging highlighted a shifting flattening morphing blob of a figure that at first plummeted quickly adopted a mantalike shape and finally glided from view the pilot might even have taken a shot at the thing but powerful updraughts from the blazing hell that was xanadu were rocking his machine forcing him to take action and climb out of danger and as jake and the others left the pool so nephran malinari shot like an arrow overhead he might easily have been some primal pterodactyl out of earths prehistory but was in fact a predatory creature from an alien parallel world trask saw him a his crimson eyes the dark blur of his passing a and a moment later heard his taunting laughter echoing from on high hearing that laughter and remembering zek a unable to forget her ever a all trask wanted was to stand there and let his hate out and will this monster to a terrible death he knew he couldnt but he had never wanted anything so much in his life in close proximity like this a so intent upon each other a malinari had heard trask and sent back hatred such as that is catching mr trask it breeds hatred as for willing me to death we must see whose will is the strongest ehp not here and now no but in another place another time this was nothing hut a skirmish to get your measure but if you would live tojight another day first you must survive the night alas i dont think so if you survive however do not despair for i shall he waiting mr trask i shall he waiting all of them with trask heard it a that dark voice in their heads and its taunting message a but especially liz she heard it and saw beyond it malinaris plan flight to a safe haven in another place another country she might even have discovered which one but nephran malinari recognized her presence and withdrew snarling into mental obscurity where his evil telepathic voice had been only mindsmog remained spiralling after him into a mental void and malinari was gone but to trask and the others it seemed the danger was still present xanadu was burning end to end a series of devastating explosions continued to rock the place malinaris bubble aerie on top of the pleasure dome was no more and showers of plastic and glass were still raining to earth scraps of blazing debris drifted across the night sky and clods of earth and grass were fountaining in the garden where chopper one had made its initial landing a lucky mistake on malinaris part that last one of his few errors but the pleasure dome itself the casino was still standing and now the precog lan goodly cried the big one is still to come its the casino a set piece of delayed action a like the pause before the last big firework at the end of the show fortunately wo bygraves had taken the initiative thinking hed lost his commanding officer when the majors radio had gone down he had called the rest of the platoon out of the casino now they came running gathering at the pool but from the pool on outwards to the perimeter of the resort it seemed that the whole of xanadu was an inferno even if there were no more explosions the sheer heat would certainly kill everyone before they made half the distance and meanwhile the precog in a fit of delirious anxiety was turning this way and that repeating its going to blow its going to blow then a piece of burning debris from the bubble came drifting like a kite weighed down by and trailing a length of electrical cable no one noticed it until it struck the monorails overhead power grid there was a flash that sent blobs of molten copper skittering and the kite and cable fell to earth trask and the major glanced at each other headed for the boarding platform no more than fifty feet away the rest followed them and jake quickly caught up what are we doing he asked trask breathlessly the elevated monorail trask gasped it has power maybe we can drive out of this or over the worst of it at least as far as the main parking lot and the big ops truck his idea was as good as any other in fact it was the only idea for the armoured car had been blown over onto its side by the blast from the garden fortunately the locator david chung along with bygraves and his men had already vacated that area like jake they had seen the pool as the only sanctuary from the bomb blasts and the fires that licked closer with every passing moment and by now the heat and smoke were suffocating dragging liz behind him jake was the first into the leading carriage of two articulated opensided cars climbing into the drivers seat he hit the red power button and as the motor throbbed into life grabbed the drive lever the system could scarcely be simpler push forward to go pull backward to stop and ahead the single overhead rail climbed and curved outwards towards the perimeter parking lot the reception area xanadus gates and safety but while the motor warmed up still the precog was shouting its going any minute now men ran limped or were carried they bundled each other into the cars until finally trask yelled thats it now get us the hell out of here and jake pushed the lever forward slowly a agonizingly slowly or so it seemed a the cars climbed to their elevated height and started along the spiralling pylonsupported rail fifty feet a hundred and gathering speed and then the pleasure dome went the blast was awesome as the casino literally lifted into the air sank down into itself split asunder under the irresistible pressure of expanding gasses and blew apart in red and yellow streamers of flame the whole thing disappeared in dust rubble and gouting fire and in the next moment the hot blast of its passing reached out and rocked the monorails carriages causing its passengers to grit their teeth and hang on for dear life but then the cars steadied up and the danger was past so everyone thoughta aexcept lan goodly theres one bomb left he suddenly cried its in the reception area the gatehouse he was right and just like the bomb in the pleasure dome this too was a delayed action device when it went it took a good man their rearguard with it a but it also took out the last elevated section of the monorail liz was behind jake shouting look look and pointing ahead but he was already looking all he could see through the smoke and the fire was a mass of slumping buckled metal a the wreckage of the tower that had borne the weight of the monorail a beyond which there was empty space and a drop of some thirty odd feet into a red roaring death jake slammed the drive lever into reverseand nothing happened the power had gone along with the overhead gantry and power line and the cars were freewheeling down a gentle gradient at some thirty miles an hour but lan goodlys talent was back in force suddenly he was there leaning over jake and shouting jake listen theres a way out i can see it were going to make it and he told jake what he had seen shouted it into his ear as the articulated cars went lurching into empty space heading for the inferno that waited below korath knew what was required and set those fantastic formulae rolling yet again down the screen of jakes mind a until jake froze them and conjured a door that even harry keogh would be proud of then darkness surrounded the cars a the ultimate darkness of a time before time a and in a single moment which might yet be as long as forever light gentle moon and starlight blinked into being as jake made his first perfect threepoint exit from the mobius continuum at wellknown coordinates the cars were boatbottomed they didnt dig in but rode across the dry grass and sandy soil of the safe houses garden quickly slowing until with scarcely a jolt they were brought up short by the stout wall then the rear car slewed a little a but not enough to spill anyone a and both cars rolled sideways through fortyfive degrees and came to a rocking standstill for a long time there was silence until jake and the ebranch epilogue people climbed out of the lead car and as a man collapsed or plumped down on the withered grass and began to breathe again then someone said holyfuck and everyone started talking at once in xanadu jethro manchester had built a pleasure dome now it was gone and manchester with it to an end as undeserved as it was brutal and horrific likewise the alien author of xanadus and manchesters ruin he too was gone but lord nephran malinari was fled not dead and it grieved ben trasks heart that he must admit it that the chase wasnt nearly over yet but if anything was now more needful and deadly than ever for if the others if vavara and szwart were trying to do what malinari had begun to do in subterranean xanadu a if they too were nurturing gardens of loathsome plaguebearing deathspawn a and if a single red spore all unnoticed inhaled like a speck of dust could write finis on a human life and replace it with undeath how then millions or billions of spores a and what then for the world on the second morning after the australians cremated their four dead comrades in a quiet ceremony with full military honours a a ceremony which trask and his ebranch people felt privileged to attend where in fact there were only three bodies in their coffins for the fourth had burned on manchesters island and was represented by a photograph a scroll of honour and messages of farewell from his closest colleagues only a the second morning after that the major and his two stalwart warrant officers were at the airport in brisbane to see trask and his people off after the british team had received their regulation new bubonic shots a for the australian authorities were insistent that no one be allowed to enter or leave the continent without first being inoculated a then over drinks in the departure lounge trask and the major had a quiet word in private jake liz and the rest of the team sat at a table with bygraves and davis where for the better part they commiserated in silence something of an aftermath it seemed there wasnt a lot to be said but trask and the sas major werent willing to leave it at that and so it goes on said the major tor you at least for us it never seems to end trask answered just when we think it might theres always something new not always as bad as what weve just been through but always bad and you cant give up on it said the major not a question but a statement of fact never trask growled this time for me its personal but personal or not its always the same weve seen all this before and well see it again yes and well see it through all the way to the end but myselfi for one will never be able to rest until this one is dead or until im dead one or the other malinari the same trask nodded i want that bastard dead dead dead and i intend to get him no matter what it takes as lardis lideci might say thats my vow hub my szgany vow aye well you have a good team to help you the major glanced across the room at the people sitting with his men weird as hell but good that david chung for instance such a quiet little man a with his builtin radar dish and the tall fellow lan goodly who id hate to play cards with and liz who hears people thinking i definitely wouldnt play cards with her and as for jakei just cant believe what he does it may have saved my life but i still dont believe it i know trask answered and it doesnt help that its something i cant talk about or something we cant talk about but being what you are sas im sure you understand that anyway a and if it makes it any easier a there are times when i dont believe this stuff myself times when i wake up and think ive been nightmaring and the hell of it is im the only one who really knows that its true the major shook his head and said weird weird people a but im glad to have known you same here said trask im only sorry thata i know the other cut him short the only consolation lies in what weve achieved for lets face it no sane people could ever suffer such as that to live those four lives might have saved thousands but trask shook his head think again he said thousands there are over six billion people on this small planet and thats how many we might have saved or that weve started to save and after a while the major said hearing you put it like that i know it was worth it at which liz called across and said theyre boarding its time we werent here said trask standing up and as the major reached out his hand trask looked at it took it and said i dont even know your name its tom said the other just tom major tom thatll suffice said the major grinning trask smiled too and said well major tom ground control is calling for us the major had been carrying a fat eighteeninchlong parcel now he gave it to trask this is for you he said the men found it when they went down and burned out the underground rooms tunnels and conduits in xanadu it got burned too so i can guarantee its clean i dont believe in trophytaking not after a job like that one maybe youll find a use for it after that there was no time for anything other than handshakes all round then trask and his people went to board their qantas vtol skyskip but as they queued at the boarding gate jake sensed someones gaze upon him and glanced toward the reinforced flexiglass wall that secured the boarding area from the viewing promenade from the far side of the wall distorted by the images of other passengers that moved across its reflective surface a thin pockmarked face looked back at him and for a moment their eyes met before jake looked away he looked away but only for a moment until something went click in his memory and he gave a start and looked again but the face was gone standing just behind him ben trask had noticed his reaction and said is there something jake frowned then shook his head no he said i dont think so but just for a moment then i thought i might haverecognized someone trask looked at him in a certain way with his head cocked a little on one side and said or youre concerned that maybe someone recognized you jake shrugged uncomfortably said that too but here in australia unlikely very unlikely yes for as jake had said what would that lousy murdering bastard thug a what would the face of a man who had featured in his worst nightmares for far too long now one of luigi castellanos soldiers unforgotten from a certain monstrous night in marseille a what would he be doing here then he shrugged again and put it out of his mind it was part of his growing obsession that was all when from time to time he would see those faces wherever he looked this despite that several of them were no more dead by his hand but still jake looked again at the flexiglass partition before moving on into the boarding tunnel and of course there was no one there as the vtol skyskip was rising vertically into the air lifting its nose and accelerating into the sky the man with the pockmarked face was in a telephone kiosk speaking longdistance to palermo no doubt about it he said in italian id know the guy anywhere hes alive and kicking and theres been all kinds of shit going down around here yeah that xanadu thing they said it was a plaguespot and an accidental fire burned it out down to the foundations but i can tell you luigi some of the crew who were up there clearing up afterwards a like you know military types a they were here at the airport to see cutter and these british people onto their plane like pals all round you know me id like to know how you knew this jake cutter would be out here in the first place you didnt know you were only interested in xanadu and ii ask too many questions yeah i know youre right sorry so what now i should find out who the brits were get after them on the next plane sure i can handle that and i can use the account in england have myself some fun hey i like it er yeah but if i dont find out who they are i neednt bother to go back to marseilleor anywhere right luigi i got that but say and there he stopped short scowling at the phone for it was purring away vacantly to itself in his hand and the ohsodark voice on the other end was gone on board the skyskip when they were indeed skipping across the outer atmosphere ben trask started to open the parcel given to him by the major but as gleaming metal hooks appeared flexible fishscale plates and sharppointed gouges he stopped went pale and
