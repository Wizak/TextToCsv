 peace manoeuvres the scout stood where three roads cut three green tunnels in the pine woods and met at his feet above his head an aged signpost pointed impartially to east carver south carver and carver centre and left the choice to him the scout scowled and bit nervously at his gauntlet the choice was difficult and there was no one with whom he could take counsel the three sunshot roads lay empty and the other scouts who with him had left the main column at sunrise he had ordered back they were to report that on the right flank so far at least as middleboro there was no sign of the enemy what lay beyond it now was his duty to discover the three empty roads spread before him like a picture puzzle smiling at his predicament whichever one he followed left two unguarded should he creep upon for choice carver centre the enemy masked by a mile of fir trees might advance from carver or south carver and obviously he could not follow three roads at the same time he considered the better strategy would be to wait where he was where the three roads met and allow the enemy himself to disclose his position to the scout this course was most distasteful he assured himself that this was so because while it were the safer course it wasted time and lacked initiative but in his heart he knew that was not the reason and to his heart his head answered that when ones country is at war when fields and firesides are trampled by the iron heels of the invader a scout should act not according to the dictates of his heart but in the service of his native land in the case of this particular patriot the man and scout were at odds as one of the bicycle squad of the boston corps of cadets the scout knew what at this momentous crisis in her history the commonwealth of massachusetts demanded of him it was that he sit tight and wait for the hated foreigners from new york city new jersey and connecticut to show themselves but the man knew and had known for several years that on the road to carver was the summer home of one beatrice farrar as private lathrop it was no part of his duty to know that as a man and a lover and a rejected lover at that he could not think of anything else struggling between love and duty the scout basely decided to leave the momentous question to chance in the front tire of his bicycle was a puncture temporarily effaced by a plug laying the bicycle on the ground lathrop spun the front wheel swiftly if he decided the wheel stops with the puncture pointing at carver centre ill advance upon carver centre should it point to either of the two other villages ill stop here its a two to one shot against me any way he growled kneeling in the road he spun the wheel and as intently as at monte carlo and palm beach he had waited for other wheels to determine his fortune he watched it come to rest it stopped with the plug pointing back to middleboro the scout told himself he was entitled to another trial again he spun the wheel again the spokes flashed in the sun again the puncture rested on the road to middleboro if it does that once more thought the scout its a warning that there is trouble ahead for me at carver and all the little carvers for the third time the wheel flashed but as he waited for the impetus to die the sound of galloping hoofs broke sharply on the silence the scout threw himself and his bicycle over the nearest stone wall and unlimbering his rifle pointed it down the road he saw approaching a small boy in a white apron seated in a white wagon on which was painted pies and pastry east wareham the boy dragged his horse to an abrupt halt dont point that at me shouted the boy where do you come from demanded the scout wareham said the baker are you carrying any one concealed in that wagon as though to make sure the bakers boy glanced apprehensively into the depths of his cart and then answered that in the wagon he carried nothing but freshbaked bread to the trained nostrils of the scout this already was evident before sunrise he had breakfasted on hard tack and muddy coffee and the odor of crullers and mince pie still warm assailed him cruelly he assumed a fierce and terrible aspect where are you going he challenged to carver centre said the boy to chance lathrop had left the decision he believed the fates had answered dragging his bicycle over the stone wall he fell into the road go on he commanded ill use your cart for a screen ill creep behind the enemy before he sees me the bakers boy frowned unhappily but supposing he argued they see you first will they shoot the scout waved his hand carelessly of course he cried then said the baker my horse will run away what of it demanded the scout are middleboro south middleboro rock brockton and boston to fall are they to be captured because youre afraid of your own horse they wont shoot real bullets this is not a real war dont you know that the bakers boy flushed with indignation sure i know that he protested but my horse he dont know that lathrop slung his rifle over his shoulder and his leg over his bicycle if the reds catch you he warned in parting theyll take everything youve got the blues have took most of it already wailed the boy and just as they were paying me the battle begun and this horse run away and i couldnt get him to come back for my money war exclaimed lathrop morosely is always cruel to the innocent he sped toward carver centre in his motor car he had travelled the road many times and as always his goal had been the home of miss beatrice farrar he had covered it at a speed unrecognized by law but now he advanced with stealth and caution in every clump of bushes he saw an ambush behind each rock he beheld the enemy in a clearing was a group of portuguese cranberry pickers dressed as though for a holiday when they saw the man in uniform one of the women hailed him anxiously is the parade coming she called have you seen any of the reds lathrop returned no complained the woman and we been waiting all morning when will the parade come its not a parade said lathrop severely its a war the summer home of miss farrar stood close to the road it had been so placed by the farmer who built it in order that the women folk might sit at the window and watch the passing of the stagecoach and the peddler great elms hung over it and a white fence separated the road from the narrow lawn at a distance of a hundred yards a turn brought the house into view and at this turn as had been his manoeuvre at every other possible ambush lathrop dismounted and advanced on foot up to this moment the road had been empty but now in front of the farrar cottage it was blocked by a touringcar and a station wagon in the occupants of the car he recognized all the members of the farrar family except miss farrar in the station wagon were all of the farrar servants miss farrar herself was leaning upon the gate and waving them a farewell the touringcar moved off down the road the station wagon followed miss farrar was alone lathrop scorched toward her and when he was opposite the gate dug his toes in the dust and halted when he lifted his broadbrimmed campaign hat miss farrar exclaimed both with surprise and displeasure drawing back from the gate she held herself erect her attitude was that of one prepared for instant retreat when she spoke it was in tones of extreme disapproval you promised said the girl you would not come to see me lathrop straddling his bicycle peered anxiously down the road this is not a social call he said im on duty have you seen the reds his tone was brisk and alert his manner preoccupied the ungraciousness of his reception did not seem in the least to disconcert him but miss farrar was not deceived she knew him not only as a persistent and irrepressible lover but as one full of guile adroit in tricks fertile in expedients he was one who could not take no for an answer at least not from her when she repulsed him she seemed to grow in his eyes only the more attractive it is not the lover who comes to woo he was constantly explaining but the lovers way of wooing miss farrar had assured him she did not like his way she objected to being regarded and treated as a castle that could be taken only by assault whether she wished time to consider or whether he and his proposal were really obnoxious to her he could not find out his policy of campaign was that she also should not have time to find out again and again she had agreed to see him only on the condition that he would not make love to her he had promised again and again and had failed to keep that promise only a week before he had been banished from her presence to remain an exile until she gave him permission to see her at her home in new york it was not her purpose to return there for two weeks and yet here he was a beggar at her gate it might be that he was there as he said on duty but her knowledge of him and of the doctrine of chances caused her to doubt it mr lathrop she began severely as though to see to whom she had spoken lathrop glanced anxiously over his shoulder apparently pained and surprised to find that it was to him she had addressed herself he regarded her with deep reproach his eyes were very beautiful it was a fact which had often caused miss farrar extreme annoyance he shook his head sadly mr lathrop he protested you know that to you i am always charles charles the bold because i am bold to love you but never mr lathrop unless he went on briskly you are referring to a future state when as mrs lathrop you will make me miss farrar had turned her back on him and was walking rapidly up the path beatrice he called i am coming after you miss farrar instantly returned and placed both hands firmly upon the gate i cannot understand you she said dont you see that when you act as you do now i cant even respect you how do you think i could ever care when you offend me so you jest at what you pretend is the most serious thing in your life you play with it laugh at it the young man interrupted her sharply its like this he said when i am with you i am so happy i cant be serious when i am not with you it is so serious that i am utterly and completely wretched you say my love offends you bores you i am sorry but what in heavens name do you think your not loving me is doing to me i am a wreck i am a skeleton look at me he let his bicycle fall and stood with his hands open at his sides as though inviting her to gaze upon the ruin she had caused four days of sun and rain astride of a bicycle without food or sleep had drawn his face into fine hard lines had bronzed it with a healthy tan his uniform made by the same tailor that fitted him with polo breeches clung to him like a jersey the spectacle he presented was that of an extremely picturesque handsome manly youth and of that fact no one was better aware than himself look at me he begged sadly miss farrar was entirely unimpressed i am she returned coldly i never saw you looking so well and you know it she gave a gasp of comprehension you came here because you knew your uniform was becoming lathrop regarded himself complacently yes isnt it he assented i brought on this war in order to wear it if you dont mind he added i think ill accept your invitation and come inside ive had nothing to eat in four days miss farrars eyes flashed indignantly youre not coming inside she declared but if youll only promise to go away at once ill bring you everything in the house in that house exclaimed lathrop dramatically theres only one thing that i desire and i want that so badly that life holds no charm without you miss farrar regarded him steadily do you intend to drive me away from my own door or will you go lathrop picked his wheel out of the dust goodby he said ill come back when you have made up your mind in vexation miss farrar stamped her foot upon the path i have made up my mind she protested then returned lathrop ill come back when you have changed it he made a movement as though to ride away but much to miss farrars dismay hastily dismounted on second thoughts he said it isnt right for me to leave you the woods are full of tramps and hangerson of the army youre not safe i can watch this road from here as well as from anywhere else and at the same time i can guard you to the consternation of miss farrar he placed his bicycle against the fence and as though preparing for a visit leaned his elbows upon it i do not wish to be rude said miss farrar but you are annoying me i have spent fifteen summers in massachusetts and i have never seen a tramp i need no one to guard me if not you said lathrop easily then the family silver and think of your jewels and your mothers jewels think of yourself in a house filled with jewels and entirely surrounded by hostile armies my duty is to remain with you miss farrar was so long in answering that lathrop lifted his head and turned to look he found her frowning and gazing intently into the shadow of the woods across the road when she felt his eyes upon her she turned her own guiltily upon him her cheeks were flushed and her face glowed with some unusual excitement i wish she exclaimed breathlessly i wish she repeated the reds would take you prisoner take me where asked lathrop take you anywhere cried miss farrar you should be ashamed to talk to me when you should be looking for the enemy i am waiting for the enemy explained lathrop its the same thing miss farrar smiled vindictively her eyes shone you need not wait long she said there was a crash of a falling stone wall and of parting bushes but not in time to give lathrop warning as though from the branches of the trees opposite two soldiers fell into the road around his hat each wore the red band of the invader each pointed his rifle at lathrop hands up shouted one youre my prisoner cried the other mechanically lathrop raised his hands but his eyes turned to miss farrar did you know he asked i have been watching them she said creeping up on you for the last ten minutes lathrop turned to the two soldiers and made an effort to smile that was very clever he said but i have twenty men up the road and behind them a regiment you had better get away while you can the two reds laughed derisively one who wore the stripes of a sergeant answered that wont do we been a mile up the road and you and us are the only soldiers on it gimme the gun lathrop knew he had no right to refuse he had been fairly surprised but he hesitated when miss farrar was not in his mind his amateur soldiering was to him a most serious proposition the war game was a serious proposition and that through his failure for ten minutes to regard it seriously he had been made a prisoner mortified him keenly that his humiliation had taken place in the presence of beatrice farrar did not lessen his discomfort nor did the explanation he must later make to his captain afford him any satisfaction already he saw himself playing the star part in a courtmartial he shrugged his shoulders and surrendered his gun as he did so he gloomily scrutinized the insignia of his captors who took me he asked we took you exclaimed the sergeant what regiment demanded lathrop sharply i have to report who took me and you probably dont know it but your collar ornaments are upside down with genuine exasperation he turned to miss farrar lord he exclaimed isnt it bad enough to be taken prisoner without being taken by raw recruits that cant put on their uniforms the reds flushed and the younger a sandyhaired ratfaced youth retorted angrily mebbe we aint strong on uniforms beau he snarled but youve got nothing on us yet that i can see you look pretty with your hands in the air dont you shut up commanded the other red he was the older man heavily built with a strong hard mouth and chin on which latter sprouted a three days irongray beard dont you see hes an officer officers dont like being took by twospot privates lathrop gave a sudden start why he laughed incredulously dont you know he stopped and his eyes glanced quickly up and down the road dont we know what demanded the older red suspiciously i forgot said lathrop i i must not give information to the enemy for an instant there was a pause while the two reds stood irresolute then the older nodded the other to the side of the road and in whispers they consulted eagerly miss farrar laughed and lathrop moved toward her i deserve worse than being laughed at he said i made a strategic mistake i should not have tried to capture you and an army corps at the same time you she taunted who were always so keen on soldiering to be taken prisoner she lowered her voice and by men like that arent they funny she whispered and east side and tenderloin it made me homesick to hear them i think when not in uniform the little one drives a taxicab and the big one is a guard on the elevated they certainly are very new york assented lathrop and very tough i thought whispered miss farrar those from new york with the red army were picked men what does it matter exclaimed lathrop its just as humiliating to be captured by a ballroom boy as by a mere millionaire i cant insist on the invading army being entirely recruited from harvard graduates the two reds either had reached a decision or agreed that they could not agree for they ceased whispering and crossed to where lathrop stood we been talking over your case explained the sergeant and we see we are in wrong we see we made a mistake in taking you prisoner we had ought to shot you dead so now were going to shoot you dead you cant objected lathrop its too late you should have thought of that sooner i know admitted the sergeant but a prisoner is a hell of a nuisance if you got a prisoner to look after you cant do your own work you got to keep tabs on him and there aint nothing in it for the prisoner neither if we take you youll have to tramp all the way to our army and all the way back but if youre dead how different you aint no bother to anybody you got a half holiday all to yourself and you can loaf around the camp so dead that they cant make you work but not so dead you cant smoke or eat the sergeant smiled ingratiatingly in a tempting manner he exhibited his rifle better be dead he urged id like to oblige you said lathrop but its against the rules you cant shoot a prisoner the ratfaced soldier uttered an angry exclamation to hell with the rules he cried we cant waste time on him turn him loose the older man rounded on the little one savagely the tone in which he addressed him was cold menacing sinister his words were simple but his eyes and face were heavy with warning who is running this he asked the little soldier muttered and shuffled away from under the brim of his campaign hat his eyes cast furtive glances up and down the road as though anxious to wipe out the effect of his comrades words the sergeant addressed lathrop suavely and in a tone of conciliation you see he explained him and me are scouts were not supposed to waste time taking prisoners so well set you free he waved his hand invitingly toward the bicycle you can go he said to miss farrars indignation lathrop instead of accepting his freedom remained motionless i cant he said im on post my captain ordered me to stay in front of this house until i was relieved miss farrar amazed at such duplicity exclaimed aloud he is not on post she protested hes a scout he wants to stop here because because hes hungry i wouldnt have let you take him prisoner if i had not thought you would take him away with you she appealed to the sergeant please take him away she begged the sergeant turned sharply upon his prisoner why dont you do what the lady wants he demanded because ive got to do what my captain wants returned lathrop and he put me on sentrygo in front of this house with the back of his hand the sergeant fretfully scraped the three days growth on his chin theres nothing to it he exclaimed but for to take him with us when we meet some more reds well turn him over fall in he commanded no protested lathrop i dont want to be turned over ive got a much better plan you dont want to be bothered with a prisoner i dont want to be a prisoner as you say i am better dead you cant shoot a prisoner but if he tries to escape you can ill try to escape you shoot me then i return to my own army and report myself dead that ends your difficulty and saves me from a courtmartial they cant courtmartial a corpse the face of the sergeant flashed with relief and satisfaction in his anxiety to rid himself of his prisoner he lifted the bicycle into the road and held it in readiness youre all right he said heartily you can make your getaway as quick as you like but to the conspiracy miss farrar refused to lend herself how do you know she demanded that he will keep his promise he may not go back to his own army he can be just as dead on my lawn as anywhere else lathrop shook his head at her sadly how you wrong me he protested how dare you doubt the promise of a dying man these are really my last words and i wish i could think of something to say suited to the occasion but the presence of strangers prevents he mounted his bicycle if i had a thousand lives to give he quoted with fervor id give them all to he hesitated and smiled mournfully on miss farrar seeing her flushed and indignant countenance he added with haste to the commonwealth of massachusetts as he started on his wheel slowly down the path he turned to the sergeant im escaping he explained the reds with an enthusiasm undoubtedly genuine raised their rifles and the calm of the indian summer was shattered by two sharp reports lathrop looking back over his shoulder waved one hand reassuringly death was instantaneous he called he bent his body over the handlebar and they watched him disappear rapidly around the turn in the road miss farrar sighed with relief thank you very much she said as though signifying that to oblige a woman he would shoot any number of prisoners the sergeant raised his hat dont mention it lady he said i seen he was annoying you and thats why i got rid of him some of them amateur soldiers as soon as they get into uniform are too fresh he took advantage of you because your folks were away from home but dont you worry about that ill guard this house until your folks get back miss farrar protested warmly really she exclaimed i need no one to guard me but the soldier was obdurate he motioned his comrade down the road watch at the turn he ordered he may come back or send some of the blues to take us ill stay here and protect the lady again miss farrar protested but the sergeant in a benign and fatherly manner smiled approvingly seating himself on the grass outside the fence he leaned his back against the gatepost apparently settling himself for conversation now how long might it have been he asked before we showed up that you seen us i saw you miss farrar said when mr when that bicycle scout was talking to me i saw the red bands on your hats among the bushes the sergeant appeared interested but why didnt you let on to him miss farrar laughed evasively maybe because i am from new york too she said perhaps i wanted to see soldiers from my city take a prisoner they were interrupted by the sudden appearance of the smaller soldier on his ratlike countenance was written deep concern when i got to the turn he began breathlessly i couldnt see him where did he go did he double back through the woods or did he have time to ride out of sight before i got there the reappearance of his comrade affected the sergeant strangely he sprang to his feet his under jaw protruding truculently his eyes flashing with anger get back he snarled do what i told you under his breath he muttered words that to miss farrar were unintelligible the little ratlike man nodded and ran from them down the road the sergeant made an awkward gesture of apology excuse me lady he begged but it makes me hot when them rookies wont obey orders you see he ran on glibly im a reglar served three years in the philippines and i cant get used to not having my men do what i say miss farrar nodded and started toward the house the sergeant sprang quickly across the road have you ever been in the philippines miss he called its a great country miss farrar halted and shook her head she was considering how far politeness required of her to entertain unshaven militiamen who insisted on making sentries of themselves at her front gate the sergeant had plunged garrulously into a confusing description of the far east he was clasping the pickets of the fence with his hands and his eyes were fastened on hers he lacked neither confidence nor vocabulary and not for an instant did his tongue hesitate or his eyes wander and yet in his manner there was nothing at which she could take offence he appeared only amiably vain that he had seen much of the world and anxious to impress that fact upon another miss farrar was bored but the man gave her no opportunity to escape in consequence she was relieved when the noisy approach of an automobile brought him to an abrupt pause coming rapidly down the road was a large touringcar filled with men in khaki the sergeant gave one glance at it and leaped across the road taking cover behind the stone wall instantly he raised his head above it and shook his fist at miss farrar dont tell he commanded theyre blues in that car dont tell again he sank from sight miss farrar now was more than bored she was annoyed why grown men should play at war so seriously she could not understand it was absurd she no longer would remain a party to it and lest the men in the car might involve her still further she retreated hastily toward the house as she opened the door the car halted at the gate and voices called to her but she pretended not to hear them and continued up the stairs behind her the car passed noisily on its way she mounted the stairs and crossing a landing moved down a long hall at the further end of which was her bedroom the hall was uncarpeted but the tennis shoes she wore made no sound nor did the door of her bedroom when she pushed it open on the threshold miss farrar stood quite still a swift sinking nausea held her in a vice her instinct was to scream and run but her throat had tightened and gone dry and her limbs trembled opposite the door was her dressingtable and reflected in its mirror were the features and figure of the ratlike soldier his back was toward her with one hand he swept the dressingtable the other hanging at his side held a revolver in a moment the panic into which miss farrar had been thrown passed her breath and blood returned and intent only on flight she softly turned on the instant the ratfaced one raised his eyes saw her reflected in the mirror and with an oath swung toward her he drew the revolver close to his cheek and looked at her down the barrel dont move he whispered dont scream where are the jewels miss farrar was not afraid of the revolver or of the man she did not believe either would do her harm the idea of both the presence of the man in her room and that any one should dare to threaten her was what filled her with repugnance as the warm blood flowed again through her body her spirit returned she was no longer afraid she was instead indignant furious with one step she was in the room leaving the road to the door open get out of here she commanded the little man snarled and stamped the floor he shoved the gun nearer to her the jewels damn you he whispered do you want me to blow your fool head off where are the jewels jewels repeated miss farrar i have no jewels you lie shrieked the little man he said the house was full of jewels we heard him he said he would stay to guard the jewels miss farrar recognized his error she remembered lathrops jest and that it had been made while the two men were within hearing behind the stone wall it was a joke she cried leave at once she backed swiftly toward the open window that looked upon the road or ill call your sergeant if you go near that window or scream whispered the ratlike one ill shoot a heavy voice speaking suddenly from the doorway shook miss farrars jangled nerves into fresh panic she wont scream said the voice in the door miss farrar saw the bulky form of the sergeant blocking her escape without shifting his eyes from miss farrar the man with the gun cursed breathlessly at the other why didnt you keep her away he panted an automobile stopped in front of the gate explained the sergeant have you got them he demanded no returned the other nothing she wont tell where they are the older man laughed oh yes shell tell he whispered his voice was still low and suave but it carried with it the weight of a threat and the threat although unspoken filled miss farrar with alarm her eyes wide with concern turned fearfully from one man to the other the sergeant stretched his hands toward her the fingers working and making clutches in the air the look in his eyes was quite terrifying if you dont tell he said slowly ill choke it out of you if his intention was to frighten the girl he succeeded admirably with her hands clasped to her throat miss farrar sank against the wall she saw no chance of escape the way to the door was barred and should she drop to the garden below from the window before she could reach the road the men would overtake her even should she reach the road the house nearest was a half mile distant the sergeant came close his fingers opening and closing in front of her eyes he raised his voice to a harsh bellowing roar im going to make you tell he shouted im going to choke it out of you although she was alone in the house although on every side the pine woods encompassed her miss farrar threw all her strength into one long piercing cry for help and upon the instant it was answered from the hall came the swift rush of feet the ratlike one swung toward it from his revolver came a report that shook the room a flash and a burst of smoke and through it miss farrar saw lathrop hurl himself he dived at the ratlike one and as on the football field he had been taught to stop a runner flung his arms around the others knees the legs of the man shot from under him his body cut a half circle through the air and the part of his anatomy to first touch the floor was his head the floor was of oak and the impact gave forth a crash like the smash of a baseball bat when it drives the ball to centre field the man did not move he did not even groan in his relaxed fingers the revolver lay within reach of lathrops hand he fell upon it and still on his knees pointed it at the sergeant youre my prisoner now he shouted cheerfully hands up the man raised his arms slowly as if he were lifting heavy dumbbells the lady called for help he said i came to help her no no protested the girl he did not help me he said he would choke me if i didnt he said he would what bellowed lathrop he leaped to his feet and sent the gun spinning through the window he stepped toward the man gingerly on the balls of his feet like one walking on ice the man seemed to know what that form of approach threatened for he threw his arms into a position of defence you bully whispered lathrop you coward you choke women do you he shifted from one foot to the other his body balancing forward his arms swinging limply in front of him with his eyes he seemed to undress the man as though choosing a place to strike i made the same mistake you did he taunted i should have killed you first now i am going to do it he sprang at the man his chin still sunk on his chest but with his arms swinging like the spokes of a wheel his opponent struck back heavily violently but each move of his arm seemed only to open up some vulnerable spot blows beat upon his chin upon his nose his eyes blows jabbed him in the ribs drove his breath from his stomach ground his teeth together cut the flesh from his cheeks he sank to his knees with his arms clasping his head get up roared lathrop stand up to it you coward but the man had no idea of standing up to it howling with pain he scrambled toward the door and fled staggering down the hall at the same moment the automobile that a few minutes before had passed up the road came limping to the gate and a halfdozen men in uniform sprang out of it from the window lathrop saw them spread across the lawn and surround the house theyve got him he said he pointed to the prostrate figure on the floor he and the other one he explained breathlessly are new york crooks they have been looting in the wake of the reds disguised as soldiers i knew they werent even amateur soldiers by the mistakes in their makeup and i made that bluff of riding away so as to give them time to show what the game was then that provost guard in the motor car stopped me and when they said who they were after i ordered them back here but they had a flat tire and my bicycle beat them in his excitement he did not notice that the girl was not listening that she was very pale that she was breathing quickly and trembling ill go tell them he added that the other one they want is up here miss farrars strength instantly returned with a look of terror at the now groaning figure on the floor she sprang toward lathrop with both hands clutching him by his sleeves you will not she commanded you will not leave me alone appealingly she raised her face to his startled countenance with a burst of tears she threw herself into his arms im afraid she sobbed dont leave me please no matter what i say never leave me again between bewilderment and joy the face of lathrop was unrecognizable as her words reached him as he felt the touch of her body in his arms and her warm wet cheek against his own he drew a deep sigh of content and then fearfully and tenderly held her close after a pause in which peace came to all the world he raised his head dont worry he said you can bet i wont leave you
