 vendetta by michael dibdin wednesday aurelio zen lounged on the sofa like a listless god bring ing the dead back to life with a flick of his finger he made them rise again one by one the shapeless blood drenched bundles stirred shook themselves crawled about a bit then floated upwards until they were on their feet again this extremely literal resurrection had taken them by surprise to judge by their expressions or per haps it was the sight of each others bodies that was so shocking the hideous injuries and disfigurements the pools and spatters of blood everywhere but as zen con tinued to apply his miraculous intervention all this was set to rights too the gaping rents in flesh and fabric healed themselves the blood mopped itself up and in no time at all the scene looked almost like the ordinary dinner party it had been until the impossible occurred none of the four seemed to notice the one remarkable feature of this spuri ous afterlife namely that everything happened backwards he did it zens mother was standing in the doorway her night dress clutched around her skimpy form whats wrong mamma she pointed at the television which now showed a beach of brilliant white sand framed by smoothly curved rocks a man was swimming backwards through the wavelets he casually dived up out of the water landed neatly on one of the rocks and strolled backwards to the shaded lounging chairs where the others sat sucking smoke out of the air and blowing it into cigarettes the one in the swimming costume he did it he was in love with his wife so he killed him he was in another one too last week on channel five they thought he was a spy but it was his twin brother he was both of them they do it with mirrors mother and son gazed at each other across the room lit by the electronically preserved sunlight of a summer now more than three months in the past it was almost two oclock in the moming and even the streets of rome were hushed zen pressed the pause button of the remote control unit stilling the video why are you up mamma he asked trying to keep his irritation out of his voice this was breaking the rules once she had retired to her room his mother never re appeared it was respect for these unwritten laws that made their life together just about tolerable from his point of view i thought i heard something their eyes still held the woman who had given zen life might have been the child he had never had awakened by a nightmare and seeking comfort he got up and walked over to her im sorry mamma i turned the sound right down i dont mean the tv he interrogated those bleary evasive eyes more closely what then she shrugged pettishly a sort of scraping scraping what do you mean like old umbertos boat zen was often brought up short by his mothers refer ences to a past which for her was infinitely more real than the present would ever be he had quite forgotten umberto the portly dignified proprietor of a general grocery near the san geremia bridge he used the boat to transport fruit and vegetables from the rialto market as well as boxes cases bottles and jars to and from the cellars of his house which the tenyearold zen had visualized as an aladdins cave crammed with exotic delights when not in use the boat was moored to a post in the little canal opposite the zens house the post had a tin collar to protect the wood and a few moments after each vaporetto passed down the cannaregio the wash would reach umbertos boat and set it rubbing its gunwale against the collar producing a series of metallic rasps it was probably me moving around in here that you heard zen told her now go back to bed before you catch cold it didnt come from in here it came from the other side across the canal just like that damned boat zen took her by the arm which felt alarmingly fragile widowed by the war his mother had confronted the world alone on his behalf wresting concessions from tradesmen and bureaucrats labouring at menial jobs to eke out her pension cooking cleaning sewing mending and making do tirelessly and ingeniously hollowing out and shoring up a space for her son to grow up in small wonder he thought that the effort had reduced her to this pittance of a person scared of noises and the dark with no interest in anything but the television serials she watched whose plots and characters were gradually becoming con fused in her mind such motherhood as she had known was like those industrial jobs that leave workers crippled and broken the only difference being that there was no one mothers could sue for damages zen led her back into the musty bedroom she occupied at the back of the apartment filled with the furniture she had brought with her from their home in venice the pieces were all elaborately carved from some wood as hard dark and heavy as iron they covered every inch of wall space blocking up the fire escape as well as most of the window which anyway she always kept tightly shuttered are you going to stay up and watch the rest of that film she asked as he tucked her in yes mamma dont worry ill be just in there if you hear anything its only me it didnt come from in there anyway i told you who did it the skinny one in the swimming costume i know mamma he murmured wearily thats what everyone thinks he wandered back to the living room just as two oclock began to strike from the churches in the vatican zen stood surveying the familiar faces locked up on the flick ering screen they were familiar not just to him but to everyone who had watched television or looked at the papers that autumn for months the news had been domi nated by the dramatic events and still more sensational implications of the burolo affair in a way it was quite understandable that zens mother had confused the characters involved with the cast of a film she had seen indeed it was a film that zen was watching but a film of a special kind not intended for commercial release and only available to him as an officer of the criminalpol section of the ministry of the interior in connection with the report he had been asked to prepare summarizing the case to date he wasnt really supposed to take it home but the ministry didnt run to video machines for its employees even those of vicequestorial rank so what was he supposed to do zen had demanded in his ignorance of the nature of video tape hold it up to the window frame by frame he sat down on the sofa again groped for the remote control unit and pressed the play button releasing the blurred figures to laugh chat and generally ham it up for the camera they knew it was there of course oscar burolo made no secret of his mania for recording the highpoints of his life on the contrary every visitor to the entrepreneurs sardinian hideaway had been impressed by the underground vault containing hundreds of video tapes as well as computer discs all carefully shelved and indexed like all good libraries oscars collection was constantly expanding indeed shortly before his death a complete new section of shelving had been installed to accommodate the latest additions but do you actually ever watch any of them the guest might ask i dont need to watch them oscar would reply smiling in a peculiar way its enough to know that theyre there if the six people relaxing at the waters edge were in any way uneasy about the prospect of having their antics pre served for posterity they certainly didnt show it an invitation to the villa burolo was so soughtafter that no one was going to quibble about the conditions quite apart from the experience itself it was something to brag about at dinner parties for months to come you mean to say youve actually been there people would ask their envy showing like an illadjusted slip tell me is it true that he has lions and tigers freely roaming the grounds and that the only way in is by helicopter secure in the knowledge that no one was likely to contradict him oscar burolos exguest could freely choose whether to distort the facts and i solemnly assure you i who have been there and seen it with my own eyes that burolo has a staff of over thirty servants or rather slaves whom he bought cash down from the president of a certain african country or in more sophisticated company to suggest that the truth was actually stranger than the various lurid and vulgar fictions which had been circulating on the face of it this degree of interest was itself almost the oddest feature of the business nothing could be more banal than for a rich italian to buy himself a villa in sar dinia by sardinia of course one meant the costa smeralda on the northern coast of the island which the aga khan had bought for a pittance from the local peasant farmers and turned into a holiday paradise for the super wealthy a ministate which sprang into being every sum mer for two months its citizens hailed from all parts of the world and from all walks of life film stars industrialists sheikhs politicians criminals pop singers bankers their cosmopolitan enclave was protected by an extremely efficient private police force but its internal regime was admirably democratic and egalitarian religious political or racial discrimination were unknown the only require ment was money and lots of it as founder and owner of a construction company whose rapid success was almost uncanny there was no question that oscar burolo satisfied that requirement but instead of meekly buying his way into the costa like everyone else he did something unheardof something so bizarre and outlandish that some people claimed after wards that they had always thought it was illomened from the start for his sardinian retreat oscar chose an abandoned farmhouse halfway down the islands almost ininhabited eastern coast and not even on the sea for gods sake but several kilometres inland italians have no great respect for eccentricity and this kind of idiosyncrasy might very easily have aroused nothing but ridicule and contempt it was a measure of the panache with which oscar carried off his whims that exactly the opposite was the case the full resources of burolo construction were brought to bear on the humble farmhouse which was swiftly altered out of all recogni tion one by one the arguments against oscars choice were made to look smallminded and unconvincing the security aspect so important in an area notorious for kidnappings was taken care of by hiring the top firm in the country to make the villa intruderproof no expense spared used to having to cut corners to make security costeffective the consultant was delighted for once to have an opportunity to design a system without compro mises if anyone ever manages to break into this place ill believe in ghosts he assured his client when the work was completed having purchased peace of mind with hard cash oscar then added a characteristic touch by buying a pair of rather motheaten lions from a bankrupt safari park outside cagliari and turning them loose in the grounds calculating that the resulting publicity would do as much as any amount of high technology to deter intruders but even oscar couldnt change the fact that the villa was situated almost zoo kilometres from the nearest air port and the glamorous nightspots of the costa smeralda zoo kilometres of tortuous and poorly maintained road where no electronic fences could protect him from kidnap pers wasnt that a drawback well it might be oscar retorted for someone who still thought of personal trans port in terms of cars but olbia and the costa were only half that distance as the crow flies and when the crow in question was capable of zzo kph to clinch the argu ment oscar would bundle his guests into the crow an agusta helicopter and pilot them personally to palau or porto cervo for aperitifs as for swimming since oscar would not go to the coast like everyone else the coast was made to come to him a wide irregular hollow the size of a small lake was scooped out of the parched red soil behind the farm this was lined with concrete filled with water and decorated with a sandy beach and wavesmoothed rocks dynamited and bulldozed out of the foreshore barnacles and all and the bamacles throve because one of the biggest surprises awaiting burolos guests as they padded off for their first dip was that the water was salt fresh from the mediter ranean oscar would explain proudly pumped up here through metres of sixtycentimetre duct filtered for impurities agitated by six asynchronous wave simulators and continuously monitored to maintain a constant level of salinity oscar liked using words like asynchronous and salinity and quoting squads of figures it clinched the effect which the villa was already beginning to have on his listener but he knew when to stop and at this point would usually slap his guest on the back or if it was a woman place his hand familiarly at the base of her spine just above the buttocks and say so whats missing except for a lot of fish and crabs and lobsters mind you we have those too but they know their place here on a plate zen paused the video again as footsteps sounded in the street outside a car door slammed shut but instead of the expected sound of the car starting up and driving away the footsteps returned the way they had come ceasing somewhere close by he walked over to the window and opened the shutters the wooden jalousies beyond the glass were closed but segments of the scene outside were visible by looking down through the angled slats both sides of the street were packed with cars parked on the road on either side of the trees lining it and all over the pavement some distance from the house a red saloon was parked beyond all these all by itself facing towards the house it appeared to be empty the scene was abruptly plunged into darkness as the streetlamp attached to the wall just below went out something had gone wrong with its automatic switch so that the lamp was continually fooled into thinking that its own light was that of the dawn and therefore turned itself off then after some time it would start to glow faintly again gradually growing brighter and brighter until the whole cycle repeated itself zen closed the shutters and walked back to the sofa catching sight of his reflection in the large mirror above the fireplace he paused as though the person he saw there might hold the key to what was puzzling him the prominent bones and slight tautness of the skin especially around the eyes gave his face a slightly exotic air prob ably due to slav or even semitic blood somewhere in the familys venetian past it was a face that gave nothing away yet seemed always to tremble on the brink of some expression that never quite appeared his face had made zens reputation as an interrogator for it was a perfect screen on to which others could project their own sus picions fears and apprehensions where other policemen confronted criminals using the carrot or the stick accord ing to the situation zens subjects found themselves shut up with a man who barely seemed to exist yet who mirrored back to them the innermost secrets of their hearts they read their every fleeting emotion accurately imaged on those scrupulously blank features and knew that they were lost like all the other furniture in the apartment the mirror was old without being valuable and the silvering was wearing off in places one particularly large worn patch covered much of zens chest reminding him of the last terrible scenes of the video he was watching of oscar burolo reeling away from the shotgun blasts which had come from nowhere passing through the elaborate elec tronic defences of his property as though they did not exist with a shiver zen deliberately stepped to one side moving the stain of darkness away there was something about the burolo case which was differeht from any other he had ever been involved in he had known cases which obsessed him professionally taking over his life until he was unable to sleep properly or to think about anything else but this was even more disturbing it was as though the aura of mystery and horror surrounding the killings had extended itself even to him as though he too was somehow in danger from the faceless power which had ravaged the villa burolo this was absurd of course the case was closed an arrest had been made and zens involvement with it was temporary secondhand and superficial but despite that the sensation of menace remained and the sound of footsteps was enough to make him rush to the window a car parked halfway down the street seemed to pose some threat the fact was that it was time to go to bed long past it in fact he walked back to the sofa and picked up his crumpled pack of nazionali cigarettes considered briefly whether to have one more before turning in decided against it then lit up anyway he yawned and glanced at his watch a quarter past two no wonder he was feeling so strange seen through the mists of sleeplessness every thing had the insubstantial fluid quality of a dream he picked up the remote control pressed the play button and tried to concentrate on the screen again you had to hand it to oscar no doubt the camera angle had been carefully chosen but it was really very difficult to believe that this beach these rocks those plashing wavelets were not part of a natural coastline but a swim ming pool five kilometres inland as for the members of the group sitting around the table in the shadow of a huge green and blue parasol toying with iced drinks packs of cards and magazines full of games and puzzles they were fairly typical of anyone who might have been found at the villa on any given day during july and august that sum mer besides oscar and his wife there were only four guests burolo assiduously preserved the mystique of the villa by restricting the number of visitors thus increasing their sense of being privileged intimates his excuse was that the household was not able to cope with huge parties despite the tall tales of resident slave communities oscars staff was in fact limited to an elderly caretaker and wife together with a young man who had come with the lions and also helped to look after the garden oscar made much of being a selfmade man with no wish for ostentatious display i am what i am he declared a simple builder and nothing more the truth was that he had realized that it was easier to dominate and manipulate small groups than large ones the video made this very clear in every scene inside or out it was the host himself who was invariably the focus of attention lounging on his personalized beach in silver shorts and a clashing pink and blue silk shirt his head exaggerated in size as though by a caricaturists pen oscar looked like the love child of the michelin man and an overweight gorilla one of his unsuccessful rivals had remarked that anyone who still doubted the theory of evolution obviously hadnt met oscar burolo but it was a waste of time trying to be witty at oscars expense he promptly took up the story telling it himself with great relish and concluding which is why ive survived and robertos gone to the wall like the dinosaur he is oscar the ebullient the irrepressible oscar nothing could touch him or so it seemed such was the spell cast by burolo that it was only by an effort of attention that one became aware of the others present the slightly saturnine man with thinning grey hair and a wedgeshaped face sitting to oscars left was a sicilian architect named vianello who had collaborated with burolo construction on the plans for a new electricity generating station at rieti unfortunately their tender had been rejected on technical grounds a previously unheardof eventuality and the contract had gone to another firm dottor vianello was wearing an immaculate pale cream cotton suit and a slightly strained smile pos sibly due to the fact that he was having to listen to oscars wifes account of an abortive shopping trip to olbia rita burolo had once been an exceptionally attractive woman and the sense of power which this had given her had remained even now that her charms were visibly wilting her inane comments had commanded total attention for so long that rita had at last come to believe that she had more to offer the world than her legs and breasts which was a consolation now that the latter were no longer quite firstdivision material opposite her sat the sicilian archi tects wife a diminutive pixie of a woman with frightened eyes and a faint moustache maria pia vianello gazed at the spectacle of her hostess in full career with a kind of awestruck amazement like a schoolgirl with a crush on her teacher clearly she would never dream of tryin to dominate a gathering in this way despite these superficial dissimilarities however the vianellos and the burolos basically had much in common no longer young but rich enough to keep age at bay for a few years yet the men ponderous with professional gra vitas like those toy figurines which cannot be knocked over because they are loaded with lead the women exuding the sullen peevishness of those who have been pampered with every luxury except freedom and responsi bility the remaining couple were different zen reversed the tape again briefly hauling the swim mer up out of the water once more and then froze the picture studying the man who had dominated the news for the previous three months renato favellonis sharp ferrety features and weak chest and limbs coupled with greasy hair and an overready smile gave him the air of a smalltown playboy by turns truculent and toadying con vinced of being gods gift to the world in general and women in particular but quite prepared to lower himself to any dirty work in the interests of getting ahead at first zen had found it almost incomprehensible that such a man could have been the linchpin of the deals that were rumoured to have taken place between oscar burolo and the senior political figure who was referred to in the press as onorevole the formula reputedly used by burolo in his secret memoranda of their relationship only gradually had he come to understand that it was precisely favel lonis blatant sleaziness which made him acceptable as a gobetween there are degrees even in the most cynical corruption and manipulation by embodying the most despicable possible grade renato favelloni made his clients feel relatively decent by comparison his wife like renato himself was a good ten years younger than the other four people present and exactly the kind of stunning bimbo that rita burolo must have been at the same age this cannot have recommended nadia favelloni to oscars wife any more than the younger womans habit of wandering around the place halfnaked having reached the age at which women begin to employ clothing for purposes of concealment rather than display signora burolo discreetly retained a flowing wrap of some material that was a good deal less transparent than it first appeared a sense of revulsion suddenly overcame zen at the thought of what was shortly to happen to that pampered veiled flesh vanity lust jealousy boredom bitchiness beauty wit what did any of it matter as the doomed faces glanced flirtatiously at the camera wondering how they were coming across zen felt like screaming at them go away get out of that house now the favellonis had done precisely that of course which was one reason why everyone in italy from the magistrate investigating the case to the knowall in your local bar agreed with zens mother that renato favelloni was the one who did it with the seedy fixer and his disturbingly barebreasted wife out of the way the two maturer couples had settled down to a quiet dinner in the villas dining room with its rough tiled floor and huge trestle table which had originally graced the refectory of a fran ciscan monastery the meal had been eaten and coffee and liqueurs served when oscar once again switched on the camera to record the afterdinner talk dominated as always by his booming emphatic voice punctuated by blows of his hairy fist on the tabletop apart from a distant metallic crash whose source and relevance were in dispute the first sign of what was about to happen appeared in signora vianellos nervous eyes the architects wife was sitting next to their host who was in the middle of a bawdy tale concerning a wellknown tv presenter and a stripper turned member of parliament who had appeared on his talk show and what they had reputedly got up to during the commercial break maria pia vianello had been listening with a vague blurry smile as though she wasnt quite sure whether it was proper for her to appear to understand then her eyes were attracted by something on the other side of the room something which made such considerations irrelevant the vague smile abruptly vanished leaving her features completely blank no one else had noticed anything the only sound in the room was oscars voice whatever signora vianello had seen was on the move and her eyes tracked it across the room until oscar saw it too he broke off in mid sentence threw his napkin on the table and stood up what do you want there was no answer no sound whatever oscars wife and dottor vianello who were sitting with their backs to the camera looked round rita burolo emitted a scream of terror vianellos expression did not change except to harden slightly what do you want burolo repeated his brows knitted in puzzlement and annoyance abruptly he pushed his chair aside and strode towards the intruder staring masterfully downwards as though to cow an unruly child you could say what you liked thought zen but the man had guts or was he just foolhardy trying to show off to his guests to preserve an image of bravado to the last at all events it was only in the final moment that any fear entered oscars eyes as he flung up his hands in an instinctive attempt to protect his face a brutal eruption of noise swamped the soundtrack literally disintegrated by the blast oscars hands dis appeared while bright red blotches appeared all over his face and neck like an instant infection he reeled away holding up the stumps of his wrists somehow he man aged to recover his balance and turn back only to receive the second discharge which carried away half his chest and flung him against the corner of the dining table where he collapsed in a bloody heap at his wifes feet rita burolo scrambled desperately away from the corpse as vianello dived under the table a pistol appearing in his hand the ratchet sound of a shotgun being reloaded by pump action mingled with two sharp light cracks from the architects pistol then the soundtrack was bludgeoned twice more in quick succession the first barrel scoured the space below the table gouging splinters out of the wood shattering plates and glasses wounding signora vianello terribly in the legs and reducing her husband to a night mare figure crawling about on the floor like a tormented animal the second caught rita burolo trying desperately to climb out of the window that lay open on to the terrace as she was further away than the others the wounds she sustained were more dispersed covering her in a spray as fine and evenly distributed as drizzle on a windscreen with a despairing cry she fell through the window to the paving stones of the terrace where she slowly bled to death despite her lacerated legs maria pia vianello somehow struggled to her feet for all her diminutive stature she too gave the impression of looking down at the intruder just a moment please she muttered over the dry clinical sound of the gun being reloaded im afraid im not quite ready yet im sorry the shot took her at close range flaying her so fearfully that loops of intestine protruded through the wall of her abdomen in places then the second barrel spun her round she clutched the wall briefly then collapsed into a dishevelled heap leaving a complex pattern of dark streaks on the whitewashed plaster it had taken less than twenty seconds to turn the room into an abattoir fifteen seconds later the caretaker would appear having run from the tworoom service flat where he and his wife had been watching a variety show on tele vision until then apart from wine dripping from a broken bottle at the edge of the table and a swishing caused by the convulsive twitches of the dying vianellos arm there was no sound whatsoever if anyone ever manages to break into this place ill believe in ghosts the security analyst had assured oscar burolo nevertheless someone or something had got in butchered the inhabitants and then vanished without trace all in less than a minute and in perfect silence even in broad daylight and the company of others it was difficult to ignore this almost supernatural dimension of the killings in the eerie doldrums of the night all alone it seemed impossible to believe that there could be a rational explanation for them the silence of the running tape was broken by a distant scraping sound zen felt his skin crawl and the hairs on his head stir he reached for the remote control unit and stilled the video the noise continued a low persistent scraping like old umbertos boat his mother had said zen walked quietly across to the inner hallway of the apartment opened the door to his mothers bedroom and looked inside can you hear it a voice murmured in the darkness yes mamma oh good i thought it might be me imagining it im not quite right in the head sometimes you know he gazed towards the invisible bed it was the first time that she had ever made such an admission they were both silent for some time but the noise did not recur where is it coming from he asked the wardrobe which wardrobe there were three of them in the room filled with clothes that no one would ever wear again carefully preserved from moths by liberal doses of napthalene which gave the room its basic funereal odour the big one his mother replied the biggest wardrobe occupied the central third of the wall giving on to the internal courtyard of the building its positioning had occasioned zen some anxiety at the time since it obstructed access to the fire escape but the wardrobe was too big to fit anywhere else zen walked over to the bed and straightened the counterpane and sheets then he patted the hand which emerged from the covers all the obsolete paraphenalia of muscles and arteries disturbingly revealed by the parchmentlike skin it was just a rat mamma the best way of dispelling her formless childish fears was by giving her a specific unpleasantness to focus on but it sounded like metal the skirtings lined with zinc he improvised to stop them gnawing through ill speak to giuseppe in the morning and well get the exterminators in you try and get sorne sleep now back in the living room he turned off the television and reound the video tape trying to dispel his vague sense of unease by thinking about the report which he had to write the next day it was the lateness of the hour that made everything seem strange and threatening now the time when according to what his uncle had once told him a house belongs not to the people who happen to live there now but to all those who have preceded them over the centuries tomorrow morning everything would have snapped back into proportion and the uncanny aspects of the burolo case would seem mere freakish curiosities the only real question was whether to mention them at all it wasnt that he wanted or needed to conceal anything for that matter he wouldnt have known where to begin since he had no idea who the report was destined for the problem was that there were certain aspects of the burolo case which were very difficult to mention without laying yourself open to the charge of being a credulous nin compoop for example the statement made by the seven yearold daughter of oscar burolos lawyer who had visited the villa in late july as a special treat she had been allowed to stay up for dinner with the adults and in the excitement of the moment had sneaked some of her fathers coffee with the result that she couldnt sleep it was a luminous summer night and eventually the child left her room and set out to explore the house according to her statement in one of the rooms in the older part of the villa she saw a figure moving about at first i was pleased she said i thought it was a child and i was lonely for someone to play with but then i remembered that there were no children at the villa i got scared and ran back to my room including things like that could easily make him the laughingstock of the department while if he left them out he laid himself open to the charge of suppressing evi dence fortunately it was no part of zens brief to draw conclusions or offer opinions all that was needed as a concise report describing the various lines of investigation which had been conducted by the police and the cara binieri and outlining the evidence against the various sus pects a clerical chore in short to which he was bringing nothing but an ability to read between the lines of official documents picking out the grain of what was not being said from the overwhelming chaff of what was watching the video had been the last stage in this procedure there was nothing left to do except sit down and write the thing and this he would do the next morning while it was all fresh in his mind by the afternoon the burolo affair would have no more significance for him than for any other member of the public once again footsteps sounded in the street below a few minutes later the silence was abruptly shattered as a car started up and accelerated away with a squeal of tyres by the time zen reached the window it had already passed far beyond the area of street visible through the closed jalousies the sound of its engine gradually faded away echoing and reverberating ever more distantly through the intersecting channels of streets the streetlight was in its waxing phase and as the light gradually intensified zen saw that the red car which had been parked further along the street was no longer there he closed the shut ters wondering why its presence or absence should be of any concern to him finding no answer he decided it was time to go to bed nearly over now everythings going the doubfs the fears the caresthe confusion even the pain all draining away of its own accord theres nothing i need do nothing more to be done when i saw him standing there the gun in his hand it was like seeing myself in a mirror he had taken my part emerging from nowhere implacable confident unsurprised he sounded impatient taunting me with a strange name threatening me theres no point in trying to hide he said lets get it over with as usual i did what i was told i he cried out in rage and disbelief whatever he had been expec ting it wasnt that then something overwhelmed me knocking me over opening me up i couldnt have resisted even if id wanted to it wasnt like the prst time the man under the table wounding me with his pistol all he gave me was pain this was different i knew at once that i was carrying a death it wont be long now already i feel light and insubstantial as though i were dissolving the darkness is on the move billowing out to enshroud me winding me in its endless folds everything is in flux solid rock gives way at my touch the ground flows beneath me as though the river had returned to its courses unexplored caverns burst open like preworks as i advance i am lost i who know this place better than i know my own body
