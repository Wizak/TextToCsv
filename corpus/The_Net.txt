shadowy fingers were reaching down the valleys across which the railroad track meandered far to the left out of an opalescent sea rose the fairylike lipari islands and in the farthest distance stromboli lifted its smoking cone above the horizon on the landward side of the train as it reeled and squealed along its tortuous course were gray and gold sicilian villages perched high against the hills or drowsing among fields of artichoke and sumac and prickly pear to one familiar with modern sicilian railway trains the journey eastward from palermo promises no considerable discomfort but twentyfive years ago it was not to be lightly undertaken not to be undertaken at all in fact without an unusual equipment of patience and a resignation entirely lacking in the average anglosaxon it was not surprising therefore that norvin blake as the hours dragged along should remark less and less upon the beauties of the island and more and more upon the medieval condition of the rickety railroad coach in which he was shaken and buffeted about he shifted himself to an easier position upon the seat and lighted a cheroot for although this was his first glimpse of sicily he had watched the same villages come and go all through a long hot afternoon had seen the same groves of orange and lemon and dustgreen olivetrees the same fields of barbary figs the same rosegrown garden spots until he was heartily tired of them all he felt at liberty to smoke for the only other occupant of the compartment was a young priest in flowing mantle and silk beaver hat finding that blake spoke italian remarkably well for a foreigner the priest had shown an earnest desire for closer acquaintance and now plied him eagerly with questions hanging upon his answers with a childlike intensity of gaze which at first had been amusing and so the signore has traveled all the way from paris to attend the wedding at terranova veramente that is a great journey many wonderful adventures befell you perhaps eh the priests little eyes gleamed from his full cheeks and he edged forward until his knees crowded blakes it was evident that he anticipated a thrilling tale and did not intend to be disappointed it was very tiresome thats all and the beggars at naples nearly tore me asunder incredible you will tell me about it theres nothing to tell these european trains cannot compare with ours evidently discouraged at this lack of response the questioner tried a new line of approach the signore is perhaps related to our young conte he suggested and yet that can scarcely be for you are inglese americano indeed martel and i are close friends however we met in paris we are almost like brothers truly i have heard that he spends much time studying to be a great painter it is very strange but many of our rich people leave sicily to reside elsewhere as for me i cannot understand it martel left when his father was killed he says this country is behind the times and he prefers to be out in the world where there is life and where things progress but the priest showed by a blank stare that he did not begin to grasp the meaning of this statement he shook his head he was always a wild lad now as to the signorina ginini who is to be his beautiful contessa she loves sicily she has spent most of her life here among us with a flash of interest blake inquired what is she like martel has spoken of her a great many times but one cant place much dependence on a lovers description bellissima the priest sighed and rolled his eyes eloquently you have never seen anything like her i assure you she is altogether too beautiful if i had my way all the beautiful women would be placed in a convent where no man could see them then there would be no fighting and no flirting and the plain women could secure husbands beautiful women are dangerous she is rich too of course thats what martel says and that is exactly the way he says it but describe her oh i have never seen her i merely know that she is very rich and very beautiful he went off into a number of rapturous issimas now as for the conte i know him like a book i know his every thought but martel has been abroad for ten years and he has only returned within a month to be sure but i come from the village this side of san sebastiano and my second cousin ricardo is his uomo daffare his overseer it is a very great position of trust which ricardo occupies for i must tell you that he attends to the leasing of the entire estate during the contes absence in france or wherever it is he draws those marvelous pictures ricardo collects the rents with true sicilian naivete the priest added he is growing rich beato lui he for one will not need to go to your golden america is it true signore that in america any one who wishes may be rich quite true smiled the young man even our beggars are rich the priest wagged his head knowingly my mothers cousin alfio amato he is an american you know him im afraid not but surely he has been in america these five years a tall dark fellow with fine teeth think he is such a liar any one would remember him ebbene he wrote that there were poor people in america as here but we knew him too well to believe him i suppose every one knows about the marriage oh indeed it will unite two old families two rich families you know the savigni are rich also even before the children were left as orphans it was settled that they should be married what a great fortune that will make for ricardo to oversee then perhaps he will be more generous to his own people he is a hard man in money matters and a man of action also he does not allow flies to sit upon his nose he sent his own daughter lucrezia to terranova when the contessa was still a child and what is the result lucrezia is no longer a servant indeed no she is more like a sister to the signorina at the marriage no doubt she will receive a fine present and ricardo as well he is as silent as a mafioso but he thinks young blake stretched his tired muscles yawning im sorry martel couldnt marry in france this has been a tedious trip it was the contessas wish then to be wed in sicily i believe she insisted and martel agreed that it was the proper thing to do since they are both sicilians he was determined also that i should be present to share his joy and so here i am between you and me i envy him his lot so much that it almost spoils for me the pleasure of this unique journey you are an original murmured the priest admiringly but it was evident that his thirst for knowledge of the outside world was not to be so easily quenched for he began to question his traveling companion closely regarding america paris the journey thence the ship which bore him to palermo and a dozen other subjects upon which his active mind preyed he was full of the gossip of the countryside moreover and norvin learned much of interest about sicily and the disposition of her people one phenomenon to which the good man referred with the extremest wonder was blakes intimacy with a sicilian nobleman how an american signore had become such a close friend of the illustrious conte who was almost a stranger even to his own people seemed very puzzling indeed until norvin explained that they had been together almost constantly during the past three years we met quite by chance but we quickly became friends what in my country we call chums and we have been inseparable ever since and you then are also a great artist blake laughed at the indirect compliment to his friend i am not an artist at all i have been exiled to europe for three years upon my mothers orders she has her own ideas regarding a mans education and wishes me to acquire a continental polish my ability to tell you all this shows that i have at least made progress with the languages although i have doubts about the practical value of anything else i have learned martel has taught me italian i have taught him english we use both and sometimes we understand each other my three years are up now and once i have seen my good friend safely married i shall return to america and begin the serious business of life you are then in business my mothers cousin alfio amato is likewise a business man he deals in fruit beware of him for he would sell you rotten oranges and swear by the saints that they were excellent like martel i have land which i lease i am or i will be a cottonplanter this opened a new field of inquiry for the priest who was making the most of it when the train drew into a station and was stormed by a horde of chattering country folk the platform swarmed with vividly dressed women most of whom carried bundles wrapped up in variegated handkerchiefs and all of whom were tremendously excited at the prospect of travel leanvisaged swarthy men peered forth from the folds of shawls or from beneath shapeless caps of many colors a pair of carabinieri idled past a soldier in jaunty feathered hat posed before the contadini dogs donkeys fowls added their clamor to the highpitched voices twilight had settled and lights were kindling in the village while the heights above were growing black against a rosepink and motherofpearl sky the air was cool and fragrant with the odor of growing things and the open sea glowed with a subdued pulsating fire the capo stazione rushed madly back and forth striving by voice and gesture to hasten the movements of his passengers partenza pronto he cried then blew furiously upon his bugle after a series of shudders and convulsions the train began to hiss and clank and finally crept on into the twilight while the priest sat knee to knee with his companion and resumed his endless questioning it was considerably after dark when norvin blake alighted at san sebastiano to be greeted effusively by a young man of about his own age who came charging through the gloom and embraced him with a great hug so at last you come savigno cried i have been here these three hours eating my heart out and every time i inquired of that head of a cabbage in yonder he said pazienza the world was not made in a day but when when i kept repeating and he could only assure me that your train was approaching with the speed of the wind the saints in heaven even the superintendent of the railway himself could not tell the exact hour of its arrival which it seems is never twice the same and now yourself you are well never better and you but there is no need to ask you look disgustingly contented one would think you were already married martel savigno showed a row of even white teeth beneath his military mustache and clapped his friend affectionately on the back it is good to be among my own people i find after all that i am a sicilian but let me tell you that train is not always late once seven years ago it arrived upon the moment there were no passengers at the station to meet it however so it was forced to wait and now in order to keep our goodwill it always arrives thus the count was a wellsetup youth of an alert and active type tall dark and vivacious with a skin as smooth as a girls he had an impulsive energetic nature that seldom left him in repose and hence the contrast between the two men was marked for blake was of a more serious cast of features and possessed a decidedly anglosaxon reserve he was much the heavier in build also which detracted from his height and robbed him of that elegance which distinguished the young sicilian yet the two made a finelooking pair as they stood face to face in the yellow glare of the station lights what the deuce made me agree to this trip i dont know the american declared it was vile ive been carsick seasick homesick and all for poor lovesick martel the count laughed ah but if you knew how glad i am to see you really then that squares it blake spoke with that indefinable undernote which creeps into mens voices when friend meets friend ive been lost without you too i was quite ashamed of myself the count turned to a middleaged man who had remained in the shadows saying this is ricardo ferara my good right hand of whom you have heard me speak the overseer raised his hat and blake took his hand catching a glimpse of a grizzled face and a stiff mop of irongray hair you will see to signore blakes baggage ricardo michele ippolito the count called the carretta quickly and now caro norvin for the last leg of your journey will you ride in the cart or on horseback it is not far but the roads are steep horseback by all means my muscles need exercise the young men mounted a pair of compact sicilian horses which were held by still another man in the street behind the depot and set off up the winding road which climbed to the village above blake regretted the lateness of the hour which prevented him from gaining an adequate idea of his surroundings he could see however that they were picturesque for san sebastiano lay in a tiny step hewed out of the mountainside and was crowded into one street overlooking the railway far below and commanding a view of the sea toward the calabrian coast as the riders clattered through the poorly lighted village blake saw the customary lowroofed houses the usual squalid sidestreets more like steep lanes than thoroughfares and heard the townspeople pronouncing the name of the count of martinello while the everpresent horde of urchins fled from their path a beggar appeared beside his stirrup crying i die of hunger your worship but the fellow ran with surprising vigor and manifested a degree of endurance quite unexampled in a starving man a glimpse of these and then the lights were left behind and they were moving swiftly upward and into the mountains skirting walls of stone over which was wafted the perfume of many flowers passing fragrant groves of orange and lemon trees and less fragrant cottages the contents of which were bared to their eyes with utter lack of modesty they disturbed herds of drowsy cattle and goats lying at the roadside and all the time they continued to climb until their horses heaved and panted the americans impressions of this entire journey from the time of his leaving paris up to the present moment had been hurried and unreal for he had made close connections at rome at naples and at palermo having the leisurely deliberateness of the american southerner he disliked haste and confusion above all things he had an intense desire therefore to come to anchor and to adjust himself to his surroundings as martel chattered along telling of his many doings blake noted that ricardo and the man who had held the horses were following closely then as the cavalcade paused at length to breathe their mounts he saw that both men carried rifles why we look like an american sheriffs posse martel said he do all sicilian bridegrooms travel with an armed escort savigno showed a trace of hesitation the nights are dark the country is wild but my dear boy this country is surely old enough to be safe why sicily was civilized long before my country was even heard of all sorts of ancient gods and heroes used to live here i am told and i supposed diana had killed all the game long ago he laughed but savigno did not join him and a moment later they were under way again after a brief gallop they drew up at a big dark house hidden among the deeper shadows of many trees and in answer to martels shout a wide door was flung back then by the light which streamed forth from it they dismounted and made their way up a flight of stone steps once inside savigno exclaimed welcome to my birthplace a thousand welcomes seizing norvin by the shoulders he whirled him about let me see you once ah i am glad you made this sacrifice for me for i need you above all men his eyes though bright with affection were grave something unusual in him and the other inquired quickly theres nothing wrong i hope savigno tossed his head and smiled wrong what could be wrong with me now that you are here no all is quite right but i have been accursed with lonesomeness something was lacking it was you caro mio now however i am the most contented of mortals but you must be famished so i will show you to your room at once francesca has provided a feast for us i assure you give me a moment to look around so this is the castello jove its ripping blake found himself in a great hall similar to many he had seen in his european wanderings but ruder and older by far he judged the castello to be of norman build but remodeled to suit the taste of the savigni to the right through an open door he saw a large room where a fat sicilian woman was laying the table to the left was a drawingroom lighted only by a fire of fagots in a huge black fireplace the furniture showing curiously distorted in the long shadows other rooms opened towards the rear and he realized that the old place was very large it was unkempt also and showed the lack of a womans hand you exaggerate said savigno after paris the castello will seem very mean we siciliani do not live in grand style and besides i have spent practically no time here since my father may the saints receive him left me free to wander the place has been closed the old servants have gone it is dilapidated on the contrary its just the sort of place it should be venerable and overflowing with romance you must rule like a medieval baron why you could sell this woodwork to some millionaire countryman of mine for enough to realize a fortune per dio if taxes are not reduced i shall be forced to some such expedient the count laughed it was my mothers home it is my birthplace so i love it even though i neglect it as you perceive it is high time i took a wife but enough if you are lacking in appetite i am not and francesca is an unbearable tyrant when her meals grow cold he led his friend up the wide stairs and left him to prepare for supper and so this ends it all said blake as the two young men lounged in the big empty drawingroom later that evening they had dined and gossiped as only friends of their age can gossip had relived their adventures of the past three years and still were loath to part even for sleep how so queried savigno you speak of marriage as if it were dissolution it might as well be so far as the other fellow is concerned nonsense i shall not change oh yes you will besides i am returning to america even so we are rich we shall travel we shall meet frequently you will come to sicily perhaps the contessa and i may even go to america friendship such as ours laughs at the leagues but blake was pessimistic perhaps she wont like me martel laughed at this impossible she is a woman she has eyes she will see you as i see you more than that i have told her that she must love you then that does settle it you have hung the crepe on our future intimacy for good and all she will instruct your cook to put a spider in my dumpling or to do away with me by some characteristic sicilian method martel seemed puzzled by the americanism of this speech but norvin merely smiled and changed to italian do you really love her he asked of course since i was a boy so high i have known we would marry she adores me she is young she is beautiful she is rich in heavens name dont use that tone in speaking of her wealth you make me doubt you no no the count smiled it would be the same if she were a peasant girl we shall be so happy oh there is no expressing how happy we intend being ive no doubt and that makes it quite certain to end our comradeship you croak like a raven declared the sicilian what has soured you nothing i am a wise young man thats all you see happiness is allsufficient it needs nothing to complete itself it is a wall beyond which the owner does not care to wander so when you are quite happy with the new countess you will forget your friends of unmarried days would you then have me unhappily married by no means i am full of regrets at losing you nothing more it is plain then that you also must marry is there no admirable american lady any quantity of them but i dont care much for women except in an impersonal sort of way or perhaps i dont attract them i might enjoy falling in love if it were not such a tedious process it is not necessarily tedious one may love with the suddenness of an explosion i have done so many times i know you have but you are a sicilian we go about such things in a dignified and respectable manner love is a serious matter with us we dont explode yes when you love you marry and you marry in the same way you buy a farm but we have blood in our veins and lime in our bones i have loved many women to distraction there is only one whom i would marry ricardo entered at the moment and the count arose with a word of apology to his guest he spoke earnestly with his overseer but as they were separated from him by the full width of the great room blake overheard no more than a word now and then they were speaking in the sicilian dialect moreover which was unfamiliar to him yet he caught the mention of ippolito one of the men who had met him at the station also of an orangegrove and the word mafioso then he heard martel say the shells for the new rifle ippolito is a bad shot take plenty when ricardo had gone and the count had returned to his seat norvin fancied he detected once more that grave look he had surprised in his friends countenance upon their arrival at the castello what were you telling ricardo about rifles and cartridges he inquired eh it was nothing we are forced to guard our oranges there are thieves about i have been too long away from martinello later as norvin blake composed himself to sleep he wondered idly if martel had told him the whole truth he recalled again the faint grave lines that had gathered about the counts eyes where there had never been aught but wrinkles of merriment and he recalled also that word mafioso it conjured memories of certain tales he had heard of sicilian outlawry and brigandage and of that evil shadowy society of friends which he understood dominated this island there was a story about the old counts death also but martel had never told him much norvin tried to remember what it was but sleep was heavy upon him and he soon gave up ii a confession and a promise norvin blake slept soundly as befitted a healthy young man with less than the usual number of cares upon his mind and notwithstanding the fact that he had retired at a late hour somewhat worn by his journey he awoke earlier than usual still lacking an adequate idea of his surroundings he arose and flinging back the blinds of his window looked out upon a scene which set him to dressing eagerly the big front door of the hall below was barred when he came down and only yielded to his efforts with a clanging which would have awakened any one except martel letting him out upon a wellkept terrace beneath which the hills fell away in majestic sweeps and curves to the coastline far beneath it was a true sicilian morning filled with a dazzling glory of color and although it was not early from a countrymans point of view the dewy freshness had not entirely faded and rosy tints still lingered in the valleys and against the calabrian coast in the distance an odor of myrtle and jessamine came from a garden beneath the outer terrace wall and on either side of the manor rose wooded hills the lower slopes of which were laid out in vineyards and groves of citrus fruits having in full measure the normal mans unaffected appreciation of nature blake found himself wondering how martel could ever leave this spot for the artificialities of paris the count was amply able to live where he chose and it was no love for art which had kept him in france these many years on the contrary they had both recognized the mediocrity of his talent and had often joked about it it was perhaps no more than a youthful restlessness and craving for excitement he concluded knowing that his luxurious host would not be stirring for another hour he set out to explore the place at his leisure and in time came around to the stables and outhouses it is not the front of any residence which shows its real character any more than a womans true nature is displayed by her sunday attire norvin made friends with a surly stiffhaired dog then with a patriarchal old goat which he found grazing atop a wall and at last he encountered francesca bearing a bundle of fagots upon her head she was in a bad temper it appeared for in answer to his cheerful greeting she began to revile the names of ippolito and michele lazy pigs she cried fiercely is it not sufficient that old francesca should bare her bones and become a shadow with the cares of the household is it not sufficient that she performs the labor of twenty in caring for the padrone no is it not the devils task to prepare the many outlandish delicacies he learned to eat in his travels yes ha what of that she must also perform the duties of an ass and bear wood for the fires and what think you those two young giants are doing all the day sleeping sior up all night asleep all day a fine business and francesca with a broken back ill carry your wood he offered at which the mountainous old woman stared at him as if she did not in the least comprehend his words although her burden was enough to tax a mans strength she balanced it easily upon her head and made no move to go and the others may they all be blinded attilio gaspare roberto the hangman will get them surely briganti indeed she snorted like a horse may belisario cardi roast them over these very fagots slowly she moved her head from side to side while the bundle swayed precariously it is a bad business sior the padrone is mad to resist you may tell him he is quite mad mark me ricardo knows that no good will come of it but he is like a bull when he is angry he lowers his head and sees blood veramente it is a bad business and we shall all lose our ears she moved off majestically her eyes rolling in her fat cheeks her lips moving leaving the american to speculate as to what her evil prediction had to do with ippolito and the firewood he was still smiling at her anger when ippolito himself astride a horse came clattering into the courtyard and dismounted stiffly giving him a good morning with a wide yawn corpo di baccho exclaimed the rider i shall sleep for a century he stretched luxuriously and unslinging a gun from his shoulder leaned it against the wall blake was surprised to find it a late model of an american repeating rifle francesca he called loudly madonna mia i am famished francesca was here a moment ago norvin volunteered in a frightful temper too just so it was the wood i presume he scowled one cannot be in ten places unless he is in ten pieces i am glad to be here and not here and there well she wants you roasted by some fellow named cardi eh what ippolito started jerking the horses head by the bridle rein through which he had thrust his arm what is this belisario cardi i believe she said i dont know him the sicilian muttered an oath and disappeared into the stable he was still scowling when he emerged prompted by a feeling that he was close to something mysterious blake tried to sound the fellow you are abroad early he suggested but ippolito seemed in no mood for conversation and merely replied si signore quite early he was a lean swarthy youth squarejawed and well put up although his clothes were poor he wore them with a certain grace and moved like a man who is sure of himself did you see any robbers robbers ippolitos look was one of quick suspicion who has ever seen a robber come come i heard the count and ricardo talking you have been away among the orangegroves all night am i right you are right tell me is it common thieves or outlaws whom you watch i have heard about your brigands ippolito came the harsh voice of ricardo who at that moment appeared around the corner of the stable in the kitchen you will find food ippolito bowed to the american and departed his rifle beneath his arm blake turned his attention to the overseer for his mind once filled with an idea was not easily satisfied but ricardo would give him no information he raised his bushy gray eyebrows at the americans question brigands ippolito is a great liar seeing the angry sparkle in the old fellows eyes norvin hastened to say he told me nothing i assure you thieves yes we have ladri here as elsewhere sometimes it is well to take precautions but francesca was quite excited and i heard you and martel mention la mafia last night blake persisted i see you all go armed i am naturally curious i thought you might be in trouble with the society childrens tales said ricardo gruffly there is no society of la mafia oh see here we have it even in my own country the new orleans papers have been full of stories about the mala vita the mafia or whatever you choose to call it there is a big italian population there you know and they are causing our police a great deal of worry i live in louisiana so i ought to know we understand its an offshoot of the sicilian mafia in naples i hear there is a camorra but this is sicily we have no societies nevertheless i heard you say something about mafioso last night blake insisted perhaps grudgingly admitted the overseer but la mafia is not a man not a society as you say it is he made a wide gesture it is all sicily you do not understand no i do not very well one does not speak of it would the signore care to see the horses thank you yes the two went into the stables together and blake for the time gave up the hope of learning anything further about sicilian brigandage nor did martel show any willingness to enlighten him when he tentatively introduced the subject at breakfast but laughingly turned the conversation into another channel today you shall see the star of my life he declared be prepared to worship as all men do assuredly and promise you will not fall in love is that why you discouraged my coming until a week before your wedding really if she is all you claim we might have been such delightful enemies enemies are never that said the count gravely i know men in my country who cherish their enemies like friends they seem to enjoy them tremendously until one or the other has passed on to glory even then they are highly spoken of i am impatient for you to see her she of course has many preparations to make for the weddingday is almost here but it is arranged that we are to dine there tonight with her and her aunt the donna teresa ah norvin mine seven days separate me from paradise you can judge of my ecstasy the hours creep the moments are leaden each night when i retire i feel faithless in allowing sleep to rob my thoughts of her when i awake it is with the consolation that more of those miserable hours have crept away i am like a man insane i am beginning to think you really are so diamine wait you have not seen her we are to be married by a bishop no doubt that will insure your happiness a marriage like this does not occur every day it will be an event i tell you and youre sure i wont be in the way this evening no no it is arranged she is waiting expecting you she knows you already this morning however you will amuse yourself will you not for i must ride down to san sebastiano and meet the colonel of carabinieri from messina certainly dont mind me martel hesitated an instant then explained it is a matter of business one of my farmhands is in prison indeed what for oh it is nothing he killed a fellow last week jove what a peaceful pastoral place you have here i arrive to be met by an armed guard i hear talk of mafiosi men ride out at night with rifles and old women predict unspeakable evil what is all the mystery nonsense there is no mystery do you think i would drag you my best friend into danger savignos lips were smiling but he awaited an answer with some restraint that would not be quite the quite a nice thing to do would it so thats it now i know you have something on your mind and it must be of considerable importance or you would have told me before this you are right the count suddenly declared although i hoped you would not discover it i might have known but i suppose it is better to make a clean breast of it now i have enemies my friend and i assure you i do not cherish them the countess margherita is a famous beauty eh well it is not remarkable that you should have rivals no no this has nothing to do with her unless our approaching marriage has roused them to make a demonstration have you ever heard of belisario cardi not until this morning who is he i would give much to know if you had asked me a month ago i would have said he is an imaginary character used to frighten people a modern fra diavolo a mere name with which to inspire terror for nobody has ever seen him now however he seems real enough and i learn that the carabinieri believe in his existence martel pushed back the breakfast dishes and leaning his elbows upon the table continued after a pause to you sicily is all beauty and peace and fragrance she is old and therefore civilized so you think everything you have seen so far is reasonably modern eh he showed his white teeth as blake assured him its the most peaceful restful spot i ever saw you see nothing but the surface sicily is much what she was in my grandfathers time you have inquired about la mafia well there is such a thing it killed my father it forced me to give up my home and be an exile at norvins exclamation of astonishment he nodded theres a long story behind it which you could not appreciate without knowing my father and the character of our sicilian people for after all sicilian character constitutes la mafia it is no sect no cult no secret body of assassins highwaymen and robbers as you foreigners imagine it is a national hatred of authority an individual expression of superiority to the law in our own new orleans we are beginning to talk of the mafia but with us it is a mysterious organization of italian criminals we treat it as somewhat of a joke be not so sure some day it may dominate your american cities as it does all sicily still i dont understand you say it is an organization and yet it is not it terrorizes a whole island and yet you say it is no more than your national character it must have a head it must have arms it has no head or rather it has many heads it is not a band it is the sicilian intolerance of restraint the individuals sense of superiority to moral social and political law it is the freemasonry that results from this common resistance to authority it is an idea not an institution it is sicilys curse and that which makes her impossible of government i do not mean to deny that we have outlawry and brigandage they are merely the most violent demonstrations of la mafia it afflicts the cities it is a tyranny in the country districts la mafia taxes us with blackmail it saddles us with a great force of carabinieri it gives food and drink and life to men like belisario cardi every landholder every man of property contributes to its support you still do not understand but you will as i go along as an instance of its workings all fruitgrowers hereabouts are obliged to maintain watchmen in addition to their regular employees otherwise their groves will be robbed these guards are mafiosi let us say that one of us opposes this monopoly what happens he loses his crop in a night his trees are cut down should he appeal to the law for protection he is regarded as a weakling a man of no spirit this is but one small example of the workings of la mafia as a matter of fact it permeates the political the business and the social life of the whole island knowing the impotence of the law to protect any one peaceable citizens shield the criminals they perjure themselves to acquit a mafioso rather than testify against him and thus incur the certainty of some fearful vengeance should the farmer persist in his independence something ends his life as in my fathers case the whole country is terrorized by a conspiracy of a few bold and masterful men it is unbearable there are of course capimafia leaders whose commands are enforced but there is no single wellorganized society it is a great interlocking system built upon patronage friendship and the peculiar sicilian character now i think i begin to understand my father was not strong enough to throw off the yoke and it meant his death i was too young to take his place but now that i am a man i intend to play a mans part and i have served notice it means a battle but i shall win to martels hasty and very incomplete sketch of the hidden influences of sicilian life blake listened with the greatest interest noting the grave determination that had settled upon his friend yet he could scarcely bring himself to accept an explanation that seemed so farfetched the whole theory of the mafia struck him as grotesque and theatrical and one man has already been killed you say he asked yes i discharged all the watchmen whom i knew to be mafiosi it caused a commotion i can tell you and no little uneasiness among the country people who love me even if to them i have been a more or less imaginary person since my fathers death naturally they warned me to desist in this mad policy of independence a week ago one of my campieri paolo he who is now in prison surprised a fellow hacking down my orangetrees and shot him the miscreant proved to be a certain galli whom i had discharged he left a family i regret to say but his reputation was bad notwithstanding all this paolo is still in prison despite my utmost efforts the machinery of the mafia is in motion they will perjure witnesses they will spend money in any quantity to convict my poor paolo heaven knows what the result will be and where does this bogeyman enter this belisario cardi i have had a letter from him really it is in the hands of the carabinieri hence this journey of my friend colonel neri from messina what did the letter say it demanded a great sum of money with my life as the penalty for refusal it was signed by cardi there was no mistaking the name if it had been from narcone for instance i would have paid no attention to it for he is no more than a cattlethief but belisario cardi my boy you dont appreciate the significance of that name i should not care to fall into his hands i assure you and have my feet roasted over a slow fire good heavens norvin cried rising abruptly from his chair you dont really mean hes that sort as a matter of fact the count reassured his guest i dont believe in his existence at all it is merely a name to be used upon occasion but as for the punishment that is perhaps the least i might expect if i were so unfortunate as to be captured why this cant be do you realize that this is the year such things are not possible any longer in your fathers time yes all things are possible in sicily smiled savigno we are a century behind the times but caro mio i did wrong to tell you no no i shall come to no harm believe me i am known to be young rich and my marriage is but a few days off what more natural therefore than for some mafioso to try to frighten me and profit by the dreaded name of cardi i am a stranger here in my own birthplace when i become better known there will be no more feeble attempts at blackmail other landholders have maintained their independence and i shall do the same for an enemy who fears to fight openly is a coward and i am in the right i am glad i came i shall be glad too when you are married and safely off on your wedding journey i feared to tell you all this lest you should think i had no right to bring you here at such a time dont be an utter idiot martel you are an american you have your own way of looking at things of course if anything should happen if illfortune should overtake me before the marriage see here if there is the slightest danger the faintest possibility you ought to go away as you did before norvin declared positively i am no longer a child i am to be married a week hence wild horses could not drag me away you could postpone it explain it to the countess there is no necessity there is no cause for alarm even all the same i feel much easier with you here margherita has relatives to be sure but they are well i have no confidence in them in the remote possibility that the worst should come you could look out for her and i am sure you would am i right of course you are and now let us think of something pleasanter we wont talk of it any more eh im perfectly willing to let it drop you know i would do anything for you or yours so we neednt discuss that point any further good martel rose and with his customary display of affection flung an arm about his friends shoulders and now ricardo is waiting to go to san sebastiano so you must amuse yourself for an hour or two i have had the billiardtable recovered and the cushions are fairly good you will find books in the library perhaps a portfolio of my earlier drawings billiards exclaimed the american fervently whereupon the count laughed till i return then a riverderci he seized his hat and strode out of the room iii the golden girl shortly after the heat of the day had begun to subside the two friends set out for terranova ricardo accompanied them it seemed he went everywhere with martel following at a distance which allowed the young men freedom to talk his watchful eyes scanning the roadside as if even in the light of day he feared some lurking danger the prospect of seeing his fiancee acted like wine upon savigno and from his exuberant spirits it was evident that he had completely forgotten his serious talk at the breakfast table his disposition was mercurial and if he had ever known real forebodings they were forgotten now it was a splendid ride along a road which wound in serpentine twinings high above the sea now breasting ridges bare of all save rock and spurge and now dipping into valleys shaded by flowering trees and cloyed with the scent of blooms it meandered past farms in haphazard fashion past vineyards and gardens and groves of mandarin lime and lemon finally toiling up over a bold chestnutstudded shoulder of the range where blake drew in to enjoy the scene a faint haze impalpable as the memory of dreams lay over the land the sea was azure the mountains faintly purple a gleam of white far below showed terranova and when the american had voiced his appreciation the three horsemen plunged downward leaving a rolling cloud of yellow dust behind them the road from here on led through a wild and somewhat forbidding country broken by ravines and watercourses and quite densely wooded with thickets which swept upward into the interior as far as the eye could reach but in the neighborhood of terranova the land blossomed and flowered again as on the other side of the mountains leaving the main road by a driveway the three horsemen swung through spacious grounds and into a courtyard behind the house where an old man came shuffling slowly forward his wrinkled face puckered into a smile of welcome ha aliandro cried the count what do i see the rheumatism is gone at last grazie dio aliandros loose lips parted over his toothless gums and he mumbled illustrissimo the accursed affliction is worse impossible then why these capers my dear aliandro you are shamming why you came leaping like a goat as god is my judge carino i can sleep only in the sun it is like the tortures of the devil and my bones creak like a gate and yet each day i declare to myself aliandro that rascal is growing younger as the hours go by it is well we are not rivals in love or i should be forced to hate him the old man chuckled and beamed upon savigno who proceeded to make norvin known aliandros face had once been long and pointed but with the loss of teeth and the other mysterious shrinkages of time it had shortened until in repose the chin and the nose seemed to meet like the points of calipers when he moved his jaws his whole countenance lengthened magically as if made of some substance more elastic than flesh it stretched and shortened rapidly now in the most extraordinary fashion for the count had a knack of pleasing people and where are the ladies savigno inquired aliandro cocked a watery eye at the heavens and replied they will be upon the loggiato at this hour illustrissimo the donna teresa will have a book he squinted respectfully at a small note which martel handed him then inquired do you wish change not at all it is yours for your courtesy grazie grazie a million thanks the old fellow made off with surprising agility what a sham he is the count laughed as he and norvin walked on around the house he will do no labor and yet the contessa supports him in idleness there is a mafioso for you he has been a brigand a robber he is to this day as you see margherita has an army of such people who impose upon her every time i am here i tip him every time he receives it with the same words although the countryseat of the ginini was known as a castello it was more in the nature of a comfortable and pretentious villa it had dignity however and drowsed upon a commanding eminence fronted by a splendid terraced lawn which one beheld through clumps of flowering shrubs and welltended trees here and there among the foliage gleamed statuary and the musical purl of a fountain fell upon the ear as the young men mounted to the loggiato or covered gallery a delicate whitehaired italian lady arose and came to meet them ah martel my dear boy we have been expecting you she cried it was the donna teresa fazello and she turned a sweet face upon mattels friend bidding him welcome to terranova with charming courtesy she was still exchanging with him the pleasantries customary upon first meetings when he heard the count exclaim softly and looking up saw him bowing low over a girls hands her back was half turned toward norvin but although he had not seen her features clearly he felt a great surprise his preconceived notion of her had been all wrong it seemed for she was not dark on the contrary she was as tawny as a lioness her hair of which there was an abundance was not the ordinary saxon yellow but iridescent as if burned by the fierce heat of a tropical sun the neck and cheeks were likewise golden or was it the light from her splendid crown he was still staring at her when she turned and came forward to give him her hand thus allowing her full glory to flash upon him welcome she said in a voice as lowpitched as a cello string and her lover watching eagerly for some sign from his friend smiled delightedly at the emotion he saw leap up in norvins face that young man was quite unconscious of martels espionage unconscious of everything in fact save the splendid creature who stood smiling at him as if she had known him all her days his first impression that she was all golden all gleaming like a flame did not leave him for the same warm tints that were in her hair were likewise present in her cheeks her neck her hands it was like the hue which underlies old ivory her skin was clear and of unusual pallor yet it seemed to radiate warmth something rich and vivid in her voice also lent strength to the odd impression she had given him as if her very speech were gold made liquid except for the faintest tinge of olive her cheeks were colorless yet they spoke of perfect health and shone with that same pale effulgent glow like the reflection of a late sun her lips were richly red and as fresh as a halfopened flower affording the only contrast to that puzzling radiance her unusual effect was due as much perhaps to the color of her eyes as to her hair and skin for while they were really of a greenish hazel they held the fires of an opal in their depths they were oriental slumbrous meditative and the black pupils were of an exaggerated size her brows were dark and met above a finely chiseled nose all in all blake was quite taken aback for he had not been prepared for such a vision and a sort of panic robbed him of speech but when his halting tongue had done its duty and his eyes had turned once more to the aunt some irresistible power swept them back to the young womans face the more he observed her the more he was puzzled by that peculiar effect that glow which seemed to envelop her even her gown of some shimmering material lent its part to the illusion yellow was undeniably her color she seemed steeped in it he had to make a determined effort to recover his composure savigno fell quickly into a lovers rhapsody devouring the girl with ardent glances under which she thrilled and soon they began to chatter of the wedding preparations it was very good of you to come so long a way said the countess at last turning to the american for a second time martel has told us all about you and about your adventures together not all cried savigno lightly we have pasts i assure you martel tries so hard to impress us with his wickedness the aunt explained but we know him to be jesting perhaps you will confound him here before us i shall do nothing of the sort blake laughed who am i to rob him of a delightfully wicked past upon which he can pretend to look back in horror it is the only past he will ever have so why spoil it for him on the contrary i am prepared to lend a hand and to start him off with a list of damning disclosures which it will require years to live down pray begin urged the count with an air of intense satisfaction eh he hesitates then i shall begin for him in the first place margherita he openly declares that i covet your riches the countess joined in the laughter at this and norvin could only say i had not met you then signorina he was quite serious nevertheless and predicted that marriage would end our friendship arguing that supreme happiness is but another term for supreme selfishness at least i did not question the certainty of your happiness the girl spoke up gravely i dont agree with you signor blake i should hate to think it will make us selfish it seems to me that such love as we share will make us very good and sweet and generous when she spoke of love she hesitated and lowered her eyes until the quivering lashes swept her cheeks but no flush of embarrassment followed norvin realized that with all her reserve she could not blush had probably never blushed you shouldnt place the least dependence on the words of a mans best friend under such conditions he told her for he covers his chagrin at losing a comrade by a display of pessimism which he doesnt really feel norvin suddenly wished the countess would not allow her glance to linger upon him so long and searchingly it filled him with a most disturbing selfconsciousness he was relieved when the donna teresa engaged him in conversation and the lovers were occupied with each other it was some time later that the countess addressed her aunt excitedly listen what do you think of this zia mia the authorities will not admit poor paolo to bail and he is still in prison poor fellow cried the donna teresa it is la mafia perhaps it is better for him to remain where he is martel said he is at least safe for the time being here is something you may not know gallis wife is sister to gian narcone the outlaw then she will probably kill paolo said the countess margherita calmly blake exclaimed wonderingly i say this is worse than breathitt county kentucky you talk of murders and outlaws as we discuss the cotton crop or the bollweevil this is the most fatal country i ever saw it is a great pity that such things exist the donna teresa agreed but one grows accustomed to them in time it has been so ever since i was a child we do not seem to progress here in sicily now in italy it is much more civilized much more restful how hard it must be to do right said the countess musingly look at paolo for instance he kills a wretched thief quite innocently and yet the law holds him in prison it is necessary of course to be severe with robbers like this galli and his brotherinlaw who is an open outlaw and yet i suppose if i were that gallis wife i should demand blood to wash my blood she is only a wife you sympathize with her exclaimed martel in astonishment deeply i am not so sorry the man was killed but a wife has rights she will doubtless follow him do you believe in the vendetta norvin asked curiously who does not the law is full of tricks there is a saying which runs the gallows for the poor justice for the fool you are a mafiosa cried the scandalized aunt it is one of aliandros sayings he has lived a life he often tells me stories aliandro is a terrible liar martel declared i fear his adventures are much like his rheumatism you do not exact a reckoning from your enemies in america queried margherita oh we do but not with quite so much enthusiasm as you do blake answered her we arent ordinarily obliged to kill people in order to protect our property and wives dont go about threatening vengeance when their husbands meet with accidents the police take care of such things a fine country it must be so peaceful for old people ejaculated the aunt we have some outlaws to be sure like your notorious belisario cardi cardi is but a name said the girl he does not exist intercepting a warning glance from martel blake said no more and the talk drifted to more agreeable subjects but the count being possessed of a nervous temperament which called for constant motion could not long remain inactive and now having poured his extravagant devotion into his sweethearts ears he rose saying i must go to the village the baker the confectioner the butcher all have many things to prepare for the festa and i must order the fireworks from messina norvin will remain here while ricardo and i complete the arrangements i tell you it will be a celebration to awaken the countryside for an hour then addio he touched his lips to margheritas fingers and bowing to her aunt ran down the steps some gadfly stings him said the donna teresa fondly he is like a child he cannot remain seated he comes he goes like the wind there is no holding him so theres to be a festa blake observed with interest oh indeed it will be a great event it was mattels idea margherita arose and the young man followed see out there upon the terrace there will be dancing you have never seen a sicilian merrymaking you have never seen the tarantella then you will be interested on the night before the ceremony the people will come from the whole countryside there will be music games fireworks oh it will be a celebrazione my cousins from messina will be here the bishop many fine people i i am more excited than martel i can scarcely wait the girls face mirrored her emotion and her eyes were as deep as the sea she seemed for the moment very far away uplifted in contemplation of the great change so soon to occur in her life and norvin began to suspect her of a tremendous depth of feeling unknown even to herself she was smouldering unawakened fires were stirred by the consciousness of coming wifehood out here in the sun she was more tawny than ever and recalling the threat against her lover the young man fell to wondering how she would take misfortune if it ever came feeling his eyes upon her she met his gaze frankly with a smile what is it you have something to say he recovered himself with an effort no only you are so different from what i expected and you also she laughed you are much more agreeable i like you immensely and i want you to tell me all about yourself that was a wonderful afternoon for blake the sicilian girl took him into her confidence without the slightest restraint there was no period of getting acquainted it was as if they had known each other for a lifetime he never ceased marveling at her beauty and his ears grew ever more eager for her voice martel made no secret of his delight at their instantaneous liking for each other and the dinner that evening was the gayest that had brightened terranova for years inasmuch as the ride to san sebastiano was long the young men were forced to leave early but they were scarcely out of hearing before martel drew his horse in beside norvin and laying a hand upon his friends arm inquired breathlessly well come come brother of mine you know i perish of eagerness what have you to say the truth between man and man blake answered him with an odd hesitation you must know without asking theres nothing to say except that she she is like a golden flame she sets one afire she is different wonderful i i exactly savigno laughed with keenest contentment there is no other when blake retired that night it was not to sleep at once for he was troubled by a growing fear of himself that would not be lightly put aside iv the feast at terranova during the next few days norvin blake saw much of the countess margherita for every afternoon he and martel rode to terranova the preparations for the wedding neared completion and the consciousness of a coming celebration had penetrated the countryside among all who looked forward to the big event perhaps the one who watched the hours fly with the greatest degree of suspense was the american he had half faced the truth on that night after his first meeting with the girl and the succeeding days enforced the conviction he would have been glad to escape he could no longer doubt that he was in love madly infatuated with his best friends fiancee and the knowledge came like some crushing misfortune it could scarcely be called a love at first sight for he felt that he had always known and always loved this girl he had never believed in these sudden obsessions and more than once had been amused at martels ability to fall violently in love at a moments notice and to fall as quickly out again but in spite of his coolest reasoning and sternest selfreproach he found the spell too strong for him every decent instinct commanded him to uproot this passion every impetuous impulse burst into sudden flame and consumed his better sense his judgment and his loyalty leaving him shaken and doubtful although this was his first serious soul conflict he possessed more than average selfcontrol and he managed to conceal his feelings so well that martel who was the embodiment of loyalty and generosity never for a moment suspected the truth as for the girl she was too full of her own happiness to see anything amiss she took her lovers comrade into her heart with that odd unrestraint which characterized her and recognizing the bond which united the two young men she strove to widen it sufficiently to include herself it spoke well for her that she felt no jealousy of that love which a man bears for his lifes best friend but rather strove to encourage it her intense desire to be a part of her lover and share all his affections led her to strive earnestly for a third place in the union with the result that blake saw even more of her than did savigno she deliberately set herself the task of winning the american a task already more than accomplished had she but known it and although for some women such a course would have been neither easy nor safe with her a misconception of motive was impossible she had an ardent almost reckless manner of attacking problems she was as intense and yet as changeful as a flame blake watched her varying moods with the same fascination with which one regards a windblown blaze recognizing even in her moments of repression that she was ready to burst forth anew at the slightest breath she was the sort of woman to dominate men to inspire them with tremendous enthusiasm for good or for evil as they chanced to lean toward the one or the other while she seemed wholly admirable she exercised a damnable effect upon norvin he was tortured by a thousand devils he was possessed by dreams and fancies hitherto strange and unrecognized the nervous strain began to tell in time he slept little he grew weary of the struggle things became unreal and distorted he longed to end it all by fleeing from sicily and had there been more time he would have arranged for a summons to america his mother had not been well for a long time and he was tempted to use this fact as an excuse for immediate departure but the thought that martel needed him acted as an effective restraint the vague menace of la mafia still hung over the count and was not lessened by the receipt of a second threatening letter a few days after blakes arrival cardi wrote again demanding instant compliance with the terms contained in his first communication savigno was directed to send ricardo ferara at a given hour to a certain crossroads above san sebastiano with ten thousand lire in that case candles would be burned and masses said for the soul of the murdered galli so the writer promised the letter put no penalty upon a failure to comply with these demands beyond a vague prediction of evil it was short and businesslike and very much to the point as this was the first document of the kind norvin had ever seen he was greatly interested in it dont you think it may be the work of this fellow narcone he inquired i understand he is the brotherinlaw of galli narcone would scarcely undertake so bold a piece of blackmail the count declared i knew him slightly before he gave himself to the campagna he was a butcher he was brutal and domineering but he was a coward it is not from narcone ricardo pronounced positively they had called in the overseer for the discussion he is grossolano he can neither read nor write this letter is well spelled and well written then you think it is really from cardi ricardo shrugged his square shoulders who knows some say there is no such person others declare he went to america years ago what is your belief i know a man who has seen him who aliandro bah aliandro is such a liar exclaimed savigno however that may be he has seen things in his time he says that cardi is not what people suppose him to be a brigand except when it suits his desires that is why he comes and goes and the carabinieri can never trace him that is why he is at home in all parts of sicily that is why he uses men like narcone when he chooses it would please me to capture the wretch said martel lets try it norvin suggested and accordingly a trap was laid four carabinieri were sent to the appointed place ahead of time with directions to conceal themselves and ferara carried out his part of the programme but no one came to meet him he encountered no one coming or going to the crossroads and returned greatly disgusted however at his suggestion colonel neri stationed the four soldier policemen at the castello to prevent any demonstration and to profit by any development which might occur the young men did not permit this diversion to interrupt their daily trips to terranova although as a matter of precaution they added ippolito to their party he was delighted at the change of duty because as norvin discovered it brought him to the side of lucrezia ferara thus it happened that martel had reason to regret the choice of his bodyguard for on the very first visit ippolito began to strut and swagger before the girl and allowed the secret to escape him whereupon it was carried to the countess she appealed to martel to leave san sebastiano for the time being to postpone the wedding or at least to go to messina for it but of course he refused and tried to laugh down her misgivings and of course she appealed privately to blake for assistance you must use your influence to change his mind she said earnestly he declares he will not be overawed by these ruffians he says that to pay them the least attention would be to encourage them to another attempt when we return but he does not know the mafia as i know it you will do this for me of course if you wish it although i agree with martel and im sure he wont listen to me he cant play the coward the wedding is only two days off now why tomorrow is the galaday how could he notify the whole district when all his preparations have been completed what excuse could he give without confessing his fear and making himself liable to a later and stronger attack the country people need not know anything about it let them come and make merry he can leave now tonight we will join him at messina norvin shook his head ill do what i can since you wish it but im sure he wont consent to any change of plan im sure also that you are needlessly troubled perhaps she acknowledged doubtfully and yet martels father yes yes but conditions are not what they were fifteen years ago this is merely a blackmailing scheme and if he ignores it hell probably never hear of it again on the other hand if he allows it to drive him away it will be repeated upon his return she searched his face with her eyes and his wits reeled at her earnest gaze he was conscious of a single wild desire that such anxiety might be for him how gladly he would yield to her wishes how gladly he would yield to any wish of hers he was a foreigner he hated this island and its people for the most part and yet if he stood in martels place he would willingly change his life to correspond with hers he would become sicilian in body and soul she had the power to dissolve his habits his likes and dislikes and reconstruct him through and through i hope you are right she said at last and yet it is said that no one escapes the mafia this isnt the mafia it is the work of some brigand what is the difference the one merges into the other blood has been spilled the forces are at work suddenly she seized him by the arm and her eyes blazed look you she cried if martel should be injured if these men should dare all sicily would not hold them no power could save them no hidingplace could be so secret no lies so cunning that i would not know you understand blake saw that the girl was at last aroused to that intensity of feeling which he had recognized as latent in her love had caused her to glow but it had required this breath of fear to fan the fire into full strength he was deeply moved and answered simply i understand i never knew how much you loved him her humor changed and she smiled one is foolish perhaps to be so frank but that is my nature you would not have me change it you couldnt if you tried martel has always known i loved him i could never conceal it i never wished to if he had not seen it i would have told him just now when i heard he was threatened well you see ippolito had no business to mention the matter i suppose his tongue ran away with him tongues have a way of doing such things when their owners are in love he is not for lucrezia why hes a fine fellow oh but lucrezia is superior i have taught her a great many things she is more like a sister to me than a servant and i could not see her married to a farmhand she can do much better than to marry ippolito love goes where it pleases said the american with so much feeling that margheritas eyes leaped to his you know ah my good friend then you have loved he nodded i have i do she was instantly all eagerness and beamed upon him with a frank delight that stabbed him martel does he know no you see theres no use no possibility im sorry there must be some great mistake i cannot conceive of so sad a thing please dont try he exclaimed panicstricken at thought of the dangerous ground he was treading and miserably afraid she would guess the truth in spite of him i should think any woman might love you she said critically after a moments meditation you are good and brave and true most discerning of women he cried with an elaborate bow those are but a few of my admirable traits he was relieved to see that she had no suspicion of his feelings for she was extremely quick of wit and her intuition was keen no doubt her failure to read him was due to her absorption in her own affairs he had arrived at a better knowledge of her capabilities today and began to realize that she was as changeable as a chameleon one moment she could be like the sirocco in warmth and languor the next as sparkling as the sunlit ocean again she could be steeped in a dreamy abstraction or alive with a pagan joy of life she might have been sixteen or thirty as her mood chanced to affect her of all the crossed strains that go to make up the sicilian race she had inherited more of the oriental than the greek or roman somewhere back in the ginini family there was saracen blood he felt sure blake was as good as his word and made her wishes known to martel who laughingly accused him of a lack of faith in his own arguments the count was bubbling with spirits at the immediate nearness of his nuptials and declined to consider anything which might interfere with them he joyfully told blake that the tickets were already bought and all arrangements made to leave for messina immediately after the ceremony which would take place in the church at terranova they would catch the boat for naples on the evening after the wedding he explained and blake was to accompany them at least that far on his way to america meanwhile he had no intention of foregoing the pleasure of tomorrows celebration even if belisario cardi himself should appear to dispute his coming it was the first the last and the only time he intended marrying and he had promised himself to enjoy the occasion to the utmost despite those letters which after all were not to be taken seriously so the matter was allowed to stand the country people had begun to assemble when martel and his friend arrived at the ginini manor on the following afternoon and the grounds were filling with gaily dressed peasants the train from messina had brought margheritas relatives and the bishop had sent word that he would arrive in ample time for the ceremony on the next morning the contadini were coming in afoot astride of donkeys and mules or in gaily painted carts pictured with the miracles of the saints and the conquests of the moors there were darkhaired men and women wildhaired boys with roses above their ears girls with huge earrings and fringed shawls which swept the ground as they walked as yet they had not entirely lost their restraint but martel went among them with friendly handclasps and exuberant greetings renewing old acquaintances and welcoming new until at last their shyness disappeared and they began to laugh and chatter unaffectedly savigno had traveled he told them he had arranged many surprises for his friends there would be games dances music and a wonderful entertainment in the big striped tent yonder supplied by a troupe of players which he had brought all the way from palermo as for the feast well the tables were already stretched under the trees as they could see and if any one wished to tantalize his nostrils just let him wander past the kitchen in the rear where a dozen women had been at work since dawn but that was not all there would be gifts for the children and prizes for the best dancers the handsomest woman would receive a magnificent shawl the like of which had never been dreamed of in terranova and then to prevent jealousy the others would receive presents also but he would not say too much let them wait and see finally there would be fireworks enough to satisfy every one and all he asked of them was that they drink the health of the countess margherita and wish her lifelong happiness it was to be a memorable occasion he hoped and if they did not enjoy themselves as never before then he and his bride would feel that their wedding had been a great a colossal failure but it seemed as night approached that martel had no reason to doubt the quality of his entertainment for the guests gave themselves up to joy as only southerners can forgetting poverty hardship and all the grinding cares of their barren lives they yielded quickly to the passion of the festa and blake began to see sicily for the first time he would have liked to enter into their merrymaking but felt himself too much a stranger the feast was elaborate no ristorante could have equaled it no one but a spendthrift lover like martel would have furnished it but it was not until darkness came and the trees began to twinkle and glow with their myriad lights that the fun reached its highest pitch then there was true sicilian dancing true sicilian joking lovemaking eyes were bright cheeks were flushed lips were parted and the halls of terranova echoed to a bacchanalian tumult there had been an elaborate supper inside also to which the more prominent townspeople had been invited and from which norvin blake was only too eager to escape as it drew to an end the strain to which he had been subjected for the past week was growing unbearable and the sight of margherita ginini clad like a vision in some elaborate parisian gown so intensified his distress that he was glad to slip away into the open air at the first opportunity he found ricardo leaning against the bole of a eucalyptustree observing the throng with watchful eyes why arent you making merry blake inquired the overseer shrugged his shoulders replying somberly i am waiting for what who knows there are strangers here you mean blakes manner changed quickly there may be enemies if cardi is in the mountains behind martinello may he not be here at terranova i am looking for a thick black man aliandro has described him cardi would scarcely come to a wedding feast said blake with a certain feeling of uneasiness scarcely the overseer agreed have you seen anything nothing where is ippolito ricardo grunted asleep in the stable the imbecile is drunk to the american these sicilian people looked very much alike they were all a bit fantastic and the scene reminded him of a fancydress ball where all the men represented brigands many of them were or seemed to be of truculent countenance some wore piratical earrings others had shawls wrapped about their heads as if for concealment any one of them might have been a brigand for all he knew and he saw how easy it would be for a handful of evilintentioned persons to mingle unobserved with such a throng yet his better sense told him that he was silly to imagine such things he had allowed old womens tales to upset his nerves a halfhour later as he was watching the crowd from the loggiato margherita appeared and he thought for a moment that she too might feel some vague foreboding but her first words reassured him my good friend i missed you she said but i had no chance of leaving until this moment coming close to him she inquired has something gone amiss you have seemed sad all this evening i do not know but i fear your heart is heavy he answered unsteadily perhaps it is i dont know it is that certain woman i dare say im a great fool you know dont say that this is perhaps the only chance i shall have of seeing you alone im glad he broke out in a tone that startled her glad for you i have tried not to be a deathshead at your feast but it has been a struggle we women see things martel boy that he is does not suspect and yet i who have known you so short a time have read your secret it is our happiness which makes you sad no no im not that sort i share your happiness i want it to continue if i had one wish it would be that she might care for you as i care for martel and who knows perhaps she may you say it is impossible yet life is full of blind ways and unseen turnings somehow i feel that she will you are very good he managed to say then yielding to a sudden impulse he took her hand and kissed it a moment later she left him but the touch of her cool flesh against his lips remained an unforgetable impression savigno appeared yawning prodigiously dio he exclaimed with a grimace those cousins of hers are deadly dull i do not blame you for escaping and the judge and the notarys wife and that village doctor colonel neri is a good chap notwithstanding his mustache in which he takes so much pride he nurses it like a child and yet it is older than i poor friend of mine you are a martyr thus to endure for me its tremendously interesting particularly this part out here norvin asserted i saw them dancing what i took to be the tarantella a moment ago those peasant boys are like leaping fauns yes and they will continue to dance for hours yet i fear the donna teresa will not retire at her usual hour what a day it has been it is fine to give people happiness that is one of my new discoveries remember tomorrow believe me i think of nothing else that is why we must be going soon we cannot wait even for the fireworks as much as i would like to it is a long road to martinello and we must be up early in the morning you do not object on the contrary i was about to bear you off in spite of yourself then i will have ippolito fetch the horses ippolito has been demonstrating the mastery of wine over matter he is asleep in the manger drunk oh the idiot he has the appetite of a shark but the belly of a herring i ought to warm his soles with a cane declared savigno angrily dont be too hard on him i suspect lucrezia would not listen to his suit poor chap hes sick from unrequited passion very well we will leave him to sleep it off i couldnt be harsh with him at this time and now we had best begin presenting our goodnights although i hate to go v what waited at the roadside to avoid the dampening effect of an early departure the three men rode out quietly from the courtyard at the rear of the house leaving the merrymakers to their fun so this is our last ride together norvin said as they left the valley and began the long ascent of the mountain that lay between them and martinello yes henceforth we spare our horses you see tomorrow we will take the morning train half of san sebastiano will accompany us too and everybody will be dressed in his finest ricardo here for instance will wear his new brown suit a glorious affair eh ricardo it would be as well to refrain from speaking said the overseer gruffly the road is dark who knows what may be waiting nonsense be not always a bear we are three armed men i fancy narcone nay even our dreadful cardi himself would scarcely dare molest us ferara merely grunted and continued to hold his place abreast of his employer norvin observed that he carried his rifle across his saddlebow and involuntarily shifted the strap of his own weapon so that it might be ready in case of an emergency he had rebelled somewhat at carrying a firearm but martel after making a clean breast of his troubles that first morning had insisted and the american had yielded even though he felt ridiculous the sky was moonless tonight but crowded with stars which gave light enough so that the riders were able to follow the road without difficulty although the shadows on either side were dense the air was sweet and so still that the sounds of revelry from terranova were plainly audible strains of music floated up the hillside the shouts of the master of ceremonies came distinctly as he issued his commands for a country dance the many lights within the grounds shone cloudily among the treetops far below like the effulgence from some welllit city hidden behind a hill now disappearing for a time now shining out again as the road pursued its meanderings the hurried footfalls of the horses thudded steadily in the soft dust the saddles creaked with that music which lulls a horseman like a song youth youth what a glorious thing it is exclaimed martel after a fruitless attempt to hold his tongue ricardo would have us go prowling like robbers when our hearts are singing loud enough for all the mountainside to hear there is no evil in the world tonight for the world is in love tomorrow it bursts into happiness and i am king over it all i shall be glad to be rid of you just the same grumbled the old man ricardo alone has fears but he was never young think you that the gods would permit my weddingday to be marred bah one can see evil before it comes it casts a shadow it has a chilling breath which any one with sensibilities can feel as for me i see the future as clearly as if it were spread out before me in the sunshine and there is no misfortune in it anywhere i cannot conceive of misfortune with all this gladness and expectancy inside me they have begun the fireworks said blake its too bad you couldnt stay to see them martel he turned in his saddle and the others reined in as a rocket soared into the night sky and burst with a shower of sparks others followed and a detonation sounded faintly poor people said the count gently i can hear them crying oh ah beautiful it is an angel from heaven on the contrary ill warrant theyre exclaiming it is that angel from san sebastiano you have given them a great night the count laughed yes they will have much to talk and dream about their lives are very barren you know and i hope the countess and i will be able to make them brighter as the years go by oh i have plans caro mio so many plans i scarcely know where to begin or how to talk about them i could never be an artist no matter how furiously i painted no matter how many beautiful women i drew but i can paint smiles upon the faces of those sad women down yonder i can bring happiness into their lives and that will be a picture to look back upon eh dont you think so when they learn to know me when they learn to love and trust me there will be brighter days at terranova and at san sebastiano they love you now i am sure i am too much a stranger yet i have neglected my duties but well in my travels i have learned some things that will be of benefit to us all i see so much to do it is delightful to be young and full of hopes and to have the means of realizing them above all it is delicious to know that there is one who will share those ambitions and efforts with you i see ricardo is disgusted with me but he is a pessimist he does not believe in charity and love what foolish talk protested the old man with heat do i not love my girl lucrezia do i not love you the countess and and perhaps a few others martel laughed i was merely teasing you they resumed their journey leaving the showering meteors behind them and the count in the lightness of his heart began humming a tune as for blake he rode as silently as ferara being lost in contemplation of a happiness in which he had no part not until this moment had he realized how entirely unnecessary he was to the existence of martel and margherita he longed to remain a part of them but saw that his desire was vain they were complete without him their lives would be full he began to feel like a stranger already it was a new sensation for he had always seemed to be a factor in the lives of those about him but martel had changed with the advent of new interests and ambitions sicily too was different from any land he knew and even margherita ginini was hard to understand she seemed to be the spirit of sicily made flesh and blood he wondered if the very fact that she was so unusual might not help him to forget her once he was away from her influence he hoped so for this last week had been the most painful period of his life he had come south somewhat against his will for a kaleidoscopic glimpse of europe never dreaming that he would carry back to america anything more than the usual flitting memories of a pleasant trip but instead he was destined to take with him a single vivid picture he argued that he was merely infatuated with the girl carried away by the allurement of a new and remarkable type of woman and that these headlong passions were neither healthy nor lasting but his reasoning brought him no real sense of conviction and his life as he looked forward to it appeared singularly flat and stale his one consolation poor as it seemed lay in the fact that he had played the man to the best of his ability and was really glad even if a bit envious of martels goodfortune he let his thoughts run free in this manner sitting his horse listlessly for he was tired mentally and physically watching the gray road idly as it slipped past beneath the muffled hoofs and lulled by savignos musical humming it was while he was still in this halfsomnolent semidetached frame of mind that he rode into a sudden whitehot whirl of events norvin blake was never clear in his mind regarding the precise sequence of the action that followed for he was snatched too quickly from his mental relaxation to retain any welldefined impressions he recalled vaguely that the road lay like a mysterious canon walled in with darkness and that his thoughts were miles away when his horse shied without warning nearly unseating him and bringing him back to a sense of his surroundings with a shock simultaneously he heard a cry from ricardo it was a scream of agony cutting through savignos song like a saber stroke for a moment blakes heart seemed to stop then began pounding crazily a stream of fire leaped out at his left side splitting the quiet night with a detonation the wood which had lain so silent and deserted an instant before was lit by answering flashes the blackness at an armslength on every side was stabbed by wicked tongues of flame and the road swarmed with grotesque bodies leaping and tumbling and fighting blakes horse reared as something black rose up beneath its forefeet and snatched at its bridle martels steed lurched into it then fell kicking and screaming sending its mate careening to the roadside the unexpected movement wrenched norvins feet from the stirrups and left him clinging desperately to mane and cantle it all came with a terrifying swiftness quite as if the three riders had crossed over a powdertrain at the instant of its eruption to find themselves in the fraction of a second involved in chaos ricardos horse thundered away riderless leaving a squirming wriggling confusion of forms in the road where the overseer was battling for his life martels voice rose shrilly in a curse and then norvin felt himself dragged roughly from his saddle whether by human hands or by some overhanging treebranch he never knew the force of his fall bruised and stunned him but he struggled weakly to his feet only to find himself in the grasp of a man whose black visage fronted his own he tried to break away but his bones were like rope his muscles were flabby and shaking he exerted no more force than a child in front of him something sickening something unspeakably foul and horrible was going on and in its presence he was wholly unmanned more hands seized him quickly but he lacked the vigor to attempt an escape on the contrary he hung limp and paralyzed with terror the mystery the uncertainty the hideous significance of that wordless scuffle in the dusty road rendered him nerveless and he cried out shakingly like a man in a nightmare a voice commanded him to be silent a hot breath beat against his cheek but he could not restrain his hysteria and one of his captors began to throttle him he heard his name called and saw savignos figure outlined briefly against the gray background saw another figure blend with it then heard martels voice end in a rising cry which lived to haunt his memory it rose in protest in surprise as if the count doubted even at the last that death could really claim him then it broke in a thin wavering shriek blake may have fainted at any rate his body was beyond his control and his next remembrance was of being half dragged half thrust forward out into the lesser shadows there was no longer any struggling although men were speaking excitedly and he could hear them panting some one was working the ejector of a rifle as if it had stuck a tall man was wiping his hands upon some dried grass plucked from the roadside and he was cursing who is this he cried thrusting his face into the americans and showing a brutal countenance bristly with a weeks growth of beard the stranger one of blakes captors answered whereupon the tall man uttered a violent exclamation wait cried the other he is already dying he cannot stand some one else explained it is indeed the american but he is wounded let me finish the work he has seen too much said the first speaker roughly no no he is the american do you not understand remember the order narcone cautioned another but narcone continued to curse as if mastered by the craving to kill and if the others had not laid hands upon him he might have made good his intention they argued with him all at once and in the midst of the confusion which ensued a new voice called from the darkness what have you there the american he cannot stand a square figure came swiftly through the group muttering angrily and the others fell back to give him room all but narcone who repeated doggedly let me finish the work if you fear to do so his companions broke out at him again in a babble of argument whereupon the newcomer shouted at them in a furious voice silenzio who did this no one answered for a moment but at length the brigand who held blakes hands pinioned at his back with a sash or scarf ventured to suggest i am not so sure he is injured we pulled him down first he may only be frightened there was to be no shooting growled the leader of the band eh but you saw for yourself there was nothing else to do said narcone that ricardo was an old wolf the thickset man whom norvin took to be the infamous cardi himself cried sharply come come signore speak are you hurt the prisoner shook his head mechanically although he did not know whether he was injured or not his denial seemed to satisfy the chief who said with relief it is well we did not wish to harm you there would be consequences you understand and now a match somebody it is not necessary narcone assured him with a laugh of what use to learn a trade like mine if one cannot strike true the knife went home twice once for us once for poor galli who was murdered it was like killing sheep picking up the wisp of grass which he had dropped he began to dry his hands once more a tiny flame flickered in the darkness it was lowered until it shone upon the upturned face of ricardo ferara where he lay sprawled in the dust his teeth showing beneath his gray mustache then died away and the black outlines of the bullnecked man leaped into relief again as he stooped to examine martel not until that instant did the full crushing horror of the affair come home to the american for events had crowded one another so closely that his mind was confused but when in the halting yellow glare he saw those two slack forms and the crooked unnatural postures in which death had left them his consciousness cleared and he strained at his bonds like a fearmaddened horse his actual danger however was at an end one of the band removed the rifle which still hung from his shoulders and which he had forgotten another slipped the scarf from his wrists and directed him to go he staggered away down the road along which he and martel and ricardo had come walking like a sick man for he was crippled with fright after a few steps he began to run heavily awkwardly at first stumbling as if his joints were loose but as his body awoke and the blood surged through him he went faster and faster until he was fleeing like a wild animal and as he ran his terror grew he fell many times goblin shapes pursued him or leaped forth from the shadows but he knew that no matter how fast he fled he could never escape the thing he had met back there in the night it was not the grisly sight of his murdered friend nor the bared teeth of ricardo ferara grinning upward out of the road which filled him with the greatest horror it was the knowledge of his own foul sickening cowardice he ran wildly as if to leave it behind but it trod in his tracks and kept step with him the pyrotechnics at terranova were nearly over and the grounds echoed to the applause of the delighted spectators the donna teresa was leaning upon the arm of colonel neri and saying no one but that extravagant martel would have entertained these poor people so magnificently but there is no reasoning with him when he has an idea it is the finest display since the fair at san felice two years ago the colonel acknowledged they had come out upon the open piazza which overlooked the lawn and the other guests who had been present at the supper had followed suit and were gathered there to admire the spectacle the country people will never finish discussing it why it has been the greatest event this village ever witnessed and margherita have you ever seen her so beautiful the old lady spoke with pride for she was very happy never colonel neri fondled his mustache tenderly she is ablaze with love oh that martel has broken all our hearts lucky fellow i could hate him if i did not like him so you men without exception pretend to adore her but it is flattery you know that she loves it and that it pleases me now martel madonna mia what is this she broke off sharply and pointed toward the main gateway to the grounds by the light that gleamed from the trees on each side of the driveway men could be seen approaching at a run others were hurrying toward them across the terrace calling excitedly to one another a woman screamed something unintelligible but the tone of her voice brought a hush over the merrymakers in the midst of the group coming up the road was one who labored heavily he was bareheaded gray with dust and he staggered as if wounded some one has been hurt exclaimed the colonel maledetto there has been a fight he dropped his companions arm and hastened to the steps then halfway down paused staring he whirled quickly and cried to the old lady wait do not come but madame fazello had seen the white face of the runner and screamed mother of god the american the other guests from the balcony pressed forward with alarmed inquiries no one guessed as yet what had befallen but the loud voices died away a murmuring tide swept the merrymakers toward the castello what has happened signore colonel neri was crying speak the mafia blake gasped martel is his knees sagged and he would have pitched forward had not the soldier supported him we met them in the woods cardi cardi echoed the colonel in a harsh voice cardi came from a dozen frightened throats the donna teresa uttered a second shrill cry and then through the ranks of staring chalkfaced peasants the countess came running swiftly cardi she cried what is this i hear go away signorina i beseech you exclaimed the colonel of carbineers something dreadful has occurred but she disregarded him and faced norvin blake he raised his dripping dustsmeared face and nodded whereat she closed her eyes an instant and swayed but she made no outcry take her away he wheezed painfully god in heaven dont you understand even yet there was no coherent speech and the people merely stared at one another or inquired dully what did he say what is this about cardi take her away blake repeated but the countess recovered herself and with a little gesture bade him go on he told his story haltingly clinging to the colonel to prevent himself from falling his matted head rolling weakly from side to side when he had finished a furious clamor broke forth from the men the women and the children neri commanded them roughly to silence run to the village some one and give the alarm he ordered in the voice of a sick man call sandro and his men and bid them bring extra horses a halfdozen fleetfooted youths broke away and were off before he had finished speaking then blake was helped into the hall of the castello where the confusion was less lucrezia ferara who had been in the rear of the house and was among the last to hear the evil tidings came running to him with colorless lips and eyes distended crying the truth signore for the love of christ they tell me he is murdered but i know it is a lie the notarys wife attempted to calm her but the girl began to scream flinging herself upon her knees at the feet of the american begging him to tell her it was all a mistake my father would not die she cried loudly he was here but an hour ago and he kissed me she would not be calmed and became so violent that it required force to remove her as soon as she was out of the way colonel neri began questioning norvin rapidly at the same time striving by his own example to steady the young man who was in a terrible condition of collapse bit by bit the soldier learned all there was to learn of the shocking story and through it all the countess margherita stood at his elbow never speaking her eyes were glazed with horror her lips were whispering something over and over but when her cousin appealed to her to leave the scene she seemed not to hear him she only stood and stared at the exhausted man until he could bear it no longer and hiding his face in his hands he began to shiver and cringe and sob it seemed to him that she must know that all these people must know the truth and see his shame as if it were blazoned in fire their horror was for him their looks were changing even now to contempt and hatred why did they not accuse him openly instead of staring with wide shocked eyes realization had come to him long before he had reached terranova and he was sick with loathing for himself now therefore in every blanched cheek in every parted lip he felt an accusation he supposed all the world would have to know it and it was a thing he could never live down he wished he might have died as martel had died might die even now and escape this torture but with every breath life flowed back into him his heart was no longer bursting his lungs were no longer splitting why do you wait he queried at length thinking of martel out there on the lonely mountainside why dont you go fetch him neri said soothingly help will be here in a few moments signore you could not sit a horse yet a while i blake asked blankly and shuddered so they expected him to return through that darkness to guide them to the horror from which he had just fled he would not go his mind recoiled at the thought and terror came upon him afresh nevertheless he made an effort at selfcontrol lurched to his feet and chattered through clicking teeth come on im ready presently presently there will be men and horses here in a moment in a lower tone the colonel urged for the love of our saviour can you not send the contessa away i am afraid she is dying blake went to the girl and laid a shaking hand upon her arm stammering wretchedly contessa you you he could not go on and turned appealingly to the others you say he is dead she inquired dully how can that be when you told me there was no danger i did not know oh he lowered his working features if it had only been i instead she nodded that would have been better from somewhere to the rear of the house came the shrill screams of lucrezia and the countess cried poor child they did not even spare ricardo but after all he was only a father neri said gently let me help you signorina the doctor is with your aunt but i will call him he cannot give me back martel she answered in the same dull lifeless tone voices footsteps sounded outside and a man in the cocked hat and uniform of a lieutenant of carbineers came briskly into the hall and saluted his superior we are ready sir the countess roused herself saying then come i too am ready heaven above us neri faltered you are not going he took her by the hand and led her away from the door no my child we will go alone you must wait his face was twitching and the sweat dripped from his square jaw as he nodded to blake they went out into the mocking glare of the garden lights leaving her standing in the great hall like a statue of ivory her lips dumbly framing the name of her lover vi a new resolve all sicily blazed with the account of the assassination of the count of martinello and his overseer all italy took it up and called for vengeance there went forth to the world by wire by post and through the public press a manyvoiced and authoritative promise that the brigandage which had cursed the island for so many generations should be extirpated the outrage was the one topic of conversation from trapani to genoa from brindisi to venice in clubs in homes upon the streets carbineers and soldiers came pouring into terranova and san sebastiano they scoured the mountains and patrolled the roads they searched the houses and farms the valleys and thickets and as the days dragged on proving the futility of their efforts still more carbineers arrived but no trace of cardi of narcone or of the other outlaws was discovered rewards were offered doubled trebled the north coast seethed with excitement the rank of the young count and his fiancee enlisted the interest of the nobility the livelyminded middle classes were romantically stirred by the picture of the lonely girl stricken on the eve of her wedding and yet notwithstanding the fact that towns were searched forests dragged as with a net no quarry came to bay colonel neri explained it to norvin as he rode in to san sebastiano after thirtysix hours in the saddle it is this accursed sicilian mafia he growled the common people are shocked horrified sympathetic and yet they fear to show their true feelings they dare not tell what they know mark you those men are not hiding in the forests they are here in san sebastiano or the other villages under our very noses perhaps they are strutting the streets of palermo or bagheria or messina marked by a hundred eyes discussed by a hundred tongues and yet we cannot surprise a look or win the slightest hint fifty arrests have been made but there will be fifty alibis proven it is maddening it is damnable it is sicily he swore wearily beneath his breath and twirled his mustache with listless fingers then you are losing hope no i had none to begin with for i know these people but we are doing everything possible god in heaven the country is wild from rome has come the order definite explicit to stamp out the banditti if it requires an army enough soldiers are coming to defeat the germans but the more we have the less we shall accomplish sweep sicily stamp out the mafia what does rome know about the mafia signore did we arrest one half of those whom we know to be mafiosi rome would need to send us not an army of soldiers but regiments of stone masons to enlarge our prisons no send back the armed men give me ten thousand of your american dollars and ten of my carbineers and i will catch cardi though it would require the cunning of the devil however we may find something who can tell at any rate we will try cant you work secretly it is being done but we are too many we make too much noise the sicilian distrusts the law and above all he distrusts his neighbor he will perjure himself to acquit a mafioso rather than betray him and become a victim of his vengeance he who talks little is wise of that which does not concern him he says neither good nor evil that is a part of the sicilians training but miracles have happened and god may intervene for that saintly girl at terranova and now tell me how is the poor child bearing up i havent seen her since we brought in martels body i couldnt in fact although i have sent word for her to call me when she is ready it seems a long time since since neri shook his head in sorrowful agreement i have never seen such grief my heart bleeds she was so still not a tear not an outcry it was terrible weak women do not act in that manner but you have suffered also and i judge you have rested no more than i i cant rest blake said dully i can do nothing but think he did not reveal the nature of the thoughts which in the short space of thirtysix hours had put lines into his face instead he scanned the officers countenance with fearful eyes to see if by any chance he had guessed the truth blake had found himself looking thus at every one since the tragedy and it was a source of constant wonder to him that his secret had remained his own it seemed that they must know and loathe him as he loathed himself but on the contrary he was treated with sympathy on all sides and it was taken merely as an example of the outlaws cunning that they had refrained from injuring a foreigner to illustrate how curiously the sicilian mind works on these subjects there were some who even spoke of it as demonstrating the fairness of the bandits thus to exclude savignos friend from any connection with their quarrel during the long hours since the night of his friends death blake had looked at himself in all his nakedness of soul and the sight was not pleasant he could never escape the thought that if he had acted the part of a man if he had resisted with the promptness and vigor of his companions the result might have been different and martel might at this moment be on his way to rome with his bride alive and well on such occasions he felt like a murderer but his mind was not always undivided in this selfcondemnation there were times when with some show of justice he told himself that the result would have been the same or even worse if he had fought and he tried to ease his conscience by dwelling on the possibility that under other circumstances he might not have proved a coward he had been physically tired worn out his nervous force had been spent at the moment of ambush his mind had been far away and he had had no time in which to gather his wits moral courage he knew is quite different from physical courage which may depend upon ones digestion ones state of mind or the amount of sleep one has had it is sometimes present in physical weaklings and men of great daring may entirely lack it a mans behavior when suddenly attacked and overpowered is a test of his nerve rather than his true nature still at the last he was always faced by the stark ugly fact that he had been tried and found wanting conversation with neri he found rather a relief i wonder what the countess will do he said what would any one do she will grieve for a long while but time will gradually rob her of her sorrow she will remember martel as a saint and marry some sinner like you or me marry never never the colonel raised his brows she is young she is human she is full of fire it would be a great pity if she did not allow herself to love a great pity indeed im afraid shes thinking more of vengeance than of love perhaps but hatred is shortlived while love grows younger all the time the world is full of great loves but great hates usually consume themselves quickly i hope she will leave all thoughts of such things to us who make a business of them if you fail as you fear she might feel bound to take up the task where you leave it and she might succeed but but what revenge is a cold bedfellow and women are designed to cherish finer sentiments as for lucrezia she will doubtless swear a vendetta like those sardinians she has indeed well she is the kind to nourish hatred for she is like her father silent somber unforgiving whereas the contessa is all sunshine but hear me talk i am dying of fatigue the funeral is at twelve it will be very sad and the poor girl will be under the greatest strain then so we must be with her you and i and then i must be off again upon the trail of this infamous cardi who is and who is not ah well he yawned widely we may accomplish the impossible or if not we may press him so closely that he will sail for your america which would not be so bad after all of course the country people turned out for the funeral but for the most part they came from curiosity to norvin the presence of such spectators at the last sacred rites for the dead seemed sacrilegious indecent and he knew that it must add to margheritas pain it was an endless heartrending ordeal a great somber impressive pageant of which he remembered little save a tall tawny girl crushed beneath a grief so great that his own seemed trivial in comparison she was in such a state of physical collapse after the service that she did not send for him until the second day following he came timidly even then for he was at a loss how to comfort her vividly conscious as he was of his own guilt and shame he found her crouched upon one of the old stone benches in the garden in the full hot glare of the sun it relieved him to find that she had lost her unnatural selfcontrol having fallen it seemed into much the same mood he would have expected in any woman it had been so hard to find what to say heretofore for she was braver than those about her and her grief was so deep as to render words of comfort futile her eyes now were heavy and full of haunting shadows her ivory cheeks were pale her lips tremulous and she seemed at last to crave sympathy i do not know why i have summoned you she said leaving her hand in his unless it is because my loneliness has begun and i lack the courage to face it i have been waiting it will always be so contessa i shall come from across the world whenever you need me she smiled listlessly you are very good i knew you were waiting it seems so strange to know that he is gone her voice caught her eyes filled then cleared without overflowing and that the world is moving on again in the same way and only i am left standing by the wayside you cannot wait with me you must move on with the rest of the world you had planned to go home and you must for you have your work and it calls you please dont think of it i shant leave you for a long time i promised martel you promised then he had reason to suspect he would not acknowledge the possibility and yet he must have had a premonition oh why will men trust themselves when women know if he had told me if he had confided his fears to me i could have told him what to do i couldnt leave now even if i wished for i might be needed by the the law you understand it isnt finished with me yet the law will not need you she told him bitterly the law will do nothing the task is for other hands after a pause he said i had news from home today rather bad news then at her quick look of inquiry he went on nothing serious i hope nothing to take me away my mother is ill and has cabled me to come then you will go at once of course no ive tried to explain to her the situation here and the necessity of my remaining for a time at least unless she grows worse i shall stay and try to help neri in his search it is a great comfort to have you near for in you i see a part of martel you were his other half but there are other aching hearts it seems that mother calls to you and you ought to go besides i must begin my work what work she met his eyes squarely you know without asking neri will fail no italian could succeed no one could succeed except a sicilian i am one you mean to bring those men to justice she nodded certainly who else can do it but my dear signorina think what that means they are of a class with which you can have no contact they are the dregs there is the mafia to reckon with how will you go about it i will become one of them if necessary he answered her in a shocked voice no no you are mad to think of it if you were a man you might have some chance for success but you a girl a gentlewoman i am a sicilian i am rich too i have resources she took him by the arm as she had done that first time when the thought of martels danger had roused her i told you no power could save them no hidingplace could be so secret no lies so cunning that i would not know well those soldiers have failed and will continue to fail but you see they did not love martel i shall live for this thing i wont allow you to dwell on the subject it isnt natural and it isnt good for you the desire to see justice done is commendable and proper but the desire for revenge isnt you must not sacrifice your life to it there is a law of compensation those men will be apprehended where is my compensation what had martel done to warrant this he fell silent and she shook her head as if to indicate the hopelessness of answering her after a moment of meditation he began again gravely if you feel that way i shall make you an offer give up your idea of taking an active personal part in this quest and i will assume your place we will work together but you will direct while i face the risks you are a stranger we would be sure to fail i thank you but my mind is made up if it becomes known you will be in great danger think life is before you and all its possibilities please let other hands do this it is useless to argue she said firmly i am like rock i have begun already and i have accomplished more than colonel neri and his carbineers i see aliandro coming now and i think he has news he knows many things of which the soldiers do not dream for he is one of the people you will excuse me of course but i cant let you undertake so dangerous a task without a protest i shall come back if i may he rose as the old man shuffled down the path and went in search of the donna teresa for he was determined to offer every discouragement in his power to what struck him as an extremely rash and perilous course men like belisario cardi or narcone the butcher would hesitate no more in attacking a woman than a man he knew the whole sicilian country to be a web of intrigue and secret understandings sensitive to the slightest touch and possessed of many means of communication it was a great ear which heard the slightest stir and its unfailing efficiency was shown by the ease with which the bandits had forestalled every effort of the authorities in the hall of the manor house he encountered lucrezia and stopped to speak to her you would do a great deal to protect the countess would you not he asked yes signore she has been both a sister and a mother to me but what do you mean feraras daughter was a robust girl of considerable physical charm but although her training at terranova had done much for her it was still evident that she was a country woman she had nursed her grief with all the sullen fierceness of a peasant and even now her face and eyes were swollen from weeping blake explained briefly his concern but when he had finished the girl surprised him by breaking forth into a furious denunciation of the assassins she surrendered to her passion with complete abandon and began to curse the names of cardi and gian narcone horribly we demand blood to wash our blood she cried i curse them and their souls living and dead in the name of god who made my father in the name of christ who died for him in the name of the holy saints who could not save him in the name of the whole world i curse them may they pray and not be heard may they repent unforgiven and lie unburied may every living thing that bears their names die in agony before their eyes may their women and unborn children be afflicted with every unclean thing until they pray for death at my hands lucrezia he seized her roughly and clapped his hand over her mouth for her voice was rising steadily and threatened to rouse the whole household her cheeks were white she was shaking with long tearless sobs she would have broken out again when he released her had he not commanded her to be silent he tried to explain that this work of vengeance was not for her or for the countess and to point out the ruin that was sure to follow any attempt on their part to take up the work of the carabinieri but she shook her head declaring stubbornly we have sworn it the more he argued the more obstinate she became until seeing the ineffectiveness of his pleas he gave up any further effort to move her sorry that he had raised such a storm he went on in search of madam fazello with lucrezias parting words ringing ominously in his ears if we die we shall be buried if we live we shall give them to the hangman from margheritas aunt he got but little comfort or hope of assistance oh my dear boy i agree with your every word the old lady said but what can i do i know better than you what it will lead to but margherita is like iron there is no reasoning with her she would sacrifice herself lucrezia even me to see martel avenged and if she does not have her way she will burn herself to ashes as for lucrezia she is demented and they do nothing all day but scheme and plan with aliandro who is himself as bad as any bandit i have no voice with them they do with me as they will she hid her face in her trembling fingers and wept softly and to think we were all so happy with martel nevertheless somebody must dissuade them from this enterprise it is no matter for two girls and an old man to undertake i pray hourly for guidance but i am frightened so frightened when margherita talks to me when i see her high resolve i am ready to follow then when i am alone i become like water again what are her plans i do not know i have begged her to take her sorrow to god the bishop who came from messina to marry martel and remained to bury him has joined me there is a convent at palermo no no blake cried vehemently not that that life is not for her she must do nothing at all until her grief has had time to moderate it will never be less you do not know her but you are the one to reason with her realizing that the old lady was powerless he returned to the garden and tried once more to weaken the girls resolution but without success it was with a very troubled mind that he took the train back to san sebastiano that afternoon the more he thought it over the more certain he became that it was his duty to remain in sicily until margherita had reached her right senses martel had put a trust in him and what could be more important than to prevent her from carrying out this fantastic enterprise he would take up the search for the assassins in her place allowing her to work through him and in that way satisfying her determination what she needed above all things was distraction occupation if she remained persistent they would work side by side until justice had been done and meanwhile he would become a part of her life he might make himself necessary to her at least he would prevent her from doing anything rash and perhaps fatal in time he would prevail upon her to travel to seek recreation and then her youth would be bound to tell that would be the work of a friend indeed that would remove at least a part of the obligation which rested upon him some day he reasoned the countess might even marry and be happy in spite of what had occurred as he contemplated the idea it began to seem less improbable what if she should come to care for him he would still be true to martel for how could he protect her better than by making her his wife his heart leaped at the thought but then his old selfdisgust returned reminding him that he had yet to prove himself a man as he stepped down from the train at san sebastiano the station master met him with a telegram even before he opened it he guessed its contents and his spirits sank was he never to escape these maddening questions of duty never to be free to pursue his hearts desire it was a cablegram and read come quickly kenear he regarded it gravely for a moment striving to balance his duty to martel and the girl against his duty to his mother but his hesitation was brief he stepped into the little telegraph office with the mandarintree peering in at the open window and wrote his answer he did not try to deceive himself the mere fact that dr kenear had been summoned from new orleans showed as plainly as the message itself that his mothers condition was more serious than he had supposed she was alone with many responsibilities upon her frail shoulders and she was calling for her son there was but one thing to do he stopped at the barracks to explain the necessity for his immediate departure to colonel neri who was most sympathetic you are not needed here the soldier assured him and you would have to go even though you were you made your statement at the inquest there is nothing further for you to do until we accomplish the capture of somebody even then i doubt if you could identify any one of those bandits i think i should know narcone anywhere the colonel shrugged narcone has been swallowed by the earth as for cardi and the rest they have become thin smoke and the wind has carried them away we are precisely where we were at the start perhaps it is fortunate for you that you have not been called upon to testify against any of the band for even the fact that you are a foreigner might not save you from unpleasant results norvin reasoned silently that if this were indeed true it more than confirmed his fears for the countess and after a brief hesitation he told the soldier what he had learned at his visit to terranova neri rose and paced the room in agitation oh she is mad indeed he exclaimed what can she do that we have not already done aliandro bah he is a doddering old reprobate who will spread news instead of gather it he has a bad record and although he loved martel and doubtless loves margherita i have no confidence in him whatever she will accomplish nothing but her own undoing i am afraid so too that is why i shall return to sicily as soon as possible indeed then you plan to come back martel was fortunate to have so good a friend as you signore we must both do all we can to prevent this folly on the part of his sweetheart you may rest assured that i shall make every effort in your absence the colonel extended his hand and norvin took it feeling some relief in the knowledge that there was at least one man close to the girl upon whose caution he could rely and upon whose good offices he could count he had grown to like the soldier during their brief acquaintance and the fact that neri knew and appreciated the situation helped to reconcile him to the thought of going away he was not ready to leave sicily however without one final appeal and accordingly he stopped at terranova on the following morning on his way to messina where a boat was sailing for naples that night but he found no change in the countess on the contrary she told him gently but firmly that she had made up her mind once for all and that she would resent any further efforts at dissuasion wont you even wait until i return he inquired she shook her head and smiled sadly do not let us deceive ourselves amico mio you will not return on the contrary i shall you make it necessary for me to return whether i wish to or not the ocean is wide the world moves you are a foreigner and you will forget it is only in sicily that people remember will you give me time to prove you wrong i could not allow it you have your own life to live you have a multitude of duties martel you see was only your friend but with me it is different he was my lover my life was a part of his and my duty will not let me sleep you have no reason to say i will forget it is the way of the world then too there is the other woman you will see her you will find a way perhaps but he replied doggedly i shall return to sicily when i cant tell a month from now two months at the longest it would be very sweet to have you near she said musingly for i am lonely very lonely and with you i feel at rest at peace in a way but something drives me signore and i cannot promise if you should not forget if you should wish to join hands with me then i should thank god and be very glad but i shant wish for it that would be unfair his voice shook as he said i am going to prove to you that your life is not hopelessly wrecked and to show you that there is something worth living for she laid her two cool hands in his and looked deeply into his eyes but if she saw what lay in them she showed no altered feeling in her words or tone martel would be glad to have you near me i am sure she said but i shall only pray for your safety and your happiness in that faroff america goodby he kissed her fingers vowing silently to devote his whole life to her and finding it very hard to leave vii the search begins it was ten months later when norvin blake landed at messina and took the morning train westward to terranova as he disposed his travellingbags in a corner of the compartment and settled himself for the short journey he felt a kind of irrational surprise at the fact that there had been no changes during his absence the city was just as dirty and uninteresting as when he had left the beggars were just as ragged and importunate the street coaches were just as rickety it required an effort to realize that ten months is after all a very short time for it seemed ten years since he had sailed away it had been a difficult period for him one crowded with many changes readjustments and responsibilities he had gone far he had done much he had been pressed by cares and anxieties on every side and even at the last he had willfully abandoned urgent duties to his own great loss and to the intense disgust of his friends in order to come back according to his promise his return had been delayed from week to week from month to month in spite of all he could do and meanwhile his thoughts had not been in america at all but in sicily causing him to fret and chafe at the necessities which bound him to his post now however the day upon which he had counted had arrived he had taken his liberty regardless of consequences and no dusty pilgrim ever longed more fiercely for a journeys end he was glad of the impression of sameness he had received for it made him feel that there would be no great changes in terranova he had learned little from the countess during the interim for she had been slow in answering his frequent letters while her own had been brief and noncommital they contained hardly a suggestion of that warmth and intimacy which he had known in her presence her last letter now quite old had added to this impression of aloofness and rendered him somewhat timid as the time for meeting her approached he reread it for the hundredth time as the train crawled out of the city my dear friend your good letter was very welcome indeed and i thank you for your sympathetic interest in our affairs at terranova but since fate has shown in so many ways that your life lies in louisiana and not in sicily i beg of you to let things take their course and give up any idea of returning here there is nothing that you can do particularly since time has proved your fears for our safety to be groundless it is kind and chivalrous of you to persist in offering to take that long journey from america but nothing would be gained by it absolutely nothing i assure you and it would entail a sacrifice on your part which i cannot permit very little of interest or of encouragement had occurred here but i am working i shall always work some day i shall succeed meanwhile we talk of you and are heartened by your friendship which seems very close and real despite the miles that separate us we shall cherish it and the memory of your loyalty to martel meanwhile you must not feel bound by your promise to come back which was not a promise after all but merely an unselfish offer once again i repeat it would do no good and might only disappoint you besides i am hoping that you have seen the woman of whom you told me and that she will need you we are all well we have made no plans yours gratefully margherita ginini it was certainly unsatisfying but her letters had all been of this somewhat formal nature she persisted too in referring to that imaginary woman and blake regretted ever having mentioned her if margherita suspected the truth she could not help feeling his lack of delicacy his disloyalty to martel in confessing his love while the count was still alive if she really believed him to be in love with some other woman it would necessitate sooner or later an explanation which he dreaded at all events he hoped that the surprise of seeing him unexpectedly the knowledge that he had really crossed the world to help her would tend to dissipate her melancholy and restore her old responsiveness during the months of his absence the girl had never been out of his mind and he had striven hard to reconcile his unconquerable love for her with the sense of his own unworthiness his unforgivable cowardice was a haunting shame and the more he dwelt upon it the more unspeakably vile he appeared in his own sight for the blakes were honorable people the family was old and cherished traditions common to fine southern houses the men of his name prided themselves upon an especially nice sense of honor which had been conspicuous even in a country where bravery and chivalrous regard for women are basic ideals having been reared in such an atmosphere the young man looked upon his own behavior with almost as much surprise as chagrin he had always taken it for granted that if he should be confronted with peril he would behave himself like a man it was inexplicable that he had failed so miserably for he had no reason to suspect a heritage of cowardice and he was sound in mind and body he loved margherita ginini with all his heart and his resolution to win her was stronger than ever but he felt that sooner or later he would have to prove himself as manly as martel had been and having lost faith in himself the prospect frightened him if she ever discovered the truth and such things are very hard to conceal she would spurn him any selfrespecting woman would do the same he had forced himself to an unflinching analysis of his case with the result that a fresh determination came to him he resolved to reconstruct his whole being if he were indeed a physical coward he would deliberately uproot the weakness and make himself into a man others had accomplished more difficult tasks he reasoned thieves had made themselves into honest men criminals had become decent why then could not a coward school himself to become brave it was merely a question of will power not so hard perhaps as the cure of some drug habit he made up his mind to attack the problem coldly systematically and he swore solemnly by all his love for margherita that he would make himself over into a person who could not only win but hold her as yet there had been no opportunity of putting the plan into operation but he had mapped out a course terranova drowsed among the hills just as he had left it and high up to the right among the trees he saw the white walls of the castello as he mounted the road briskly a goatherd flat upon his back in the sun was piping some haunting air a tinkle of bells came from the hillside the vines were purple with fruit women were busy in the vineyards gathering their burdens and bearing them to the tubs for the white feet of the girls who trod the vintage nearing his goal he saw that the house had an unoccupied air and he found the big gates closed since no one appeared in answer to his summons he made his way around to the rear where he discovered aliandro sunning himself well aliandro he cried this is good weather for rheumatism the old man peered up at him uncertainly muttering the saints in heaven are smiling today where are the contessa margherita and her aunt they are where their business takes them i dare say ma che gone to messina perhaps perhaps visiting friends exactly aliandro nodded they are visiting friends in messina i wish i had known i just came from there will they return soon blakes hopes had been so high his disappointment was so keen that he failed to notice the old mans lack of greeting and his crafty leer as he answered si veramente soon very soon within a year five years at the outside what oh they will return so soon as it pleases them he chuckled as if delighted at his own secrecy norvin said sharply come come dont jest with me i have traveled a long way to see them i wish to know their whereabouts then ask some one who knows if ever i was told i have forgotten sior my memory goes jumping about like a kid it is the rheumatism after an instant more he queried you are perhaps a friend of that thriceblessed angel my padrona with an exclamation of relief norvin laid a hand upon the old fellows shoulder and shook him gently have your eyes failed you my good aliandro he cried dont you recognize the american the signore blake who came here with the count of martinello look at me and tell me where your mistress has gone aliandro arose and peered into his visitors face wagging his loose jaws excitedly as god is my judge he declared finally i believe it is che dio who would have expected to see you yes yes i remember as if it were yesterday when you came riding up with that most illustrious gentleman who now sits in paradise it is a miracle that you have crossed the seas so many times in safety so now tell me what i want to know they have gone where how do i know find belisario cardi may he live a million years in hell find him and you will find them also you mean find belisario cardi that most infamous of assassins my padrona has set out to say good morning to him he may even now be on his way to purgatory blake stared at the speaker for he could not credit the words once more he asked but where where where indeed if i had known in time where this cardi lived i would have knocked at his door some evening with the hilt of a knife but he was never twice in the same place he has the ears of a fox so long as the soldiers went tramping back and forth he laughed then he must have heard something perhaps it was aliandro whetting his blade at any rate he was gone in an hour in a moment in a second now i know nothing more she took the donna teresa with her yes squealing like a cat she is too old to be of use but the contessa could not leave her behind i suppose norvin felt some relief at this intelligence reflecting that margherita would hardly draw her aunt into an enterprise which promised to be dangerous as he considered the matter further he began to doubt the truth of aliandros story for the old fellow seemed half daft perhaps the countess and her aunt were merely traveling and aliandro had construed their trip into a journey of vengeance he had doubtless spent all his time meditating upon the murder of his friend and benefactor and that was a subject which might easily unbalance a stronger mind ten months had worked a change in blakes viewpoint when he left sicily the idea of a girls devoting her life to the pursuit of her lovers assassins had seemed to him extravagant yet not wholly unnatural now it struck him as beyond belief that margherita should really do this aliandro was continuing it is work for young hands excellency old people grow weary and forget especially women now that lucrezia she is a fine child she can hate like the devil himself and she is as silent as a mafioso it was two months ago that they went away and that angel of gold that sweetest of ladies whom the saints are quarreling over she left me sufficient money for the balance of my days but i will tell you something excellency a scandal to make your blood boil she left that money with the notary and now what do you think he gives me scarcely enough for tobacco once a week sometimes oftener i go down to the village and whine like a beggar for what is mine a fine man to trust eh may he lie unburied sometimes i think i shall have to kill him he is so hardhearted but i cannot see well enough if you should find him kicking in the road however you will know that he brought it upon himself you are shocked no wonder he is a greater scoundrel than that judas perhaps you you are a great friend of the family perhaps you might force the wolf to disgorge eh what do you say a word would do it you will save his life in all probability very well ill speak to him and meanwhile here is something to please you norvin handed the old ruffian a gold coin greatly to his delight they have been gone two months and you have had no word not a whisper once a week the notary comes up from the village to see that all is well with the house many people have asked me the same questions you asked some of them know me and i know some who think i do not they would like to trick me into betraying the whereabouts of the contessa but i lie like a lawyer and tell them first one thing then another body of christ i am no fool when norvin had put himself in possession of all that aliandro knew he retraced his steps to the village where the notary confirmed practically all the old man had said but declared positively that the countess and her admirable aunt were traveling for pleasure what else would take them abroad he inquired nothing i have the honor to look after the castello during their absence and the rents from the land are placed in the bank at messina when do you expect them to return privately signore i do not expect them to return at all that shocking tragedy preyed upon the poor childs mind until she could no longer endure terranova she is highly sensitive you know everything spoke of martel savigno what more natural than for her to wish never to see it again she consulted me once regarding a sale of all the lands and only last week some men came with a letter from the bank at messina they were englishmen i believe or perhaps germans i can never tell the difference if indeed there is any i showed them through the house it would be a great loss to the village however yes and to the whole countryside if they purchased terranova for the countess was like a ray of sunshine like an angels smile and so generous tell me cardi was never found the notary shrugged his shoulders as for me i have never believed there was such a person gian narcone yes we all knew him but he has not been heard from since that terrible night which we both remember now this cardi well he is imaginary if he were flesh and blood the carabinieri would certainly have caught him there were enough of them per baccho you never saw the like of it they were thicker than flies and yet they didnt catch narcone and hes real enough true acknowledged the notary thoughtfully i never thought of it in that light perhaps there is such a person after all but why has no one ever seen him where is colonel neri he is stationed at messina perhaps he could tell you more than i dismayed yet not entirely discouraged by what he had learned blake caught the first train back to messina and that evening found him at neris rooms the colonel was delighted to see him but could tell him little more than aliandro or the notary do you really believe the countess left sicily to travel blake asked him to you i will confess that i do not we know better than that you and i she was working constantly from the time you left for america until her own departure but i never knew what she discovered that she learned more than we did i am certain and it is my opinion that she found the trail of cardi then youre not like the others you still believe there is such a person whether he calls himself cardi or something else makes no difference there has been an intelligence of a high order at work among the mafiosi and the banditti of this neighborhood for many years we learned things after you left we were many times upon the verge of important discoveries but invariably we were thwarted at the last moment by that sicilian trait of secrecy and by some very potent terror we tried our best to get to the bottom of this fear i mention but we could not it was more than the customary distrust and dislike of the law it was a lively personal dread of some man or body of men the fact that we have been working nearly a year now without result would indicate that the person at the head of the organization is no common fellow no one dares betray him even at the price of a fortune i believe him to be some man of affairs some wellfed and respected merchant or banker perhaps the knowledge of whose identity would cause a commotion such as etna causes when she turns over in her sleep that was ricardos belief you remember yes i have many reasons for thinking he was right but i have no proof cardi may still be in sicily although i doubt it gian narcone has fled that much i know indeed yes the pursuit became hot we did not rest i do not see even yet how we failed to capture him we apprehended a number whom we know were in the band although we have no evidence connecting them with that particular outrage i think we will convict them for something or other however at any rate we have broken up this gang even though we have lost the two men we most desired narcone went to naples he may be there now he may be in any part of italy or he may even be in your own america for all i know and this mysterious cardi is probably with him it is my hope that we have frightened them off the island for all time and sent them to my country thanks were having trouble enough with our own italians as it is you at least have more room than we but now before we go further you must tell me about yourself about your mother norvin shook his head gravely i arrived in time to see her to be with her at the last that is all i am indeed full of sympathy said neri it is no wonder you could not return to sicily as soon as you had planned everything conspired to hold me back there were many things that needed attention for her affairs had become badly mixed and required a strong hand to straighten them out yet all the time i knew i was needed here i knew the countess was in want of some one to lean upon i came at the first opportunity but it seems i am too late i am afraid neri afraid for her god knows what she may do god knows agreed the soldier i pleaded with her i tried to argue but surely she cant absolutely disappear in this fashion she will have to make herself known sooner or later im not so certain her affairs are in good shape and terranova is for sale doesnt the bank know her whereabouts if so she has instructed them to conceal it nevertheless i shall go there in the morning and also to her cousins will you help me of course neri regarded the young man curiously for an instant then said you will pardon this question i hope but since she has taken such pains to conceal herself do you think it wise to to to force myself upon her i dont know whether it is wise or foolish all i know is that i must find her i must blake met the older mans eyes and his own were filled with a great trouble you told me once that revenge and hatred are bad companions for a woman and that it would be a great pity if margherita ginini did not allow herself to love and be loved i think you were right im afraid to let her follow this quest of hers it may lead her into something very bad for she has unlimited capabilities for good or evil i had hoped to to show her that god had willed her to be happy you see neri i loved her even when martel was alive the colonel nodded i guessed as much all men love her and there lies her danger i love her also signore i have always loved her even though i am old enough to be her father and i would give my life to see her well to see her your wife you understand me i would help you find her if i could but i am a soldier i am chained to my post i am poor jove youre mighty decent said the american with an odd breathlessness but do you think she could ever forget martel she is not yet twenty do you think there is any possibility of my winning her i thought so once but lately i have been terribly doubtful i should say it will depend largely upon your finding her we are not the only good men who will love her they sailed from here to naples on the trail of narcone that much i believe is reasonably certain i will give you a letter to the police there and they will help you it is possible that we excite ourselves unduly perhaps you will have no difficulty whatever in locating her but in the mean time we will do well to talk with her relatives and with the officials of the bank i look for little help from those quarters however colonel neris misgivings were well founded as the following day proved at the bank nothing definite was known as to the whereabouts of the countess she had left instructions for the rents to be collected until terranova was sold and then for all moneys to be held until she advised further her cousins were under the impression that she had taken her aunt to northern italy for a change of climate and believed that she could be found in the mountains somewhere blake was not long in discovering that while the relations between the two branches of the family were maintained with an outward show of cordiality they were really not of the closest neri told him as a matter of fact that margherita had always considered these people covetous and untrustworthy having exhausted the clues at messina norvin hastened to naples and there took up his inquiry he presented his letter but the police could find no trace of the women and finally told him that they must have passed through the city without stopping perhaps on their way to rome so to rome he went and there met a similar discouragement by now he was growing alarmed for it seemed incredible that a woman so conspicuous and so well known as the countess of terranova should be so hard to find unless she had taken unusual pains to hide her identity if such were the case the search promised many difficulties nevertheless he set about it energetically sparing no expense and yet preserving a certain caution in order not to embarrass the countess he reasoned that if cardi and narcone had fled their own island they would be unlikely to seek an utterly foreign land but would probably go where their own tongue was spoken hence the countess was doubtless in one of the italian cities when several weeks had been spent without result the young man widened the scope of his efforts and appealed to the police of all the principal cities of southern europe two months had crept by before word came from colonel neri which put an end to his futile campaign the bank it seemed had received a letter from the countess written in new york it was merely a request to perform certain duties and contained no return address but it sent norvin blake homeward on the first ship now that he knew that the girl was in his own country he felt his hopes revive it seemed very natural after all that she should be there instead of in europe for cardi and his lieutenant having found sicily too hot to hold them had doubtless joined the tide of italian emigration to america that land of freedom and riches whither all the scum of europe was floating why should they turn to italy the mother country when the criminals of europe were flocking across the westward ocean to a richer field which offered little chance of identification it seemed certain now that margherita had taken up the work in earnest nothing less would have drawn her to the united states blake gave up his last lingering doubt regarding her intentions but he vowed that if her resolve were firm his should be firmer if her life held nothing but thoughts of martel his held nothing but thoughts of her if she were determined to hide herself he was equally determined to find her and he would keep searching until he had done so the hunt began to obsess him he obeyed but one idea beheld but one image and he cherished the illusion that once he had overtaken her his task would be completed only upon rare occasions did he realize that the girl was still unwon perhaps beyond his power to win he chose to trust his heart rather than his reason and in truth something deep within him gave assurance that she was waiting that she needed him and would welcome his coming viii old trails mr bernard dreux was regarded by his friends rather as an institution than as an individual he was a small man but he wore the dignity of a senator and he possessed a pride of that intense and fastidious sort which is rarely encountered outside the oldest southern families he was thin with the delicate birdlike mannerisms of a dyspeptic and although he was nearing fifty he cultivated all the airs and graces of beardless youth his feet were small and highly arched his hands were sensitive and colorless he was an authority on art he dabbled in music and he had once been a lavish entertainer that was in the early days when he had been a social leader now although harassed by a lack of money which he considered degrading he still mingled in good society he still dressed elegantly his hands were still white and sensitive contrasting a little with his conscience which had become slightly discolored and calloused he no longer entertained however except by his wit he exercised a watchful solicitude over his slender wardrobe and his revenues were derived from sources so uncertain that he seemed to maintain his outwardly placid existence only through a series of lucky chances but adversity had not soured mr dreux it had not dimmed his pride nor coarsened his appreciation of beauty he remained the gentle suave and agreeably cynical beau young girls had been known to rave over him despite their mothers frowns fathers and brothers called him bernie and greeted him warmly at their clubs but aside from mr dreuxs inherited right to social recognition he was marked by another and peculiar distinction in that he was the halfbrother and guardian of myra nell warren this fact alone would have assured him a wide acquaintance and a degree of popularity without regard to his personal characteristics while it was generally known that old captain warren during a short and riotous life had dashed through the dreux fortune at a tremendous rate very few people realized what an utter financial wreck he had left for the two children there had been barely enough for them to live upon after his death and inasmuch as myra nells extravagance steadily increased as the income diminished her halfbrother was always hard pressed to keep up appearances she was a great responsibility upon the little mans shoulders particularly since she managed in all innocence and thoughtlessness to spend not only her own share of the income but his also he was many times upon the point of remonstrating with her but invariably his courage failed him and he ended by planning some additional selfsacrifice to offset her expanding necessities the situation would have been far simpler had bernie lacked that particular inborn pride which forbade him to seek employment not that he felt himself above work but he recoiled from any occupation which did not carry with it a dignity matching that of his name since the name he bore was as highly honored as any in the state and since his capabilities for earning a living were not greater than those of an eighteenyearold boy he was obliged to rely upon his wits and his wits had become uncommonly keen the winter climate of new orleans drew thither a stream of northern tourists and upon these strangers mr dreux in a gentlemanly manner exercised his versatile talents he made friends easily he knew everybody and everything and being a man of leisure his time was at the command of those travelers who were fortunate enough to meet him he understood the good points of each and every little cafe in the foreign quarters he could order a dinner with the rarest taste it was due largely to him that the fame of the ramos ginfizz and the sazerac cocktail became national his grandfather general dreux had drunk at the old absinthe house with no less a person that lafitte the pirate and had frequented the house on royal street when lafayette and marechal ney were there it was in this house indeed that he had met louis philippe his grandson had such a wealth of intimate detail at his finger tips that it was a great pleasure and privilege to go through the french quarter with him he exhaled the atmosphere of southern aristocracy which is so agreeable to northern sensibilities he told inimitable stories and as for antiques he knew every shop and bargain in the city he was liberal moreover nay ingenuous in sharing this knowledge with his newfound friends even while admitting that he coveted certain of these bargains for his own slender collection as a result of mr dreuxs knack of making friends and his intimate knowledge of art he did a very good business in antiques many of his acquaintances wrote him from time to time asking him to execute commissions which he was ever willing to do gratuitously of course in this way he was able to bridge over the dull summer season and live without any unpleasant sacrifice of dignity but it was at best a precarious means of livelihood and one which he privately detested however on the particular day in the summer of on which we first encounter him mr dreux was well contented for a lumberman from minneapolis who had come south with no appreciation whatever of colonial antiques had just departed with enough wormeaten furniture to stock a museum and bernie had collected his regular commission from the dealer now that his own pressing necessities were taken care of for the moment he began as usual to plan for myra nells future this would have required little thought or worry had she been an ordinary girl but that was precisely what miss warren was not the beaux of new orleans were enthusiastically united in declaring that she was quite the contrary quite the most extraordinary and dazzling of creatures bernie had led them to the slaughter methodically one after another with hope flaming in his breast only to be disappointed time after time they had merely served to increase the unhappy number which vainly swarmed about her and to make bernie himself the target of her satire popularity had not spoiled the girl however her attitude toward marriage was very sensible beneath the surface and bernies anxious efforts at matchmaking instead of relieving their financial distress merely served to keep him in the antique business miss warren loved admiration she might be said to live on it and she greeted every new admirer with a bubbling gladness which was intoxicating but she had no appreciation of the sanctity of a promise she looked upon an engagement to marry in the same light as an engagement to walk or dine namely as being subject to the weather or to a prior obligation of the same sort bernie was too much a gentleman to urge her into any step for which she was not ready so he merely sighed when he saw his plans go astray albeit confessing to moments of dismay as he foresaw himself growing old in the secondhand business but a change had occurred lately and although no word had passed between brother and sister the melancholy little bachelor had been highly gratified at certain indications he had marked it seemed to him that her choice provided she really had chosen was excellent for norvin blake was certainly very young to be the president of the cotton exchange he was free from any social entanglements and he was rich moreover his name had as many honorable associations as even bernies own all in all therefore the little man was in an agreeable frame of mind today as he strolled up canal street nodding here and there to his acquaintances and turned into blakes office he entered without announcing himself and norvin greeted him cordially bernie seldom announced himself being one of those rare persons who come and go unobtrusively and who interrupt important conversations without offense do i find you busy he inquired dropping into one of blakes easychairs and lighting a perfumed cigarette no business is over for the day but i am glad to see you at any time youre so refreshingly restful how are the new duties and responsibilities coming on oh very well said blake although im absurdly selfconscious the exchange needed new blood im told i think you are a happy choice opportunity has singled you out and evidently intends to bear you forward on her shoulders whether you wish or not jove you have made strides let me see you are thirty two this makes me look older than i am norvin touched his hair which was gray and bernie nodded funny how your hair changed so suddenly i remember seeing you four years ago at the lexington races just after you returned from europe the second time you were dark then i saw you a year later and you were gray did the wing of sorrow brush your brow blake shrugged they say fear will turn men gray dreux laughed lightly fancy you afraid and why not have you never been afraid i to be sure i rather like it too its invigorating unusual you know theres a kind of fascination about certain emotions which are in themselves unpleasant but my dear boy you cant understand we were talking about you the other night at the boston club after your election and thompson told about that affair you had with those niggers up the state when you were sheriff it was quite thrilling to hear him tell it indeed oh yes he made you out a great hero i never knew why you went in for politics or at least why if you went in at all you didnt try for something worth while you could have gone to the legislature just as easily but for a blake to be sheriff well it knocked us all silly when we heard of it and i dont understand it yet we pictured you locking up drunken men serving subpoenas and selling widows farms over their heads theres really more to a sheriffs duties than that so i judged from thompsons bloodcurdling tales i felt very anaemic and insignificant as i listened to him it doesnt hurt a gentleman to hold a minor political office even in a tough parish i think men ought to try themselves out and find what they are made of it isnt your lack of exclusiveness that strikes one its your nerve oh thats mostly imaginary i havent much really but the truth is im interested in courage they say a man always admires the quality in which he is naturally lacking and wants to acquire it im interested in brave men too they fascinate me ive studied them ive tried to analyze courage and find out what it is where it lies how it is developed and all about it because i have perhaps a rather foolish craving to be able to call myself fairly brave if you hadnt made a reputation for yourself this sort of modesty would convict you of cowardice dreux exclaimed it sounds very funny coming from you and i think you are posing now with me it is wholly different i couldnt stand what you have why the sight of a dead man would unsettle me for months and as for risking my life or attempting the life of a fellow creature well it would be a physical impossibility i id just turn tail you are exceptional though you may not know it youre not normal the majority of us away back in the woodsheds of our minds recognize ourselves as cowards and i differ from the rest in that im brave enough to admit it how do you know you are a coward oh any little thing upsets me your people were brave enough of course but conditions were different in those days were more advanced now theres nothing refined about swinging sabers around your head like a windmill and chopping off yankee arms and legs nor is there anything especially artistic in two gentlemen meeting at dawn under the oaks with shotguns loaded with scrap iron mr dreux shuddered im tremendously glad the war is over and duels are out of fashion well be thankful that antiques are not out of fashion there is still a profit in them i suppose dreux shook his head mournfully not in the good stuff i just sold the original sword of jean lafitte to a man who makes preserved tomatoes it is the eighth in three weeks the business in lafitte sabers is very fair lately general jackson beltbuckles are moving well too not to mention plug hats worn by jefferson davis at his inauguration there was a fabulous hardwood king at the st charles whom i inflamed with the beauties of marquetrie du bois it was all modern of course made in baltimore but i found him a genuine sinurette fourposter which was very fine i also discovered a royal sevres vase for him worth a small fortune but he preferred a bath sponge used by louis xiv i assured him the sponge was genuine so he bought a buhl cabinet to put it in i took the vase for myra nell do you think myra nell would care to be queen of the carnival norvin inquired care bernie started forward in his chair his eyes opened wide youre joking is is there any he relaxed suddenly and after an instants hesitation inquired what do you mean i mean what i say she can be queen if she wishes dreux shook his head reluctantly shed be delighted of course shed go mad at the prospect but frankly she cant afford it he flushed under blakes gaze im sorry bernie ive been told to ask her i am very much obliged to you for the honor and its worth any sacrifice but lord it is disgusting to be poor he prodded viciously with his cane it is a great thing for any girl to be queen the chance may not come again dreux made a creditable effort to conceal his disappointment but he was really beside himself with chagrin you neednt tell me he said but there is no use of my even dreaming of it ive figured over the expense too often she was queen of momus last year thats why ive had to vouch for so many lafitte swords and davis high hats if those tourists ever compare notes theyll think that old pirate must have been a centipede or a devilfish to wield all those weapons i would like to have her accept blake persisted bernie dreux glanced at the speaker quickly feeling a warm glow suffuse his withered body at the hint of encouragement for his private hopes what more natural he reasoned than for blake to wish his future wife to accept the highest social honor that new orleans can confer norvins next words offered further encouragement yet awoke a very conflicting emotion in view of the circumstances and in view of all it means to myra nell i would consider it a privilege to lend you whatever you require she need never know involuntarily the little bachelor flushed and drew himself up thanks its very considerate of you but i cant accept really even for her sake if i didnt know you so well or perhaps if you didnt know us so well id resent such a proposal nonsense dont be foolish realizing thoroughly what this sacrifice meant to miss warrens halfbrother norvin continued suppose we say nothing further about it for the time being perhaps you will feel differently later after a pause dreux said heaven knows where these carnivals will end if we continue giving bigger pageants every year its a frightful drain on the antique business and im afraid i will have to drop out next season i scarcely know what to do why dont you marry blake inquired marry dreux smiled whimsically that lumber king had a daughter but she was freckled felicite delord isnt freckled bernie said nothing for a moment and then inquired quietly what do you know about felicite all there is to know i believe enough at any rate to realize that you ought to marry her as dreux made no answer he inquired she is willing of course of course then why dont you do it the very fact that people well that i know i ought to perhaps then too my situation i have certain obligations which i must live up to dont be forever thinking of yourself there are others to be considered exactly myra nell for instance it seems to me you owe something to felicite my dear boy you dont talk like a like a southern gentleman blake smiled nevertheless miss delord is a delightful little person and you can make her happy if myra nell should be queen of the mardi gras it would round out her social career she will marry before long no doubt and then you will be left with no obligations beyond those you choose to assume nobody knows of your relations with felicite you know said the bachelor stiffly and therefore others must know hence it is quite impossible id prefer not to discuss it if you dont mind certainly i want you to keep that loan in mind however i think you owe it to your sister to accept at any rate i am glad we had this opportunity of speaking frankly ah said bernie suddenly as if seizing with relief upon a chance to end the discussion i think i heard some one in the outer office to be sure exclaimed blake that must be donnelly i had an appointment with him here which id forgotten all about the chief of police hes quite a friend of yours yes we met while i was sheriff hes a remarkably able officer one of those men i like to study well then ill be going said bernie rising no stay and meet him blake rose to greet a tall angular man of about dreuxs age who came in without knocking chief donnelly had an impassive face into which was set a pair of those peculiar smokyblue eyes which have become familiar upon our frontiers he acknowledged his introduction to bernie quietly and measured the little man curiously mr dreux is a friend of mine and he was anxious to meet you so i asked him to stay norvin explained if im not intruding bernie said oh theres nothing much on my mind the chief declared ive come in for some information which i dont believe blake can give me to norvin he said i remembered hearing that youd been to italy so i thought you might help me out mr dreux sat back eliminated himself from the conversation in his own effective manner and regarded the officer as a mouse might gaze upon a lion yes but that was four years ago norvin replied all the better were you ever in sicily blake started the sudden mention of sicily was like a touch upon an exposed nerve i was in sicily twice he said slowly then perhaps you can help me after all i recalled some sort of experience you had over there with the mafia and took a chance the chief drew from his pocket a notebook which he consulted did you ever hear of a sicilian named narcone gian narcone he looked up to see that his friends face had gone colorless blake nodded silently also a chap named some nobleman he turned again to his memorandumbook martel savigno count of martinello norvin supplied in a strained breathless voice thats him why you must know all about this affair blake rose and began to pace his office while the others watched him curiously amazed at his agitated manner and his evident effort to control his features neither of his two friends had deemed him capable of such an exhibition of feeling as a matter of fact norvin had grown to pride himself upon his physical selfcommand and above all upon his impassivity of countenance he had cultivated it purposely for it formed a part of his later training what he chose to call his course in courage but this sudden probing of an old wound this unexpected reference to the most painful part of his life had found him off his guard and with his nerves loose after his return from europe he had set himself vigorously to the task of uprooting his cowardice realizing that his parish had always been lawless it occurred to him that the office of sheriff would compel an exercise of whatever courage he had in him it had been absurdly easy to win the election but afterward the memory of the bitter fight which followed often made him cringe strangely enough his theory had not worked out he found that his cowardice was not a sick spot which could be cauterized or cut out but rather that it was like some humor of the blood or something ingrained in the very structure of his nervous tissue but although his lack of physical courage seemed constitutional and incurable he had a great and splendid pride which enabled him to conceal his weakness from the world time and again he had balked had shied like a frightened horse time and again he had roweled himself with cruel spurs and ridden down his unruly terrors by force of will but the struggle had burned him out had calcined his youth had grayed his hair and left him old and tired even now when he had begun to consider his selfmastery complete it had required no more than the unexpected mention of martel savignos name and that of his murderer to awaken pangs of poignant distress the signs of which he could not altogether conceal when after an interval of several minutes he felt that he had himself sufficiently in hand to talk without danger of selfbetrayal he seated himself and inquired what do you wish to know about the count of martinello and narcone the bandit i want to know all there is said donnelly perhaps we can get at it quicker if you will tell me what you know i had no idea you were familiar with the case its remarkable how these old trails recross i i know everything about the murder of martel savigno for i saw it i was there he was my best friend that is the story of which you read that is why the mention of his name upset me even after nearly five years bernie dreux uttered an exclamation and hitched forward in his chair this new side of blakes character fascinated him if you will tell me the circumstances it will help me piece out my record said the chief so blake began reluctantly hesitatingly giving the facts clearly but with a constraint that bore witness to his pain in the recital when he had finished it was donnellys turn to show surprise that is remarkable he exclaimed to think that you have seen gian narcone dyou suppose you would know him again after four years he shot a keen glance at his friend i am quite sure i would but come you havent told me anything yet well narcone is in new orleans what blake leaned forward in his chair his eyes blazing at least im informed that he is i received a letter some time ago containing most of the information youve just given me and stating that there are extradition papers for him in new york the letter says that some of his old gang have confessed to their part in the murder and have implicated narcone so strongly that he will hang if they can get him back to sicily i believe that but who is your informant i dont know the letter is anonymous a sudden wild hope sprang up in blakes mind he dared not trust it yet it clamored for credence was it written by a woman he queried tensely no at least i dont think so it was written on one of these newfangled typewriting machines i left it at the office or you could judge for yourself if it is typewritten how do you know whether i tell you i dont know but i can guess pretty closely it was one of the pallozzo gang this narcone he calls himself vito sabella by the way is a leader of the quatrones the two factions have been at war lately and some member of the pallozzo outfit has turned him up the light died out of norvins face his body relaxed he had followed so many clues his quest had been so long and fruitless that he met disappointment halfway up to this moment bernie dreux had listened without a word or movement but now he stirred and inquired hesitatingly pardon me but what is this pallozzo gang and who are the quatrones im tremendously interested in this affair the pallozzos and the quatrones donnelly explained are two italian gangs which have come into rivalry over the fruit business they unload the ships you know and they have clashed several times you probably heard about their last mixup one man killed and four wounded i never read about such things dreux acknowledged at which the chiefs eyes twinkled and once more wandered over the little mans immaculate figure you are familiar with our italian problem arent you i im afraid not i know we have a large foreign population in the city in fact i spend much of my time on the other side of canal street but i didnt know there was any particular problem well there is and a very serious one too blake assured him its giving our friend donnelly and the rest of the city officials trouble enough and to spare there have been some eighty killings in the italian quarter eightyfour said donnelly and about two hundred outrages of one sort or another and almost no convictions am i right you are we cant do a thing with them they are a law to themselves and they ignore us and ours absolutely its getting worse too fine situation to exist in the midst of a lawabiding american community isnt it donnelly appealed to dreux now that will show you how little a person may know of his own home reflected bernie has it anything to do with this mafia we hear so much about it has but the mafia is going to end donnelly announced positively ive gone on record to that effect if those dagos cant obey our laws theyll have to pull their freight its up to me to put a finish to this state of affairs or acknowledge im a poor official and dont know my business the reform crowd has seized upon it as a weapon to put me out of office claiming that ive sold out to the italians and dont want to run em down so ive got to do something to show im not asleep on my beat ive never had a chance before but now im going after this vito sabella and land him will you look him over norvin and see if hes the right party of course i owe narcone a visit and im glad of this chance but granting that he is narcone how can you get him out of new orleans hell fight extradition and the quatrones will support him im blamed if i know ill have to figure that out said the chief as he rose to go im mighty glad i had that hunch to come and see you and i wish you were a plainclothes man instead of the president of the cotton exchange i think you and i could clean out this mafia and make the town fit for a white man to live in if youll drop in on me at eight oclock tonight well walk over toward st phillip street and perhaps get a look at your old friend narcone if you care to come along mr dreux id be glad to have you bernie dreux threw up his shapely hands in hasty refusal oh dear no he protested i havent lost any italian murderers this expedition which youre planning so lightly may lead to heaven knows what at any rate i should only be in the way so if its quite the same to you ill send regrets quite the same donnelly laughed then to norvin if you think this dago may recognize you youd better tote a gun at eight then at eight agreed blake and escorted him to the door ix one who knows norvin blake dined at his club that evening returning to his office at about halfpast seven he was relieved to find the place deserted for he desired an opportunity to think undisturbed although this unforeseen twist of events had seemed remarkable at first he began to feel that he had been unconsciously waiting for this very hour something had always forewarned him that a time would come when he would be forced to take a hand once more in that old affair nor was he so much disturbed by the knowledge that narcone the butcher was here in new orleans as by the memories and regrets which the news aroused entering his private office he lit the gas and flinging himself into an easychair gave himself over to recollections of all that the last four years had brought forth it seemed only yesterday that he had returned from italy hot upon the scent which colonel neri had uncovered for him he had been confident eager hopeful yet he had failed signally unaccountably he had combed new york city for a trace of margherita ginini with a thoroughness that left no possible means untried as he looked back upon it now he wondered if he could ever summon sufficient enthusiasm to attack any other project with a similar determination he doubted it later experience had bred in him a peculiar caution a shrinking hesitancy at exposing his true feelings due no doubt to that everpresent necessity of watching himself margherita had never written him after her first disappearance his own letters had been returned from sicily the police of new york had failed as those of rome and naples and other cities had failed he had wasted a small fortune in the hire of private detectives at last when it was too late to profit him he had learned that the three women had been in new york at the time of his arrival but evidently they had become alarmed at his pursuit and fled it was this which had forced him to give up the certainty that margherita knew the motive of his search and resented it he had never quite recovered from the sting of that discovery for he was proud but he had grown too wise to cherish unjust resentment it merely struck him as a great pity that their lives had fallen out in such unhappy fashion he never tried to deceive himself into believing that he could forget her become a new man and banish the joy and the pain of his past impartially there were other women it is true who attracted him strongly aroused his tenderness and appealed to his manhood and among them myra nell warren his power of feeling had not been atrophied rather it had become deeper yet his loyalty was never really impaired in the bottom of his heart he knew that that tawny slumbrous yet passionate sicilian girl was his first and his most sacred love as he sat alone now with the evidences of his accomplishment about him he realized that in spite of his material success life so far at least had been just as stale and flat as it had promised to be on that night when he and martel had ridden away from the feast at terranova he had made good to his own satisfaction in all respects save one and even in that he had gained the form if not the substance for the world regarded him as a man of proven courage it seemed to him a grim and hideous joke and he wondered what his friends would think if they knew that the very commonplace adventure planned for this evening filled him with a cringing horror the prospect of this trip into the italian quarter with the probability of encountering narcone turned him cold and sick his hands were like ice and the muscles of his back were twitching nervously he could feel his heart pound as he let his thoughts have free play but these symptoms were only too familiar he had conquered them too many times to think of weakening after five years of intimate selfstudy he was still at a loss to account for his phenomenal cowardice he wondered again tonight if it might not be the result of a too powerful imagination donnelly had no imagination whatever and the same seemed true of others whom he had studied as for himself his fancies took alarm at the slightest hint and went careering off into all the dark byways of supposition encountering impossible shapes and improbable dangers whatever the cause he had long since given up hope of ever winning a permanent victory over himself and had learned that each trial meant a fresh battle when he saw by the clock that the hour of his appointment had come he arose although his body seemed to belong to some one else and his spirit was crying out a mad panicky warning he opened the drawer of his desk and extracting a revolver raised it at armslength he drew it down before his eye until the sights crept into alignment and held it there for a throbbing second then he smiled mirthlessly for his hand had not shown the slightest tremor donnelly was waiting as blake walked into headquarters and exhuming a box of cigars from the remotest depths of a desk drawer he offered them saying ive sent oconnell over to reconnoiter theres no use of our starting out until he locates sabella you neednt be so suspicious of those perfectos they wont bite you the last one you gave me did precisely that must have been one of my cooking cigars i keep two kinds one for callers and one for friends then if this is a flor de friendship ill accept blake said with a laugh i see mr dreux didnt change his mind and decide to join us no this is a little too rough for bernie he very cheerfully acknowledged that he was afraid narcone might recognize me and make trouble i thought of that donnelly acknowledged is there any chance in the depths of blakes consciousness something cried out fearfully in the affirmative but he replied hardly he never saw me except indistinctly and that was nearly five years ago he might recall my name but i dare say not without an introduction which isnt necessary do you think you will know him ii have reason to think i will the chief grunted with satisfaction a funny little fellow that dreux he remarked wasnt it his father who fought a duel with colonel hammond from baton rouge the same they used shotguns at forty yards colonel hammond was killed humph and he was afraid to go with us tonight oh he makes no secret of his cowardice well a mule is a mule a coward is a coward and a gambler is a sonofagun paraphrased the chief if he hasnt any courage he cant force it into himself do you think so i know so ive seen it tried some people are born cowards and cant help themselves as for me i was never troubled much that way i suppose you find it the same too no my only consolation lies in thinking its barely possible the other fellow may be as badly frightened as i am donnelly scoffed openly i never saw a man stand up better than you why ive touted you as the gamest chap i ever saw do you remember that dago misetti who jumped from here into your parish when you were sheriff blake smiled im not likely to forget him you walked into a gun that day when you knew hed use it he didnt though at least not much perhaps he was as badly rattled as i was have it your own way the chief said but that reminds me hes out again indeed i hadnt heard you knew of course we couldnt convict him for that killing we had a perfect case but the mafia cleared him same old story perjury alibis and juryfixing we put him away for resisting an officer though they couldnt stop us there but theyve sprung him and hes back in town again damn such people with over two hundred italian outrages of various kinds in this city up to date i can count the convictions on the fingers of one hand the rest of the country is beginning to notice it it is a serious matter blake acknowledged and it is affecting the business interests of the city we see that every day if i had a free hand id tincan every dago in new orleans nonsense theyre not all bad the great majority of them are good industrious lawabiding people its a comparatively small criminal element that does the mischief you think so eh well if you held down this job for a year youd be ready to swear theyre all blackmailers and murderers if theyre so honest and peaceable why dont they come out and help us run down the malefactors thats not their way no you bet it isnt donnelly affirmed things are getting worse every day the reformers dont have to call my attention to it im wise so far they have confined their operations to their own people but whats to prevent them from spreading out some day those italians will break over and tackle us americans and then there will be hell to pay ill be blamed for not holding them in check why youve no idea of the completeness of their organization it has a thousand branches and it takes in some of their very best people i dare say you think this mafia is some dago secret society with lodgerooms and grips and passwords and a picnic once a year well i tell you you neednt tell me anything about la mafia blake interrupted gravely i know as much about it perhaps as you do something ought to be done to choke off this flood of european criminal immigration believe me i realize what you are up against dan and i know as you know that la mafia will beat you im damned if it will exploded the officer the policing of this city is under my charge and if those people want to live here among us the telephone bell rang and donnelly broke off to answer it hello is that you oconnell good stick around the neighborhood well be right over he hung up the receiver and explained oconnell has him marked out wed better go it was not until they were well on their way that norvin thought to mention the letter which he had wished to see oh yes i meant to show it to you said donnelly but theres nothing unusual about it except perhaps the signature i thought you said it was anonymous well it is its merely signed one who knows does it mention an associate of narcone a man named cardi no whos he i dare say at least a hundred thousand people have asked that same question briefly norvin told what he knew of the reputed chief of the banditti of the terrors his name inspired in sicily and of his supposed connection with the murder of savigno once or twice a year i hear from colonel neri he added but he informs me that cardi has never returned to the island so it occurred to me that he too might be in new orleans its very likely that he is and if he was a capomafia there hes probably the same here lord id like to get inside of that outfit id go through it like a sandstorm by this time they had threaded the narrow thoroughfares of the old quarter and were nearing the vicinity of st phillip street the heart of what donnelly called dagotown there was little to distinguish this part of the city from that through which they had come there were the same dingy wrinkled houses with their odd little balconies and ornamental iron galleries overhanging the sidewalks and peering into one anothers faces as if to see what their neighbors were up to the same queer musty dusty shops dozing amid violent foreign odors the same open doorways and tunnellike entrances leading to paved courtyards at the rear the steep roofs were tiled and mossgrown the pavements were of huge stone flags set in between seams of mud and so unevenly placed as to make traffic impossible save by the light of day alongside the walks were open sewers in which the foul and sluggish current was setting not toward but away from the riverfront the district was peopled by shadows and mystery it abounded in strange sights and sounds and smells at the corner of royal and dumaine they found oconnell loitering in a doorway and with a word he directed them to a small cafe and wineshop in the next block a moment later they pushed through swinging doors and entered donnelly nodded to the whitehaired italian behind the bar and led the way back to a vacant table against the wall where he and norvin seated themselves there were perhaps a halfdozen similar tables in the room at some of which men were eating but it was late for supper and for the most part the occupants were either drinking or playing cards there was a momentary pause in the babble of conversation as the two stalked boldly in and a score of suspicious glances were leveled at them for the chief was well known in the italian quarter the proprietor came bustling toward the newcomers with an obsequious smile upon his grizzled features taking the end of his apron he wiped the surface of their table dry at the same time informing donnelly in broken english that he was honored by the privilege of serving him donnelly ordered a bottle of wine then drew an envelope from his pocket and began making figures upon it leaning forward and addressing his companion confidentially to the complete disregard of his surroundings norvin glued his eyes upon the paper nodding now and then as if in agreement although he had taken but one hasty glance around the cafe upon entering he had seen a certain heavymuscled sicilian whose face was only too familiar it was narcone without a doubt blake had seen that brutal lustcoarsened countenance too many times in his dreams to be mistaken and while his one and only glimpse had been secured in a halflight his mind at that instant had been so unnaturally sensitized that the photograph remained clear and unfading he could feel narcone staring at him now as he sat nodding to the senseless patter of the chief in a sort of breathless terrifying suspense would his own face recall to the fellows mind that night in the forest of terranova and set his fears aflame blakes reason told him that such a thing was beyond the faintest probability yet the flesh upon his back was crawling as if in anticipation of a knifethrust nevertheless he lit a cigar and held the match between fingers which did not tremble he was fighting his usual senseless battle and he was winning when the proprietor set the bottle in front of him he filled both glasses with a firm hand and then still listening to donnellys words he settled back in his chair and let his eyes rove casually over the room he encountered narcones evil gaze when the glass was halfway to his lips and returned it boldly for an instant it filled him with an odd satisfaction to note that not a ripple disturbed the red surface of the wine have you made him donnelly inquired under his breath blake nodded the tall fellow at the third table thats him all right agreed the chief he doesnt remember you i didnt expect him to ive changed considerably and besides he never saw me distinctly as i told you before youve got the policemans eye declared donnelly with enthusiasm i wanted you to pick him out by yourself well go now as soon as we lap up this dago vinegar out in the street again blake heaved a sigh of relief for even this little harmless adventure had been a trial to his unruly nerves well drift past the red wing club its a hangout of mine and i want to talk further with you said donnelly they turned back towards the heart of the city stopping a moment while the chief directed oconnell to keep a close watch upon narcone the red wing club was not really a club at all but a small restaurant which had become known for certain of its culinary specialties and had gathered to itself a somewhat select clientele of bons vivants who dined there after the leisurely continental fashion thither the two men betook themselves i cant see what real good those extradition papers are going to do you even now that youre sure of your man said norvin as soon as they were seated it wont be difficult to arrest him but to extradite him will prove quite another matter im not eager myself to take the stand against him for obvious reasons donnelly nodded his appreciation i will do so if necessary of course but my evidence wont counterbalance all the testimony sabella will be able to bring we know hes the man his friends know it but theyll unite to swear he is really vito sabella a gentle sweet soul whom they knew in sicily and theyll prove he was here in america at the time martel savigno was murdered if we had him in new york away from his friends it would be different hed go back to sicily and once there hed hang as he deserves donnelly swore under his breath its the thing i run foul of every time i try to enforce the law against these people but just the same im going to get this fellow somehow for hes one of the gang that fired into the pallozzos and killed tony alto thats another thing i know but cant prove what made you ask if that letter was written by a woman has sabella a sweetheart not to my knowledge i norvin hesitated no sabella has no sweetheart but savigno had i havent told you much of that part of my story its no use my trying to give you an idea of what kind of woman the countess of terranova was or is you wouldnt understand its enough to say that she is a woman of extraordinary character wholly devoted to martels memory and sicilian to the backbone after her lovers death when the police had failed she swore to be avenged upon his murderers i know it sounds strange but it didnt seem so strange to me then i tried to reason with her but it was a waste of breath when i returned to sicily after my mother died margherita the countess had disappeared i tried every means to find her you know martel left her in a way under my care but i couldnt locate her in any italian city then i learned that she had come to the united states and took up the search on this side its a long story the gist of it is simply that i looked up every possibility and finally gave up in despair that was more than four years ago i have no idea that all this has any connection with our present problem donnelly listened with interest and for a time plied blake with shrewd questions but at length the subject seemed to lose its importance in his mind its a queer coincidence he said but the letter was mailed in this city and by some one familiar with narcones movements up to date if your countess was here youd surely know it this isnt new york besides women dont make good detectives they get discouraged i dare say she went back to italy long ago and is married now with a dozen or more little counts and countesses around her i agree with you said blake that she cant be the one who knows there are too many easier explanations and i couldnt hope he checked himself well i guess ive told you about all i know call on me at any time that i can be of assistance he left rather abruptly struggling with a sense of selfdisgust in that he had been led to talk of margherita unnecessarily yet with a curious undercurrent of excitement running through his mood x myra nell warren miss myra nell warren seldom commenced her toilet with that feeling of pleasurable anticipation common to most girls of her age not that she failed to appreciate her own good looks for she did not but because in order to attain the desired effects she was forced to exercise a nice discrimination which can be appreciated only by those who have attempted to keep up appearances upon an income never equal to ones requirements she had many dresses to be sure but they were as familiar to her as family portraits and even among her most blinded admirers they had been known to stir the chords of remembrance then too they were always getting lost for myra nell had a way of scattering other things than her affections she had often likened her dresses to an army of central american troops for mere ragged abundance in which there lay no real fighting strength having been molded to fit the existing fashions in ladies clothes and bred to a careless extravagance poverty brought the girl many complexities and worries tonight however she was in a very happy frame of mind as she began dressing and bernie hearing her singing blithely paused outside her door to inquire the cause cant you guess stupid she replied umm i didnt know he was coming well he is and bernie have you seen my white satin slippers how in the world should i see them it isnt them it is just him ive discovered one under the bed but the other has disappeared gone skedaddled do rummage around and find it for me wont you i think its downstairs my dear child her brother began in mild exasperation how can it be downstairs the door of myra nells room burst open suddenly and a very animated face peered around the edge at him because i left it there purposely i kicked it off it hurt at least i think i did although im not sure i kicked it off somewhere miss warrens words had a way of rushing forth head over heels in a glad frolicky manner which was most delightful although somewhat damaging to grammar but she was too enthusiastic to waste time on grammar life forever pressed her too closely to allow repose of thought of action or of speech now dont get huffy honey she ran on if you only knew how ive oh goody youre going out i was going out but of course now dont be silly he isnt coming to see you bernie exclaimed in a shocked voice myra nell you know i never leave you to entertain your callers alone it isnt proper she sighed it isnt proper to entertain them on one foot like a stork either do be a dear now and find my slipper ive worn myself to the bone i positively have hunting for it and im in tears very well he said ill look but why dont you take care of your things the idea she pouted a pair of red lips at him slammed the door in his face and began singing joyously once more what dress are you going to wear he called to her that white one with all the chiffon missing what has become of the chiffon he demanded sternly i must have stepped on it at the dance i in fact i know i did of course you saved it oh yes but i cant find it now if you could only no he cried firmly and dashed down the stairs two steps at a time from the lower hall he called up to her wear the new one and be sure to let me see you before he comes bernie sighed as he hung up his hat for he had looked forward through a dull disappointing day to an evening with felicite delord she was expecting him she would be greatly disappointed he sighed a second time for he was far from happy life seemed to be one long constant worry over money matters and myra nell being a prim orderly man he intensely disliked searching for mislaid articles but he began a systematic hunt for knowing myra nells peculiar irresponsibility he was prepared to find the missing slipper anywhere between the hammock on the front gallery and the kitchen in the rear however a full halfhours search failed to discover it he had been under most of the furniture and was both hot and dusty when she came bouncing in upon him miss warren never walked nor glided nor swayed sinuously as languorous southern society belles are supposed to do she romped and bounced and she was chattering amiably at this moment here i am bunny decked out like an empress the new dress is a duck and im ravishing perfectly ravishing eh what he wriggled out from beneath the horsehair sofa rose and wiping the perspiration from his brow pointed with a trembling finger at her feet there there it is he said in a terrible tone thats it on your foot oh yes i found it right after you came downstairs she burst out laughing at his disheveled appearance i forgot you were looking but come admire me she revolved before his eyes and he smiled delightedly in truth miss warren presented a picture to bring admiration into any eye and although she was entirely lacking in poise and dignity her constant restless vivacity and the witchlike spirit of laughter that possessed her were quite as engaging she was a madcap flyaway creature whose ravishing lace was framed by an unruly mop of dark hair which no amount of attention could hold in place little dancing curls and wisps and ringlets were forever escaping in coquettish fashion bernie regarded her critically from head to foot absentmindedly brushing from his own immaculate person the dust which bore witness to his sisters housekeeping in his eyes this girl was more than a queen she was a sort of deity and she could do no wrong he was by no means an admirable man himself but he saw in her all the virtues which he lacked and his simple devotion was touching you didnt comb your hair he said severely oh i did i combed it like mad but the hairpins pop right out she exclaimed anyway there werent enough well i found some on the piano he said so ill fix you with deft fingers he secured the stray locks which were escaping working as skilfully as a hairdresser oh but youre a nuisance she told him as she accepted his aid with the fidgety impatience of a restless boy theyll pop right out again they wouldnt if you didnt jerk and flirt around flirt indeed bunny bunny what an idea she kissed him with a resounding smack squarely upon the end of his thin nose then flounced over to the oldfashioned haircloth sofa now mr dreux abhorred the name of bunny and above all things he abominated myra nells method of saluting him upon the nose but she only laughed at his exclamation of disgust saying well well you havent told me how nice i look there is no possible hope for him he acknowledged the gown fits very nicely too chloe did it she cut it off and sewed on the doodads the what the ruffly things myra nell sighed its hard to make a dressmaker out of a cook her soul never rises above fried chicken and light bread but she did pretty well this time almost as well as do you know bunny youd have made a dandy dressmaker my dear child he said in scandalized tones you get more slangy every day its not ladylike i know but it gets you there quicker lordy i hope he doesnt keep me waiting until i get all wrinkled up why dont you go out and have a good time ill entertain him you know i wouldnt leave you alone she made a little laughing grimace at him and said well then if you must stay ill keep him out on the gallery all to myself its a lovely night and besides the drawingroom is getting to smell musty mind you dont get into any mischief she bounced up from the sofa and gave his ear a playful tweak with her pink fingers then danced out into the drawingroom where she rattled off a part of a piano selection at breakneck speed ending in the middle with a crash and finally flung open the long french blinds the next instant he heard her swinging furiously in the hammock bernie smiled fondly as a mother smiles and his pinched little face was glorified then he sighed for a third time as he thought of felicite delord and regretfully settled himself down to a dull and solitary evening the library had long since been denuded of its valuable books in the same way that the old frame mansion had lost its finer furniture piece by piece as some whim of its mistress made a sacrifice necessary in consequence about all that remained now to afford bernie amusement were certain works on art which had no market value selecting one of these he lit a cigarette and lost himself among the old masters when norvin blake came up the walk beneath the liveoak and magnolia trees myra nell met him at the top of the steps and her cool fresh loveliness struck him as something extremely pleasant to look upon after his heated bustling day on the exchange bernies in the library feasting on spanish masters so if you dont mind well sit out here she told him ill be delighted he assured her in that way i may be seen and so excite the jealousy of certain fellows who have been monopolizing you lately a little jealousy is a good thing so ill help you but they dont have it in them theyre as calm and placid as bayou water blake was fond of mildly teasing the girl about her popularity assuming as an old friend a whimsically injured tone she could never be sure how much or little his speeches meant but being an outrageous little coquette herself she seldom put much confidence in any ones words tell me he went on i havent seen you for a week who are you engaged to now the idea im never really engaged that is hardly ever then there is a terrible misapprehension at large oh im always misapprehended even bernie misapprehends me he thinks im frivolous and lightminded but im not im really very serious im im almost morose he laughed at her you dont mean to deny you have a bewildering train of admirers perhaps but i dont like to think of them you see it takes years to collect a real train of admirers and it argues that a girl is a fixture thats something i wont be im beginning to feel like one of the sights of the city such as bernie points out to his northern tourists of course youre the exception i dont think weve ever been engaged have we umm i believe not i dont care to be considered eccentric however it isnt too late bernie wouldnt allow it for a moment and besides youre too serious a girl should never engage herself to a seriousminded man unless shes really ready to marry him how true by the way she chattered on what in the world have you done to bernie he has talked nothing but mafia and murders and vendettas ever since he saw you the other day he told you about meeting donnelly in my office yes hes become tremendously interested in the italian question all at once he reads all the papers and he haunts the foreign quarter he tells me we have a fearful condition of affairs here of course i dont know what hes talking about but hes very much in earnest and wants to help mr donnelly do something or other kill somebody i judge really i didnt suppose he cared for such things neither did i but your story worked him all up of course i read about you long ago and thats how i knew you were a hero when you returned from abroad i was simply smothered with excitement until i met you the idea of your fighting with bandits and all that but tell me did you discover that murderer creature yes we identified him ohh the girl fairly wriggled with eagerness and he had to smile at her as she leaned forward waiting for details bernie said you asked him to go but he was afraid i i wish youd take me the next time fancy what did he do was he a tall dangerouslooking man did he grind his teeth at you no no norvin briefly explained the very ordinary happenings of his trip with the chief of police to which she listened with her usual intensity of interest in the subject of the moment you wont have to testify against him in those whatdoyoucallem proceedings she asked as soon as he had finished extradition why why theyll blow you up or do something dreadful i suppose ill have to donnelly is bent on arresting him and i owe something to the memory of mattel savigno you mustnt she exclaimed with a gravity quite surprising in her when bernie told me what it might lead to it frightened me nearly to death he says this mafia is a perfectly awful affair you wont get mixed up in it will you please the girl who was speaking now was not the myra nell he knew her tone of real concern struck him very agreeably beneath her customary mood of intoxication with the joy of living he had occasionally caught fleeting glimpses of a really unusual depth of feeling and the thought that she was concerned for his welfare filled him with a selfish gladness nevertheless he answered her truly i cant promise that i rather feel that i owe it to martel hes dead that sounds brutal but i owe something also to those he left behind you mean that sicilian woman that countess i suppose you know im horribly jealous of her i didnt know it i am just think of it a real countess with a castle and dozens thousands of gorgeous dresses was she beautiful very dont say it that way goodness how i hate her miss warren flounced back into the corner of the hammock and norvin said with a laugh no wonder you have a train of suitors ive never seen a really beautiful italian woman except vittoria fabrizi of course your friend the nurse yes and shes not really italian shes just like anybody else she was here to see me again this afternoon by the way its her day off at the hospital you know i want you to meet her youll fall desperately in love really im not interested in trained nurses and i wouldnt want you to hate her as you hate the countess oh i couldnt hate vittoria shes such a dear she saved my life you know nonsense you only had a sprained ankle yes but it was a perfectly odious sprain nobody knows how i suffered and to think it was all bernies fault how so you fell off a horse i did not indignantly declared miss warren i was thrown hurled flung violently projected and then i was frightfully trampled by a snorting steed norvin laughed heartily at this for he knew the rickety old family horse very well by sight and the picture she conjured up was amusing how do you manage to blame it on bernie he inquired well he forbade me to ride horseback so of course i had to do it oh i see i fixed up a perfectly ravishing habit i couldnt ask bernie to buy me one since he refused to let me ride so i made a skirt out of our grandpiano cover it was miles long and a darling shade of green when it came to a hat i was stumped until i thought of bernies silk one no mother ever loved a child as he loved that hat you know i twisted his evening scarf around it and the effect was really stunning it floated beautifully babylon and i formed a picture i can tell you i call the horse babylon because hes such an old ruin but i dont believe any one ever rode him before he didnt seem to know what it was all about he was very bony too and he stuck out in places i suppose we would have gotten along all right if i hadnt tried to make him prance he wouldnt do it so i jabbed him jabbed him myra nell nodded vigorously with my hatpin i didnt mean to hurt him but oh my he isnt nearly so old as we think i suppose the surprise did it anyhow he became a raging demon in a second and when they picked me up i had a sprained ankle and the piano cover was a sight i suppose babylon ran away no he was standing there with one foot right through bernies high hat that was the terrible part of it all i had to pretend i was nearly killed just to take bernies mind off the hat i stayed in bed for the longest time i was afraid to get up and he got vittoria fabrizi to wait on me so thats how i met her you cant linger along with your life in a persons hands for weeks at a time without getting attached to her i was sorry for babylon so i had chloe put a poultice on his back where i jabbed him now id like to know if that isnt bernies fault he should have allowed me to ride and then i wouldnt have wanted to poor boy he was the one to suffer after all hed planned to take a trip somewhere but of course he couldnt do that and pay for a trained nurse too myra nells allusion to her brothers financial condition reminded blake of the subject which had been uppermost in his mind all evening and he decided to broach it now subsequent to his last talk with dreux he had thought a good deal about that proffered loan and had come to regard bernies refusal as unwarranted to be queen of the carnival was an honor given to but few young women and one that would probably never come to miss warren again so even at the risk of offending her halfbrother he had decided to lay the matter before myra nell herself she ought at least to have in later years the consoling thought that she had once refused the royal scepter he hoped however that her persuasion added to his own would bring dreux to a change of heart if youll promise to make no scene refrain from hysterics and all that he began warningly ill tell you some good news how silly im an iceberg i never get excited she declared well then how would you like to be queen of the next mardi gras myra nell gasped faintly in the darkness and sat boltupright you youre joking thats no answer i i do you mean it oh she was out of the hammock now and poised tremblingly before him like a bird honestly youre not fooling norvin you dear duck she clapped her hands together gleefully and began to dance up and down iim going to scream remember your promise oh but queen queen why im dreaming i must scream i gather from these rapt incoherences that youd like it like it you silly like it havent i lived for it havent i dreamed about it ever since t was a baby wouldnt any girl give her eyes to be queen she seemed upon the verge of kissing him perhaps upon the nose but changed her mind and went dancing around his chair like some moonmad sprite he seized her barely in time to prevent her from crying the news aloud to bernie explaining hastily that she must breathe no word to any one for the time being and must first win her brothers consent it was very difficult to impress her with the fact that the carnival was still a long way off and that bernie was yet to be reckoned with as if there could be any question of my accepting she chattered dear dear why shouldnt i and it was lovely of you to arrange it for me too oh i know you did so you neednt deny it i hope youre to be rex wouldnt that be splendid but of course you wouldnt tell me i can tell you this much that i am not to be king now i have already spoken to bernie the wretch he never breathed a word of it hes afraid he cant afford it oh la la hell have to ill die if he refuses just die you know i will well bring him around between us you talk to him after i go and the next time i see him ill clinch matters youll make the most gorgeous of queens myra nell you think so she blushed prettily in the gloom ill have to be very dignified the train is as long as a hall carpet and ill have to walk this way she illustrated the royal step bowing to him with a regal inclination of her dark head and then broke out into rippling life and laughter so infectious that he felt he was a boy once more the girls unaffected spontaneity was her most adorable trait she was like a dancing ray of sunshine and underneath her blithesome carelessness was a fine clean tender nature blake watched her with his eyes alight for all men loved myra nell warren and it was conceded among those who worshiped at her shrine that he who finally received her love in return for his would be favored far above his kind she was closer to him tonight than ever before she seemed to reach out and take him into her warm confidence while he felt her appeal more strongly than at any time in their acquaintance of course she did not let him do much talking she never did that and now her head was full of dreams of delirious anticipations of splendid visions at last when she had thanked him in as many ways as she could think of for his kindness and the time drew near for him to leave she fell serious in a most abrupt manner and then to his great surprise referred once again to his affair with the mafia it seems to me that my joy would be supreme tonight if i knew you would drop that italian matter she said the consequences may be terrible and i dont want you to get into trouble ill be careful he told her but as she stood with her hand in his she looked up at him with eyes which were no longer sparkling with fun but deep and dark with shadows saying gently is there nothing which would induce you to change your mind thats not a fair question i shall be worried to death and i detest worry theres no necessity for the least bit of concern he assured her but there was a plaintive wrinkle upon her brow as she watched him swing down the walk to the street as blake strolled homeward he began to reflect that this charming intimacy with myra nell warren could not go much farther without doing her an injustice the time was rapidly nearing when he would have to make up his mind either to have very much more or very much less of her society he was undeniably fond of her for she not only interested him but what is far rarer and quite as important she amused him moreover she was of his own people the very music of her southern speech soothed his ear in contrast with the harsh accents of his northern acquaintances the thought came to him with a profound appeal that she might grow to love him with that unswerving faithfulness which distinguishes the southern woman and yet strangely enough when he retired that night it was not with her picture in his mind but that of a splendid tawny sicilian girl with lips as fresh as a halfopened flower and eyes as deep as the sea xi the kidnapping bernie dreux appeared at blakes office on the following afternoon with a sour look upon his face norvin had known he would come but hardly expected myra nell to win her victory so easily without waiting for the little man to speak he began i know what youre here for and i know just what youre going to tell me so proceed run me through with your reproaches i offer no resistance do you think you acted very decently dreux inquired my dear bernie a crown was at stake a crown of thorns for me it means bankruptcy then you have consented good i knew you would of course you knew i would thats what makes your trick so abominable i didnt think it of you thats because you dont know my depravity few people do it would serve you right if i accepted your loan and never paid you back it would indeed blake laughingly laid his hand upon his friends shoulder whats more that is exactly what i would do in your place id borrow all i could and give my sister her one supreme hour free from all disturbing fears and embarrassments then id tell the impertinent meddler who was to blame for my trouble to go whistle for his satisfaction of course miss myra nell doesnt suspect oh heaven forbid piously exclaimed dreuix now how much will you need i dont know some fabulous sum there will be gowns and luncheons and carriages and entertaining i will have to figure it out do then double it and thanks awfully for coming to your senses thats just the point i havent come to them im perfectly insane to consider it bernie declared savagely but what can i do when she looks at me with her eyes like stars and and he waved his hands hopelessly its mighty decent of you but understand i consider it a dastardly trick and im horribly offended exactly and i dont blame you but your sister deserves a crown for her royal gift of youth and sweetness as for being offended since you are not one of the mafia i am not afraid do you know said bernie i have been thinking about this mafia matter ever since i saw you im tremendously interested and i im beginning to feel the dawning of a civic spirit remarkable eh you know i havent many interests and id like to to take a hand in running down these miscreants ive always had an ambition ever since i was a child to be a dont laugh now this is a confession ive always wanted to be a detective he looked very grave and at the same time a little shamefaced do you suppose donnelly could make me one well this is rather startling said blake with difficulty restraining a desire to laugh i i can wear disguises wonderfully well bernie went on wistfully i learned when i was in college theatricals i was really very good and you see i might earn a lot of money that way i understand there are tremendous rewards offered for trainrobbers and that sort of people no one need know of course and no one would ever suspect me of being a minion of the law thats true enough but im afraid detectives in real life dont wear false beards its a pretty mean occupation i fancy do you seriously think you are er fitted for it heavens im no good at anything else and im perfectly wonderful at worming secrets out of people this mafia matter would give me a great opportunity i think ill try it these italians have no sense of humor you know something disagreeable might happen if you went prowling around them oh of course id quit if they discovered my intentions my game when we were talking of such things the other day i said i was a coward but really im not ive a frightful temper when im roused really fiendish as a matter of fact ive he smiled sheepishly and tapped his slender higharched foot with his rattan cane ive already begun blake settled back in his chair without a word im taking italian lessons from myra nells nurse miss fabrizi shes a very superior woman for a nurse and she knows all about the mafia quite an inspiration i call it thinking of her im working her for informa for a clue he winked one eye gravely and norvin gasped bernie suddenly seemed very secretive very different from his usual self it was the first time blake had ever seen him give this particular facial demonstration and the effect was much as if some benevolent old lady had winked brazenly well he exclaimed i dont know what to say there is nothing to say mr dreux answered in a vastly selfsatisfied tone im going to offer my services to donnelly in confidence of course im glad you introduced us for otherwise id have to arrange to meet him properly if he doesnt want me ill proceed unaided when his caller had gone blake gave way to the hearty laughter he had been smothering dwelling with keen enjoyment upon the probable result of bernies interview with the chief dan he was sure would not hurt the little mans feelings so he felt no obligation to interfere although he was expecting to hear from donnelly at any moment regarding the narcone matter it was not until two weeks after their nocturnal excursion to the italian quarter that the chief came to see him he brought unexpected news weve had a run of luck he began ive verified the information in that letter and found that those extradition papers for narcone are really in new york whats more theres an italian detective there on another matter and hes ready to take our man back to sicily with him really narcone it seems was in new york for a year before he came here thats why steps were taken to extradite him then he evidently got suspicious and came south anyhow the plank is all greased and if we land him in that city hell go back to sicily i see all thats necessary is to invite him to run up there and be arrested it seems to me youre just where you were two weeks ago dan unfortunately this doesnt happen to be new york and youve still got to solve the important problem of getting him there im going to kidnap him said the chief quietly what youre joking not a bit of it but kidnapping it isnt done any more its not even considered the thing in police circles i believe youll be stealing children next like any mafioso donnelly grinned thats where i got the idea this same narcone is mixed up in the domenchino case the kid has been gone nearly a month now but the father wont help us he made a roar at the start but they evidently got to him and now he declares that the boy must have strayed away to the riverfront and been drowned well it occurred to me to treat that quatrone gang to some of its own medicine by stealing their ringleader theres poetic justice in the idea that is if narcone was really connected with the disappearance of the child oh he was connected with it all right ordinary blackmail was getting too slow for the outfit so they went after a good ransom now that old domenchino has kicked up such a row theyre afraid to come through and have probably murdered the child thats what he fears at any rate and thats why he wont help us its shocking but tell me is this plan your own or did bernie dreux suggest it donnelly laughed silently so you knew hed turned fly cop i thought id split when he came to me i hope you didnt offend him oh not at all those little milliners are mighty sensitive i told him he had the makings of another le coq but the force was full i suggested that he work on the outside and set him to watching a certain dago fruitstand on canal street why that particular stand because its owned by one of our men and he cant come to any harm there he reports every day but narcone are you really in earnest about this scheme i am its our only chance to land him and ive got to accomplish something or quit drawing my salary heres the layout the pinkertons have an operative who knew sabella in new york they were friends in fact this fellow arrived here two hours ago calls himself corte hes to renew his acquaintance with our man and explain that he is returning to new york in a week the day he sails we grab mr narcone hustle him aboard ship and corte will see to the rest if it works right nobodyll know anything about it until narcone is at sea when it will be too late for interference its old stuff but itll work from what he knew of the sicilian bandit blake felt a certain doubt as to the practicability of this plan yet he was relieved to learn that he would not be called upon to testify he therefore expressed himself as gratified at the change of procedure it was partly to spare you the chief replied that i decided on this course i want you to help me though in what way well it will naturally take some force narcone wont go willingly i want you to help me take him instantly those fears which had been lulled in norvins breast leaped into turmoil the same sick surge of emotions rose and he felt himself quailing after an instants pause he said ill act any part you cast me for but dont you think it is work for trained officers like you and this corte thats exactly the point narcone may put up a fight and i have more confidence in you when it comes to a pinch than in any man i know cortes job is to get him down to the dock and i cant ask any of my men to take a hand with me for its well not exactly regular besides i may need a witness donnelly hesitated if i do need one ill want some man whose word will carry more weight than that of a policeman you understand he leveled his blue eyes at blake and they looked particularly smoky and cold you mean the quatrones may try to break you something like that suppose narcone er resists donnelly shrugged we cant very well kill him thats what makes it hard i knew you had as much at stake as i so i felt sure youd help blake heard himself assuring the officer that he had not been mistaken but it was not his own voice that reached his ears and when his caller had gone he found himself sitting limply in his chair numb with horror at his own temerity as he looked back upon it blaming himself for his too ready agreement he realized that several mingling emotions had been at the root of it in the first place he had said yes because his craven spirit had screamed no so loudly he felt that the project was not only dangerous but impracticable yet something which he chose to term his overwill had warned him that he must not upon any account give way to fear lest he weaken his already insecure hold upon himself again donnelly had appealed to him in a way hard to resist he was not only flattered by the chiefs high regard for his courage but grateful to him for having relieved him of the notoriety and possible consequences of a public proceeding most of all perhaps his final acquiescence had been an instinctive reaction of rage and disgust at the part of his nature that he hated he struck at it as a man strikes at a snake but now that he was irrevocably pledged his reason broke and fled leaving him a prey to his imagination what he wondered would narcone do when he saw his life at stake when he recognized in one of his captors the man he had craved to kill in the forest of terranova there would in all probability be a physical struggle perhaps he would find his own flabby muscles pitted against the mighty thews of the sicilian butcher at the thought he felt again the melting horror which had weakened him on that unspeakable night when narcone had turned from wiping the warm blood from his hands to glare into his face blake feared that the memories would return to betray him at the last moment that would mean that he would be left naked of the reputation he had guarded so jealously and a far worse calamity that his rebellious nature would finally triumph one defeat he knew implied total overthrow he tried to reason that he was magnifying the danger that narcone would be easily handled that other criminals as desperate had been taken without a struggle but the instant such grains of comfort touched the healed terrors in his mind they vanished like drops of water sprinkled upon an incandescent furnace nevertheless he was pledged and he knew that he would go he had barely gotten himself under a semblance of control two days later when donnelly called him up by telephone to advise him in cautious terms that affairs were nearing a climax and to warn him to make ready this served to throw him into a renewed panic it required a tremendous effort to concentrate upon his business affairs and it took the genius of an actor to carry him through the inconsequent details of his everyday life without betrayal alone at home upon the crowded change in deadlydull directors meetings that sinister shadow overhung him these long leaden hours of suspense were doing what nothing else had been able to do since he took himself definitely in hand they were harder to bear than any of those disciplinary experiences which had turned his hair white and burned his youth to an ash at last donnelly came corte has framed it for tomorrow he announced with evident satisfaction tomorrow norvin echoed faintly yes hes sailing on the philadelphia at eleven oclock no stops between here and new york theyll be waiting for narcone at quarantine im glad its time to do something donnelly rubbed his palms together and showed his teeth in a smile corte says hell have him at the cromwell line docks without fail so that will save us grabbing him on the street and holding him until sailing time if we pull it off quietly at the last minute nobodyll know anything about it youd better be at my office by nine in case anything goes wrong you may count on me blake answered in a tone that gave no hint of his inward flinching but once alone he found that his nerves would not allow him to work he closed his desk and went home when the heat of the afternoon diminished he took out his saddlehorse and went for a gallop thinking in this way to blow some of the tortured fancies out of his mind but he did not succeed despite his agitation he ate a hearty dinner much as a condemned man devours his last meal but he could not sleep all night he alternately tossed in his bed or paced his room restlessly his features working his body shivering he ate breakfast however with an apparent appetite that delighted his colored servant and as the clock struck nine he walked into donnellys office smoking a cigar which he did not taste i havent heard anything further from corte so well go down to the dock the chief informed him on the way to the riverfront blake continued to smoke silently giving a careful ear to donnellys final directions when they reached their destination he waited while dan went aboard the ship in search of the captain in those days rail transportation had not developed into its present proportions and new orleans was even more interesting as a shippingpoint than now along the levee stretched rows of craft from every port big black ocean liners barques and brigantines fruit steamers from the tropics and a tremendous flotilla of flatnosed river steamers with their huge tows of barges the cavernous sheds that lined the embankment echoed to a thunder of rumbling trucks of clanking winches of stamping hoofs while through and above it all came the cries and songs of a multitude of roustabouts and deckhands down the gangways of the philadelphia a thin continuous line of dusky truckmen was moving a growing chaos of trunks and smaller baggage on the dock indicated that her passengerlist was heavy blake watched the shifting scene with little interest now and then casting an unseeing eye over the ramparts of cotton bales near by but although he was outwardly calm his palms were cold and wet and his mind was working with a panicky swiftness donnelly reappeared with the assurance that all was arranged with the ships master and taking their stand where they could observe what went on they settled themselves to wait again the moments dragged again blake fought his usual weary battle he envied donnelly his utter impassivity for the officer betrayed no more feeling than as if he were standing rod in hand waiting for a fish to strike an hour passed bringing no sign of their men although a stream of passengers was filing aboard and the piles of baggage were diminishing norvin struggled with the desire to voice his misgivings which were taking the form of hopes donnelly chewed tobacco and occasionally spat accurately at a knothole his companion watched him curiously then without warning the chief stirred and there in the crowd norvin suddenly saw the tall figure of gian narcone with another man evidently a sicilian beside him thats corte donnelly said quietly the two watchers mingled with the crowd gradually drawing closer to their quarry but it seemed that narcone refused to go aboard with his friend at any rate he made no move in that direction the philadelphia blew a warning blast the remaining passengers quickened their movements there was but little baggage left now upon the deck and still the two italians stood talking volubly donnelly waited stolidly near by never glancing at his man blake held himself with an iron grip although his heartthrobs were choking him it was plain that corte also was beginning to feel the strain and norvin began to fear that donnelly would delay too long at last the pinkerton man stooped and raised his valise then extended his hand to the mafioso donnelly edged closer blake knew that the moment for action had come and found that without any exercise of willpower he too was closing in his mind was working at such high speed that time seemed to halt and wait donnelly was within armslength of narcone before he spoke then he said quietly going to leave the city sabella eh the sicilian started his eyes leaped to the speaker and the smile died from his heavy features recognizing the officer however he pulled at the visor of his cap and said brokenly no no signore my friend goes come now the chief said grimly i want you to tell me something about the domenchino boy narcone recoiled colliding with blake who instantly locked his arm within his own simultaneously donnelly seized the other wrist repeating you know who stole the little domenchino the tension which had leaped into the giant muscles died away narcone shrugged his shoulders crying excitedly in his native tongue before god you wrong me it was the instant for which his captor had planned the ruse had worked there was a deft movement on donnellys part something snapped metallically and the manacles of the law were upon the murderer of martel savigno it had all been accomplished quietly quickly even those standing near by hardly noticed it and those who did were unaware of the significance of the arrest but once his man was safely ironed the chiefs manner changed and in the next instant the prisoner caught perhaps from the eye of corte the stoolpigeon some fleeting hint that he had been betrayed following that came the suspicion that he had been seized not for complicity in the domenchino affair but for something far more significant with a furious snarling cry he flung himself backward and raised his manacled hands to strike but it was too late for effective resistance they took him across the gangplank screaming struggling biting like a maddened animal while curious passengers rushed to the rails above and stared at them and another crowd yelled and hooted derisively from the dock a moment later they were in cortes stateroom panting grim triumphant with their prisoners back against the wall and their work done now that narcone realized the deception that had been practised upon him he began to curse his betrayer with incredible violence and fluency as yet he had no idea whither he was being taken nor for which of his many crimes he had been apprehended but it seemed as if his rage would strangle him with the unrestraint of a lifetime of lawlessness he poured out his passion in a terrifying rush of vilification anathema and threat he hurled himself against the walls of the stateroom as if to burst his way out and they were forced to clamp legirons upon him when donnelly had regained his breath he savagely commanded the fellow to be silent but narcone only shifted his fury from his betrayer to the chief of police to the pinkerton operative donnelly said gratefully that was good work corte wire me from new york well have to go now for the ship is clearing wait said blake then pushing himself forward he addressed the captive in italian where is belisario cardi the question came like a gunshot silencing the outlaw as if with a gag his bloodshot eyes searched his questioners face his lips wet with slaver were snarling like those of a dog but he said nothing where is belisario cardi came the question for a second time i do not know him said the sicilian sullenly i am vito sabella an honest man you are gian narcone the butcher of san sebastiano said blake you are going back to sicily to be hanged for the murder of martel savigno count of martinello and his man ricardo bah cried the prisoner loudly i am not this narcone of which you speak i do not know him i am vito sabella a poor man i swear it by the body of christ i have never seen this cardi god will punish those who persecute me blake leaned forward until his face was close to narcones look closely he said have you ever seen me before they stared at each other eye to eye and the sicilian nodded you were drinking chianti in the cafe on royal street but i swear to you i am an innocent man and i curse those who betray me think do you recall a night four years ago you were waiting beside the road above terranova there was a feast of all the country people at the castello and finally three men came riding upward through the darkness one of them was singing for it was the eve of his marriage and you knew him by his voice as the count of martinello do you remember what happened then think you were called narcone the butcher and you boasted loudly of your skill with the knife as you dried your hands upon a wisp of grass you left two men in the road that night but the third returned to terranova i ask you again if you have ever seen my face the effect of these words was extraordinary the fury died from the prisoners eyes his coarse lips fell apart the blood receded from his purple cheeks he shrank and shivered loosely in the silence they could hear the breath wheezing hoarsely in his throat blake made a final appeal they will take you back to sicily to colonel neri and his carbineers and you will hang before it is too late tell me where is belisario cardi narcone moistened his livid lips and glared malignantly at his inquisitors but he could not be prevailed upon to speak well that was easy said donnelly when the philadelphia had cast off and the two friends were once more back in the rush and bustle of the waterfront norvin agreed and yet it seemed a bit unfair he remarked there were three of us you know if he were not what he is id feel somewhat ashamed of my part in the affair donnelly showed his contempt for such quixotic views by an expressive grunt you can take the next one singlehanded if you prefer perhaps it may be your friend cardi perhaps said norvin gravely if that should happen i should feel that i had paid my debt in full id like a chance to sweat narcone growled the chief regretfully id find cardi or id he heaved a sigh of relief oh well weve done a good days work as it is i hope the papers dont get hold of it but the papers did get hold of it and with an effect which neither man had anticipated had they foreseen the consequences of this mornings work had they even remotely guessed at the forces they had unwittingly set in motion they would have lost something of their complacency throughout the greater part of the city that night the kidnapping of vito sabella became the subject of excited comment in the neighborhood of st phillip street it was received in an ominous silence xii la mafia the surprising ease with which the capture of narcone had been effected gratified norvin blake immensely for it gave him an opportunity to jeer at the weaker side of his nature he told himself that the incident went to prove what his saner judgment was forever saying that fear depends largely upon the power of visualization that danger is real only in so far as the mind sees it moreover the admiration his conduct aroused was balm to his soul his friends congratulated him warmly agreeing that he and donnelly had taken the only practical means to rid the community of a menace in our southern and western states where individual character stands for more than it does in the overlegalized communities of the north and east men are concerned not so much with redtape as with effects and hence there was little disposition to criticize blake was amazed to discover what a strong public sentiment the italian outrages had awakened new orleans it seemed was not only indignant but alarmed his selfsatisfaction received a sudden shock however when donnelly strolled into his office a few days later and without a word laid a letter upon his desk it ran as follows daniel donnelly chief of police new orleans la dear sir god be praised that gian narcone has gone to his punishment but you have incurred the everlasting enmity of the mala vita or what you term la mafia and it has been decided that your life must pay for his you are to be killed next thursday night at the red wing club i cannot name those upon whom the choice has fallen for that is veiled in secrecy i pray that you will not ignore this warning for if you do your blood will rest upon one who knows p s destroy this letter the color had receded from norvins face when he looked up to meet the smokeblue eyes of his friend god he exclaimed this looks bad doesnt it you think its on the level dont you donnelly shrugged im blessed if i know it may have come from the very gang im after it strikes me that they wanted to get rid of narcone but didnt know just how to go about it so used me for an instrument now they want to scare me off but he names the very place the very hour sure everything except the very dago who is to do the killing if he knew where and when why wouldnt he know how and who i that sounds reasonable and yet you are not going to the red wing club any more are you why not ive got until thursday and i like their coffee here is the other letter by the way donnelly produced the first communication the paper was identical and the type appeared to be the same beyond this norvin could make out nothing well dan exclaimed when they had exhausted their conjectures theyve set their date and i reckon they wont change it so im going to eat dinner tonight at the red wing club as usual just to see what happens after a brief hesitation norvin said id like to join you if you dont mind donnelly shook his gray head doubtfully i dont think youd better this may be on the square i think it is and therefore i intend to see you through suit yourself of course id like to have you go along but i dont want to get you into any fuss seven oclock that evening found the two friends dining at the little cafe in the foreign quarter but they were seated at one of the corner tables and their backs were toward the wall ive had my reasons for eating here and it wasnt altogether the coffee either the elder man confessed i suspected as much norvin told him at least i couldnt detect anything remarkable about this rio you see its a favorite hangout of the better italian class and ive been working it carefully for a year what have you discovered not much and yet a great deal ive made friends for one thing and thats considerable here comes one now you know him dont you dan indicated a thicknecked squarely built italian who had entered at the moment thats caesar maruffi norvin regarded the newcomer with interest for maruffi stood for what is best among his americanized countrymen moreover if rumor spoke true he was one of the richest and most influential foreigners in the city in answer to the chiefs invitation he approached and seated himself at the table accepting his introduction to blake with a smile and a gracious word ah it is my first opportunity to thank you for the service you have done us in arresting that hateful brigand he began did you know the fellow norvin queried very well indeed maruffi knows a whole lot if hed only open up hes a mafioso himself eh caesar the chief laughed no no the other exclaimed casting a cautious glance over his shoulder i tell you everything i learn but as for this sabella i thought him a trifle sullen perhaps but an honest fellow you dont really think there has been any mistake eh how could that be possible did not signore blake remember him norvin was about to disclaim his part in the affair but the speaker ran on i fear you must regard all us italians as mafiosi signore blake but it is not so no we are honest people but we are terrorized by a few bad men we do not know them signore we are robbed we are blackmailed and if we resist behold something unspeakable befalls us we do not know who deals the blow we merely know that we are marked and that some day we are buried maruffi shrugged his square shoulders expressively do you suffer in your business norvin asked per dio who does not i have adopted your free country signore but it is not so free as my own maledetto you have too damned many laws in this free america maruffi spoke hesitatingly and yet with intense feeling his black eyes glittered wickedly and it was plain that he sounded the note of revolt which was rising from the lawabiding italian element his appearance bore out his reputation for leadership for he was big and black and dour and he gave the impression of unusual force your home is in sicily is it not blake inquired si i come from palermo i have been there i remember said maruffi calmly donnelly broke in what do you hear regarding our capture of sabella eh how do they take it again maruffi shrugged how can they take it my good countrymen are delighted others perhaps not so well pleased but sabella has friends i suppose theyve marked me for revenge no doubt but what can they do you are the law with a private citizen with me for instance it would be different my wife would prepare herself for widowhood hows that youre not married said donnelly not yet but i have plans a fine sicilian girl good i congratulate you speaking of sabella blake interposed curiously i had a hand in taking him and im a private citizen true maruffi regarded him with his impenetrable eyes you predict trouble for me then i predict nothing we say in my country that no one escapes the mafia no doubt we are timid you are an american you are not easily frightened but tell me he turned to the chief of police who is to follow this brigand there are others quite as black as he if they were known no doubt but unfortunately i dont know them why dont you help me out caesar if i could you have no suspicions eh plenty of suspicions but no proofs maruffi turned back to norvin saying so you identified the murderer of your friend savigno madonna mia you have a memory but were you not afraid afraid of what ah you are american as i said before you fear nothing but it was belisario cardi who killed the conte of martinello belisario cardi is only a name said norvin guardedly true maruffi agreed being a palermitan myself he is real to me but as you say nobody knows he rose and shook hands cordially with both men when he had joined the group of italians at a nearby table donnelly said theres the whitest dago in the city i thought he might be the one who knows but i reckon i was mistaken he could help me though if he dared have you confided in him lord no i dont trust any of them say the more i think about that letter the more i think its a bluff you cant afford to ignore it of course not ill plant oconnell and another man outside on thursday night and see if anything suspicious turns up but ill take my dinner elsewhere the two men had finished their meal when bernie dreux strolled in and took the seat which maruffi had vacated well how goes your detecting bernie norvin inquired hist breathed the little man so sharply that his hearers started he winked mysteriously and they saw that he was bursting with important tidings theres something doing what is it demanded the chief but mr dreux answered nothing instead he lit a cigarette and as he raised the match looked guardedly into a mirror behind donnellys chair im glad you took this table he began in a low voice i always sit where i can get a flash a what queried the astonished blake pianissimo with that talk cautioned the speaker youll tip him off tip who donnelly breathed my man hes one of the gang do you see that fellow that wop next to caesar maruffi bernie did not lower his eyes from the mirror the third from the left sure well triumphantly well that is he thats who i dont know what the hes one of em thats all i know ive been on him for a week ive trailed him everywhere he has an accomplice a woman the chiefs face underwent a remarkable change are you sure he whispered eagerly its a cinch he comes to the fruitstand every day i think hes after blackmail but im not sure good dan exclaimed i want you to trail him wherever he goes and above all watch the woman now tear back to your banana rookery or youll miss something better have a drink first though ill go you its tough work on the nerves im all upset i thought you never drank whiskey norvin said still amazed at the extraordinary transformation in his friend i dont as a rule it kippers my stomach but it gives me the courage of a lion donnelly nodded with satisfaction dont get pickled but keep your nerve remember im depending on you dreuxs slender form writhed and shuddered as he swallowed the liquor but his eyes were shining when he rose to go im glad im making good said he if anything happens to me keep your eye skinned for that fellow theres dirty work afoot when he had gone donnelly stuck his napkin into his mouth to still his laughter theres dirty work afoot he quoted in a strangling voice can you beat that i cant believe my senses why bernies actually getting tough who is this fellow hes trailing that thats joe poggi the owner of the fruitstand hes my best dago detective and i sent him here tonight in case anything blew off the woman is his wife lovely lady too blackmail oh lord ill have to tell poggi about this ill have to tell him hes being shadowed too or hell stop suddenly on the street some day and bernie will run into him from behind and break his nose thursday night passed without incident donnelly set a watch upon the red wing club but nothing occurred to give the least color to the written warning in the course of a fortnight he had wellnigh forgotten it and when a third letter came he was less than ever inclined to believe it genuine you forestalled the first attempt upon your life wrote the informant but another will be made you are to be shot at police headquarters some night next week your desk stands just inside a window which opens upon the street a fight will occur at the corner near by and during the disturbance an assassin will fire upon you out of the darkness then disappear in the confusion do not treat this warning lightly or i swear that you will repent it one who knows donnelly showed this to blake saying sourly you see its just as i told you theyre trying to run me out what are you going to do im going to move my desk for one thing then im going to run down this writer oconnell is going through the stationerystores now trying to match the watermark on the paper the postoffice is on the lookout for the next letter and will try to find which mailbox it is dropped into then you think there will be other letters to follow this one certainly when they see that ive moved away from that window theyll think theyve got me going then ill be warned of another plot and another and another it might work with some people the speakers lips curled in a wintry smile you no longer think it came from one of the pallozzo gang no theres nobody in the outfit who can write a letter like that its from the mafia how can you say that when the same writer betrayed narcone oh ive asked myself the same question donnelly answered with a trace of exasperation and i cant answer it unless that was merely a case of revenge take it from me ill get another letter inside of ten days see if i dont true to his prediction the tenth day brought another warning the writer advised him that his enemies had changed their plans once more but would strike when the first opportunity offered as to where or when this would occur no information was given the chief was merely urged in the strongest terms to remove himself beyond the possibility of danger naturally the recipient took this as proof positive that the whole affair was no more than a weak attempt to frighten him unfortunately the postal authorities could not determine where the letter had been mailed and oconnell reported that the paper on which it was written was of a variety in common use there seemed to be little hope of tracing the matter back to its source so donnelly dismissed the whole affair from his mind and went about his duties undisturbed norvin blake however could not bring himself to take the same view as usual he attributed his fears to imagination yet they preyed upon him so constantly that he was forced to heed them his one frightful experience with la mafia had marked him it seemed like some prenatal influence and now the more he dwelt upon the subject the more his apprehension quickened he was ashamed to confess to donnelly and at the same time he was loath to allow the chief to expose himself unnecessarily therefore he made it a point to be with him as much as possible this of course involved a considerable risk to himself and he recalled with misgiving what caesar maruffi had said that night in the red wing club donnelly alone had been warned but that did not argue that vengeance would be confined to him october had come the lazy heat of summer had passed and new orleans was awakening under its magic winter climate the piny breezeswept gulf resorts had emptied their summer colonies cityward the social season had begun the preparations for the great february carnival were nearing completion and blake had the satisfaction of knowing that myra nell warren was to realize her hearts desire he had forced a loan upon bernie sufficient to meet the requirements of any queen and had spent several delightful evenings with the girl herself amused by her plans of royal conquest it was like a tonic to be with her norvin invariably parted from her with a feeling of optimism and a gayety quite reasonless he had no fears no apprehensions the universe was peopled with sprites and fairies the morrow was a glad adventure full of merriment and promise he was in precisely such a mood one drizzly wednesday night after having made an inexcusably long call upon her nothing whatever had occurred to put him in this agreeable humor yet he went homeward humming as blithely as a barefoot boy in springtime as he neared the neighborhood in which donnelly lived he decided to drop in on him for a few moments and smoke a cigar business had lately kept him away from the chief and he felt a bit guilty but donnelly had either retired early or else he had not returned from headquarters for his windows were dark and norvin retraced his steps a trifle disappointed in front of a cobblers shop across the street several men were talking and as he glanced in their direction the door behind them opened allowing a stream of light to pour forth he recognized larubio the old italian shoemaker himself and he was on the point of inquiring if donnelly had come home but thought better of it larubio and his companions were idling beneath the wooden awning or shed which extended over the sidewalk and in the open doorway briefly silhouetted against the yellow light blake noted a man clad in a shining rubber coat although the picture was fleeting it caught his attention the thought occurred to him that these men were italians and therefore possible mafiosi but his mood was too optimistic to permit of silly suspicions tonight the mafia seemed decidedly unreal and indefinite he found himself smiling again at the memory of an argument in which he had been worsted by myra nell he had taken her a most elaborate box of chocolates and she had gleefully promised to consume at least half of them that very night after retiring he had remonstrated at such an unhygienic procedure whereupon she had confessed to a secret ungovernable habit of eating candy in bed he had argued that the pernicious practice was sure to wreck her digestion and ruin her teeth but she had confounded him utterly by displaying twin rows as sound as pearls as white and regular as rice kernels her digestion he had to confess was that of a shetland pony and he had been forced to fall back upon an unconvincing prophecy of a toothless and dyspeptic old age he pictured her at this moment propped up in the middle of the great mahogany fourposter all lace and ruffles and ribbons her wayward hair in adorable confusion about her face as she pawed over the sweets and breathed ecstatic blessings upon his name near the corner he stumbled over a boy hiding in the shadows then as he turned north on rampart street he ran plump into donnelly and oconnell i just came from your house he told dan i thought id drop in and smoke one of your bad cigars is there anything new not much ive had a hard day and there was a police board meeting tonight im fagged out no more letters eh no but ive heard that sabella is safe in sicily that means his finish ill have something else to tell you in a day or so something about your other friend cardi no really if what i suspect is true itll be a sensation i cant credit the thing myself thats why i dont want to say anything just yet im all up in the air over it a moment later the three men separated donnelly and oconnell turning toward their respective homes blake continuing his way toward the heart of the city but the chiefs words had upset norvins complacency his line of thought was changed and he found himself once more dwelling upon the tragedy which had left such a mark upon his life martel had been the finest the cleanest fellow he had ever known his life so full of promise had just begun and yet he had been ruthlessly stricken down norvin shuddered at the memory he saw the road to martinello stretching out ahead of him like a ghostgray canyon walled with gloom he heard the creaking of saddles the muffled thud of hoofs in the dust of the causeway the song of a lover then blake halted suddenly listening from somewhere not far away came the sound again it was a gunshot deadened by the blanket of mist and drizzle that shrouded the streets he turned it was repeated for a third time and as he realized whence it came he cried out affrightedly donnelly donnelly oh god then he began to run swiftly as he had run that night four years before with the lights of terranova in the distance and in his heart was that same sickening horrible terror but this time he ran not away from the sound but towards it as he raced along the slippery streets the night air was ripped again and again with those same loud reverberations he saw by the flickering arclamp above the crossing where he had just left donnelly another figure flying towards him and recognized oconnell together they turned into girod street they were in time to see a flash from the shed that stood in front of larubios shop then an answering spurt of flame from the side of the street upon which they were the place was full of noise and smoke at the farther crossing a man in a shining rubber coat knelt and fired then rose and scurried into the darkness beyond figures broke out from the shadows of the wooden awning in front of larubios shop and followed some turning towards the left at basin street others continuing on through the area lighted by the sputtering street light and into the night one of them paused and looked back as if loath to leave the spot until certain of his work side by side blake and oconnell raced towards the chief whom they saw lurching uncertainly along the banquette ahead of them the detective was cursing blake sobbed through his tightclenched teeth donnelly was down when they reached him and his empty revolver lay by his side norvin raised him with shaking arms his whole body sick with horror are you badly hit old man he gasped im done for said the chief weakly and the dagos did it from an open window above them a woman began to scream loudly murder murder the cry was taken up in other quarters and went echoing down the street doors were flung wide gates slammed men came hurrying through the wet night hurling startled questions at one another but the powder smoke which hung sluggishly in the dark night air was sufficient answer it floated in thin blue layers beneath the electric lights gradually fading and melting as the life ebbed from the mangled body of dan donnelly it was nearing dawn when norvin blake emerged from the hospital whither donnelly had been taken the air was dead and heavy a dripping windingsheet of fog wrapped the city in its folds no sound broke the silence of the hour he was sadly shaken for he had watched a brave soul pass out of the light and in his ears the words of his friend were ringing dont let them get away with this norvin youre the only man i trust xiii the blood of his ancestors at the central station norvin found a great confusion city officials and newspaper men were coming and going telephones were ringing patrolmen and detectives summoned from their beds were reporting and receiving orders yet all this bustling activity affected him with a kind of angry impatience it seemed somehow perfunctory and inadequate in the intensity of his feeling he doubted that any one else realized as he did the full significance of what had occurred as quickly as possible he made his way to oneil the assistant superintendent of police who was deep in consultation with mayor wright for a moment he stood listening to their talk and then at the first pause interposed without ceremony tell me what is being done oneil who had not seemed to note his approach answered without a hint of surprise at the interruption we are dragging the city of course have you arrested larubio the cobbler no both men turned to blake now with concentrated attention then dont lose a moments time arrest all his friends and associates look for a man in a rubber coat i saw him fire theres a boy too he added after a moments pause about fourteen years old he was hiding at the corner i think he must have been their picket at any rate he knows something the assistant superintendent noted these directions and listened impassively while norvin poured forth his story of the murder before it was fairly concluded he was summoned elsewhere and turning away abruptly he left the room like a man who knows he must think of but one thing at a time the young man wiping his face with uncertain hand turned to the mayor dan was the second friend ive seen murdered by these devils he said id like to do something well need your help if it was really the dagoes what theres no doubt on that score donnelly was warned well we ought to have them under arrest in short order and then what theyve probably arranged their alibis long ago the fellows who did the shooting are not the only ones either we must get the leaders exactly oneil understands but hell fail as donnelly failed what would you have us do blake spoke excitedly his emotions finding a vent do id rouse the people awaken the city create an uprising of the lawabiding strip the courts of their red tape and administer justice with a rope hang the guilty ones at once before delay robs their execution of its effect and before there is time to breed doubts and distrust in the minds of the people you mean in plain words lynch them well what of that its the only but my dear young man the law oh i know what youre going to say well enough yet there are times when mob law is justified if these men are not destroyed quickly they will live to laugh at our laws and our scheme of justice we must strike terror into the heart of every foreignborn criminal we must clean the city with fire unless we wish to see our institutions become a mockery and our community overridden by a band of cutthroats the killing of dan donnelly is more than a mere murder it is an attack on our civilization you are carried away by your personal feelings i think not if this thing runs through the regular channels what will happen you know how hard it is to convict those people we must fight fire with fire personally i agree with a good deal you say officially of course i cant go so far you say you want to help will you assume a large responsibility will you take the lead in a popular movement to help the enforcement of the law organize a committee if you think im the right man good understand the mayor spoke now with determined earnestness we must have no lynchings but i believe the police will need help in the search and i think you are the man to stir up the public conscience and secure that aid if you can help in apprehending the criminals we shall see that the courts do their part i can trust you in so delicate a matter where i couldnt trust some others oneil appeared at that moment with two strange objects in his hands see what weve just found on the basin street banquette he displayed a pair of sawedoff shotguns the stocks of which were hinged in such a manner that the weapons could be doubled into a length of perhaps eighteen inches and thus be concealed upon the person blake examined them with mingled feelings having seen the body of the chief ripped and torn in twenty places by buckshot slugs and scraps of iron he had tried to imagine what sort of firearms had been used now he knew and he began to wonder whether death would come to him in the same ugly form have you sent for larubio he asked the men are just leaving ill go with them oneil intercepted the officers at the door and a moment later norvin was hurrying with them toward girod street mechanically his mind began to review the events leading up to the murder dwelling on each detail with painful and fruitless persistence he repictured the scene that his eye had so swiftly and so carelessly recorded he saw again the dark shed the dumb group of figures idling beneath it the open door and the flood of yellow light behind but when he strove to recall a single face or form or even the precise number of persons he was at a loss nothing stood out distinctly but the bearded face of larubio the silhouette of a man in a gleaming rubber coat and a moment later a slim stripling boy crouched in the shadows near the corner as the party turned into girod street he saw by the first streaks of dawn that the curious had already begun to assemble a dozen or more men were morbidly examining the scene reenacting the assassination and tracing the course of bullets by the holes in wall and fence no difficult matter since the ground where donnelly had given battle had been swept by a fusillade larubios shop was dark the officers tried the door quietly then at a signal from norvin they rushed it the next instant the three men found themselves in an evilsmelling room furnished with a bench some broken chairs a litter of tools and shoes and leather findings it was untenanted but seeing another door ahead of him blake stumbled toward it over the debris like the outer door it was barred but yielded to his shoulder it was well that the policemen were close upon his heels for they found him locked in desperate conflict with a huge halfnaked sicilian who fought with the silent wickedness of a wolf at bay the chamber was squalid and odorous a tumbled couch from which the occupant had leaped showed that he had been calmly sleeping upon the scene of his crime through the dimlit filth of the place the cobbler whirled them struggling like a man insane a table fell with a crash of dishes a stove was wrecked a chair smashed then he was pinned writhing to the bed from which he had just arisen close the front door quick norvin panted keep out the crowd one of the policemen dashed to the front of the hovel barely in time to bar the way larubio as he crouched there in the halflight manacled but defiant made a striking figure he was a patriarchal man his hairy naked chest rose and fell as he fought for his breath a thick beard grew high upon his cheeks lending dignity to his fierce aquiline features a tangled mass of irongray hair hung low above his eyes he looked more like an arab sheik than a beggarly sicilian shoemaker why are you here he questioned in a deep voice blake answered him in his own language you killed the chief of police no i had no part dont lie as god is my judge i am innocent i heard the shooting i looked out into the night and saw men running about i was frightened so i went to bed that is all norvin undertook to stare him down you will hang for this larubio he said the fierce gray eyes met his unflinchingly you had a hand in the killing for i saw you but you acted against your will am i right still the patriarch flung back his glance defiantly you were ordered to kill and you dared not disobey where is belisario cardi the old man started into his eyes for the briefest instant there leaped a look of terror then it was gone i do not know what you are talking about he answered come the man with the rubber coat has confessed larubios gaze roved uncertainly about the squalid quarters but he shook his head mumbling god will protect the innocent i know nothing your excellency they dragged him still protesting from his den as dogs drag an animal from its burrow but norvin had learned something that momentary wavering glance that flitting light of doubt and fear had told him that to the cobbler the name of cardi meant something real and terrible back at headquarters oneil had further information for him weve got larubios brotherinlaw caspardo cressi it was his son no doubt whom you saw waiting at the corner have you found the boy no hes gone then make haste before they have time to spirit him away these men wont talk but we might squeeze something out of the boy hes the weakest link in the chain so you must find him the morning papers were on the street when norvin went home new orleans had awakened to the outrage against her good name men were grouped upon corners women were gossiping from house to house the air was surcharged with a great excitement it was as if a public enemy had been discovered at the gates as if an alien foe had struck while the city slept that unformed foreign prejudice which had been slowly growing had crystallized in a single night to norvin the popular clamor which rose high during the next few days had a sickening familiarity at the time of martel savignos murder he had looked upon justice as a thing inevitable he had felt that the public wrath once aroused was an irresistible force yet he had seen how ineffectually such a force could spend itself and the new orleans police seemed likely to accomplish little more than the italian soldiers although more than a hundred arrests were made it was doubtful if with the exception of larubio and cressi any of the real culprits had been caught he turned the matter over in his mind incessantly consulted with oneil as to ways and means conferred with the mayor sounded his friends then one morning he awoke to find himself at the head of a committee of justice composed of fifty leading business men of the city armed with powers somewhat vaguely defined but in reality extremely wide he set himself diligently to his task there followed through the newspapers an appeal to the italian population for assistance and offers of tremendous rewards this resulted in a flood of letters some signed but mostly anonymous a multitude of shadowy clues of wild accusations but no sooner was a promising trail uncovered than the witness disappeared or became inspired with a terror which sealed his lips it began to appear that there was really no evidence to be had beyond what norvins eyes had photographed and this he knew was not enough to convict even larubio and his brotherinlaw while thus baffled and groping for the faintest clue he received a letter which brought him at least a ray of sunshine he had opened perhaps half of his mornings mail one day when he came upon a truly remarkable missive it was headed with an amateurish drawing or a skull at the bottom of the sheet was a dagger and over all in bright red was the lifesize imprint of a small plump hand in round schoolgirl characters he read as follows beware you are a traitor and a deserter therefore you are doomed escape is impossible unless you heed this warning meet me at the old house on st charles street and bring your ransom the avenger at the lower lefthand corner in microscopic characters was written i love chocolate nougat best norvin laughed as he reread this sanguinary epistle for he had to admit that it had given him a slight start being a man of action he walked to the telephone and called a number which had long since become familiar is this the creole candy kitchen send ten pounds of your best chocolate nougat to miss myra nell warren at once this is blake speaking wait i have enough on my conscience without adding another sin perhaps youd better make it five pounds now and five pounds a week hereafter put it in your fanciest basket with lots of blue ribbon and label it ransom next he called the girl himself and after an interminable wait heard a breathless voice say hello norvin ive been out in the kitchen making cake so i couldnt get away its in the oven now cooking like mad ive just received a threatening letter he told her who in the world could have sent it evidently some blackmailing wretch it demands a ransom heavens you wont be cowardly enough to yield certainly i darent refuse he heard her laughing softly why dont you tell the police indeed theres an army of men besieging the place now then you must expect to catch the writer ive been trying to for a long time im sure i dont know what you are talking about she said innocently could i have sent the ransom to the wrong address he pretended to be seized with doubt whereupon myra nell exclaimed quickly oh not necessarily then after a pause norvin how does a person get red ink off of her hands use a cotton broker let him hold it this evening id love to but bernie wouldnt allow it it was his ink you know and i spilled it all over his desk norvin is it really nougat it is the most unhealthy the most indigestible you duck you may hold my gory hand for wait blake heard a faint shriek dont ring off something terrible then the wire was dead hello hello he called whats wrong myra nell he rattled the receiver violently and getting no response applied to central after some moments he heard her explaining in a relieved tone oh such a fright as i had what was it for heavens the cake you frightened me i thought its four stories high and pasted together with caramel you should never leave a phone in that way without bernie detests caramel but im expecting a certain party to call on me tonight norvin do you think red ink would hurt a cake myra nell he said severely didnt you wash your hands before mixing that dough of course i have my doubts will you really be at liberty this evening that depends entirely upon you if i am i shall exact another ransom flowers perhaps ill send them anyhow marechal neils oh you are a wait for a second time miss warren broke off but now norvin heard her cry out gladly to some one he held the receiver patiently until his arm cramped then rang up again oh i forgot all about you norvin dear she chattered vittoria has just come so i cant talk to you any more wont you run out and meet her i know shes just dying to she says she isnt either oh fiddlesticks youre not so busy as all that very well well probably eat the cake ourselves goodby goodby avenger he laughed as he turned away smiling he found bernie dreux comfortably ensconced in an office chair and regarding him benignly hello bernie i didnt hear you come in wasnt that myra nell talking inquired the little man yes you called her avenger what has she been up to now blake handed him the redhand letter to his surprise bernie burst out angrily how dare she what its most unladylike begging a gentleman for gifts ill see that she apologizes if you do ill punch your head she couldnt do anything unladylike if she tried i dont approve nonsense ill see that she gets her chocolates oh ive sent em a deadly consignment enough to destroy both of you and ive left a standing order for five pounds a week but that letter its blackmail bernie groaned she holds me up in the same way whenever she feels like it shes getting suspicious of me lately and i darent tell her im a detective the other day she set remus our gardener on my trail and he shadowed me all over the town felicite thinks theres something wrong too and shes taken to following me between her and remus i havent a moments privacy its tough for a detective to be dogged by his gardener and his sweetheart norvin sympathized he began to run through his mail while his visitor talked on in his amusing irrelevant fashion im rather offended that i wasnt named on that committee of fifty bernie confessed after a time you know how the chief relied on me exactly well im full of italian mysteries now what i havent discovered by my own investigations vittoria fabrizi has told me for instance i know what became of the boy gino cressi you do blake looked up curiously from a letter he had been eagerly perusing hes in mobile are you sure certainly i think youre wrong why am i wrong read this my mail is full of anonymous communications he passed over the letter in his hand and mr dreux read as follows norvin blake new orleans louisiana the cressi boy is hidden at st phillip street go personally and in secret for there are spies among the police one who knows good lord do you believe it i shall know in an hour in reality norvin had no doubt that his informant told the truth on the contrary he found that he had been waiting subconsciously for a hint from this mysterious but reliable source and now that it had come he felt confident and elated a leak in the department would explain the maddening series of checkmates up to date after a moments hesitation he continued if gino cressi proves to be the boy i saw that night we will put the rope around his fathers and his uncles necks for he is little more than a child and they evidently knew he would confess if accused otherwise they wouldnt have been so careful to hide him he rose and eying dreux intently inquired will you go along and help me take him bernie fell into a sudden panic of excitement his face paled he blinked with incredible rapidity his lips twitched and he clasped his thin bloodless hands nervously why are you really going and alone norvin nodded if they have spies among our own men the least indiscretion may give the alarm besides there is no time to lose it would be madness to go there after dark will you come you bbbet mr dreux stuttered after a painful effort to control himself he inquired with rolling eyes ssay norvin will there be any fighting any dddanger blakes own imagination had already presented that aspect of the matter all too vividly yes there may be danger he confessed we may have to take the boy by force his nerves began to dance and quiver as always before every new adventure perhaps after all youd better not go i understand how you feel the little man burst out in a forceful expletive pudding i want to fight ddont you see no i dont ive never been in a row ive never done anything brave or desperate like like you im aching for trouble i go looking for it every night really blake looked his incredulity sure thing last night i insulted a perfectly nice gentleman just to provoke a quarrel id never seen him before and ordinarily i hesitate to accost strangers but i felt as if id have hysterics if i couldnt lick somebody so i walked up to this person and told him his necktie was in rotten taste what did he say he offered to go home and change it i was so chagrined that i cursed him fearfully bernie dreux nodded with an expression of the keenest satisfaction i could have cried i called him a worm a bug a bollweevil but he said he had a family and didnt intend to be shot up by some welldressed desperado i suppose its the blood of your ancestors i suppose it is now lets go get this dago boy im loaded for grizzlies and if the mafia cuts in ill croak somebody he drew a huge rusty military revolver from somewhere inside his clothes and flourished it so recklessly that his companion recoiled together the two set out for st phillip street blake whose reputation for bravery had become proverbial went reluctantly preyed upon by misgivings dreux the decadent overbred dandy went gladly as if thirsting for the fray xiv the net tightens number st phillip street proved to be a hovel in the front portion of which an old woman sold charcoal and kindling leaving bernie on guard blake penetrated swiftly to the rooms behind paying no heed to the crones protestations in one corner a slender darkeyed boy was cowering whom he recognized at once as the lad he had seen on the night of donnellys death you are gino cressi he said quietly the boy shook his head oh yes you are and you must come with me gino the little fellow recoiled you have come to kill me he quavered no no my little man why should i wish to do that i am a sicilian you hate me that is not true we hate only bad sicilians and you are a good boy i did not kill the chief true you did not even know that those other men intended to kill him you were merely told to wait at the corner until you saw him come home am i right i do not know anything about the chief gino mumbled but it was plain that some of his fear was vanishing under this unexpected kindness blake had a voice which won dumb animals and a smile which made friends of children at last the young sicilian came forward and put his hand into the strangers they told me to hide or the americans would kill me madonna mia i am no mafioso i i wish to see my father i will take you to him now you will not harm me no you are perfectly safe but the boy still hung back stammering i am afraid sior after all you see i know nothing perhaps i had better wait here but you will come to please me will you not then when you find that the policemen will not hurt you you will tell us all about it eh carino he led his shrinking captive out through the front of the house whence the crone had fled to spread the alarm and lifted him into the waiting cab but bernie dreux was loath to acknowledge such a tame conclusion to an adventure upon which he had built high hopes llets stick round he shivered its just getting gggood come on you idiot blake fairly dragged him in and commanded the driver to whip up that old woman will rouse the neighborhood and well have a mob heaving bricks at us in another minute thatll be fine dreux declared his pride revolting at what he considered a cowardly retreat he had come along in the hope of doing deeds that would add luster to his name and he did not intend to be disappointed it required a vigorous muscular effort to keep him from clambering out of the carriage i dont understand you at all said norvin with one hand firmly gripping his coat collar but i understand the value of discretion at this moment and i dont intend to take any chances on losing our little friend gino before he has turned states evidence dreux sank back gloomily enough continuing for the rest of the journey to declaim against the fate that had condemned him to a life of insipid peace but it was not until they had turned out of the narrow streets of the foreign quarter into the wide clean stretch of canal street that blake felt secure little gino cressi was badly frightened his wan pinched face was ashen and he shivered wretchedly yet he strove to play the man and his pitiful attempt at selfcontrol roused something tender and protective in his captor laying a reassuring hand upon his shoulder blake said gently coraggio no harm shall befall you i do not wish to die excellency you will not die speak the truth figlio mio and the police will be very kind to you i promise i know nothing quavered the child my father is a good man they told me the chief was dead but i did not kill him i only hid who told you the chief was dead i do not remember who told you to hide i do not remember sior ginos eyes were like those of a hunted deer and he trembled as if dreadfully cold it was a wretched stricken child whom blake led into oneils office and for a long time young cressis lips were glued but eventually he yielded to the kindfaced men who were so patient with him and his lies and told them all he knew on the following morning the papers announced three new arrests in the donnelly case resulting from a confession by gino cressi on the afternoon of the same day the friendly and influential caesar maruffi called upon blake with a protest signore my friend he began you and your committee are doing a great injustice to the italians of this city how so already everybody hates us we cannot walk upon your streets without insult men curse us children spit at us we are not jews we are italians there are bad people among my countrymen of course but signore look upon me do you think such men as i oh you stand for all that is best in your community mr maruffi i only wish youd help us clean house the sicilian shrugged help how can i help tell what you know of the mafia so that we can destroy it at every turn we are thwarted by the secrecy of your people they know what is good for them as for me my flesh will not turn the point of a knife signore life is an enjoyable affair and if i die i can never marry what would you have me tell the name of the capomafia for instance you think there is a capomafia i know it whats more i know who he is belisario cardi bah few people believe there is such a man you and i believe it perhaps but what if i could lay hands upon him think you that i or any sicilian would dare all the police of this city could never take belisario cardi it is to make laugh our friend donnelly was unwise he was too zealous now he is but a memory he took a life his life was taken in return this affair will mean more deaths leave things as they are my friend before you too are mourned norvin eyed his caller curiously that sounds almost as much like a threat as a warning god forbid i simply state the truth for your own good and for the good of all of us wherever sicilians are found there your laws will be ignored for my own part naturally i do not approve i am an american now but the truth is what i tell you in other words you think we ought to leave your countrymen alone ah i do not go so far the laws should be enforced that is certain but in trying to do what is impossible you stir up race hatred and make it hard for us reputable sicilians who would help you so far as lies in our power you cannot stamp out the mafia in a day in a week it is sicilian character already you have done enough to vindicate the law if you go on in a mad attempt to catch this cardi whose existence even is doubtful the consequences may be in every way bad we have five of the murderers now and well have the other man soon the fellow with the rubber coat the grand jury will indict them but we wont stop there were on a trail that leads higher up to the man or men who directed larubio and the others to do their work maruffi shook his head mournfully and the cressi boy it was you who found him it was how did you do it norvin laughed if youd only enlist in the cause id tell you all my secrets gladly eh then he was betrayed for the life of him norvin could not tell whether the man was pleased or chagrined at his secrecy but something told him that the sicilian was feeling him out for a purpose he smiled without answering betrayed said maruffi ah well i should not like to be in the shoes of the betrayer he seemed to lose himself in thought for a moment believe me i would help you if i could but i know nothing and besides it is dangerous i am a good citizen but i am not a detective you americanborn he smiled assume that all we sicilians are deep in the secrets of the mafia so the people in the street insult us and you in authority think that if we would only tell bah tell what we know no more than you and it is less safe for us to aid he rose and extended his hand of course if i learn anything i will inform you but there are times when it is best to let sleeping dogs lie norvin closed the door behind him with a feeling of relief for he was puzzled as to the object of this visit and wanted time to think it out undisturbed the upshot of his reflection was that donnelly had been right and that caesar was indeed the author of the warning letters as to his want of knowledge the sicilian protested rather like a man who plays a part openly on the other hand his fears for his own safety seemed genuine enough what more natural then than that he should wish to test donnellys successor with the utmost care before proceeding with his disclosures blake was glad that he had been secretive for if maruffi were the unknown friend he would find such caution reassuring as if to confirm this view of the case there came a day or two later another communication stating that the assassin who was still at large he in fact who had worn the rubber coat was a laborer in the parish of st john the baptist named frank normando the letter went on to say that in escaping from the scene of the crime the man had fallen on the slippery pavement and the traces of his injury might still be found upon his body norvin lost no time in consulting oneil jove youre the best detective we have said the acting chief admiringly id do well to turn this affair over to you entirely have you learned anything more from your prisoners nothing they refuse to talk were giving them the third degree but its no use there was another murder on st phillip street last night the old woman who guarded the cressi boy was found dead then they think she betrayed the lad norvin recalled maruffis hint that it would go hard with the traitor yes we might have expected it how many men will you need to take this normando i you think id better do the trick blake had not intended to take any active part in the capture he was already known as the head of the movement to avenge donnelly he had apprehended larubio and the cressi boy with his own hand inner voices warned him wildly to run no further risks i thought youd prefer to lead the raid oneil said so i would give me two or three men and well bring in normando dead or alive six hours later the last of donnellys actual assassins was in the parish prison and the police were in possession of evidence showing his movements from early morning on the day of the murder up to the hour of the crime his identification was even more complete than that of his accomplices and the public press thanked norvin blake in the name of the city for his efficient service the anonymous letters continued to come to him regularly and each one contained some important clue which followed up invariably led to evidence of value slowly surely out of nothing as it were the chain was forged now came the names of persons who had seen or had talked with some of the accused upon the fatal day now a hint which turned light upon some dark spot in their records again the letters aided in the discovery of important witnesses who under pressure confessed to facts which they had feared to make public until at last the history of the six assassins lay exposed like an open sheet before the prosecuting attorney the certainty and directness with which the one who knows worked was a matter of everincreasing amazement to blake he himself was little more than an instrument in these unseen hands who or what could the writer be by what means could he remain in such intimate touch with the workings of the mafia and what reason impelled him to betray its members hour after hour the young man speculated racking his head until it ached he considered every possibility he began to look with curiosity at every face at length he came to feel an even greater interest in the identity of this hidden friend than in the result of the struggle itself but investigations no matter how cautious invariably resulted in a prompt and imperative warning to desist upon pain of ruining everything gradually in his mind the conviction assumed certainty that the omniscient informer could be none other than caesar maruffi he frequented the red wing club as donnelly had done and the more he saw of the fellow the more firm became his belief he had recognized at their first meeting that caesar was unusual there was something unfathomable about him but precisely what this peculiarity was he could never quite determine as for maruffi he met norvins advances halfway but although he was apparently more than once upon the verge of some disclosure the terror of the brotherhood seemed always to intervene feeling that he could not openly voice his suspicions until the other was ready to show his hand blake kept a close mouth and thus the two played at crosspurposes maruffi if he were indeed the author of those letters had not shrunk from betraying the unthinking instruments of the mafia would he ever bring himself to implicate the man or men higher up blake doubted it a certain instinctive distrust of the sicilian was beginning to master him when a letter came which put a wholly different face upon the matter the men who really killed chief donnelly it read are salvatore di marco frank garcia giordano bolla and lorenzo cardoni blake gasped these were men of standing and repute in the foreign community larubio and his companions were but parts of the machine these are the hands which set them in motion these four men dined together on the evening of october th at fabachers then attended a theater where they made themselves conspicuous from there they proceeded to the lower section of the city and were purposely arrested for disturbing the peace about the time of donnellys murder in order to establish incontestable alibis nevertheless it was they who laid the trap and they are equally guilty with the wretches who obeyed their orders it was they who paid over the blood money and with their arrest you will have all the accessories to the crime save one of him i can tell you nothing i fear i can never find him for he walks in shadow and no man dares identify him the importance of this information was tremendous for arrests up to date had been made only among the lower element an accusation against di marco garcia bolla and cardoni would set the city ablaze oneil was aghast at the charge the mayor was incredulous the committee of fifty showed signs of hesitation but blake staking his reputation on the genuineness of the letter and urging the reliability of the writer as shown on each occasion in the past won his point and the arrests were made the italian press raised a frightful clamor the prisoners themselves were righteously indignant and norvin found that he had begun to lose that confidence which the public had been so quick to place in him nevertheless he pursued his work systematically and soon the mysterious agent proceeded to weave a new web around the four suspected men while he looked on fascinated doing as he was bid keeping his own counsel as he had been advised and turning over the results of his inquiries to the police as they were completed then came what he had long been dreading a warning like those which had foreshadowed donnellys death and he began to spend sleepless nights his daylight hours were passed in a strained expectancy he fought constantly to hold his fears in check he began sitting with his face to doors he turned wide corners and avoided side streets he became furtive and watchful his eyes were forever flitting here and there he chose the outer edges of the sidewalks and he went nowhere after nightfall unattended the time was past when he could doubt the constancy of his purpose but he did fear a nervous breakdown and even shuddered at the thought of possible insanity being in fact as sane a man as ever lived his irrational nerves alarmed him all the more he could not conceive that an event was immediately before him which without making his position safer would rouse him from all thought of self our lives are swayed by trifles a feathers weight may alter the course of our destinies a mans daily existence is made up of an infinite series of choices every one of which is of the utmost importance did he but know it we follow paths of a million forkings none of which converge a momentary whim a passing fancy a broken promise turns our feet into trails that wind into realms undreamed of it so happened that myra nell warren yielded to an utterly reasonless impulse to go calling at the utterly absurd hour of am miss warren followed no set rules in her conduct her mind reacted according to no given formula and therefore when it suddenly occurred to her to visit a little old creole lady in the french quarter she went without thoughtful consideration or delay madame la branche was a distant cousin on bernies side so distant in fact that no one except herself had ever troubled to trace the precise relationship but she employed a cook whose skill was celebrated now myra nells appetite was a most ungovernable affair and when she realized that her complete happiness depended upon a certain bouillabaisse in the preparation of which madame la branches julia had become famous she whisked her hair into a knot jammed her best and largest hat over its unruly confusion and went bouncing away in the direction of esplanade street it was in the early afternoon that norvin blake received a note from a coalblack urchin who after many attempts had finally succeeded in penetrating to his inner office recognizing the writing norvin tore open the envelope eagerly ready to be entertained by some fresh example of the girls infinite variety he read with startled eyes i send this by a trusted messenger hoping that it will reach you in time i am a prisoner i am in danger i fear my beauty is destroyed if you love me come your wretched myra nell the address was that of a house on esplanade street how did you get this he demanded harshly of the pickaninny a lady drap it from a window where where was she in a gret big house on esplanade street she seemed mighty put out about something then a man run me away with a club a moment later blake was on the street and had hailed a carriage the driver reading urgency in the set face of his fare whipped the horses into a gallop and the vehicle tore across town leaping and rocking violently the thought that myra nell was in danger filled blake with a physical sickness her beauty gone could it be that the mafia had taken this means of attacking him knowing of his affection for the girl of a sudden she became very dear and he was smothered with fury that any one should cause her suffering his heart was pounding madly as the carriage slowed into esplanade street threatening to upset and he saw ahead of him the house he sought with a sharp twinge of apprehension he sighted another man approaching the place at a run and leaping from his conveyance he raced on with frantic speed xv the end of the quest evidently the alarm had spread for there were others ahead of blake several men were grouped beneath an open window they were strangely excited some were panting as if from violent exertion a young french creole lecompte rilleau was sprawled at full length upon the grassy banquette either badly injured or entirely out of breath he raised a listless hand to the newcomer as if waving him to the attack norvin recognized them all as admirers of myra nell cotton brokers merchants a bank cashier a great relief surged over him thank god youre here in time he gasped whats happened to her raymond cline started to speak but just then blake heard the girl herself calling to him and saw her leaning from a window her piquant beauty framed with blushing roses which hung about the sill myra nell youre safe he cried shakingly what have they done to you she smiled piteously and shook her dark head you were good to come i am a prisoner a prisoner norvin stared at the young men about him come on he said lets get her out but murray logan quieted him its no use old man what dyou mean you cant go in cant go in as blake stared uncomprehendingly at the speaker he heard rapid footsteps approaching and saw achille marigny coming on the wings of the wind it was he who appeared in the distance as norvin rounded the corner and it was plain now that he was wellnigh spent rilleau reared himself on one elbow and cried with difficulty welcome achille take it easy marigny called cline weve saved her some one laughed and the suspicion that he had been hoaxed swept over blake whats the joke he demanded i was frightened to death the house is quarantined i never dreamed youd all come miss warren was saying sweetly it was very gallant and i shall never forget it never she says her beauty is gone wildly panted marigny who had run himself blind and as yet could hear nothing but the drumming in his ears judge for yourself cline steadied him against the low iron fence and pointed to the girls bewitching face embowered in the leafy window above from where he lay flat on his back idly flapping his hands rilleau complained i have a weak heart will somebody get me a drink it was splendid of you myra nell called down to the group i love you for it please get me out right away norvin now perceived a burly individual seated upon the steps of the la branche mansion he approached with a view to parleying but the man forestalled him saying warningly you cant go in theyve got smallpox in there smallpox go away from that door screamed myra nell but the fellow merely scowled i hate to offend the lady he explained to norvin in a hoarse whisper but i cant let her out miss warren repeated in a fury go away i tell you these are friends of mine if you were a gentleman youd know youre not wanted norvin make him skedaddle blake shook his head youve scared us all blue if youre quarantined i dont see what we can do the idea you can at least come in if you go in you cant come out belligerently declared the watchman thems orders ohh you monster cried his prisoner she says herself shes got it the man explained i never did myra nell wrung her hands will you stand there and let me perish do you refuse to save me where is madame la branche norvin asked asleep and cousin montegut is playing solitaire in the library then who has the smallpox the cook they took her screaming to the pesthouse an hour after i came i shall be the next victim i feel it were shut up here for a week maybe longer think of that theres nothing to do nobody to talk to nothing to look at we need another hand for whist i i supposed somebody would volunteer id love to rilleau called faintly from the curb but i wouldnt survive a week my heart is beating its last and besides i dont play whist mr cline called the attention of his companions to two figures which had appeared in the distance and began to chant the animals came in two by two the elephant and the kangaroo gentlemen here come the porpoise and the antelope we are now complete the new arrivals proved to be bernie dreux and august kulm the latter a fat teutonic merchant whose place of business was down near the river mr kulm had evidently run all the way for he was laboring heavily and his gait had long since slackened into a stumbling trot his eyes were rolling wildly his fresh young cheeks were purple and sheathed in perspiration miss warren exclaimed crossly oh dear i didnt send for bernie ill bet hes furious and so it proved when her halfbrothers horrified alarm had been dispelled by the noisy group of rescuers it was replaced by the blackest indignation he thanked them stiffly and undertook to apologize for his sister in the midst of which rilleau who had now managed to regain his feet suggested the formation of the myra nell contagion club its object shall be the alleviation of our ladys distress and its membership shall be limited to her rejected suitors he declared well take turns amusing her ill appoint myself chairman of the entertainment committee and one of us will always be on guard well sing well dance well cavort beneath the window and help to while the dreary hours away his suggestion was noisily accepted then after an exchange of views murray logan confessed that he had bolted a directors meeting and that ruin stared him in the face unless he returned immediately achille marigny it appeared had unceremoniously fled from the trial of an important lawsuit and raymond cline was needed at the bank foote delavan and the others admitted that they too must leave miss warren to her fate at least until after change had closed and so having put themselves at her service with extravagant protestations of loyalty promising candy books flowers a choir to sing beneath her window they finally trooped off half carrying the rotund mr kulm who had sprinted himself into a jellylike state of collapse rilleau alone maintained his readiness to brave the perils of smallpox leprosy or plague at miss warrens side until bernie informed him that the very idea was shocking whereupon he dragged himself away with the accusation that all his heart trouble lay at her door oh you spoiled it all myra nell told her brother indignantly you might at least have let him come in cousin althea would have chaperoned us the idea why did you do such an atrocious thing where you frightened norvin the girl beamed hopefully down upon him horribly im not over it yet im half inclined to act on lecomptes suggestion and break in she clapped her hands gleefully whereupon the watchman arose saying no you dont i wouldnt allow such a thing said bernie firmly it would mean a scandal i i cant stay here alone for a whole week ill die then ill join you myself her brother offered myra nell looked alarmed oh not you i want some one to nurse me when i fall ill what makes you think youll catch it were you exposed exposed heavens i can feel the disease coming on this very minute the place is full of germs i can spear em with a hatpin she shuddered and managed to counterfeit a tear ive an idea said norvin ill get that trained nurse who saved you when you fell off the horse vittoria she might do but norvin the horse threw me she warned him with a grimace which bernie did not see hes a frightful beast i cant afford a trained nurse dreux objected and you dont need one anyhow all right for you bernie if you dont care any more for my life than that ill sicken and die when a girls relatives turn against her its time she was out of the way oh all right said her brother angrily its ruinous but i suppose you must have it your way myra nell shook her head gloomily no not if you are going to feel like that of course if she were here she could cut off my hair when i take to my bed she could bathe my face with limewater when my beauty goes she could listen to my ravings and understand for she is a woman but no im not worth it perhaps i can get along all right and anyhow ill have to teach school or or be a nun if im all pockmarks good lord bernie wiped his brow with a trembling hand dyou think thatll happen norvin its bound to the girl predicted indifferently but whats the odds suddenly a new thought dilated her eyes with real horror oh she cried oh i just happened to remember im to be queen of the carnival now ill be scarred and hideous even if i happen to recover but i wont recover you shall have my royal robe bunny keep it always and norvin shall have my hair here i dont want your hair blake asserted nervously i mean not without it is all i have to give you may not catch the smallpox after all well have miss fabrizi bby all means bernie chattered you stay here and talk to her while i go norvin suggested quickly and myra nell ill fetch you a lot of chocolates ill fetch you anything if youll only cheer up remember its against my wishes the girl said but shes not at the hospital now shes living in the italian quarter she gave him the street and number and he made off in all haste on his way he had time to think more collectedly of the girl he had just left her prank had shocked him into a keen realization of his feeling for her and he began to understand the large part she played in his life many things inclined him to believe that her regard for him was really deeper than her careless levity indicated and it seemed now that they had been destined for each other it was dusk when he reached his destination a nondescript italian girl ushered him up a dark stairway and into an oldfashioned drawingroom with high ceiling and long windows which opened out upon a rusty overhanging iron balcony the room ran through to a court in the rear after the style of so many of these foreignbuilt houses it had once been the home of luxury and elegance but had long since fallen into a state of shabby decay he was still lost in thoughts of the important step which he contemplated when he heard the rustle of a womans garment behind him and rose as a tall figure entered the room miss fabrizi he inquired i came to find you he paused for the girl had given a smothered cry the light was poor and the shadows played tricks with his eyes he stepped forward peering strangely at her then halted margherita he whispered then in a shaking voice my god yes she said quietly it is i he touched her gently staring as if bereft of his senses he felt himself swept by a tremendous excitement it struck him dumb it shook him it set the room to whirling dizzily the place was no longer illlit and shabby but illumined as if by a burst of light and through his mad panic of confusion he saw her standing there calm tawny selfpossessed caro norvin you have found me indeed he heard her say i wondered when the day would come you you he choked his arms were hungry for her his heart was melting with the wildest ecstasy that had ever possessed it she was clad as he often remembered her in a dress which partook of her favorite and inseparable color her hair shone with that unforgettable luster her face was the face he had dreamed of and there was no shock of readjustment in his recognition of her rather her real presence made the cherished mental image seem poor and weak i came to see miss fabrizi why are you here he glanced at the door as if expecting an interruption i am she contessa hush she laid her fingers upon his lips i am no longer the contessa margherita i am vittoria fabrizi then you have been here in new orleans for a long time more than a year impossible i you its inconceivable why have we never met i have seen you many times and you didnt speak why oh why margherita my friend if you care for me for my safety and my peace of mind you must not use that name collect yourself we will have explanations but first remember i am vittoria fabrizi the nurse a poor girl i shall remember i dont understand but i shall be careful i dont know what it all means why you didnt let me know in spite of his effort at selfcontrol he fell again into a delicious bewilderment his spirits leaped he felt unaccountably young and exhilarated he laughed senselessly and yet with a deep throbbing undernote of delight what are names and reasons anyhow what are worries and hopes and despairs ive found you you live you are safe you are young i feared you were old and changed it has seemed so long and and my search dragged so but i never ceased thinking and caring i never ceased hoping she laid a gentle hand upon his arm come come you are upset it will all seem natural enough when you know the story tell me everything all at once i cant wait he led her to a low french lit de repos near by and seated himself beside her her nearness thrilled him with the old intoxication and he hardly heeded what he was saying tell me how you came to be vittoria fabrizi instead of margherita ginini how you came to be here how you knew of my presence and yet oh tell me everything for im smothering im incoherent i i first wont you explain how you happened to come looking for me he gathered his wits to tell her briefly of myra nell feeling a renewed sense of strangeness in the fact that these two knew each other she made as if to rise please he cried this is more important than miss warrens predicament shes really delighted with her adventure you know true she is in no danger there is so much to tell that which has taken four years to live cannot be told in five minutes i im afraid i am sorry you came dont destroy my one great moment of gladness remember i am vittoria fabrizi i know of no other name lucrezia is here also and she too is another you have never seen her you understand he nodded and her name oliveta we are cousins i respect your reasons for these changes tell me only what you wish oh i have nothing to conceal she said relieved at his growing calmness they are old family names which i chose when i gave up my former life you wonder why it is part of the story when martel died the contessa margherita died also she could not remain at terranova where everything spoke of him she was young she began a long quest as you know it was fruitless and when in time her ideas changed she was born to a new life you have abandoned the search long ago you told me truly that hatred and revenge destroy the soul i was young and i could not understand but now i know that only good can survive good thoughts good actions good lives and is the donna teresa here vittoria shook her head she has gone back perhaps to her land of sunshine her flowers and her birds and her dreamfilled mountain valleys it was two years ago that we lost her she could not survive the change i have many regrets when i think of her you know of course that i returned to sicily and that i followed you yes and when i learned of it i knew there was but one thing to do i was unwise disloyal there at terranova she met his eyes frankly but made no sign is that why you avoided me ah let us not speak of that old time when one severs all connections with the past and begins a new existence one should not look back but i have not lost interest in you my friend i have learned much from myra nell seeing her was like seeing you for she hardly speaks of any one else many times we nearly met only a moment separated us you came as i went or i came in time barely to miss you you walked one street as i walked another we were in the same crowds our elbows touched our paths crossed but we never chanced to meet until this hour now i am almost sorry but why if you have forgiven me how could you be so indifferent you must have known how i longed for you her look checked him on the brink of a passionate avowal does my profession tell you nothing she asked you are a nurse what has that to do with it do you know that i have been with the sisters of mercy i i am one of them impossible in spirit at least i shall be one in reality as soon as i am better fitted a nun he stared at her dumbly and his face paled i have given all i possess to the order excepting only what i have settled upon oliveta this is her house i am her guest her pensioner i am ready to take the last step to devote my life to mercy now you begin to understand my reason for waiting and watching you in silence you see it is very true that margherita ginini no longer exists i have not only changed my name i am a different woman i am sorry she said doing her best to comfort him yes and it is hard for me too that is why i would have avoided this meeting if you contemplate this step he inquired dully why have you left the hospital i am not ready to take orders i have much to overcome now i must prepare oliveta to meet you for she has not changed as i have and there might be consequences what consequences we wish to forget the past she said noncommittally when she returned from her errand she saw him outlined blackly against one of the long windows his hands clasped behind his back his head low as if in meditation he seemed unable to throw off this spell of silence as they drove to the la branche home but listened contentedly to her voice so like the low soft music of a cello after he left her it was long before he tried to reduce his thoughts to order he preferred to dwell indefinitely upon the amazing fact that he at last had found her that he had actually seen and touched her finally when he brought himself to face the truth in its entirety he knew that he was deeply disappointed and he felt that he ought to be hopeless yet hope was strong in him it blazed through his very veins he felt it thrill him magically when he fell asleep that night it was with a smile upon his lips for hope had crystallized into a baseless but none the less assured belief that he would find a way to win her xvi quarantine blake arose like a boy on christmas morning he thrilled to an extravagant gladness at breakfast the truth came to him he was young for the first time he realized that he had let himself grow up and lose his illusions that he had become cynical tired prosaic while all the time the flame of youth was merely smouldering old he was but only as a stripling soldier is aged by battle as for the real rare joys of living and loving he had never felt them myra nell had appealed to his affection like a dear and clever child and helped to keep some warmth in his heart but this was magic the sun had never been so bright the air so sweet to his nostrils the strength so vigorous in his limbs he had become so accustomed to the mysterious letters by this time that he had grown to look for them as a matter of course and he was not disturbed when on arriving at his office he found one in his mail heretofore the writer had been positive in his statements but now came the first hint of uncertainty i cannot find belisario cardi he wrote his hand is over all and yet he is more intangible than mist i am hedged about with difficulties and dangers which multiply as the days pass i can do no more hence the task devolves upon you be careful for he is more desperate than ever it is your life or his one who knows it was as daunting a message as he could have received the withdrawal of assistance the authoritative confirmation of his fears yet blakes spirit rose to meet the exigency with a new courage it occurred to him that if maruffi or whoever the author was had exhausted his usefulness perhaps vittoria could help she had spent much time in her search for this very cardi and might have learned something of value concerning him oliveta too could be of assistance he felt sure that the knowledge of his own peril would be enough to enlist their aid and he gladly seized upon the thought that a common interest would draw him closer to the woman he loved he arrived at the la branche house early that afternoon and found young rilleau sitting on a box beneath myra nells window with the girl herself embowered as before in a frame of roses any symptoms yet norvin inquired agreeably thousands im slowly dying lecompte nodded dolefully look at her color no doubt its the glow from those red roses that i see in her cheeks its fever miss warren exclaimed indignantly she took a handglass from her lap and regarded her vivid young features smallpox attacks people differently with me the first sign is fever she had parted her abundant hair and swept it back from her brow in an attempt to make herself look ill but with the sole effect of enhancing her appearance of abounding health madame la branches best black shawl was drawn about her plump and dimpled shoulders assuming a hollow tone she inquired do you see any other change in me yes and i rather like that way of doing your hair vittoria says i look like a picture of sister dolorosa or something is miss fabrizi in in how could she be out isnt she a dear norvin i knew youd meet some day does she play whist of course not silly shes nearly a nun but we sat up in bed all night talking oh its a comfort to have some one with you at the last some one in whom you can confide i cant bear to to soar aloft with so much on my conscience ive confessed everything whats to prevent her from catching the disease and soaring away with you shes a nurse theyre just like doctors you know they never catch anything is that hideous watchman still at his post yes fast asleep with his mouth open i hope a fly crawls in said the girl vindictively then in an eager whisper couldnt you manage to get past him wed have a lovely time here for a week rilleau raised his voice in jealous protest and leave me sitting on my throne never im giving this boxparty for you myra nell oh you could come too i respect the law norvin told her but lecompte continued to complain i dont see what youre doing here at this time of day anyhow blake have you no business responsibilities im a member of the contagion club ive a right to be here we were discussing rice old shoes and orange blossoms when you interrupted the languid mr rilleau continued frankly speaking as a friend i dont see anything in your conversation so far to interest a sick lady why dont you talk to the yellowhaired nurse i intend to vittoria is back in the kitchen preparing my diet said myra nell shes making fudge i believe i i seem to crave sweet things maybe its another symptom it must be blake acknowledged ill ask her what she thinks of it with a glance at the slumbering guard he vaulted the low fence and made his way around to the rear of the house he heard vittoria singing as he came into the flowergarden a lowpitched sicilian lovesong he called to her and she came to a window smiling down at him spotless and fresh in her stiff uniform do you know that youre trespassing and may get into trouble she queried the watchman is asleep and i had to speak to you no wonder he sleeps myra nell holds the poor fellow responsible for all her troubles and those young men have nearly driven him insane is there any danger of smallpox really not the slightest this quarantine is merely a matter of form but that child she broke into a frank sweet laugh she pretends to be horribly frightened all the time she is acting the little fraud norvin flushed a bit under her gaze i had no chance to talk to you last night and you will have no chance now vittoria tipped her chin the slightest bit i must see you alone impossible tonight you can slip away on some pretext or other it is really important she regarded him questioningly if that is true i will try but i cannot meet you at olivetas house besides you must not go into that quarter alone at night what do you mean he inquired wondering how she could know of his danger because no american is safe there now perhaps i can meet you on the street yonder ill be waiting it may be late unless i tell myra nell heaven above shed insist on coming too just because its forbidden very well now go before you are discovered during the afternoon his excitement increased deliciously and that evening he found himself pacing the shaded street near the la branche home with the eager restlessness of a lover it was indeed late when vittoria finally appeared myra nell is such a chatterbox she explained that i couldnt get her to bed have you waited long i dare say im not sure this is very exciting is it not she glanced over her shoulder up the illlighted street rows of shade trees cast long inky blots between the corner illuminations the houses on either side sat well back in their yards increasing the sense of isolation it is quite a new experience for me for me too i hope were not seen signore norvin blake and a trained nurse oh the comment theres a bench near by where we can sit passersby will take us for servants you are the butler i am the maid she laughed i am glad you can laugh he told her you were very sad there at terranova ive learned the value of a smile life is full of gladness if we can only bring ourselves to see it now tell me the meaning of this i knew it must be important or i would not have come back of the bench upon which she had seated herself a jessamine vine depended filling the air with perfume the night was warm and still and languorous through the gloom she regarded him with curiosity i hate to begin he said i dread to speak of unpleasant things to you i wish we might just sit here and talk of whatever we pleased we cannot sit here long on any account but let me guess it is your work against those men exactly you know the history of our struggle with the mafia everything i am leading a hard fight and i think you can help me why do you think so she asked in a low voice i have given up my part i have no desire for revenge nor have i i do not wish to harm any man but i became involved in this through a desire to see justice done and i have reached a point where i cannot stop or go back it started with the arrest of gian narcone you know how donnelly was killed they took his life for narcones and he too was my dear friend all this is familiar to me she said in a strained tone i will tell you something that no one knows but myself i have a friend among the mafiosi and it is he not i who has brought the murderers of mr donnelly to an accounting you know him yes at least i think i do his name she was staring at him oddly i feel bound not to reveal it even to you he has told me many things among them that belisario cardi is alive is here and that it is he who worked all this evil what has all this to do with me she inquired have i not told you that i gave my search into other hands it was cardi who killed one whom we both loved one for whose life i would have given my own it was cardi who destroyed my nextbest friend a simple soul who lived for nothing but his duty now he has threatened my life also does that count for nothing with you she leaned forward searching his face earnestly you are a brave man you should go away where he cannot harm you i would like very much to he confessed but i am too great a coward to run away and why do you tell me this i need your help my mysterious friend can do no more he has said so im not equal to it alone oh she cried as if yielding to a feeling long suppressed i did so want to be rid of it all and now you are in danger the greatest danger wont you give it up he shook his head puzzled at her vehemence i dont wish to drag you into it against your will but oliveta lives there among her countrypeople she must know many things which i as an outsider could never learn i need help there was a long silence before the girl said yes i will help for i am still the same woman you knew in sicily i am still full of hatred i would give my life to convict martels assassins but i am fighting myself that is why i have gone to live with oliveta until i have conquered and am ready to become a sister please dont say that oliveta you know is alone she went on with forced composure and so i watch over her she is to be married soon and when she is safe then i think i can return to the sisters and live as i long to it will be a good match much better than i ever hoped for and she loves which is even more blessed to contemplate vittoria laid her hands impulsively upon his arm meanwhile i cannot refuse such aid as i can give you for you have already suffered too much through me you have suffered have you not it has turned my hair gray he laughed trying not to show the depth of his feeling but now that i know you are safe and well and happy nothing seems to matter does myra nell know who you are no one knows save you and oliveta if that child even dreamed she lifted her slender hands in an eloquent gesture my secret would be known in an hour now i must go for even housemaids must observe the proprieties its late i think i had better see you safely home i dare say our watchman has found himself a comfortable bed the slumbers of nightwatchmen are notoriously deep and papa la branche has finished his solitaire there is no danger no one was in sight as they stole in through the driveway to the servants door she gave him her hand and he pressed it closely whispering when shall i see you again after the quarantine i can do nothing until then you will go back to olivetas house yes but you must never come there even in daylight she thought for a moment while he still retained her hand i will instruct you later she broke off suddenly and at the same instant blake heard a stir in the darkness behind him vittoria drew him quickly into the black shadows of the rear porch where they stood close together afraid to move until the man had passed the kitchen gallery was shielded by a latticework covered with vines and blake felt reasonably safe within its shelter he was beginning to breathe easier when a voice barely an armslength away inquired gruffly whos there he would have given something handsome to be out of this foolish predicament which he knew must be very trying to his companion but the fates were against him to his horror the man struck a match and mounting the steps to the porch flashed it directly into his face good evening said blake with rather a weak attempt at assurance what are you doing here the guard demanded dont you know that this house is quarantined i do kindly lower your voice there are people asleep the fellows eyes took in the girl in her stiffly starched uniform before the match burned out and darkness engulfed them once more im not a burglar humph i dont know whether you are or not i assure you urged vittoria strike another match and ill prove to you that im not dangerous when the light flared up once more norvin selected a card from his case and handed it to the watchman i am norvin blake president of the cotton exchange but this information failed of the desired effect oh i know you but this aint exactly the right time to be calling on a lady vittoria felt her companions muscles stiffen i will explain my presence later he said stiffly then turning to vittoria i am sorry i disturbed this estimable man good night just a minute the watchman broke in you neednt say good night what do you mean this house is quarantined for smallpox well nobody can come or go without the doctors permission i understand that now that youre here i reckon youll stay miss fabrizi uttered a smothered exclamation youre crazy said blake angrily yes well thats my instructions i havent been inside that dont make any difference the lady has its absurd you cant force shh breathed vittoria some one had entered the kitchen at their back a light flashed through the window the door opened and mr la branche clad in a rusty satin dressinggown and carpet slippers stood revealed a lamp in his hand i thought i heard voices he said what is the trouble theres no trouble at all sir blake protested then found himself absurdly embarrassed vittoria and the guard both began to speak at once and at length she broke into laughter saying poor mr blake i fear he has been exposed to contagion it was necessary for him to talk with me on a matter of importance and now this man tells him he cannot leave but from papa la branches expression it was evident that he saw nothing humorous in the situation to talk with you at this hour im working for the board of health and those are my orders declared outraged authority it was imperative that i see miss fabrizi the blame for this complication is entirely mine norvin assured the old creole the representative of the board of health inquired loudly didnt the doctors tell you that nobody could come or go mr la branche they did but my dear man this is no ordinary case now that i have explained i shall go first apologizing to mr la branche for disturbing him no you wont the master of the house stepped aside holding his light on high miss fabrizi is my guest he said quietly so no explanations are necessary this man is but doing his duty and therefore mr blake i fear i shall have to offer you the poor hospitality of my roof until the law permits you to leave impossible sir i i regret that we have never met before but you are welcome and i shall do my best to make you comfortable he waved his hand commandingly toward the open door thank you but i cant accept really i fear that you have no choice but the idea is ridiculous preposterous im a busy man i cant shut myself up this way for a week or more besides i couldnt allow myself to be forced upon strangers in this manner if you are a good citizen you will respect the law said la branche coldly bother the law i have obligations why the very idea is absurd ill see the health officers and explain at once the old gentleman however still waited while the watchman took his place at the top of the steps as if determined to do his duty come what might norvin found vittorias eyes upon him and saw that beneath her selfpossession she was intensely embarrassed evidently there was nothing to do now but accept the situation and put an end to the painful scene at any sacrifice once inside he could perhaps set himself right but for the present no explanations were possible he might have braved the board of health but he could not run away from papa la branches accusing eye bowing gravely he said you are quite right sir and i thank you for your hospitality if you will lead the way i will follow the two culprits entered the big empty kitchen then followed the rotund little figure which waddled ahead of them into the front part of the house xvii an obligation is met montegut la branche paused in the front hall at the foot of the stairs it is late he said no doubt mademoiselle wishes to retire i would like to offer a word of explanation norvin ventured but vittoria interposed quietly mr la branche is right explanations are unnecessary bowing graciously to them both she mounted the stairs into the gloom above followed by the old creoles polite voice a pleasant sleep mademoiselle and happy dreams leading the way into the library he placed the lamp upon a table then turning to his unbidden guest inquired coldly well his black eyes were flashing underneath his gray brows and he presented a fierce aspect despite his gown which resembled a mother hubbard and his slippers which flapped as he walked i must apologize for my intrusion said norvin i wish you to understand how it came about in view of your attentions to my wifes cousin it was unfortunate that you should have selected this time this place for your er adventure exactly im wondering how to spare miss warren any annoyance i fear that will be impossible she must know the truth she must not know she must not guess msieu exclaimed the old man my wife and i can take no part in your intrigues myra nell is too well bred to show resentment at your conduct no matter what may be her feelings norvin flushed with exasperation then suddenly felt ashamed of himself surely he could trust this chivalrous old soul with a part of the truth once his scruples were satisfied the mans very sense of honor would prevent him from even thinking of what did not concern him i think you will understand better he said when you have heard me through i cant tell you everything for i am not at liberty to do so but you know perhaps that i am connected with the committee of justice i do you dont know the full extent of the task with which i am charged however perhaps not its gravity may be understood when you know that i have been marked for the same fate as chief donnelly the old man started my labors have taken me into many quarters i seek information through many channels it was upon this business in a way that i came to see miss fabrizi i do not follow you she is a sicilian she knows much which would be of value to the committee and to me it was necessary for me to see her alone and secretly if the truth were known it would mean her life perhaps the creoles bearing altered instantly say no more i believe you to be a man of honor and i apologize for my suspicions may i trust you to respect this confidence it is sealed but this doesnt entirely relieve the situation i cant explain to madame la branche or to miss myra nell even as much as ive explained to you some day will you relieve me from my promise of secrecy queried the old man with an eager birdlike glance from ms bright eyes assuredly as soon as we have won our fight against the mafia then i will lie for you and confess later i have never lied to my wife msieu except upon rare occasions mr la branche chuckled merrily and even then only about trifles so the result absolute trust supreme confidence on her part a happy state for man and wife is it not ha i am a very good liar an adept as you shall see for i am not calloused by practice and therefore liable to forgetfulness with me a lie is always fresh in my mind it is a matter of absorbing interest hence i do not forget myself heaven knows the excitement of nursing an innocent deceit and of seeing it grow and flower under my care will be most welcome for the monotony of this abominable confinement but i must inquire do you play piquet i am rather good at it norvin confessed whereat papa la branche seemed about to embrace him you are sent from heaven he declared you deliver me from darkness thirtyseven games of napoleon today think of it i was dealing the thirtyeighth when you came but piquet ah that is a game even though my angel wife abominates it we have still five days of this hideous imprisonment so let us agree to an hour before lunch an hour before dinner then um perhaps two hours in the evening at a few cents a game eh you agree my friend the little man peered up timidly perhaps but no i dare say you are sleepy and it is late i should enjoy a game or two right now norvin falsified but first dont you think wed better rehearse our explanation of my presence a good idea you came to see me upon business i telephoned and you came like a good friend then let me see i was so overjoyed to see a new face that i rushed forth to greet you and behold that scorpion that loathsome reptile outside pronounced you infected he forced you to enter even against my protestations it was all my fault i am desolated with regrets eh how is that you see nature designed me for a rogue excellent but what is our important business true since i retired from active affairs i have no business that is awkward is it not may i ask in what line you are engaged i am a cotton factor then i shall open an account with you i shall give you money to invest come there need be no deceit about that i shall write you a check at once thats hardly necessary so long as we understand each other but mr la branche insisted saying one lie is all that i dare undertake i have told two at the same time but invariably they clashed and disaster resulted there i trust you to make use of the money as you think best but enough what do women know of business it is a mysterious word to them now piquet he dragged norvin to a seat at a table then trotted away in search of cards his slippers clapclapping at every step as if in gleeful applause shall we cut for deal msieu ah he sighed gratefully as he won and began to shuffle with four hours of piquet every day and a lie upon my conscience i feel that i shall be happy in spite of this execrable smallpox myra nells emotions may be imagined when on the following morning she learned who had broken through the cordon while she slept lordy lordy she exclaimed with round eyes he said hed do it but i didnt think he really would she had flounced into vittorias room to gossip while she combed her hair mr la branche says its all his fault and hes terribly grieved miss fabrizi told her now now your eyes are fairly popping out wouldnt your eyes pop out if the handsomest the richest the bravest man in new orleans deliberately took his life in his hands to see you and be near you but he says it was important business which brought him vittoria smiled guiltily tell that to your granny you dont know men as i do have you really seen him im not dreaming i have seen him with these very eyes and if you were not such a lazy little pig youd have seen him too shall you take your breakfast in your room as usual vittorias eyes twinkled dont tease me miss warren exclaimed with a furious blush i i love to tease other people but i cant stand it myself breakfast in my room indeed but of course i shall treat him with freezing politeness why should you pretend to be offended dont you understand this is bound to cause gossip why the idea of norvin blake the handsomest the richest yes yes the idea of his getting himself quarantined in the same house with me and our being here together for days maybe for months why it will create the loveliest scandal ill never dare hold up my head again in public never you see how it must make me feel im compromised myra nell undertook to show horror in her features but burst into a gale of laughter do you care for him very much im crazy about him why dearie after this were were almost married now watch me show him how deeply im offended but when she appeared in the diningroom late as usual her frigidity was not especially marked on the contrary her face rippled into one smile after another and seizing blake by both hands she danced around him singing you did it you did it you did it hurrah for a jolly life in the pesthouse madame la branche was inclined to be shocked at this behavior but inasmuch as papa montegut was beaming angelically upon the two young people she allowed herself to be mollified i couldnt believe vittoria myra nell told norvin dont you know the danger you run mr la branche exclaimed i am desolated at the consequences of my selfishness i did not sleep a wink i can never atone quite right his wife agreed you must have been mad montegut it was criminal of you to rush forth and embrace him in that manner but delight of my soul the news he bore the joy of seeing him it unmanned me the creole waved his hands wildly as if at a loss for words oh you fibber norvin told me hed never met you said myra nell eh impossible we are associates in business business of a most important but what does that term signify to you my precious ladybird nothing enough then to say that he saved me from disaster naturally i was overjoyed and forgot myself his wife inquired timidly have your affairs gone disastrously worse than that ruin stared us in the face until he came our deliverer blake flushed at this fulsome extravagance particularly as he saw myra nell making faces at him fortunately everything is arranged now he assured his hostess but this did not satisfy miss warren who with apparent innocence questioned the two men until papa la branche began to bog and flounder in his explanations fortunately for the men she was diverted for the moment by discovering that the table was set for only four oh we need another place she exclaimed for vittoria the old lady said quietly no dear while we were alone it was permissible but it is better now in this way myra nells ready acquiescence was a shock to norvin arguing as it did that these people regarded the countess margherita as an employee could it be that they were so utterly blind he was allowed little time for such thoughts however since myra nell set herself to the agreeable task of unmasking her lover and confounding montegut la branche but cousin althea was not of a suspicious nature and continued to beam upon her husband albeit a trifle vaguely then when breakfast was out of the way the girl added to norvins embarrassment by flirting with him so outrageously that he was glad to flee to papa monteguts piquet game at the first opportunity he said to vittoria i feel dreadfully about this why they seem to think youre a a servant its unbearable that is part of my work i am accustomed to it she smiled then you have changed but if they knew the truth how differently theyd act they must never suspect more depends upon it than you know i feel horribly guilty all the same it can make no difference what they think of me im afraid however that you have made it difficult for myra nell so it appears i didnt think of her when i entered this delightful prison you had no choice it wasnt altogether that i wanted to be near you vittoria her glance was level and cool her voice steady it was chivalrous to try to spare me the necessity of explaining the situation was trying but we were both to blame and now we must make the best of it myra nells misunderstanding is complete and she will be unhappy unless you devote yourself to her i simply cant i think ill keep to myself as much as possible you dont know that girl vittoria said you think she is frivolous and inconsequent that she has the brightness of a sunbeam and no more substance but you are mistaken she is good and true and steadfast underneath and she can feel deeply blake found that it was impossible to isolate himself mr la branche clung to him like a drowning man his business affairs called him repeatedly to the telephone myra nell appropriated him with all the calm assurance of a queen and madame la branche insisted upon seeing personally to his every want the only person of whom he saw little was vittoria fabrizi his disappearance of course required much explaining and long conversations with his office with his associates and with police headquarters where his plight was regarded as a great joke this was all very well but there were other and unforeseen consequences bernie dreux heard of the affair with blank amazement which turned into something resembling rage his duty however was plain he packed a valise and set out for the quarantined house like a man marching to his execution for he had a deathly horror of disease and smallpox was beyond compare the most loathsome but the health department had given strict orders and he was turned away nay he was rudely repulsed crushed humiliated he retired to his club and there it was that rilleau found him steeped in melancholy and a very insidious brand of kentucky bourbon when lecompte accused blake of breaking the rules of the game the little bachelor rose resolutely to his sisters defense norvins got a perfect right to protect her he lied and i honor him for it you mean hes engaged to her rilleau inquired blankly bernie nodded well so am i so are delevan and mangny and the others not this way mr dreuxs alcoholic flush deepened he thought she was in danger so he flew to her side mighty unselfish to sacrifice his business and brave the disease he did it with my consent yunderstand when he asked me i said norvin my boy she needs you so he went unselfish is no word for it hes a man of honor a hero mr rilleaus gloom thickened and he too ordered the famous bourbon he sighed id have done the same thing i offered to and im no hero i suppose that ends us its a great disappointment though i hoped during carnival week that shed well i wanted her for my real queen bernie undertook to clap the speaker on the shoulder and admonish him to buck up but his eye was wavering and his aim so uncertain that he knocked off mr rilleaus hat with due apologies he ran on she couldnt have been queen at all only for him he made it possible i had as much to say about it as he did bernie whispered he lent me the money yunderstand it was all right under the circumstances everything being settled but the date yunderstand rilleau rose at last saying youre all to be congratulated he is the best fellow in new orleans and theres only one man id rather see your sister marry than him thats me now im going to select a present before the rush commences what would you think of an onyx clock with gold cupids straddling around over it fine im sorry old man i like you yunderstand bernie upset his chair in rising to embrace his friend then catching sight of august kulm who entered at the moment he made his way to him and repeated his explanations mr kulm was silent attentive despairing and spoke vaguely of suicide whereupon dreux set himself to the task of drowning this teutonic instinct in the flowing bowl i dont know what has happened to the boys myra nell complained to norvin on the second day after his arrival lecompte was going to read me the rubaiyat and raymond cline promised me a bunch of orchids but nobody has shown up its jealousy he said lightly i suppose so of course it was nice of you to compromise me this way its delicious in fact but i didnt think it would scare off the others you think i have compromised you you know you have terribly im engaged to all of them everybody in fact except you but they know my presence here is unintentional oh is it really she laughed dont you believe it is goodness dont spoil all my pleasure if ever i saw two cringing selfconscious criminals its you and papa montegut men are so deceitful heighho i thought this was going to be splendid but you play cards all day with mr la branche while i die of loneliness what would you like me to do he faltered i dont know its very dull couldnt you sally forth and drag in lecompte or murray or raymond she looked up with eyes beaming bernie was furious wasnt he mr la branche came trotting in with the evening newspaper in his hand its in the paper he chuckled those reporters get everything whats in the paper myra nell snatched the sheet from his hand and read eagerly as he went trotting out again with his slippers applauding every step oh lordy blake read over her shoulder and his face flushed norvin were really truly engaged now see after a pause and youve never even asked me there was only one thing to say myra nell he began i want you will you oh you goose youre not taking a cold shower will you do me the honor to be my wife she burst into delightful laughter so you actually have the courage to propose shall i take time to think it over or shall i answer now now by all means very well of course i wont why not he exclaimed with a start the idea you dont mean it i do why norvin youre old enough to be my father oh no im not do you think i could marry a man with gray hair it all gets gray after a while no ill be engaged to you but ill never marry any one never that would spoil all the fun this very thing shows how stupid it must be the mere rumor has scared the others away youre a mormon im not ill tell you what ill do if i ever marry any one ill marry you thats altogether too indefinite i dont see it meanwhile were engaged arent we if thats the case he reached uncertainly for her hand and pressed it i im very happy she waited an instant watching him shyly then said now i must show this to vittoria but please dont look so frightened the next instant she was gone when miss fabrizi entered her room a halfhour later it was to find her with her eyes red from weeping as for norvin he had risen to the occasion as best he could he loved myra nell sincerely tenderly in a bigbrotherly way he would have gone to any lengths to serve her yet he could not feel toward her as he felt toward vittoria fabrizi he nerved himself to stand by his word even though it meant the greatest sacrifice but the thought agonized him nor was he made more easy as time went on for mr and mrs la branche took it for granted that he was their cousins affianced lover and while the girl herself now bewildered him with her shy inviting coquetry or again berated him for placing her in an unwelcome position he could never determine how much she really cared when the quarantine was finally lifted he walked out with feelings akin to those of a prisoner who has been reprieved xviii belisario cardi after his enforced idleness blake was keen to resume his task yet there was little for him to do save study the one big problem which lay at the root of the whole matter the evidence against the prisoners was in good shape they were indicted and the trial date would soon be set they had hired competent lawyers and were preparing for a desperate fight where the necessary money came from nobody seemed to know although it was generally felt that a powerful influence was at work to free them the district attorney expressed the strongest hopes of obtaining convictions but there came disturbing rumors of alibis for the accused of manufactured evidence and of overwhelming surprises to be sprung at the last moment detectives were shadowed by other detectives lawyers were spied upon their plans leaked out witnesses for the state disappeared opposing the authorities was a master hand at once so cunning and so bold as to threaten a miscarriage of justice this could be none other then belisario cardi yet he seemed no nearer discovery than ever norvin had no idea how to proceed he could only wait for some word from his new ally vittoria fabrizi it might be that she would find a clue and he feared to complicate matters by any premature or illjudged action meanwhile he encountered the results of bernie dreuxs garrulity he found himself generally regarded as myra nells accepted suitor and of course could make no denial but when he telephoned to the girl herself and asked when he might call he was surprised to hear her say you cant call at all why youve ruined all my enjoyment as it is there hasnt been a man in this whole neighborhood since i came home even the policeman takes the other side of the street all the more reason why i should come i wont have you hanging around until i get my carnival dresses fitted oh norvin you ought to see them theres onewhite brocaded peau de soie all frills and rosebuds the bodice is trimmed with pearl passementerie and its a dear after a moments hesitation she added norvin dear what does it cost to rent the front page of a newspaper i dont know i dont think it can be done i wondered if you couldnt do it and deny our engagement do you want to break it he could hardly keep the eagerness out of his voice oh no but id like to deny it until after the carnival now dont be offended ill never get my dances filled if im as good as married to you imagine a queen with an empty programme i just love you to pieces of course but i cant allow our engagement to interfere with the success of the carnival can i dont you know this is a thing we cant joke about of course i do it has taught me a good lesson what ill never be engaged to another man well i should hope not do you intend to marry me myra nell i dont know sometimes i think i will then again im afraid nobodyd ever come to see me if i did ill get old like you im not old wed both have gray hair and i cant talk any more here comes bernie with an armful of dresses and a mouthful of pins if he coughs ill be all alone in the world no you cant see me for a week i dont even want to hear from you except what well the strain of dressfitting is tremendous im nearly always hungry ravenous for nourishment you mean youre out of candy i suppose practically theres hardly a whole piece left theyve all been nibbled blake did not know whether to feel amused or ashamed he was relieved at the girls apparent carelessness yet this halfserious engagement had put myra nell in a new light he could not think of their relations as really unchanged and this was inevitable since his sentiment for her was genuine the grotesqueness of the affair even myra nells own attitude toward it seemed a violation of something sacred but nothing could subdue the joy he felt in his growing intimacy with vittoria whom he managed to see frequently although she never permitted him to come to olivetas house little by little her reserve melted and more and more she seemed to forget her intention of devoting herself to a religious life while fears for her friends safety appealed to the deep mother instinct which had remained latent in her she was unable however even with olivetas assistance to put any information in his way and blake could think of no better plan than to try once more to sound caesar maruffi if caesar had really written the letters it would be strange if he could not be induced to go farther despite his obvious fear of cardi it was unbelievable that a man who knew so much about the mafia was really in ignorance of its leaders identity and blake was convinced that if he acted diplomatically and seized the right occasion he could bring the fellow to unbosom himself discarding all thought of his own safety he went often to the red wing club but he found caesar wary and he dared not be too abrupt time and again he was upon the verge of speaking out but something invariably prevented some inner voice warned him that the mans mood was unpropitious that his extravagant caution was not yet satisfied he allowed the sicilian to feel him out to his hearts content and at last seeing that he made no real progress he set out one evening resolved to risk all in an effort to reach some definite understanding he was delayed in reaching the foreign quarter and the dinnerhour was nearly over when he arrived at the cafe maruffi was there as usual but he had finished his meal and was playing cards with some of his countrymen swarthy eagerfaced voluble fellows whose chatter filled the place they greeted norvin politely as he seated himself near by then went on with their amusement as he ordered and ate his dinner he was near enough to hear their talk and to catch an occasional glimpse of the game so that he was not long in finding that they played for considerable stakes they were as earnest as schoolboys and he watched their everchanging expressions with interest particularly when he discovered that maruffi was in hard luck the big sicilian sat bulked up in a corner black silent and sinister his scowling brows bespeaking his rage occasionally he growled a curse then sent the waiter scurrying with an order other italians were drawn to the scene and crowded about the players when norvin had finished his meal he sat back to smoke and idly sip his claret thinking he would wait until the game broke up so that he might get caesar to himself and perhaps put the issue to the test he began to study the fellows face thinking what force what passion lay in it puzzling his brain for some means of enlisting that energy upon his side but as fortune continued to run against maruffi he began to fear that the time was not favorable what a picture those laughing hawklike men formed surrounding the black resentful merchant martel savigno could have drawn a group like that he mused for he had a rare appreciation of his own people no matter what might be said of his talent he had done some very creditable sicilian sketches in fact norvin had one framed in his room what a pity the count had been stricken in the first years of his promise what a ruthless hand it was that had destroyed him what a giant mind it was which had kept all sicily in terror and scaled its lips in that very group yonder there probably was more than one who knew the evil genius in person and yet they were held in a thralldom of fear which no offer of riches could break what manner of man was this cardi what hellish methods did he follow to wield such despotism those cardplayers were impudent unscrupulous blades as ready to gamble with death as with their jingling coins and yet they dared not lift a hand against him blake saw that the game had reached a point of unusual intensity the players were deeply engrossed the spectators had fallen silent with bright eyes fixed upon the mounting stakes when the tension broke norvin saw that caesar had lost again and smiled at the excited conversation which ensued there was a babble of laughter of curses of expostulation shafts of badinage flew at the sicilian merchant in the midst of it he raised a huge hairy fist and brought it down smiting the table until the coins the cards and the glasses leaped his face was distorted his voice was thick with passion illustration silenzio he growled i play my own game and i lose silenzio he growled with such imperative fury that the others fell silent then hoarsely i play my own game and i lose that is all you are like old wives with your advice it is my accursed luck which will some day bring me to the gallows now deal that same nausea which invariably seized norvin blake in moments of extreme excitement swept over him now his whole body went cold the knot of figures faded from his vision he heard the noisy voices as if from a great distance a giant hand had reached forth and gripped him halting his breath and his heartbeats the room swam dizzily in a haze he found an instant later that he had risen and was gripping the table in front of him as if for support he had upset his goblet of wine and a wide red stain was spreading over the white cloth to him it was the blood of martel savigno he stared down at it dazedly his eyes glazed with horror and surprise as the crimson splotch widened his heart took up its halting labors then began to race faster and faster until he felt himself smothering his frame was swept with tremors then the raucous voices grew louder and louder mounting into a roar as if he were coming out from a swoon and all the time that red blotch grew until he could see no other color it blurred the room and the quarreling gamblers it steeped the very air he was still deathly sick as only those men are whose blood sours whose bones and muscles disintegrate at the touch of fear he did not remember leaving the place but found the cool night air fanning fresh upon his face as he lurched blindly down the dark street within his eyes the picture of a scowling blackbrowed visage in his ears that hoarse unforgettable command silenzio a single word burdened with rage and venom had carried him back over the years to a certain moment and a certain spot on a sicilian mountainside the peculiar arrogance the harsh vibrations of that voice permitted no mistake he saw again a ghostgray road walled in with fearful shadows and at his feet two silent twisted bodies dimly outlined against the dust a match flared and ricardo ferara grinned up into the night beneath his grizzled mustache narcone the butcher his hands still wet was whining for the blood of the american he heard martel savigno call heard the young counts voice rise and break in a shriek heard a thunder of hoofs retreating into the blackness sicilian men were peering into his face talking excitedly through their chatter came that same voice imperative furious filled with rage and it cried silenzio there was no mistaking it the veil was ripped at last blake recalled the dim outlines of that burly bullnecked figure as it had leaped into brief silhouette against the glare of the blazing match that night so long ago and then he cried out aloud in the empty street as he realized how complete was the identification he remembered donnellys vague prediction five minutes before he was stricken if what i suspect is true it will cause a sensation a sensation indeed the surprise the realization of consequences was too overpowering to permit coherent thought this maruffi or cardi or whoever he might prove to be was tremendous no wonder he had been hard to uncover no wonder his power was absolute he had the genius of a great general a great politician and a great criminal all in one and he was as pitiless as a panther more deadly than a moccasin what influence had perverted such intellect into a weapon of iniquity what evil of the blood what lesion of the brain had distorted his instincts so monstrously caesar maruffi rich respected honored it was unbelievable blake halted after a time and took note of the surroundings into which his feet had led him he was deep in the foreign quarter and found with a start that he had been heading for vittoria fabrizis dwelling as if guided by some extraneous power by a strong exercise of will he calmed himself what he needed above all things was counsel some one with whom he could share this amazing discovery perhaps his presence here was a sign at any rate he decided to follow his first impulse so hastened onward inside the house his brain cleared in a measure as he waited but his agitation must have left plain traces for no sooner had vittoria appeared than she exclaimed my friend something has happened he rose and met her halfway yes something tremendous something terrible it was unwise of you to come here you may be followed tell me quickly what has made you so indiscreet i have found belisario cardi she paled her eyes flamed yes its incredible his voice shook i know the man well thats the marvel of it ive trusted him ive rubbed shoulders with him i went to him tonight to enlist his aid he paused realizing for the first time that the mystery of those letters was now deeper than ever if maruffi had not written them who then hes the best and richest italian in the city god the thing is appalling he must go to justice said vittoria quietly his name caesar maruffi the girls eager look faded into one of blank dismay no she said strangely no do you know him in a daze she nodded then cast a hurried frightened look over her shoulder madonna mia caesar maruffi disbelief and horror leaped into her eyes you are mad not caesar i do not believe it caesar caesar he cried why do you call him that why do you doubt what is he to you she drew away with a look that brought him to his senses there is no mistake he mumbled he is cardi i know it i wait wait dont tell me she went groping uncertainly to the door dont tell me yet a moment later he heard her call oliveta come quickly sorella mia a friend quickly oliveta recognizably the same girl that he had known in sicily entered with her black brows lifted in anxious inquiry her dark eyes wide with apprehension some evil has befallen tell me she said wasting no time in greeting no nothing evil blake assured her our friend has made a terrible discovery said vittoria in a faint voice i cannot believe i want you to hear carina she motioned to norvin i have been seeking our enemy belisario cardi and i have found him oliveta cried out in fierce triumph god be praised he lives that is enough i feared he had cheated us listen exclaimed vittoria in such a tone that the peasant girl started you dont understand i understand nothing except that he lives his blood shall wash our blood that is what we swore and i have never forgotten even though you have he shall go to meet his dead and his soul shall be accursed she spoke with the same hysterical ferocity as when she had cursed her fathers murderer in the castello of terranova he calls himself caesar maruffi blake told her there was a pause then she said simply that is a lie no no i saw him that night i saw him again tonight it cannot be that is what i have said concurred vittoria with strange eagerness no no it would be too dreadful mystified and offended blake defended his statement forcibly believe it or not as you please it is true that night in sicily he came among the brigands who held me prisoner they were talking excitedly he cried silenzio in a voice i can never forget tonight he was gambling and he lost heavily he was furious his friends began to chatter and he cried that word again i would know it a thousand years hence i saw it all in a flash i saw other things i had failed to grasp his size his appearance i tell you he is belisario cardi god help me whispered the daughter of ferara crossing herself with uncertain hand she was staring affrightedly at vittoria god help me she kept repeating the words and gesture blake turned inquiringly to the other woman and read the truth in her eyes good lord he cried he is her she nodded they were to be married oliveta began speaking slowly to her foster sister yes it is indeed true i have suspected something but i dared not tell you all the things he said all that i half learned and would not ask about i was afraid to know i closed my eyes and my ears body of christ and all the time my fathers blood was on his hands vittoria appealed helplessly to blake you see how it is what is to be done but his attention was all centered upon oliveta whose face was changing curiously his blood she exclaimed i have loved that infamous man his hands she let her gaze fall to her own as if they too might be stained from contact does maruffi know who you really are he asked vittoria answered no she would have told him soon we were waiting until we had run down those men you see it was largely through her that i worked those things which i could not discover she learned from him it was she who secured the names of di marco and garcia and the others sudden enlightenment brought a cry from him you then you wrote those letters you are the one who knows vittoria nodded but her eyes were fixed upon the girl oliveta was whispering through white lips it is the will of god he has been delivered into my hands i am beginning to wait vittoria did not withdraw her anxious gaze after an instant she inquired gently oliveta what shall we do there is but one thing to do you mean i have been sent by god to betray him her face became convulsed her voice harsh i curse him living and dead in the name of my father in the name of martel savigno who died by his hand may he pray unheard may he burn in agony for a thousand thousand years take him to the hangman signore he shall die with my curse in his ears i cant bring him to justice blake confessed i know him to be the assassin but my mere word isnt enough to convict him i have no way of connecting him with the murder of chief donnelly and that is what he must answer for olivetas lips writhed into a tortured smile never fear i shall place the loop about his neck where my arms have lain he has told me little for i feared to listen but wait give me time vittoria cried in a shocked voice child not that it was from him i learned of gian narcone and his other friends now i shall learn from his own mouth the whole truth he shall weave the rope for his own destruction oh he is like water in my hands and i shall lie in his arms lucrezia you cant touch him knowing i will have the truth if i give myself to him in payment if i am damned for eternity god has chosen me she broke down into frightful sobs with sisterly affection the other woman put her arms about her and tried to soothe her at length she led her away but for a long time norvin could hear sounds of the peasant girls grief when vittoria reappeared her face was still pale and troubled i can do nothing with her she seems to think we are all divine instruments poor girl she is in a frightful position im too amazed to talk sensibly but surely she wont persist you do not know her she is like iron even i have no power over her now and i fear for the result she is sicilian to the core she will sacrifice her body her soul for vengeance and that man is a fiend its better to know the truth now than later yes the web of chance has entangled our enemies and delivered them bound into our hands we cannot question the wisdom of that power which wove the net oliveta is perhaps a stronger instrument than i she will never rest until her father is avenged the strangest part is that you are the one who knows you told me you had given up the quest and so i had i was weary of it my life was bleak and empty i could not return to sicily because of the memories it held we came south in answer to the call of our blood and i took up a work of love instead of hate while oliveta found a new interest in this man who was wonderful and strong and fierce in his devotion to her i attained to that peace for which i had prayed then when i was nearly ready for my vows my foster sister learned of gian narcone and came to me we talked long together and i finally yielded to her demands she is a contadina she never forgets and i wrote that first letter to mr donnelly i feared you might see and recognize my handwriting so i bought one of those new machines and learned to use it what followed you know when we discovered that the mafia had vowed to take chief donnellys life in payment for narcones we were forced to go on or have innocent blood upon our hands the chief was killed in spite of our warnings and then you appeared as the head of his avengers you my truest friend the brother of martel i knew that the mafia would have your life unless you crushed it and in a sense i was responsible for your danger it seemed my duty to help break up this accursed brotherhood much as i wished that the work might fall to other hands oliveta was eager for the struggle and while she fought for her vengeance i i fought to save you you did this for me he cried falteringly yes my position at the hospital my occupation made it easy for me to learn many things it was i who discovered the men who actually killed chief donnelly for normando after his injury was brought there and i attended him i learned of his accomplices where the boy gino cressi was concealed and other things lucrezia was a spy here among her countrypeople and caesar was forever dropping bits of information though we never dreamed who he was she went to the long french window and shading her eyes with her hands peered down into the dark street then you have thought of me he urged you thought of me even before we were drawn together by this net of chance you have seldom been out of my thoughts she told him quietly you were my only friend and i live a lonely life turning with a wistful smile she asked and have you now and then remembered that sicilian girl you knew so long ago his voice was unruly it broke as he replied your face is always before me contessa i grew very tired of waiting but i always felt that i would find you she gave him her two hands the thought of your affection and loyalty has meant much to me and it will always mean much when i have entered upon my new life and know that you are happy in yours but i never shall be happy he broke out hoarsely she stopped him with a grave look please you must go now i will show you a way so long as cardi is at liberty you must not return the risks are too great for all of us as oliveta learns the truth i shall advise you poor girl she needs me tonight come she led him through the house down a stairway into the courtyard and directed him into a narrow passageway which led out to the street behind even this is not safe for they may be waiting she laid her hand upon his arm and said earnestly you will be careful i will he fought down the wild impulse to take her in his arms as he skulked through the gloom searching the darkest shadows like a criminal his fear was gone and in his heart was something singing joyously xix felicite youre just the man im looking for bernie dreux told norvin whom he chanced to meet on the following morning ive made a discovery indeed what is it hist the walls have ears bernie cast a glance over his shoulder at the busy sunlit street and the hurrying crowds come with a melodramatic air he led blake into a coffeehouse near by you cant guess it he exclaimed when they were seated and whats more i wont try youre getting too mysterious bernie ive found him whom the bellcow the boss dago the chief headhunter belisario cardi blake started and the smile died from his lips dreux ran on with some heat oh dont look so skeptical any man with intelligence and courage can become as good a detective as i am ive found your capomafia thats all who is he you wont believe me but hes well thought of you know him oneil knows him hes generally trusted norvin began to suspect that by some freak of fortune his little friend had indeed stumbled upon the truth dreux was leaning back in his chair and beaming triumphantly come come whats his name joe poggi poggi hes the owner of that fruitstand youve been watching exactly chief donnelly suspected him nonsense norvins face was twitching once more poggi is on the force hes a detective like you come off bernie was shocked and incredulous have you shadowed him for months without learning that hes an officer i i hes the fellow just the same oh bernie youd better stick to the antique business mr dreux flushed angrily if he isnt one of the gang he cried what was he doing with salvatore di marco and frank garcia the night after donnellys murder whats he doing now with caesar maruffi if he isnt after him for money blakes amusement suddenly gave place to eagerness maruffi he exclaimed whats this joe poggi is blackmailing caesar maruffi out of the money to defend his friends he was at di marcos house an hour before salvatores arrest i saw him with garcia and bolla and cardoni more than once why didnt you tell this to oneil i tried to but he wouldnt listen when i said i was a detective he laughed in my face and we had a scene he told me i couldnt find a ham at a hebrew picnic since then ive been working alone poggi has been lying low lately but bernie hesitated and a slight flush stole into his cheeks ive become acquainted with his wife were good friends and what have you learned from her nothing directly but i think shes acting as her husbands agent collecting blackmail to hire lawyers for the defense poor caesar hes rich and poggi is bleeding him since joe is on the police force he knows every thing that goes on no wonder you cant break up the mafia by jove said norvin i was warned of a leak in the department but it couldnt be poggi he began to question bernie with a peremptoriness and rapidity that made the little man blink mingled with much that was grotesque and irrelevant he drew out a fairly credible story of nocturnal meetings between the italian detective and caesar maruffi which taken in connection with what he already knew was most disturbing how did you come to meet mrs poggi he inquired at last the question brought that same flush to mr dreuxs cheeks she found i was following her one day he explained so i told her i was smitten by her beauty i got away with it too rather clever for an amateur eh is she goodlooking bernie nodded shes an outrageous flirt though and oh what a temper he shuddered nervously why shed stick a knife into me or bite my ears off if she suspected shes insanely jealous its not a nice position for you no but ive something far worse than her on my hands felicite shes more to be feared than the mafia surely miss delord isnt dangerous isnt she mocked the bachelor you ought to see he started his eyes fixed themselves upon the entrance to the cafe with a look of horror he paled and cast a hurried glance around as if in search of a means of escape here she is now norvin turned to behold miss delord approaching them like an arrow she was a tiny creature but it was plain that she was out in all her fighting strength her pretty face was dark with passion her eyes were flashing and they pierced her lover with a terrible glance as she paused before him crying furiously well where is she felicite stammered dreux ddont cause a scene miss delord stamped a ridiculously small foot and cried again oblivious of all save her black jealousy where is she i say eh you fear to answer you shield her perhaps a plump brown hand darted forth and seized bernie by the ear giving it a tweak like the bite of a parrot ouch he exclaimed loudly felicite youll ruin us a waiter began to laugh in smothered tones tell me stormed the diminutive fury it is time we had a settlement she and i i will lead you to her by those asss ears of yours and let her hear the truth from your own mouth miss delord you do bernie an injustice norvin said placatingly she turned swiftly injustice bah he is a flirt a loathsome trifler what could be more abominable felicite ddont make a scene groaned the unhappy dreux nursing his ear and staring about the cafe with frightened appealing eyes bernie was just you defend him eh stormed the creole girl you are his friend beware msieu that i do not pull your ears also i came here to unmask him please sit down youre attracting attention attention yes but this is nothing to what will follow i shall make known his depravity to the whole city for he has sweethearts like that king solomon of old it is his beauty msieu listen he loves a married woman imagine it felicite for heavens sake a dago woman by the name of piggy but wait i shall make her squeal piggy a suitable name indeed he follows her about he meets her secretly he adores her the scoundrel is it not disgusting but i am no fool i too have watched i have followed them both and i shall scratch her black face until it bleeds then i shall tell her husband the whole truth miss delord paused out of breath for the moment while bernie pawed at her in a futile manner beads of perspiration were gathering upon his brow and he seemed upon the verge of swooning as if from habit however he reached forth a trembling hand and deftly replaced a loose hairpin then tucked in a stray lock which felicites vehemence had disarranged yyour hats on one side my dear he told her she tossed her head and drew away saying your touch contaminates me monster blake drew out a chair for her his eyes were twinkling as he said wont you allow him to explain there is nothing to explain since i know everything see his tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth he quails he cannot even lie but wait until i have told the piggys husband that big black ruffian then perhaps he will find his voice ah if i had found that woman here there would have been a scene i promise you help me out gasped mr dreux and norvin came willingly to his friends rescue bernie loves no one but you he said so i glory in the fact that i loathe him please sit down no miss delord plumped herself down upon the edge of the proffered seat her toes bardy touching the floor im working mrs poggi bernie explained im a detective what new falsehood is this no falsehood at all norvin told her he is a detective a very fine one too and he has been working on the mafia case for a long time it has been part of his work to follow the poggis please dont allow your jealousy to ruin everything i am not jealous i merely will not let him love another that is all but what is this you say her velvet eyes had lost a little of their hardness they were as round as buttons and fixed inquiringly upon the speaker you must believe me he said impressively though i cant tell you more even of this you mustnt breathe a word to any one mr dreux has had to permit this misunderstanding much against his will because of the secrecy imposed upon him with wonderful quickness the anger died out of felicites face to be replaced by a look of sweetness a detective she cried turning to bernie you work for the public good at the risk of your life and that dago woman is one of the mafia what a noble work you forgive me instantly mr dreuxs embarrassment left him and he assumed a chilling haughtiness forgive you after such a scene my dear girl thats asking a good deal felicites lips trembled her eyes as they turned to norvin held such an appeal that he hastened to reassure her of course he forgives you hes delighted that you care enough to be jealous bernie grinned whereupon his peppery sweetheart exploded angrily you delight in my unhappiness villain you enjoy my sufferings very well you have flirted i shall flirt you drive me to distraction i shall behave accordingly that antoine giroux worships me and would buy a ring for me tomorrow if i would consent ill murder him exclaimed dreux with more savagery than his friend believed was in him now dont start all over again blake cautioned them you are mad about each other nothing of the sort declared felicite at least bernie worships you the girl fell silent and beamed openly upon her lover why dont you two end this sort of misunderstanding and marry miss delord paled at this bold question dreux gasped and flushed dully but seemed to find no words that is impossible he said finally its nothing of the sort urged blake you think youre happy this way but youre not and never will be youre letting the best years of your lives escape why care what people say if youre happy with each other and unhappy when apart to his surprise the girl turned upon him fiercely do not torture bernie so she cried there are reasons why he cannot marry i love him he adores me that is enough two tears gathered and stole down her smooth cheeks you are cruel to hurt him so msieu bernie youre a coward blake said with some degree of feeling but the girl flew once more to her lovers defense coward indeed his bravery is unbelievable does he not risk his life for this miserable committee of yours he has the courage of a thousand lions i admire your loyalty and of course its really not my affair although why dont you go out to the park where the birds are singing and talk it all over those birds are always glad to welcome lovers meanwhile ill look into the poggi matter bernie was glad enough to end the scene and he arose with alacrity but his face was very red and he avoided the eye of his friend as for miss delord now that her doubts were quelled she was as sparkling and as cheerful as an april morning if bernie dreux supposed that his troubles for the day had ended with that stormy scene in the cafe he was greatly mistaken he had promised felicite that he would fly to her with the coming of dusk and that neither the claims of duty nor of family should keep him from her side but that evening myra nell seized upon him as he was cautiously tiptoeing past her door on his way out the tone of her greeting gave him an unpleasant start i want to talk with you young man she said now nobody save myra nell ever assumed the poetic license of calling bernie young man and even she did so only upon momentous occasions a quick glance at her face confirmed his premonition of an uncomfortable halfhour i havent a cent really he said desperately this isnt about money she was very grave it is something far more serious then what can it be he inquired in a tone of mild surprise but she deigned no explanation until she had led him into the library waved him imperiously to a seat upon the haircloth sofa and composed herself on a chair facing him reflecting that he was already late for his appointment he wriggled uncomfortably under her gaze well she said after a pause something in her bearing caused his spirits to continue their downward course her brow was furrowed with a somber portent yesm he said nervously quite like a small schoolboy whose eyes are fixed upon the sunshine outside ive heard the truth yesm he repeated vaguely needless to say im crushed bernie slowly whitened as the meaning of his sisters words sank in he seemed to melt to settle together and his eyes filled with a strange hunted expression what are you talking about he demanded thickly you know very well do i she nodded her head this is the first disgrace which has ever fallen upon us and im heartbroken i dont understand he protested in a voice so faint she could scarcely hear him but his pallor increased he sat upon the edge of the couch clutching it nervously as if it had begun to move under him he really felt dizzy myra nell had a bottle of smellingsalts in her room and he thought of asking her to fetch it even yet i cant believe it of you she continued the idea that you my protector the one man upon whom ive always looked with reverence and respect you my sole remaining relative the idea that you should be entangled in a miserable intrigue why its appalling her lips quivered tears welled into her eyes seeing which the little man felt himself strangling dont he cried miserably i didnt think youd ever find it out i seem to be the only one who doesnt know all about it myra nell shuddered i simply couldnt help it he told her im human and ive been in love for years but think what people are saying he passed a shaking hand over his forehead which had grown damp one never realizes the outcome of these things until too late i hoped youd never discover it ive done everything i could to conceal it thats the terrible part your double life dont you know its wrong wicked vile i cant really believe it of you why youre my own brother the honor of our name rests upon you the the idea that you should fall a victim to the wiles of a low vulgar bernie stiffened his back and his colorless eyes flashed myra nell shes nothing like that he declared you dont know her perhaps but didnt you think of me he nodded his head didnt you realize it meant my social ruin again he nodded his mind in a whirl of doubts and fears and furious regrets nobodyll care to marry me now what do you think lecompte will say what the devil has lecompte to do with it youre engaged to norvin blake oh yes among the others bernie was too miserable to voice the indignation which such flippancy evoked in him he merely said norvin isnt like the others its different with him he compromised you yes it was rather nice of him but do you think hell care to continue our engagement after this oh hes known about felicite for a long time most of the fellows know thats what makes it so hard this intelligence entirely robbed myra nell of words she stared at her halfbrother as if trying to realize that the man who had made this shocking admission was he do you mean to tell me that your friends have known of this disgrace she asked at length bernie nodded of course it seems terrible to you myra nell for youre innocent and unworldly and im rather a dissipated old chap but im awfully lonely the men of my own age are successful and busy and theyve all left me behind the young ones dont find me interesting you see i dont know anything i cant do anything im a failure nobody cares anything about me except you and felicite i found a haven in her society her faith in me is splendid to her im all thats heroic and fine and manly so when im with her i begin to feel that im really all she believes all that i hoped to be once upon a time she shares my dreams and i allow myself to believe in her beliefs and yet you must realize that your conduct is shocking i suppose i do you must know that youre an utterly immoral person he nodded youre my protector bernie youre all i have im a poor motherless girl and i lean upon you but you must appreciate now that youre quite unfit to act as my guardian the little man wailed his miserable assent his halfsisters reproachful eyes distracted him the mention of her defenseless position before the world touched his sorest feeling it was almost more than he could stand he was upon the verge of hysterical breakdown when her manner suddenly changed her eyes brightened and rising swiftly she flung herself down beside him upon the sofa where he still sat clutching it as if it were a bucking horse then curling one foot under her she bent toward him all eagerness all impulsiveness with breathless intensity she inquired tell me bunnie is she pretty very pretty indeed he said lamely whats she like quick tell me all about her this is the wickedest thing i ever heard of and im perfectly delighted it was bernies turn to look shocked he arose indignantly myra nell you paralyze me have you no moral rats interrupted miss warren inelegantly ive let you preach to me in the past but never again weve the same blood in us bunnie if i were a man i dare say id do the most terrible things although ive never dreamed of anything so fiercely awful as this i should hope not he gasped so come now tell me everything does she pet you and call you funny names and ruffle your hair the way i do bernie assumed an attitude of military erectness its bad enough for me to be a reprobate in secret he said stiffly but i shant allow my own flesh and blood to share my shame and gloat over it the girls essential innocence her childlike capacity for seeing only the romance of a situation in which he himself recognized real dishonor made him feel ashamed yet he was grateful that she took the matter after all so lightly his respite however was of short duration failing to draw him out on the subject which held her interest for the moment myra nell followed the beckoning of a new thought fixing her eyes meditatively upon him she said with mellow satisfaction it seems were both being gossiped about dear you what have you been doing he demanded in despair oh i really havent done anything but its nearly as bad theres a report that norvin blake is paying all my carnival bills and naturally it has occasioned talk of course i denied it the idea is too preposterous bernie who had in a measure recovered his composure felt himself paling once more amy cline told me shed heard that he actually bought my dresses but amy is a catty creature shes mad over lecompte you know thats why i encourage him and she wanted to be queen too but la la shes so skinny well i was furious naturally miss warren paused quick to note the telltale signs in her brothers face bernie she said look me in the eye then it is true her own eyes were round and horrified her rosy cheeks lost something of their healthy glow for once in her capricious life she was not acting i never dreamed youd learn about it her brother protested when norvin asked me if youd like to be queen i forbade him to mention it to you for i couldnt afford the expense but he told you in spite of me and when i saw your heart was set on it i i just couldnt refuse i allowed him to loan me the money bernie bernie myra nell rose and turning her back upon him stared out of the window into the dusk of the evening at length she said with a strange catch in her voice youre an anxious comfort bernie for an orphan girl another moment passed in silence before he ventured you see i knew hed marry you sooner or later so it wasnt really a loan he saw the color flood her neck and cheek at his words but he was unprepared for her reply ill never marry him now ill never speak to him again why not cant you understand do you think im entirely lacking in pride what kind of man can he be to tell of his loan to make it public that the very dresses which cover me were bought with his money she turned upon her halfbrother with clenched hands and eyes which were gleaming through tears of indignation i could kill him for that he didnt tell bernie blurted out he must have nobody knew it except you her eyes widened she hesitated you she gasped it was indeed the hour of bernies discomfiture myra nell was his divinity and to confess his personal offense against her to destroy her faith in him was the hardest thing he had ever done but he was gentleman enough not to spare himself at the cost of an effort which left him colorless he told her the truth id been drinking that day of the quarantine i thought id fix it so he couldnt back out myra nells lips were white as she said slowly measuring him meanwhile with a curious glance well i reckon you fixed it right enough i reckon you fixed it so that neither of us can back out she turned and went slowly upstairs past the badly done portraits of her people which stared down at her in all their ancient pride she carried her head high before them but once in her room she flung herself upon her bed and wept as if her heart were breaking fortunately for norvin blakes peace of mind he had no inkling of bernies indiscretion nor of any change in myra nell his work now occupied his mind to the exclusion of everything else while anxiously waiting for some word from oliveta he took up with oneil the investigation of joe poggi the italian detective before definite results had been obtained he was delighted to receive a visit from vittoria fabrizi who explained that she had risked coming to see him because she dared not trust the mails and feared to bring him into the foreign quarter then oliveta has made some progress he asked eagerly yes good poor girl it must be terribly hard for her to play such a part no one knows how hard it has been you would not recognize her she has changed so her love for which we were so deeply thankful has turned into bitter hate it was a long time before she dared trust herself with maruffi for always she saw the blood of her father upon his hands but she is sicilian she turned to stone and finally welcomed his caresses ah that man will suffer for what he has made her endure blake inquired curiously does he really love her yes that is the strangest part of the whole affair it is the one good thing in his character the bit of gold in that queer alloy which goes to make him up perhaps if he had met her when he was younger love would have made him a different man in her hands he is like wax he is simple childlike he fawns upon her he would shower her with gifts and attentions yet underneath there is that streak of devilish cunning what has he told so far much that is significant little that is definite we have pieced his words together bit by bit and uncovered his life an inch at a time it was he who paid the blood money to di marco and bolla thousand dollars a thousand dollars for the life of dan donnelly the countess lowered her yellow head they in turn hired larubio normando and the rest the chain is complete then all that remains is to prove it link by link before arresting him is not olivetas word sufficient proof no blake paced his office silently followed by the anxious gaze of his caller at length he asked will she take the stand at the trial heaven forbid nothing could induce her to do so that is no part of her scheme of vengeance you understand being sicilian she will work only in her own way besides that would mean the disclosure of her identity and mine i feared as much in that case every point which maruffi confesses to her must be verified by other means that will not be easy but i dare say it can be done the law is such a stupid thing exclaimed vittoria it has no eyes it will not reason it cannot multiply nor add it must be led by the hand like a blind old man and be told that two and two make four however i have a plan i confess that i see no way what do you advise these accused men are in the parish prison yes very well imprison spies with them who will gain their confidence in that way we can verify maruffis words thats not so easily done there is no certainty that they would make damaging admissions men who dwell constantly with thoughts of their guilt feel the need of talking the mind is incapable of continued silence it must communicate the things that weigh it down let the imprisoned mafiosi mingle with one another freely whenever ears are open near by and you will surely get results seeing him frown in thought she continued after a moment you told me of a great detective agency one which sent that man corte here to betray narcone yes the pinkertons i was thinking of them i believe it can be done at any rate leave it to me to try and if i succeed no one shall know about it not even our own police when our spies enter the prison if they do it will be in a way to inspire confidence among the mafiosi meanwhile do you think you are entirely safe in that foreign quarter quite safe although the situation is trying i have felt the strain almost as deeply as my unfortunate sister and when it is all over you will be ready for your vows her answer gave no sign of the hesitation he had hoped for and half expected of course he shook his head doubtfully somehow i i feel that fate will keep you from that life i cannot think of you as a sister of mercy in spite of himself his voice was uneven and his eyes were alight with the hope which she so steadfastly refused to recognize as she rose to leave she said musingly how strange it is that this master of crime and intrigue should betray himself through the one good and unselfish emotion of his life samson was shorn of his strength by the fingers of a woman he said yes many good men have been betrayed by evil women but it is not often that evil men meet their punishment through good ones and now a riverderci goodby for a few days he pressed his lips lightly to her fingers xx the man in the shadows late one day a fortnight after her visit to blakes office vittoria returned from a call upon myra nell warren to find oliveta in a high state of apprehension the girl who had evidently kept watch for her met her at the door and inquired nervously what news what have you heard nothing further sorella mia impossible god in heaven i am dying this suspense i cannot endure it longer vittoria laid a comforting hand upon her courage she said we can only wait i too am torn by a thousand demons caesar has gone but no one knows where oliveta shuddered we are ruined he suspects so you have said before but how could he suspect i dont know yet judge for yourself i worm his secrets from him at the cost of kisses and endearments i hold him in my arms and with smiles and caresses i lead him to betray himself then suddenly without warning or farewell he vanishes i tell you he knows he has the cunning of the fiend and your friend signore blake has blundered olivetas face blanched with terror she clung to her companion weakly repeating over and over he will return god help us he will return even though he knows the truth which is far from likely he would scarcely dare to come here vittoria said striving with a show of confidence which she did not feel to calm her foster sister you do not know him as i do you do not know the furies which goad him in his anger in spite of herself vittoria felt choked again by those fears which during the days since maruffis disappearance she had with difficulty controlled she knew that the net had been spread for him in all caution yet he had slipped through it whether he had been warned or whether mere chance had taken him from the city at the last moment neither she nor blake nor the chief of police had been able to learn all had been done with such secrecy that except a bare halfdozen trusted officers no one knew him to be even suspected of a part in the mafias affairs norvin had been quick to sense the possible danger to the two women and had urged them to accept his protection but they had convinced him that such a course had its own dangers for in case the mafioso was really unsuspicious the slightest indiscretion on their part might frighten him therefore they had insisted upon living as usual until something more definite was known this afternoon vittoria had received a message from myra nell requesting or rather demanding her immediate attendance she had gone gladly hoping to divert her mind from its present anxieties but the girl had talked of little except norvin blake and the effect had not been calming oliveta soon discovered that her sister was in a state to receive rather than give consolation carissima you are ill she said with concern vittoria assented it is my eyes my head the heat is perhaps as much to blame as our many worries she removed her hat and pressed slender fingers to her throbbing temples while oliveta drew the curtains against the fierce rays of a westering sun later clad in a loose silken robe vittoria flung herself upon the low couch and her companion let down her luxuriant masses of hair until it enveloped her like a cloud she lay back upon the cushions in grateful relaxation while oliveta combed and brushed the braids soothing her with an occasional touch of cool palms or straying fingers how strange that both our lives should have been blighted by this man the peasant girl said at length shh you must not think of him so unceasingly vittoria warned her ones thoughts go where they will when one is sick and wearied i have grown to hate everything about me the people the life the country sicily is calling you perhaps oliveta answered eagerly yes you too are unhappy my dearest let us go home home she let her hands fall idle and stared ahead of her seeing the purple hills behind terranova the dusty graygreen groves of olivetrees the brilliant fields of sumach the arbors bent beneath their weight of blushing fruit i want to see the village people again my fathers relatives old aliandro and the notarys little boy he must be a wellgrown lad by now murmured vittoria aliandro i fear is dead but it is a long road to terranova we have changed yes everything has changed my happiness has changed to misery my hope to despair my love to hate poor sister mine vittoria sympathized be patient no wound is too deep for time to heal the scar will remain but the pain will disappear i should know for i have suffered and do you suffer no longer it has been a long time since you mentioned martel for a moment vittoria remained silent her eyes closed when she replied it was not in answer to the question i can never return to sicily for it would awaken nothing but distress in me but there is no reason why you should not go if you wish you have the means while all that i had has been given to the sisters oliveta cried out at this passionately i have nothing that which you gave me i hold only for you but i would not go alone i shall never leave you some time you must my dear our parting is not far off i am not sure the peasant girl hesitated deep in your heart do you hope to find peace inside the walls of that hospital yes peace at least perhaps contentment and happiness also that is impossible said oliveta at which vittorias hazel eyes flew open eh why not because you love this signore blake oliveta you are losing your wits perhaps but i have not lost my eyes as for him he loved you even in sicily what then he is a fine man i think you could hear an echo to the love you cherished for martel if you but listened vittoria gazed at her fostersister with a look half tender and half stern her voice had lost some of its languid indifference when she replied any feeling i might have would indeed be no more than an echo i am not like other women something in me is dead it is the power to love as women love i am like a person who emerges from a conflagration blinded the eyes are there but the sight is gone perhaps you only sleep like the princess who waited for a kiss vittoria interrupted impatiently no no and you mistake his feelings i attract him perhaps but he loves miss warren and has asked her to marry him what is more she adores him and they were made for each other she adores him echoed the other che dio she only plays at love her affections are as shifting as the winds that may be but he is in earnest it was he who gave her this social triumph he made her queen of the carnival he even bought her dresses it was that which caused her to send for me this afternoon heaven knows i was in no mood to listen but she chattered like a magpie as if i could advise her wisely she is very dear to you oliveta ventured indeed yes she shares with you all the love that is left in me i think i understand you have principles my sister you have purposely barred the way to your fairy prince and will continue sleeping vittorias brow showed faint lines but whether of pain or annoyance it was hard to tell oliveta sighed what evil fortune overhangs us that we should be denied love please let us speak no more of it she turned her face away and for a long time her companion soothed her with silent ministrations meanwhile the dusk settled the golden flames died out of the western windows the room darkened seeing that her patient slept oliveta arose and with noiseless step went to a little shrine which hung on the wall she knelt before the figure of the virgin whispering a prayer then lit a fresh candle for her sisters pain and left the room partly closing the door behind her she had allowed the maidservant to go for the afternoon and found upon examination that the days marketing had been neglected there was still time however in which to secure some delicacies to tempt vittorias taste so she flung a shawl over her dark hair and descended softly to the street a little earlier on this same afternoon as norvin blake sat at work in his office the telephone bell roused him from deep thought he seized the instrument eagerly hoping for any news that would relieve the tension upon his nerves for uncertainty as to maruffis whereabouts had weighed heavily upon him especially in view of the possible danger to the woman he loved and to her devoted companion the voice of oneil came over the wire fulltoned and distinct hello is this blake and then weve got maruffi when where shouted norvin five minutes ago at his own house johnson and dean have been watching the place he went with them like a lamb too theyve just phoned me that theyre all on their way here good do you need me no see you later goodby the acting chief slammed up his receiver leaving his hearer stunned at the suddenness of this longawaited denouement maruffi taken his race run then this was the end of the fight a ferocious triumph flooded norvins brain with belisario cardi in the hands of the law the spell of the mafia was broken savigno and donnelly were as good as avenged he experienced an odd feeling of relaxation as if both his body and brain were cramped and tired with waiting then realizing that the countess and oliveta must have suffered an even greater strain he set out at once to give them the news in person as he turned swiftly into royal street he encountered oconnell who noting his haste and something unusual in his bearing detained him to ask the cause havent you heard exclaimed norvin maruffis captured at last you dont mean it yes oneil told me over the wire not ten minutes ago oconnell fell into step with him saying incredulously and he came without a fight lord i cant believe it nor i i expected trouble with him sure i thought he was a bad one but thats the way it goes sometimes i reckon he saw he had no chance the officer shook his red head its just my blamed luck to miss the fun oconnell was one of the few who had been first trusted with the news of maruffis identity and for the past fortnight he had been casting high and low for the sicilians trail ever since that october night when he had supported donnelly in his arms as the life ebbed from the chief ever since he had knelt on the soft banquette with the sting of powder smoke in his nostrils he had been obsessed by a fanatical desire to be in at the death of his friends murderers he left blake at his destination and hurried on toward st phillip street in the vague hope that he might not be too late to take a hand in some part of the proceedings blakes hand was upon olivetas bell when the door opened and she confronted him her start her frightened cry gave evidence of the nervous dread under which she labored dont be afraid oliveta he said quickly i come with news good news she swayed and groped blindly for support he put out his hand to sustain her but she shrank away from him saying faintly then he is captured god be praised in spite of the words her eyes filmed over with tears a look of abject misery bared itself upon her face where is the countess above resting come she too will rejoice let me take her the news you were going out and i think the air will do you good be brave oliveta you have done your share and theres nothing more to fear she acquiesced dully her olive features were ghastly as she felt her way past him she walked like a sick woman he watched her pityingly for a moment then mounted the stairs as he laid his hand upon the door it gave to his touch and he stood upon the threshold of the parlor vittorias name was upon his lips when by the dim evening light which came through the drawn curtains and by the faint illumination from the solitary shrine candle he saw her recumbent form upon the couch she was lying in an attitude of complete relaxation her sungilded hair straying in long thick braids below her waist those tawny ropes were of a length and thickness to bind a man about the body her lips were slightly parted her lashes lay like dark shadows against her ivory cheeks he was swept by a sudden awed abashment the impulse to retreat came over him but he lacked the will the longing which had remained so strong in him through years of denial governing the whole course of his life blazed up in him now and increased with every heartbeat he found that without willing it he had come close to the couch the girls slim hand lay upon the cushions limply upturned to him it was half open and there sprang through him an ungovernable desire to bury his lips in its rosy palm he knelt then quailed and recovered himself at the same instant she stirred and to his incredulous delight whispered his name a wild exultation shot through him why not yield to this madness he asked himself dizzily the long struggle was over now for this womans sake he had repeatedly played the part of bravery in a fever of fear he had done what he had done to make himself worthy of her and now at the last he was to have nothing absolutely nothing except a memory against these thoughts his notions of honorable conduct hastily and confusedly arrayed themselves but he was in no state to reason the same enchantment half psychic half physical ethereal yet strongly human that had mastered him in the old sicilian days was at work upon him now dimly he felt that so mighty and natural a thing ought not to be resisted he stood stiffly like a man spellbound it may have been olivetas accusation that affected the course of the sleeping womans thoughts it may have been that she felt the mans nearness or that some influence passed from his mind to hers however it was she spoke his name again her fingers closed over his she drew him toward her he yielded her warm breath beat upon his face then the last atoms of selfrestraint fled away from him like sparks before a fierce night wind a fiery madness coursed through his veins as he caught her to him her lips were fevered with sleep for a moment the caress seemed real it was the climax of his hopes the attainment of his longings he crushed her in his arms her hair blinded him he buried his face in it kissing her brow her cheek the curve where neck and shoulder met and all the time he was speaking her name with hoarse tenderness so strangely had the fanciful merged into the real that the girl was slow in waking her eyelids fluttered her breast rose and fell tumultuously and even while her wits were struggling back to reality her arms clung to him but the transition was brief her eyes opened and she stiffened as with the shock of an electric current a cry a swift writhing movement and she was upon her feet his incoherent words beating upon her ears but making no impression upon her brain you god above she cried she faced him white terrorstricken yet splendid in her anger she was still dazed but horror and dismay leaped quickly into her eyes margherita you called me you drew me to you it was your real self that spoke i know it you kissed me while i slept he paled at the look with which she scorched him then broke out doggedly you wanted me you drew me close you cant undo that moment you cant my god dont tell me it was all a mistake that would make it unendurable i could never forgive myself she hid her face with a choking cry of shame no no i didnt know he approached and touched her arm timidly margherita he said if i thought you really did not call me if i were made to believe that i had committed an unpardonable offense against your womanhood and our friendship i would go and kill myself but somehow i cannot believe that i was beside myself but i was never more exalted something greater than my own will made me do as i did i think it was your love answering to mine if that is not so if it is all a delusion there is nothing left for me i have played my part out to the end my work is done and i do not see how i can go on living there was an odd mingling of pain and rapture in the gaze she raised to his it gave him courage why struggle longer he urged gently why turn from love when heaven wills you to receive it and learn to be a woman i was in your thoughts and you longed for me as i have never ceased all these years to hunger for you please please margherita why fight it longer what have you done what have you done she whispered over and over she looked toward the open door as if with thought of escape or assistance and despite his growing hope blake was miserable at sight of her distress how came you here alone with me she asked at length oliveta was here only a moment ago i came with good news for both of you i met oliveta as she went out and when i had told her she sent me to you dont you understand dear it was good news our quest is over our work is done and god has seen fit to deliver our enemy she flung out a trembling hand while the other hid itself in the silk and lace at her breast what is this you tell me maruffi am i still dreaming maruffi has been arrested is it possible this long nightmare ended at last like this maruffi is arrested you are safe no one has been killed it is all right oneil telephoned me and i came here at once to tell you and oliveta when did they find him where not half an hour ago at his house we have been watching the place ever since he disappeared feeling sure hed have to return sooner or later if only for a moment he is under lock and key at this instant blake attributed a stir in the hall outside to the presence of the maidservant margherita whose eyes were fixed upon him failed to detect a figure which stood in the shadow just beyond the open door does he know of our part in it olivetas part she asked oneil didnt say hell learn of it shortly in any event do you realize what his capture means i hardly do myself for one thing theres no further need of concealment i i want people to know who you are it seems hardly conceivable that belisario cardi has gone to meet his punishment but it is true lucrezia has her revenge at last it has been a terrible task for all of us but it brought you and me together i dont intend ever to let you go again margherita i loved you there in sicily ive loved you every moment every hour blake turned at the sound of a door closing behind him he saw margherita start then lean forward staring past him with a look of amazement of frightened incredulity upon her face some one a man had stepped into the dimlit room and was fumbling with the lock his eyes fixed upon them meanwhile over his shoulder the light from the windows had faded the faint illumination from the taper before the shrine was insufficient fully to pierce the gloom but on the instant of his interruption all triumph and hope all thoughts of love fled from norvins mind bursting like iridescent bubbles at a touch the flesh along his back writhed the hair at his neck lifted itself for there in the shadow huge black and silent stood caesar maruffi xxi under fire blake heard margheritas breath release itself she was staring as if at an apparition his mind working with feverish speed sought vainly to grasp the situation maruffi had broken away and come for his vengeance but how or why this had been made possible he could not conceive it sufficed that the man was here in the flesh sinister terrible malignant as hell blake knew that the ultimate test of his courage had come he felt the beginnings of that same shuddering sickening weakness with which he was only too familiar felt the strength running out from his body as water escapes from a broken vessel he froze with the sense of his physical impotency and yet despite this chaos of conflicting emotions his inner mind was clear it was bitter too with a ferocious selfdisgust there was a breathless pause before maruffi spoke lucrezia ferara he said hoarsely as if wishing to test the sound of the name so oliveta is the daughter of the overseer and you are savignos sweetheart his words were directed at margherita who answered in a thin shrill broken voice what are you doing here i came for that wantons blood give her to me oliveta she is gone the sicilian cursed gone where away into the street you you cannot find her christ maruffi reached upward and tore open the collar of his shirt blake spoke for the first time but his voice was dead and lifeless yes shes gone youre wanted you must go with me maruffi gave a snarling growling cry and his gesture showed that he was armed involuntarily blake shrank back his hand groped for his hip but halfway encountered the pile of silken cushions upon which margherita had been lying his fingers sank into them nervously his other hand gripped the carven footboard of the couch he had no weapon he had not dreamed of such a necessity in this imminent peril a new fear swept over him greater than any he had ever known it was not the fear of death it was something far worse for the moment it seemed to him inevitable that margherita ginini should at last learn the truth concerning him should see him as he was that night at terranova swift upon the heels of his longdeferred declaration of love would come the proof that he was a craven then he thought of her danger realizing that this man was quite capable in his fury of killing her too and he stiffened in every fiber his cowardice fell away from him like a rotten garment and he stood erect maruffi it seemed had not heard his last words or else his mind was still set upon oliveta gone he exclaimed then i shall not see her face grow black within my fingers not yet god how i ran he cursed again but i shall not fare so badly after all he stirred and with his movement blake flew to action swiftly with one sweep of his right hand he brought the silken cushions up before his breast and lunged at his enemy at the same instant maruffi fired in the closed room the detonation was deafening it rattled the windows it seemed to bulge the very walls blake felt a heavy blow which drove the flossfilled pillows against his body with the force of a giant hammer it tore them from his grip it crushed the breath from his lungs and spun him half around seeing that he did not fall maruffi cocked and fired a second time without aiming but his victim was upon him like a tiger and together they crashed back against the wall locked in each others arms blakes will propelled him splendidly all that indecision with which fear works upon the mind had left him but the old contraction of his nerves still hampered his action the blaze from maruffis second shot half blinded him and its breath smote him like a blow two he counted wonderingly a pain in his left side due to that first sledgehammer impact was spreading slowly but he had crossed the room under the belching muzzle of the revolver and was practically unharmed there began a struggle the more terrible since it was unequal in which the weaker man had to drive his body at the cost of tremendous effort blake was like a leader commanding troops which had begun to retreat but more power came to him under the spur of action and the pressing realization that he must give margherita a chance to get safely away if he could not wrest the weapon from maruffis hands he knew that he must receive those four remaining bullets in his own body he rather doubted that he could take that weight of lead he shouted to her to run while he wrestled for possession of the gun he had flung his right arm about his adversarys body his other hand gripped his wrist his head was pressed against maruffis chest the weapon described swift circles jerking parabolas and figures as the men strained to wrest it from each other maruffi strove violently to free his imprisoned hand and in doing so he discharged the revolver a third time the bullet brought a shower of plaster from the ceiling and blake counted with fierce exultation three he gasped his warning to the woman again then twined his leg about his antagonists in a wrestlers hold striving mightily to bear maruffi against the wall but caesar was like an oaktree failing to move him blake suddenly flung himself backward with all his weight lifting at the same instant in the hope of a fall in this he was all but successful the two reeled out into the room tripped went to their knees then rose still intertwined in that desperate embrace the odd stiff feeling in blakes side had increased rapidly it began to numb his muscles and squeeze his lungs his eyes were stinging with sweat and smoke his ears were roaring as they swayed and turned he saw that margherita had made no effort to escape and he was seized with an extraordinary rage which for a brief time renewed his strength she was at the front window crying for help jump for gods sake jump he shouted but she did not obey instead she ran toward the combatants and seized maruffis free arm in a measure checking his effort to break the other mans hold her closeness to danger agonized blake the more as he felt his own strength ebbing under that stabbing pain in his side he centered his force in the grip of his left hand clinging doggedly while the sicilian flung his two assailants here and there as a dog worries a scarf blake fancied he heard a stamping of feet in the hall outside and the sound of voices of heavy bodies crashing against the door maruffi heard it too for with a bellow of fury he redoubled his exertions a sweep of his arm flung the girl aside with a mighty wrench of his body he carried blake half across the room loosening his hold then he seized him by the throat and forced his head back illustration he wrestled for possession of the gun the shouting outside was increasing the pounding was growing louder blakes breath was cut off and his strength went swiftly his death grip on the sicilians body slackened as he tore at the fingers which were throttling him his left hand slipped citing to maruffis sleeve and finally began clawing blindly for the weapon the next moment he was hurled aside so violently that he fell his feet entangled in the cushions with which he had defended himself against the first shot he rose and renewed his attack hearing margherita cry out in horror this time maruffi took deliberate aim and when he fired the figure lurching toward him was halted as if by some giant fist four blake counted he was hit he knew but he still had strength there were but two more shots to come then he was dazed to find himself upon his knees as if through a film he saw the italian turn away and raise his weapon toward the girl who was wrenching at the door maruffi he shouted oh god then he closed his eyes to shut out what followed but he heard nothing for he slipped forward face down and felt himself falling falling into silence and oblivion as oconnell made his way toward st phillip street he nursed a growing resentment at the news norvin blake had given him his feeling toward caesar maruffi had all the fierceness of private hatred calling for revenge and he considered himself illused in that he had not even been permitted to witness the arrest he knew maruffis countrymen would be likely to make a demonstration and he was grimly desirous of being present when this occurred as he neared the heart of the italian section he saw a bluecoated officer running toward him whats up he cried have the dagoes started something maruffi was pinched but he got away the other answered johnson is hurt and oconnell lost the remaining words for he had broken into a run a crowd had gathered in front of a little shop where the wounded policeman had been carried to await the arrival of an ambulance and even before oconnell had heard the full story of the escape actingchief oneil drove up behind a lathered horse he leaped from his mudstained buggy demanding hoarsely where is he maruffi officer dean johnsons companion met him at the door of the shop he made his break while i was phoning you he answered hell didnt you frisk him roared the chief sure but we missed his gun caesar carries it on a cord around his neck niggerfashion briefly explained oconnell dean was running on excitedly i heard johnson holler but before i could get out into the street maruffi had shot him twice and was into that alley yonder i tried to follow but lost him so i came back and sent in the alarm the acting chief cursed under his breath and with a few sharp orders hurried off the few officers who had reached the scene then as an ambulance appeared he passed into the room where johnson lay as he emerged a moment later oconnell drew him aside maruffi wont try to leave town till its good and dark he said hes got a girl and ive an idea hell ask her to hide him out it was his girl who turned him up she and blake oconnell cried sharply wait does he know she did that if he does hell make for her sure that may be those two women are all alone and id feel better if they were safely out of the way ill leave you there on the way back an instant later they were clattering over the uneven flags while their vehicle rocked and bounded in a way that threatened to hurl them out even before they reached their destination they saw people running through the dusk toward the house in which the two girls lived and heard a shot muffled behind walls oneil reined the horse to his haunches as the shrill cry of a woman rang out above them and the next moment he and oconnell were inside rushing up the stairs with headlong haste they were brought to a stop before a bolted door from behind which came the sounds of a furious struggle blake norvin blake shouted oconnell break it down oneil ordered he set his back against the opposite wall then launched himself like a catapult the patrolman followed suit but although the panels strained and split the heavy door held by god hes in there the chief cried as he set his shoulder to the barrier for a second time once more together through a crevice which had opened in the upper panels they caught a glimpse of the dimly lighted room what they saw made them struggle like madmen another shot sounded and oneil in desperation inserted his fingers in the opening and tore at it through the aperture oconnell saw maruffi run to an open window at the rear then pause long enough to snatch the taper from its sconce at the foot of the little shrine and stooping touch its flame to the long lace curtains they promptly flashed into a blaze parting them he bestrode the sill lowered himself outside and disappeared it was an old but effective ruse to delay pursuit quick hes set fire to the place oconnell gasped and dashed down the hall a tremendous final heave of oneils body cleared his way a few strides and he was at the window ripping the blazing hangings down and flinging them into the court below when he turned it was to behold in the dim twilight vittoria fabrizi kneeling beside blake her arms were about him her yellow hair entwined his figure a light somebody get a light the chief roared to those who had followed him up the stairs then seeing a lamp near by he lit it hurriedly revealing the full disorder of the room he knelt beside vittoria who drew the fallen man closer to her moaning something in italian which oneil could not understand but her look told him enough and rising he ordered some one to run for a doctor strangers whitefaced and horrified were crowding in the sound of other feet came from the stairs outside questions and explanations were noisily exchanged oneil swore roundly at the crowd and drove it ahead of him down into the street where he set a man to guard the door then he returned and helped the girl examine her lovers wounds her fingers were steady and sure but in her face was such an abandonment of grief as he had never seen and her voice was little more than a rasping whisper they were still working when the doctor came followed a moment later by a disheveled stricken figure of tragedy which oneil recognized as oliveta at sight of her fostersister the peasant girl broke into a passion of weeping but vittoria checked her with an imperious word meanwhile keeping her tortured eyes upon the physician she waited upon him forestalling his every thought and need with a mechanical dexterity that bore witness to her training but all the while her eyes held a pitiful entreaty not until she heard oneil call for an ambulance did she rouse herself to connected speech then she exclaimed with hysterical insistence you shall not take him away i am a nurse he shall stay here who better than i could attend to him he can stay here if you have a place for him said the doctor oneil drew him aside inquiring will he live the doctor indicated vittoria with a movement of his head im sure of it that girl wont let him die the news of that combat traveled fast and far and it came to myra nell warren among the first despite the dreadful false position in which bernie had placed her with respect to norvin the girl had but one thought and that was to go to her friend she could not endure the sight of blood and her somewhat childlike imagination conjured up a gory spectacle she was afraid that if she tried to act as nurse she would faint or run away when most needed but she was determined to go to him and to assist in any way she could it was not consistent with her ideas of loyalty to shrink from the sight of suffering even though she could do nothing to relieve it when she mounted the stairs to olivetas livingquarters she was pale and agitated and she faltered on the threshold at the sight of strangers within were a newspaper reporter a doctor the chief of police the mayor of the city while outside a curious throng was gathered seeing miss fabrizi she ran toward her sobbing nervously where is he vittoria tell me that hes safe some one answered hes safe and resting quietly ttake me to him a spasm stirred vittorias tired features she petted the girl with a comforting hand while mayor wright said gently it must have been a great shock to you myra nell as it was to all of us but you may thank god he has been spared to you the reporter made a note upon his pad and began framing the heart interest of his story here was a new and interesting aspect of an event worth many columns vittoria led the girl toward her room but outside the door myra nell paused shaking in every limb you you love him asked the other woman the look which miss warren gave her stabbed like a knife and when the girl had sunk to her knees beside the bed with blakes name upon her lips vittoria stood for a long moment gazing down upon her dazedly later when she had sent myra nell home and silence lay over the city norvins nurse stole into the great front room where she had experienced so much of gladness and horror that night and made her way wearily to the little image of the virgin she noted with a start that the candle was gone so she lit a new one and kneeling for many minutes prayed earnestly for strength to do the right and to quench the leaping dazzling flame which had been kindled in her heart xxii a misunderstanding several days later vittoria fabrizi led bernie dreux into the room where norvin lay the little man walked on tiptoe and wore an expression of such gloomy sympathy that blake said please dont look so blamed pious it makes me hurt all over bernies features lightened faintly he smiled in a manner bordering upon the natural they wouldnt let me see you before lord how you have frightened us my nurse wont let me talk blakes eyes rested with puzzled interrogation upon the girl who maintained her most professional air as she smoothed his pillow and admonished him not to overtax himself when she had disappeared noiselessly he said well you neednt put a rose in my hand yet awhile tell me what has happened how is myra nell shes heartbroken of course she came here that first night but the smell of drugs makes her sick i suppose maruffi got away dreux straightened in his chair his face flushed proudly he put on at least an inch of stature havent you heard he inquired incredulously how could i hear anything when im doctored by a deafmute and nursed by a divinity without a tongue maruffi was captured that very night sure why the whole country knows about it again a look of mellow satisfaction glowed on the little mans face my dear boy youre a hero of course but there are others who caught him i did you norvin stared in openmouthed amazement thats what i said i me mr bernard effingwell dreux the prominent cotillion leader the secondhand dealer the art critic and amateur detective i unearthed the notorious and dreaded sicilian desperado in his lair and now hes cooling his heels in the parish prison along with his little friends why im astonished naturally i found him in joe poggis house mr poggi also languishes in the bastille how in the world well its quite a story and it all happened through the woman bernie flushed a bit as he met his companions eye when i told you about mrs poggi i didnt exactly go into all the intimate er details the truth is she became deeply interested in me i told you how i met her well she wasnt averse to receiving my attentions heavens no she ate em up before i knew it i found myself entangled in an intrigue i had hold of an electric current and couldnt let go when i didnt follow her around she followed me when i didnt make love she did she learned about felicite and there was excuse me bernie rose put his head cautiously outside the door to find the coast clear then said hell to pay i tried to back out but you cant back away from some women any more than you can back away from a prairie fire he shook his head gloomily it seems she wasnt satisfied with poggi she had ambitions shed caught a glimpse of the life that went on around her and wanted to take part in it she thought i was rich too my name had something to do with it i presume at any rate she began to talk of divorce elopement and other schemes that terrorized me she was quite willing that i murder her husband poison her relatives or adopt any little expedient of that kind which would clear the path for our true love i was in over my depth but when i backed water she swam out and grabbed me when i stayed away from her she looked me up i tried once to tell her that i didnt really care for her only once the memory brought beads of sweat to the detectives brow between her and felicite i led a dogs life if id had the money id have left town id been meeting her on street corners up to that point but she finally told me to come to the house while poggi was away it was the day you were hurt i rebelled but she made such a scene i had to agree or be arrested for blocking traffic she carries a dagger norvin in her stocking or somewhere its no longer than your finger but its the meanestlooking weapon i ever saw well i went along about dark determined to have it out with her once for all but those aristocrats during the french revolution had nothing on me i know how it feels to mount the steps of the guillotine the poggis parlor furniture is upholstered in red and smells musty i sat on the edge of a chair one eye on her and the other taking in my surroundings theres a fine crayon enlargement of joe with his uniform in a gold frame with blue mosquitonetting over it to disappoint the flies four ninetyeight and we supply the frame done by an old master of the county fair school theres an organ in the parlor too with a stuffed fishhawk on it she seemed quite subdued and coy at first so i took heart never dreaming shed wear her dirk in the house but say that woman was raised on raw beef before i could wink she had it out it has an ivory hilt and you could split a silk thread with it i suppose she didnt want to spoil the parlor furniture with me although id never have showed against that upholstery or else shes in the habit of preparing herself for manslaughter by a system of vocal calisthenics at any rate we were having it hot and heavy and i was trying to think of some good and unselfish actions i had done when we heard the back door of the cottage open and close then somebody moving in the hall mrs poggi turned green not white green and i began to picture the headlines in the morning papers the bachelor and the policemans wife they seemed to say it wasnt poggi however as i discovered when the fellow called to her he was breathing heavily as if he had been running she signaled me to keep quiet then went out and i heard them talking but couldnt understand what was said when she came back she was greener than ever and told me to go which i did realizing that the day of miracles is not done i fell down three times and ran over a child getting out of that neighborhood blake who had listened eagerly inquired the man was maruffi exactly i got back to the club in time to hear about his arrest and escape and your fight here the town was ringing with it everybody was horrified and amazed what particularly stunned me was the news that maruffi not poggi was the head of the mafia but my experience in criminal work has taught me to be guided by circumstances and not theory so when i learned more about caesars escape i fell to wondering where he could hide then i recalled his secret meetings with joe poggi and that scalding volcano of emotion from whom i had just been delivered her fright when she let me out something familiar in the voice which called to her came back and well i couldnt help guessing the truth maruffi was in the house of one of the officers who was supposed to be hunting him but his capture simple enough i went to oneil and told him we got a posse together and went after him we descended in such force and so suddenly that he didnt have a chance to resist if id known who he was at first id have tried to take him singlehanded then its well you didnt know blake smiled what bothers me dreux confessed is how mrs poggi regards my action i i hate to appear a cad id apologize if i dared vittoria appeared to warn dreux that his visit must end when the little man had gone norvin inquired you knew of maruffis arrest oh yes why didnt you tell me you were in no condition to hear news of importance is that why you have been so silent hush you have talked quite enough for the present you act strangely differently he insisted i am your nurse i am responsible for your recovery so i do as i am ordered and you havent changed he inquired wistfully not at all i am quite the same quite the same girl you knew in sicily he did not relish her undertone and wondered if illness had quickened his imagination if he was forever seeing more in her manner hearing more in her words than she meant there was something intangibly cold and distant about her or seemed to be during the first feverish hours after his return to consciousness he had seen her hanging over him with a wonderful loving tenderness it was that which had closed his wounds and brought him back toward health so swiftly but as his brain had cleared and he had grown more rational this vision had disappeared along with his other fancies he wondered whether knowledge of his pseudoengagement to myra nell had anything to do with her manner he knew that she was in the girls confidence naturally he himself was not quite at his ease in regard to miss warren the rumor about his advancing the money for her carnival expenses had been quieted through bernies efforts and the knowledge of it restricted to a necessary few although myra nell had refused his offers of marriage and treated the matter lightly he could not help feeling that this attitude was assumed or exaggerated to cover her humiliation or was it something deeper it would be terrible if she really cared for him in earnest her own character protected her from scandal the breakingoff of his supposed engagement with her could not hurt her unless she really loved him he closed his eyes cursing bernie inwardly after a time he again addressed vittoria tell me he said how maruffi came to spare you my last vision was of him aiming he had but four shots four yes he had used two in his escape from the officers before he came here i see it was horrible i felt as if i had failed you at the critical moment just as i failed as you failed whom martel the word sounded in his ears with a terrible significance he could hardly realize that he had spoken it he had always meant to tell her of course but the moment had taken him unawares his conscience his inmost feeling had found a voice apart from his volition there was a little silence at length she said in a low constrained tone did you fail him i i did he said chokingly and the way once opened he made a full and free confession of his craven fear that night on the road to terranova told her of the inherent cowardice which had ever since tortured and shamed him and of his efforts to reconstruct his whole being i wanted to expiate my sin he finished and above all i have longed to prove myself a man in your sight she listened with white set face slightly averted when she turned to him at last he saw that her eyes were wet with tears i cannot judge of these matters she said you you were no coward the other night amico mio you were the bravest of the brave you saved my life as for that other time do not ask me to turn back and judge you perhaps blame yourself too much it was not as if you could have saved martel it is rather that you should have at least tried that is how you feel is it not you had to reckon with your own sense of honor well you have won your fight you have become a new person and you are not to be held responsible for any action of that norvin blake i knew in sicily who indeed did not know his own weakness and could not guard against it ever since i met you here in new orleans i have known you for a brave strong man it is splendid the way in which you have conquered yourself splendid few men could have done it be comforted she added with a note of tenderness that answered the pleading in his eyes there is no bitterness in my heart margherita he cried desperately cant you wont you oh she interposed peremptorily do not say it i forbid you to speak then as he fell silent she continued in a manner she strove to make natural that dear girl myra nell warren has inquired about you daily she has been distracted heartbroken believe me caro norvin there is a true and loving woman whom you cannot cast aside she seems frivolous on the surface i grant you even i have been deceived but at the time of mr dreuxs dreadful faux pas she was so hurt she grieved so that i couldnt but believe she felt deeply norvin flushed dully and said nothing vittoria smiled down upon him with a look that was half maternal in its sweetness all this has been painful for you she said and you have become overexcited you must not talk any more now you are to be moved soon arent you going to be my nurse any more you are to be taken home his hand encountered hers and he tried to thank her for what she had done but she rose and admonishing him to sleep left the room somewhat hurriedly in the short time which intervened before norvin was taken to his own quarters vittoria maintained her air of cool detachment myra nell came once bringing bernie with her much to the sick mans relief his other friends began to visit him in rapidly increasing numbers he gradually took up the threads of his everyday life which had been so rudely severed meanwhile he had ample time to think over his situation he could not persuade himself that vittoria had been right in her reading of myra nell perhaps she had only put this view forward to shield herself from the expression of a love she was not ready to receive he could not believe that he had been deluded that there was in reality no hope for him mardi gras week found him still in bed and unable to witness myra nells triumph during the days of furious social activity she had little time to give him for the series of luncheons of pageants of gorgeous tableaux and brilliant masked balls kept her in a whirl of rapturous confusion and left her scant leisure in which to snatch even her beauty sleep since she was to be the flower of the festival and since her beauty was being saved for the grand climax of the whole affair she had no idea of sacrificing it proteus momus the mistick krewe of comus and the other lesser societies celebrated their distinctive nights with torch and float and tableau the city was transformed by day with bunting and flags by night it was garlanded with fire merrymakers thronged the streets their carnival spirit entered into every breast it was a glad mad week of gaiety of dancing of laughter of flirting and lovemaking under the glamour of balmy skies and velvet torchlit nights and to the pleasure of the women was added the delicious torture of curiosity regarding those mysterious men in masks who came through a blaze of fire and departed no one knew whither as the spirit of the celebration mounted myra nell abandoned herself to it she lived amid a bewilderment of social obligations through which she strove incessantly to discover the identity of her king finding herself unsuccessful in this her excitement redoubled at last came his entrance to the city the booming cannon the applauding thousands his royal progress through the streets toward the flowerfestooned stand where she looked down upon the multitude miss warrens maids of honor were the fairest of all this fair city and yet she stood out of that galaxy as by far the most entrancing her royal consort came at length a majestic figure upon a float of ivory and gold he took the goblet from her hand he pledged her with silent grace while the assembled hordes shouted their allegiance to the pair she knew he must be very handsome underneath his mask and he was bold also in a quite unkingly way for there was more in his glance than the greeting of a monarch there was ardent love a burning adoration which thrilled her breast and fanned her curiosity to a leaping flame this was indeed life romance the purple splendor for which she had been born she could scarcely contain herself until the hour of the rex ball when she knew her chance would come to match her charm and beauty against his voiceless secrecy she was no longer a makebelieve queen but a royal ruler beloved by her subjects adored by her thronemate then the glittering ball that followed the blazing lights the splendid pantomime the great shifting kaleidoscope of beauteous ladies and knightly men in gold and satin and coats of mail and above all the maddening mystery of that king at her side whose glances were now melting with melancholy now ablaze with eagerness and whose whispered words muffled behind his mask were not those of a monarch but rather those of a bold and audacious lover he poured his vows into her blushing ear he set her wits to scampering madly his sincere passion together with the dreamlike unreality of the scene intoxicated her who could he be how dared he say these things what faint familiar echo did his voice possess which one of her many admirers had the delightful effrontery to court her thus ardently beneath a thousand eyes he was drunk with the glory of this hour it seemed for he whispered words she dared not listen to what preposterous proposals he voiced what insane audacity he showed and yet he was in deadly earnest too she canvassed her many suitors in her mind she tried artfully to trap him into some betrayal the game thrilled her with a keen delight at last she realized there was but one who possessed such brazen impudence and told him she had known him from the first whereat he laughed with the abandon of a pagan and renewed the fervor of his suit blake learned from many sources that myra nell had made a gorgeous queen the papers lauded her grace her beauty the magnificence of her costumes bernie was full of it and could talk of nothing else when he dropped in as usual shes all tired out and i reckon shell sleep for a week i hope so anyhow im sorry i couldnt see her but im glad i escaped the carnival the mardi gras is hard enough on the women but it kills us men i should say so look at me a wreck after a moment he added you think myra nell is all frivolity and glitter but she isnt shes as deep as the sea norvin i cant tell you how glad i am that you two blake stirred uneasily i i admire you tremendously for youre just what i wanted to be and couldnt im talking foolishly i know but this carnival has made me see myra nell in a new light i see now that she was born for joy and luxury and splendor and and those things which you can give her shes been a care to me ive been her mother ive actually made her dresses but im glad now for all my little sacrifices two tears gathered and trickled down mr dreuxs cheeks while blake marveled at the strange mixture of qualities in this withered little beau bernies words left him very uncomfortable however and the hours that followed did not lessen the feeling although myra nell sent him daily messages and gifts now books now flowers now a plate of fudge which she had made with her own hands and which he was hard put to dispose of she nevertheless maintained a shy embarrassment and came to see him but seldom when she did call her attitude was most unusual she overflowed with gossip yet she talked with a nervous hesitation when she found his eyes upon her she stammered flushed and paled and he caught her stealing glances of miserable appeal at him she was very different from the girl he had known and had learned to love in a big impersonal way he attributed the change to his own failure in responding to her timid advances and this made him quite unhappy nor did he see much of vittoria although oliveta came daily to inquire about his progress he was up and about in time for the mafia trial but his duties in connection with it left him little leisure for society which he was indeed glad to escape new orleans he found was on tiptoe for the climax of the tragedy which had so long been its source of ferment the public was roused to a new and even keener suspense than at any time not so much perhaps by the reopening of the case as by the rumors of bribery and corruption which were gaining ground a startling array of legal talent had appeared for the defense the trial was expected to prove the greatest legal battle in the history of the commonwealth maruffi with his genius for control had assumed an ironbound leadership and laughed openly at the possibility of a conviction he had struck the note of persecution making a patriotic appeal to the italian populace and the foreign section of the city seethed in consequence on the opening day the courtroom was packed the halls and corridors of the criminal court building were filled to suffocation the neighboring streets were jammed with people clamoring for admittance and hungry for news from within then began the long tedious task of selecting a jury public opinion had run so high that this was no easy undertaking as day after day went by in the monotonous examination and challenge of talesmen as panel after panel was exhausted with no result not only did the ridiculous shortcomings of our jury system become apparent but also the fact that the mafia had as usual made full use of its sinister powers of intimidation in view of the atrocious character of the crime and the immense publicity given it those citizens who were qualified by intelligence to act as jurors had of necessity read and heard sufficient to form an opinion and were therefore automatically debarred from service it became necessary to place the final adjudication of the matter in the hands of men who were either utterly indifferent to the public weal or lacked the intelligence to read and weigh and think a remarkable wave of humanity seemed to have overwhelmed the city four out of every five men examined professed a disbelief in capital punishment which although it merely covered a fear of the mafias antagonism nevertheless excused them for cause day after day this mockery went on as the list of talesmen grew into the hundreds and the same extraordinary antipathy to hanging continued to manifest itself it occasioned remark then ridicule it would have been laughable had it not been so significant the papers took it up urging exhorting demanding that there be a stiffening of backbone but to no effect more than this the mafia had reigned so long and so autocratically it had so shamefully abused the courts in the past that a large proportion of honest men declared themselves unwilling to believe sicilian testimony unless corroborated and this prevented them from serving a week went by and then another and still twelve men who could try the issue fairly had not been found some few had been accepted to be sure but they were not representative of the city and the list of talesmen who had been examined and excused on one pretext or another numbered fully a thousand meanwhile maruffi smiled and shrugged and maintained his innocence xxiii the trial and the verdict blake did not attend these tiresome preliminaries although he followed them with intense interest the while a sardonic irritation arose in him chancing to meet mayor wright one day he said im beginning to think my original plan was the best after all you mean we should have lynched those fellows as they were taken queried the mayor with a smile something like that it wont take long to fix their guilt or innocence once we get a jury perhaps if we ever get one but the men of new orleans seem filled with a quality of mercy which isnt tempered with justice those who havent already formed an opinion of the case are incompetent to act as intelligent jurors those who could render a fair judgment are afraid you dont think theres any chance of an acquittal hardly and yet i hear the defense has called two hundred witnesses so theres no telling what they will prove you see the prosecution is handicapped by a regard for the truth something which doesnt trouble the other side in the least suppose they should be acquitted it would mean the breakdown of our legal system and what would happen blake repeated the question eyeing the mayor curiously exactly what would happen what ought to happen why nothing said the other nervously theyd go free i suppose but maruffi cant get off he resisted an officer bah hed prove that johnson assaulted him and he acted in selfdefense hed have to answer for his attack upon you norvin gave a peculiarly disagreeable laugh not at all thats the least of his sins if the law fails in the donnelly case i shant ask it to help me but his pessimism gave way to a more hopeful frame of mind when the jury was finally impaneled and sworn and the trial began the whole city likewise heaved a sigh of relief the people had been puzzled and disgusted by the delay and now looked forward to the outcome with all the keener eagerness to see justice done even before the hour for opening the streets around the criminal court were thronged the halls and lobbies were packed with a crowd which gave evidence of a breathless interest no inch of space in the courtroom was untenanted an air of deep importance a hush of strained expectancy lay over all norvin found himself in a room with the other witnesses for the state a goodly crowd of men and women whites and blacks many of whom he had been instrumental in ferreting out from beyond came the murmur of a great assemblage the shuffling of restless feet the breathing of a densely packed audience the wait grew tedious as witness after witness was summoned and did not return at last he heard his own name called and was escorted down a narrow aisle into an inclosure peopled with lawyers reporters and court officials above which towered the dais of the judge the throne of justice he mounted the witnessstand was sworn and seated himself then permitted his eyes to take in the scene before him stretching back to the distant walls was a sea of faces to his right was the jury which he scanned with the quick appraisal of one skilled in human analysis between him and his audience were the distinguished counsel a dozen or more and back of them eleven swarthy darkvisaged sicilian men seated in a row at one end sat caesar maruffi massive calm powerful at the other end sat gino cressi huddled beside his father his pinched face bewildered and terrorstricken a buzz of voices arose as the crowd caught its first full glimpse of the man who had so nearly lost his life through his efforts to bring these criminals to justice upon maruffis face was a look of such malignant hate that the witness stiffened in his chair for one brief instant the sicilian laid bare his soul as their eyes met then his cunning returned the fire died from his impenetrable eyes he was again the handsome solid merchant who had sat with donnelly at the red wing club the man showed no effect of his imprisonment and betrayed no sign of fear norvin told his story simply clearly with a positiveness which could not fail to impress the jury he withstood a grilling crossexamination at the hands of a criminal lawyer whose reputation was more than statewide and when he finally descended from the stand larubio the cobbler the senior cressi and frank normando stood within the shadow of the gallows normando he identified as the man in the rubber coat whose face he had clearly seen as the final shot was fired he pointed out gino cressi as the picket who had given warning of the chiefs approach then told of his share in the lads arrest and what gino had said concerning the other three who had helped in the shooting he had no conclusive evidence to offer nevertheless it was plain that his testimony had dealt a damaging blow to the defense yet maruffis glance showed no concern but rather a veiled and mocking insolence as blake passed out young cressi reached forth a timid hand and plucked at him whispering signore you said they would not hurt me dont be afraid no one shall harm you he told the boy reassuringly you promise yes cressi snatched his son to his side and scowled upward breathing a malediction upon the american inasmuch as the assassination had been carefully planned and executed at a late hour on a deserted street it was popularly believed that very little direct testimony would be brought out and that a conviction therefore would rest mainly upon circumstantial evidence but as the trial progressed the case against the prisoners developed unexpected strength had donnelly fallen at the first volley his assailants would in all probability never have been identified but he had stood and returned their fire for a considerable time thus allowing opportunity for those living near by to reach their windows or to run into the street in time to catch at least a glimpse of the tragedy few saw more than a little no one could identify all six of the assailants but so thoroughly had the prosecution worked so cunningly had it put these pieces together that the whole scene was reproduced in the courtroom the murderers were singled out one by one and identified beyond a reasonable doubt one witness had passed larubios shop a few minutes before the shooting and had recognized the cobbler and his brotherinlaw gaspardo cressi he also pointed out normando and paul rafiro both of whom he knew by sight from an upper window of a house near by another man who had been awakened by the noise saw normando and celso fabbri in the act of firing a woman living opposite the cobblers house peered out into the smoke and flare in time to see adriano dora kneeling in the middle of the street he was facing her the light was fairly good there could be no mistake various residents of the neighborhood had similar tales to tell for while no one had seen the beginning of the fight a dozen pairs of eyes had looked out upon the finish and many of these had recorded a definite picture of one or more of the actors a gentleman returning from a lodgemeeting had even found himself on the edge of the battle and had been so frightened that he ran straight home he had learned later the significance of the fray and had told nobody about his experience until norvin blake had traced him out and wrung the story from him he feared the mafia with the fear of death but descending from the stand he pointed out four of the assassins normando fabbri rafiro and dora he had seen them in the very act of firing a watchman on duty near by saw the boy gino running past a moment before the shooting began then as he hurried toward the disturbance he met normando dora and rafiro coming toward him the first of these carried a shotgun which dropped into the gutter as he slipped and fell the weapon and the suit of clothes normando had worn were produced and identified it transpired that this witness knew paul rafiro well and for that reason had refused to tell what he knew until norvin blake had come to him and forced the words from his lips so it ran the chain of evidence grew heavier with every hour it seemed that some superhuman agency must have set the stage for the tragedy posting witnesses at advantageous points people marveled how so many eyes had gazed through the empty rainy night it was as if a mysterious hand had reached out of nowhere and brought together the onlookers one by one willing and unwilling friend and enemy alike a more conclusive case than the state advanced against the six hired murderers during the first few days would be hard to conceive and the public began to look for equally conclusive proof against the master ruffian and his lieutenants but through it all maruffi sat unperturbed guiding the counsel with a word or a suggestion in his bearing a calm selfassurance then came a surprise which roused the whole city from out of the parish prison appeared another italian a counterfeiter who had recently been arrested and who proved to be a pinkerton detective planted among the mafiosi for a purpose larubio had been a counterfeiter in sicily it was in the government prison that he had learned his cobblers trade and out of the fullness of his heart he had talked so the detective swore concerning these foolish americans who sought to stay the hand of la mafia nor had he been the only one to commit himself di marco garcia and the other two lieutenants turned livid as the stoolpigeon confronted them with their own words on the heels of this came the crowning dramatic moment of the trial normando broke down and tried to confess in open court he was a dull ignorant man with a bestial face and a cowards eye this unexpected treachery his own complete identification had put an intolerable strain upon him without warning he rose to his feet in the crowded courtroom and cried loudly in his own tongue madonna mia i do not want to die i confess i confess norvin blake who had been watching the proceedings from the audience leaped from his seat as if electrified other spectators followed for even among those who could not understand the fellows words it was seen that he was breaking normandos ghastly pallor his wet and twitching lips his shaking hands all told the story confusion followed amid the hubbub of startled voices the stir of feet the interruption of counsel the wretch ran on repeating his fear of death and his desire to confess meanwhile beating his breast in hysterical frenzy of all the americans present perhaps norvin alone understood exactly what the sicilian was saying and why consternation had fallen upon the other prisoners larubio went white a blind and savage fury leaped into maruffis face the other nine wilted or stiffened according to the effect fear had upon them a deathlike hush succeeded the first outbreak and through normandos gabble came the judges voice calling for an interpreter there was no need for the crier to demand silence every ear was strained for the disclosures that seemed imminent blake was forcing himself forward to offer his services when the wretchs wavering eyes caught something in the audience and rested there the death sign of the brotherhood was flashed at him he halted his tongue ran thickly for a moment then he sank into his chair and burying his head in his hands began to rock from side to side sobbing and muttering nor would he say more even when a recess was declared and he was taken into the judges chambers thereafter he maintained a sullen hopeless silence which nothing could break glaring at his captors with the defiance of a beast at bay but the episode had had its effect it seemed that no one could now doubt the guilt of the prisoners the assurance of conviction grew as it was proven that maruffi himself had rented larubios shop and laid the trap for donnellys destruction step by step the plot was bared in all its hideous detail the blood money was traced from the six hirelings up through the four superiors to caesar himself then followed the effort to show a motive for the crime not a difficult task since every one knew of donnellys work against the mafia maruffis domination of the society was harder to bring out but when the state finally rested its case even blake who had been dubious from the start confessed that american law and american courts had demonstrated their efficiency during all this time his relations with vittoria remained unchanged she and oliveta eagerly welcomed his reports of the trial but she never permitted him to see her alone and he felt that she was deliberately withdrawing from him he met her only for brief interviews of myra nell meanwhile he saw nothing since with characteristic abruptness she had decided to visit some forgotten cousins in mobile of all those who followed the famous mafia trial detail by detail perhaps no one did so with greater fixity of interest than bernie dreux he reveled in it he talked of nothing else his waking hours were spent in the courtroom his dreams were peopled with sicilian figures he hung upon norvin his hero with a tenacity that was trying he discussed the evidence bit by bit he ran to him with every rumor every fresh development as the prosecution made its case his triumph became fierce and fearful to behold then when the defense began its crafty efforts he grew furiously indignant a mighty rage shook him he swelled and choked with resentment what do you think he inquired one day theyre proving alibis one by one its infamous it will take considerable sicilian testimony to offset the effect of our witnesses blake told him but dreux looked upon the efforts of the opposing lawyers as a personal affront and so declared himself why theyre trying to make you out a liar thats what it amounts to the law never intended that a gentlemans word should be disputed if i were the judge id close the case right now and instruct the sheriff to hang all the prisoners including their attorneys theyll never be acquitted bernie shook his head morosely theres a rumor of juryfixing i hear one of the talesmen was approached with a bribe before the trial i can scarcely believe that ill bet its true just the same if id known what they were up to id have got on the jury myself id have taken their money then id have fixed em youd have voted for eleven hemp neckties eh id have hung each man twice although blake at first refused to credit the rumors of corruption the following days served to verify them for more than one juryman confessed to receiving offers this caused a sensation which grew as the papers took up the matter and commented editorially a leading witness for the state finally told of an effort to intimidate him and men began to ask if this was destined to prove as rotten as other mafia cases in the past a feeling of unrest of impatience began to manifest itself vague threats were voiced but the idea of a bribed or terrorized jury was so preposterous that few gave credence to it nevertheless the closing days of the trial were weighted heavily with suspense not only the city but the country at large hung upon the outcome so strongly had racial antipathy figured that italy took note of the case and it assumed an international importance biased accounts were cabled abroad which led to an uneasy stir in ministerial and consular quarters during the exhaustive arguments at the close of the trial norvin and bernie sat together when the opening attorneys for the prosecution had finished dreux exclaimed triumphantly weve got em they cant escape after that but when the defense in turn had closed the little man revealed an indignant face to his companion saying lord theyre as good as free well never convict on evidence like that once more he changed under the spell of the masterly states attorney and declared with fierce exultance what did i tell you theyll hang every mothers son of em the jury wont be out an hour the jury was out more than an hour even though press and public declared the case to be clear yet knowing that the eyes of the world were upon her new orleans went to sleep that night serene in the certainty that she had vindicated herself had upheld her laws and proved her ability to deal with that organized lawlessness which had so long been a blot upon her fair name soon after court convened on the following morning the jury sent word that they had reached a verdict and the courtroom quickly filled rumors of caesar maruffis double identity had gone forth it was hinted that he was none other than the dreaded belisario cardi that genius of a thousand crimes who had held all sicily in fear this report supplied the last touch of dramatic interest blake and bernie were in their places before the prisoners arrived every face in the room was tense and expectant even the calloused attendants felt the hush and lowered their voices in deference every eye was strained toward the door behind which the jury was concealed there came the rumble of the prison van below the tramp of feet upon the hollow stairs and into the dingy highceilinged hall of justice filed the accused manacled and doubly guarded maruffi led his black head held high normando brought up the rear supported by two officers he was racked with terror his body hung like a sack a moisture of foam and spittle lay upon his lips when he reached the railing of the prisoners box he clutched it and resisted loosely sobbing in his throat but he was thrust forward into a seat where he collapsed the judge and the attorneys were in their places when a deputy sheriff swung open the door to the juryroom and the twelve good men and true appeared as if through the silence of a tomb they went to their stations while eleven pairs of black sicilian eyes searched their downcast features for a sign larubio the cobbler was paperwhite above his smoky beard di marcos swarthy face was green like that of a corpse his companions were frozen in various attitudes of eager dreadful waiting the only sound through the scuff and tramp of the jurors feet was normandos lunatic murmuring as for the leader of the band he sat as if graven in stone but despite his iron control a pallor had crept up beneath his skin blake heard bernie whisper look they know theyre lost gentlemen of the jury have you agreed upon a verdict came the voice of the judge the foreman rose we have he passed a document up to the bench and silently the court examined it the seconds were now creeping minutes normandos ceaseless mumbling was like that of a man distraught by torture a hand was used to silence him the spectators were upon their feet and bent forward in attention the cordon of officers closed in behind the accused as if to throttle any act of desperation the judge passed the verdict down to the minute clerk who read in a clear distinct monotonous tone celso fabbri frank normando mistrial salvatore di marco frank garcia giordano bolla the list of names seemed interminable gaspardo cressi lorenzo cardoni caesar maruffi he paused for an instant while time halted not guilty after the first moment of stunned stupefaction a murmur of angry disapproval ran through the crowd it was not loud but hushed as if men doubted their senses and were seeking corroboration of their ears from the street below as the judgment was flashed to the waiting hundreds came an echo faint unformed like the first vague stir that runs ahead of a tempest the shock of norvin blakes amazement in part blurred his memory of that dramatic tableau but certain details stood out clearly afterwards for one thing he heard bernie dreux giggling like an overwrought woman while through his hysteria ran a stream of shocking curses he saw one of the jurors rise yawn and stretch himself then rub his bullet head smiling meanwhile at the cressi boy he saw caesar maruffi turn full to the room behind him and search for his own face when their eyes met a light of devilish amusement lit the sicilians visage his lips parted and his white teeth gleamed but it was no smile rather the nervous rippling twitch that bares a wolfs fangs his color had come flooding back too victory suffused him with a ruddy purple congestion almost apoplectic then heads came between them friends of the prisoners crowded forward with noisy congratulations and outstretched palms the rival attorneys were shaking hands blake found himself borne along by the eddying stream which set out of the courtroom and down into the sunlit street where the curbs were lined with uplifted faces dreux was close beside him quite silent now a similar silence brooded over the whole procession which emerged from the building like a funeral cortege when the moments brought home the truth to its members they felt indeed as if they came from a house of death for they had seen justice murdered and the chill was in their hearts but there was something sinister in the hush which gagged that multitude many readers will doubtless recall even now the shock that went through this country at the conclusion of the famous new orleans mafia trial of twenty years ago they will perhaps remember a general feeling of surprise that an american jury would dare in the face of such popular feeling and such apparently overwhelming evidence to render a verdict of not guilty in some quarters the farcical outcome of the trial was blamed upon louisianas peculiar legal code but the truth is our northern cities had not at that time felt the power of organized crime new york for instance had not been shaken by an interminable succession of dynamite outrages nor terrorized by bands of latinborn apaches who live by violence and blackmail therefore the tremendous difficulty of securing convictions was not appreciated as it is today there was a universal suspicion that the last word concerning the new orleans affair had not been written so what followed was not entirely a surprise xxiv at the feet of the statue two hours after the verdict there was a meeting of the committee of justice and that night the evening papers carried the following notice massmeeting all good citizens are invited to attend a massmeeting tomorrow morning at oclock at clay statue to take steps to remedy the failure of justice in the donnelly case come prepared for action it was signed by the fifty wellknown men who had been appointed to represent the people that incredible verdict had caused a great excitement but this bold and threatening appeal brought the city up standing it caused men who had been loudly cursing the jury to halt and measure the true depth of their indignation there was no other topic of conversation that night and when the same call appeared in the morning papers together with a ringing column headed awake arise it stirred a swift and mighty public sentiment never perhaps in any public press had so sanguinary an appeal been issued citizens of new orleans it read in part when murder overrides law and justice when juries are bribed and suborners go unwhipped it is time to resort to your own indefeasible right of selfpreservation alien bands of oathbound assassins have set the blot of a martyrs blood upon your civilization your laws in the very temple of justice have been bought suborners have loosed upon your streets the midnight murderers of an officer in whose grave lies the majesty of american law rise in your might people of new orleans rise a similar note was struck by editorials many of them couched in language even stronger and more suited to fan the public rage the recent trial was called an outrageous travesty on justice attention was directed to the damnable vagaries of recent juries which had been impaneled to try redhanded italian murderers our city is become the haven of blackmailers and assassins the safe vantageground for sicilian stilletto bands who slay our legal officers who buy jurors and corrupt sworn witnesses under the hooded eyes of justice how much longer will this outrage be permitted so read a heavily typed article in the leading journal a wave of fierce determination ran through the whole community margherita ginini was waiting at blakes place of business when he arrived after a night of sleepless worry she too showed evidence of a painful vigil her hand was shaking as she held out a copy of the morning paper inquiring what is the meaning of this it means were no longer in sicily he said you intend to kill those men i fear something like that may occur the question will be put up to the people plainly she clutched the edge of his desk staring at him with wide tragic eyes your name heads the list did you do this i am the chairman of that committee i did my part but the law declares them innocent she gasped all but two and they can be tried over again the law he smiled bitterly do you believe that i believe they are guilty who can doubt it but this lawlessness this mad cry for revenge it is against all my beliefs my religion oh my friend cant you stop it at least take no part in it for my sake his look was hard yet regretful for your sake i would give my life gladly he said but there are times when one must act his destined part that verdict holds me up to the public as a perjurer but that is a small matter oh i have had my scruples i have questioned my conscience and deep in my heart i see that there is only one way id be a hypocrite if i denied it im wrong perhaps but i cant be untrue to myself we know but a part of the truth she urged desperately god alone knows it all you saw three men there are others whom you did not see they were seen by other eyes quite as trustworthy as mine she wrung her hands miserably crying but wait guilty or innocent they have appeared in judgment and the law has acquitted them you urge upon the people now a crime greater than theirs two wrongs do not make a right who are you to raise yourself above that power which is supreme theres a law higher than the courts yes one the law of god if our means have failed leave their punishment to him he shook his head no trace of yielding in his eyes one man was killed and yet you contemplate the death of eleven listen he cried this cause belongs to the people who have seen their sacred institutions debauched if i had the power to sway the citizens of new orleans from the course which i believe they contemplate i doubt that i could bring myself to exercise it for it is plain that the mafia must be exterminated the good of the city the safety of all of us demands it he regarded her curiously do you realize what maruffis freedom would mean to you and oliveta we are in gods hands it would require a miracle to save you caesar would have my life too he told me as much with his eyes when that corrupted jury lifted the fear of death from his heart so cried the girl you fear him therefore you take this means of destroying him you goad the public and your friends into a red rage and send them to murder your enemy her hysteria was not proof against the look which leaped into his eyes the pallor that left him facing her with the visage of a sick man during the last five years he said slowly ive often tried to be a man but never until last night have i succeeded fully when i signed that call to arms i felt that i was writing maruffis deathwarrant i hesitated for a time then i put aside all thoughts of myself and now im prepared to meet this accusation i knew it would come the world my world knows that maruffis life or mine hinges on his liberty if he dies by the mob today that world will call me coward for my act it will say that i roused the passions of the populace to save myself nevertheless i was chosen leader of that committee and i did their will as i shall do the will of the people the will of the people you know very well that the people have no will they do what their leaders tell them my name is written i am sorry that i cannot do as you wish but surely you do not deceive yourself she insisted this is wrong oh so inconceivably so terribly wrong you do not possess the divine power to bestow life how then can you dare to take it by what possible authority do you decree the destruction of your fellowmen whom the law has adjudged innocent by the sovereign authority of the public good by the inherited right of selfprotection you would shoot them down like caged animals those eleven individuals have ceased to exist as men they represent an infection a diseased spot which must be cut out they stand for disorder and violence to free them would be a crime to give them arms to defend themselves would be merely to increase their evil there is a child among them too would you have his death upon your conscience i told gino he should come to no harm and god willing he shant how can you hope to stem the rage of a thousand madmen a mob will stop at no half measures there are two men among the prisoners who are entitled to another trial do you think the people will spare them if they take the others he shrugged his shoulders doubtfully and she shuddered you shall not have the death of those defenseless men upon your soul she cried your hands at least shall remain clean please dont urge me he said but i do i ask you to take no part in this barbarous uprising and i must refuse you she looked at him wildly her face was ashen as she continued you have said that you love me cant you make this sacrifice for me cant you make this concession to my fears my conscience my beliefs i am only a woman and i cannot face this grim and awful thing i cannot think of your part in it the look she gave him went to his heart margherita he cried in torture dont you see i have no choice i couldnt yield even if the price were you and your love you wouldnt rob me of my manhood i could never touch hands which were stained with the blood of defenseless men not even in friendship you understand i understand for a second time the color left his face her glance wavered again she swayed then groped for the door while he stood like stone in his tracks goodby he said lifelessly goodby she answered in the same tone i have done my part you are a man and you must do yours as you see it but may god save you from bloodshed long before the hour set for the gathering at clay statue the streets in that vicinity began to fill men continued on past their places of business shops and offices remained closed the wide strip of neutral ground which divided the two sides of the citys leading thoroughfare began to pack around the base of the monument groups of citizens congregated until the cars were forced to slow down and proceed with a clangor of gongs which served only as a tocsin to draw more recruits vehicles came to a halt were wedged dose to the curbs and became coigns of vantage office windows storefronts balconies and rooftops began to cluster with a human freight after a week of wind and rain the sun had risen in a sky that was cloudless save for a few thin streaks of shining silver which resembled long polished rapiers or the gleaming spearpoints of a host still hidden below the horizon the fragrance of shrubs and flowers long dormant weighted the breeze it was a glorious morning fit for love and laughter and little children nor did the rapidly swelling assemblage resemble in any measure a mob bent upon violence it was composed mainly of lawabiding business men who greeted each other genially in their grave intelligent faces was no hint of savagery or brutality all traffic finally ceased the entire neighborhood was massed and clotted with waiting humanity then as the hour struck a running salvo of applause came from the galleries and a cheer from the street when a handful of men was seen crowding its way up to the base of the statue it was composed of a halfdozen prominent men who had been identified with the committee of justice among them was norvin blake a hush followed as one of them mounted the pedestal and began to speak he was recognized as judge blackmar a wealthy lawyer and his welltrained voice filled the wide spaces from wall to wall it went out over the sea of heads and up to the crowded rooftops he told of the reasons which had inspired this indignation meeting he recounted the history of the mafia in new orleans and recalled its many outrages culminating in the assassination of chief donnelly affairs have reached such a crisis said he that we who live in an organized and civilized community find our laws ineffective and are forced to protect ourselves as best we may when courts fail the people must act what protection is left us when our highest police official is slain in our very midst by the mafia and his assassins turned loose upon us this is not the first case of wilful murder and supine justice our court records are full of similar ones the time has come to say whether we shall tolerate these outrages further or whether we shall set aside the verdict of an infamous and perjured jury and cleanse our city of the ghouls which prey upon it i ask you to consider this question fairly you have been assembled not behind closed doors nor under the cloak of darkness but in the heart of the city in the broad light of day to take such action as honest men must take to save their homes against a public enemy what is your answer a roar broke from all sides an incoherent wordless growling rumbled down the street those on the outskirts of the assemblage who had come merely from curiosity or in doubt that anything would be accomplished began to press closer a restless murmur broken by the cries of excitable men arose when the second speaker took his place then as he spoke the temper of the people began to manifest itself undeniably the crowd swayed and cheered certain demands were voiced insistently a wave of intense excitement swept it as it heard its desires so boldly proclaimed as the heaving sea is lashed to fury by the wind the peoples rage mounted higher with every sentence of the orator every pause was greeted with howls men stared into the faces around them and seeing their own emotions mirrored they were swept by an everincreasing agitation there was a general impulse to advance at once upon the parish prison and knots of stragglers were already making in that direction while down from the telegraphpoles from roofs and shedtops men were descending all that seemed lacking for a concerted movement was a leader a bold figure a ringing voice to set this army in motion blake had been selected to make the third address and to put the issue squarely up to the people but as he wedged his way forward to enact his role up to the feet of the statue squirmed and wriggled a figure which assumed the place just vacated by the second speaker it was bernie dreux but a different bernie from the man his amazed friends in the crowd thought they knew he was pale and his limbs shook under him but his eyes blazed with a fire which brought a hush of attention to all within sight of him up there against the heroic figure of henry clay he looked more diminutive more insignificant than ever but oddly enough he had attained a sudden dignity which made him seem intensely masterful and alive for a moment he paused erect and motionless surveying that restless multitude which rocked and rumbled for the distance of a full city square in both directions then he began his voice though highpitched from emotion was as clear and ringing as a trumpet it pierced to the farthest limits of the giant audience and stirred it like a battle signal the blood of his forefathers had awakened at last and old general dreux the man of iron and fire and passion was speaking through his son people of new orleans he cried i desire neither fame nor name nor glory i am here not as one of the committee of public safety but as a plain citizen let me therefore speak for you let mine be the lips which give your answer fifty of our trusted townsmen were appointed to assist in bringing the murderers of chief donnelly to justice they told us to wait upon the law we waited and the law failed our court and our jury were debauched our committee comes back to us now the source from which it took its power and acknowledges that it can do no more it lays the matter in our hands and asks for our decision let me deliver the message justice must be done dan donnelly must be avenged today the clamor which had greeted the words of the previous speakers was as nothing to the titanic bellow which burst forth acclaiming dreuxs this is the hour for action not for talk he continued when he had stilled them the anglosaxon is slow to anger and because of that the mafia has thrived among us but once he is aroused once his rights are invaded and his laws assailed his rage is a thing to reckon with our committee asks us if we are ready to take justice into our own hands and i answer yes a chaos of waving arms and of highflung hats a deafening crash of voices again answered then our speakers shall lead us judge blackmar shall be the first in command mr slade who spoke after him shall be second and i shall be the third in authority arm yourselves quickly gentlemen and may god have mercy upon the souls of those eleven murderers he leaped lightly down and the great assemblage burst into motion streaming out canal street like a storming army it boiled into side streets and through every avenue which led in the direction of the prison at each corner it gathered strength every thoroughfare belched forth reinforcements hundreds who had entertained no faintest notion of taking part fell in were swallowed up in the seething tide and went shouting to the very gates of the jail once that tossing river of humanity had been given force and direction its character changed it became a mailed dragon it suddenly blossomed with steel peaceful middleaged men who had stood beside the monument buttoned up in peculiarly bulky overcoats were now marching silently with weapons at their shoulders strangest of all perhaps was the greeting this army received on every side the flotsam and jetsam which swirled along in its eddies or followed in its wake cheered howled and danced deliriously men women and children from doorways and galleries raised their voices lustily and applauded as if at some favorite carnival parade in notable contrast was the bearing of the armed men themselves they marched through the echoing streets like a regiment of mutes xxv the appeal on the iron balcony of a house in the vicinity of the parish prison the two sicilian girls were standing across from them loomed the great decaying structure with its little ironbarred windows and its steelribbed doors behind which lay their countrymen from inside came the echo of a great hammering as if a gallows were being erected but the square and the streets outside were quiet what time is it now oliveta had repeated this question already a dozen times it is after ten i hear nothing as yet do you nothing we could hear if it were not for that dreadful pounding yonder in the jail hush they are building barricades the peasant girl gasped and seized the iron railing in front of her madonna mia i am dying do you think signore blake will yield to your appeal and turn the mob im afraid not said vittoria faintly he can do more than any other for he is powerful they will listen to him if caesar should escape i am shamed through and through to have loved such a man and yet to have him killed like a rat in a hole i pray and i know not what i pray for my thoughts are whirling so do you hear anything from the city no no there was a moments pause those barricades will not allow them to enter even if our friend does not persuade them to disperse i have heard there is sometimes shooting vittoria shuddered it is terrible for men to become brutes the time is growing late oliveta quavered there was another period of silence while they strained their ears for the faintest sound but the fresh breeze wafted nothing to them on a neighboring gallery two housewives were gossiping a child was playing on the walk beneath and his piping laughter sounded strangely incongruous from across the way rose that desultory pounding as spikes were driven home and beams were nailed in place through a grated aperture in the prison wall an armed man peered down the street caesar is cunning oliveta broke out he is not one to be easily caught he is brave too ah god how i loved him and how i have hated him ever since maruffis capture she had remained in a frame of mind scarcely rational fluctuating between a silent sullen mood of revenge and a sense of horror at her betrayal of the man who had once possessed her whole heart it cant be that you still care for him no i loathe him and if he escapes he would surely kill me yet sometimes i wish it she began mumbling to herself look she cried suddenly what is this a public hack came swinging into view its horses at a gallop it drew up before the main gate of the prison a man leaped forth and began pounding for admittance some one spoke to him through a grating what does he say queried the peasant girl i cannot hear perhaps he comes to say there is no mother of god listen from somewhere toward the heart of the city came a faint murmur it is the rumble of a wagon on the next street gasped oliveta the sound died away the girls stood frozen at attention with their senses strained then it rose again louder soon there was no mistaking it a whisper came upon the breeze it mounted into a longdrawn humming which in turn grew to a steady drone of voices broken by waves of cheering it gathered volume rapidly and straggling figures came running into view followed by knots and groups of fleetfooted youths the driver of the carriage rose on his box looked over his shoulder then whipped his horses into a gallop and fled as he did so a slowly moving wagon laden with timbers turned in from a side street it was driven by a somnolent negro who finally halted his team and stared in dull lack of comprehension at what he saw approaching by now the street beneath the girls was half filled with people it echoed to a babble of voices to the shuffle and tread of a coming multitude and an instant later out of every thoroughfare which fronted upon the grim old prison structure streamed the people of new orleans see they are unarmed olivetas fingers sank into her sisters wrist then through the press came a body of silent men four abreast and shoulder to shoulder the crowd opened to let them through cheering frenziedly they wore an air of sober responsibility they carried guns and looked to neither right nor left directly beneath the waiting women they passed and at their head marched norvin blake and bernie dreux together with two men unknown to the girls vittoria leaned forward horrorstricken and although she tried to call she did not hear her voice above the confusion oliveta clutched her murmuring distractedly the avenues were jammed from curb to curb telegraphpoles lampposts trees held a burden of human forms windows and housetops were filling in every direction a continuous roar beat thunderously against the prison walls the army of vigilantes drew up before the main gate and a man smote it with the butt of his shotgun demanding entrance the crowd anticipating a volley from within surged back leaving them isolated a dozen bluecoats struggled to clear the sidewalks next the structure but they might as well have tried to stem a rising tide with their naked hands they were buffeted briefly then swallowed up in answer to a command the armed men scattered surrounding the building with a cordon of steel then the main body renewed its assault but the oaken barrier stoutly reinforced withstood them gallantly and a brief colloquy occurred after which they made their way to a small side door which directly faced the two women across the street this was not so heavily constructed as the front gate and promised an easier entrance but it was likewise locked and barred then some one spied the wagon and its load of timbers now hopelessly wedged into the press and a rush was made toward it a beam was raised upon willing shoulders and with this as a batteringram a breach was begun every crash was the signal for a shout from the multitude and when the door finally gave way a triumphant roar arose the armed men swarmed into the opening and disappeared one by one all but two who stood with backs to the door and faced the crowd warningly it was evident that some sort of order prevailed among them and that this was more than an unorganized assault through the closepacked ranks on and on around the massive pile ran the word that the vigilantes were within it was telegraphed from housetop to housetop then a silence descended the more sinister and ominous because of the pandemonium which had preceded it thus far vittoria and her companion had seen and heard all that occurred for their position commanded a view of both fronts of the building but now they had only their ears to guide them come let us leave now we have seen enough vittoria cried and strove to drag oliveta from her post but the girl would not yield she did not seem to hear her eyes were fixed with strained and fascinated horror upon that shattered aperture which showed like a gaping wound her bloodless lips were whispering her fingers where they gripped the iron railing were like claws quickly quickly moaned vittoria we did not come to see this monstrous thing oliveta spare yourself in the silence her voice sounded so loudly and shrilly that people on the adjoining balcony turned curious uncomprehending faces toward her moment after moment that hush continued then from within came a renewed hammering hollow measured above it sounded the faint cries of terrified prisoners this died away after a time and some one said theyre into the corridors at last it wont be long now a moment later a dull unmistakable reverberation rolled forth like the smothered sound of a subterranean explosion it was followed by another and another gunshots fired within brick walls and flagpaved courtyards it shattered that sickening unending suspense which caused the pulse to flutter and the breath to lag the crowd gave tongue in a howl of hoarse delight then followed a peculiar shrilling chorus that familiar signal known as the dago whistle which was like the piercing cry of lost souls who killa da chief screamed the hoodlums then puckered their lips and piped again that mocking signal as the booming of the guns continued now singly now in volley the maddened populace squeezed toward that narrow entrance through which the avengers had disappeared but they were halted by the guards and forced to content themselves by greeting every shot with an exultant cry the streets in all directions were tossing and billowing like the waves of the sea men capered and flung their arms aloft shrieking women and children waved their aprons and kerchiefs sobbing and spent with excitement it was a wild and grotesque scene unspeakably terrible inhumanly ferocious through it the two sicilian girls clung to each other fainting revolted fascinated when they could summon strength they descended to the street and fought their way out of the bedlam norvin blake was not a willing participant in the lynching although he had gone to the meeting at clay statue determined to do what he considered his duty he had felt no doubt as to the outcome of the massmeeting even before he saw its giant proportions and even before it had sounded its approval of the first speakers words for he knew how deeply his townspeople were stirred by the astounding miscarriage of justice at the rally of the committee on the afternoon previous it had been urged to proceed with the execution at once and the counsel of the more conservative had barely prevailed blake knew perhaps better than his companions to what lengths the rage of a mob will go and he confessed to a secret fear of the result therefore although he marched in the vanguard of the storming party it was more to exercise a restraining influence and to prevent violence against unoffending foreigners than to take part in the demonstration as for the actual shedding of blood his instinct revolted from it while his reason recognized its necessity and defended it bernie dreuxs amazing assumption of dictatorship had relieved him of the duty of heading the mob a thing for which he was profoundly grateful when the main body of vigilantes had armed itself he fell in beside his friend with some notion of helping and protecting him but the little man proved amply equal to the occasion he was unwaveringly grim and determined it was he who faced the oaken gate and demanded entrance in the name of the people it was he who suggested the use of the batteringram and it was he who first fought his way through the breach at the risk of bullets from within blake followed to find him with his fowlingpiece at the head of the prison captain and demanding the keys to the cells the posse had gained a partial entrance but another ironribbed door withheld them from the body of the prison and there followed a delay while this was broken down meanwhile from within came the sound of turning locks and of clanging steel doors also a shuffling of many feet and cries of mortal terror which told that the prisoners had been freed to shift for themselves in this extremity in truth a scene was being enacted within more terrible than that outside for as the deputies released the prisoners commanding them to save themselves if they could a frightful confusion ensued not only did the eleven sicilians cry to god but the other inmates of the place who feared their crimes had overtaken them joined in the appeal men and women negroes and whites felons and minor evildoers rushed to and fro along the galleries and passageways fighting with one another tearing one another from places of refuge seeking new and securer points of safety they huddled in dark corners they crept under beds beneath stairways and into barrels they burrowed into rubbish piles only to be dragged out by the hair or the heels and to see their jealous companions seize upon these sanctuaries terror is swiftly contagious the whole place became a seething pit of dismay some knelt and prayed while others trampled upon them they rose from their knees to beat with bleeding fists upon barred doors and blind partitions but as their fear of death increased and the chorus of their despair mounted higher there came another pounding nearer louder the sound of splitting wood and of rending metal to escape was impossible to remain was madness of hidingplaces there was a fearful scarcity the regulators came rushing into the prison proper with footsteps echoing loudly through the barren corridors out into the open court they swarmed then up the iron stairways to the galleries that ringed it about peering into cells as they went ousting the wretched inmates from remotest corners but the chamber in which they knew their quarry had been housed was empty so they paused undecided while from all sides came the smothered sounds of terror like the mewling and squeaking of mice hidden in a wall suddenly some one shouted there they are and pointed to the topmost gallery which ran in front of the condemned cells a rush began but at the top of the winding stairs another grating barred the way through this however could be seen salvatore di marco giordano bolla and the elder cressi the three sicilians had fled to this last stronghold slammed the steel door behind them and now crouched in the shelter of a brick column some one hammered at the lock and the terrified prisoners started to their feet with an agonized appeal for mercy as they exposed themselves to view a man fired through the bars his aim was true di marco flung his arms aloft and pitched forward on his face crazed by this his two companions rushed madly back and forth but they were securely penned in and appeal was futile another shot boomed deafeningly in the close confines of the place and cressi plunged to his death then bolla followed his bloody hands gripping the bars his face upturned in a hideous grimace and his eyes which stared through at his slayers glazing slowly down the ringing stairs marched the grimfeatured men who had set themselves this task and among them bernie dreux strode issuing orders the weapon in his hand was hot his shoulder was bruised for he had long been unaccustomed to the use of firearms then began a systematic search of the mens department of the prison but no new victims were discovered only the ordinary prisoners who were wellnigh speechless with fright where are the others went up the cry and some one answered on the womens side the band passed through to the adjoining portion of the double building and keys having been secured the rapidity of their search increased into the twin courtyard they filed then while some investigated the cookhouse others climbed to the topmost tier of cells as the quest narrowed six of the sicilians who had lain concealed in a compartment on the first floor broke out in a desperate endeavor to escape but they were caught between the opposing ranks as in the jaws of a trap the cell door clanged to behind them they found themselves at bay in the open yard resistance was useless they sank to their knees and set up a cry for mercy they shrieked they sobbed they groveled but their enemies were open to no appeal untouched by any sense of compunction they were men wholly dominated by a single fixed idea as merciless as machines there followed a nightmare scene a horrid bellowing uproar of voices and detonations of groans and prayers and curses the armed men emptied their weapons blindly into that writhing tangle of forms and as one finished he stepped back while another took his place the prison rocked with the din of it the wretches were shot to pieces riddled by that horizontal hail which mowed and mangled like an invisible scythe now a figure struggled to its feet only to become the target for a fusillade again one twisted in his agony only to be filled with missiles fired from so short a range that his garments were torn to rags the pavement became wet and slippery in one brief moment that section of the yard became a shambles then men went up and poked among the bodies with the hot muzzles of their rifles turning the corpses over for identification and as each stark face was recognized a name went echoing out through the dingy corridors to the mob beyond larubio the cobbler had attempted a daring ruse the firing had ceased when up out of that limp and sodden heap he rose his gray hair matted his garments streaming they thrust their rifles against his chest and killed him quickly nine men had died by now and only two remained normando and maruffi the former was found shortly where he had squeezed himself into a dogkennel which stood under the stairs but the vigilantes it seemed had had enough of slaughter so he was rushed into the street where the crowd tore him to pieces as wolves rend a rabbit even his garments were ripped to rags and distributed as ghastly souvenirs norvin blake had been a witness to only a part of this brutality but what he had seen had sickened him and had increased his determination to find gino cressi he shared not at all in the sanguinary exaltation which possessed his fellowtownsmen instead he longed for the end and hoped he would be able to forget what he had seen he would have fled but for his fear of what might happen to the cressi boy corridor after corridor he searched peering into cells under cots into corners and crannies while through the cavernous old building the other hunters stormed he was hard pressed to keep ahead of them and when he finally found the lad they were dose at his heels they came upon him with the lad clinging to his knees and a shout went up heres the cressi kid he gave the signal let him have it but norvin turned upon them saying you cant kill this boy step aside blake ordered a redfaced man raising and cocking his weapon norvin seized the riflebarrel and turned it aside roughly the two stared at each other with angry eyes hes only a baby dont you understand good god you have children of your own i i the fellow hesitated so he is damnation what has come over me he lowered his gun and turned against the others who were clamoring behind him this is awful he murmured shakingly when the crowd had passed on ive done all i intend to he flung his rifle from him with a gesture of repugnance and went out of the cell norvin continued to stand guard over his charge while the search for maruffi went on for he dared not trust these men who had gone mad thus he did not learn that his arch enemy had been taken until he saw him rushed past in the hands of his captors caesar had fought as best he could against overwhelming odds and continued to resist now in a blind fury but a rope was about his neck at the end of which were a dozen running men a dozen gunbutts hustled him on his way to the open air blake closed the cell door upon gino cressi and followed drawn by a magnetic force he could not resist the main gate of the prison opened before the rush of that tangled growling handful of men and they swept straight out into the turmoil that filled the streets an instant later maruffi was beset by five thousand maniacs he was kicked he was beaten he was spat upon he was overwhelmed by an avalanche of humanity his progress to the gallows was a short but a terrible one marked by a series of violent whirlpools which set through that river of people the uproar was deafening spectators screamed hoarsely but did not hear their voices from where blake paused beside the gate he traced the sicilians progress plainly marveling at the fellows vitality for it seemed impossible that any human being could withstand that onslaught a coil of rope sailed upward a negro perched in a tree passed it over a limb and the next instant the head and shoulders of the capomafia rose above the dense level of standing forms he was writhing horribly but seizing the rope with his hands he drew himself upward his blackened face glared down upon his executioners the grinning negro kicked at the dark head beneath him once twice three times so violently that he lost his balance and fell whereupon a bellowing shout of laughter arose more terrible than any sound heretofore still the sicilian clung to the rope which was strangling him then puffs of smoke curled up in the sunshine and the crowd rolled back upon itself leaving the gibbet ringed with armed men maruffis body was swayed and spun as if by invisible hands his fingers slipped he settled downward blake turned and hid his face against the cold damp walls for he was very sick xxvi at the dusk within two days the city had regained its customary calm it had in fact settled down to a more placid mood than at any time since the murder of chief donnelly immediately after the lynching the citizens had dispersed to their homes no prisoners except the mafiosi had been harmed and of those who had been sought not one had escaped the damage to the parish prison did not amount to fifty dollars through the community spread a feeling of satisfaction which horror at the terrible details of the slaughter could not destroy there was nowhere the slightest effort at dodging responsibility those who had led in the assault were the bestknown citizens and openly acknowledged their parts it was realized now even more fully than before the event that the course pursued had been the only one compatible with public safety and while every one deplored the necessity of lynchings in general there was no regret at this one shocking as it had been this state of mind was reflected by the local press and for that matter by the press of all the southern cities where the gravity of the situation had become known while to lend it further countenance the cotton exchange the board of trade and the chamber of commerce promptly passed resolutions commending the action of the vigilance committee there was some talk of legal proceedings but no one took it seriously except the police who felt obliged to excuse their dereliction of course the stir was national international indeed since italy demanded particulars but serene in the sense of an unpleasant duty thoroughly performed new orleans did not trouble to explain except by a bare recital of facts in spite of the passive part he had played blake was perhaps more deeply affected by the doings at the prison than any other member of the party and during the interval that followed he did not trust himself to see vittoria there was a double reason for this for he not only recalled their last interview with consternation but he still had a guilty feeling about myra nell on the second afternoon after the lynching bernie dreux dropped in to tell him of his sisters return from mobile she read that i took a hand in the fuss bernie explained but of course she has no idea i did so much actual shooting when she told me she was going to see you this afternoon i came to warn you not to expose me do you regret your part not the least bit im merely surprised at myself you surprised all your friends blake said with a smile you seem to have changed lately in truth the difference in dreuxs bearing was noteworthy and many had remarked upon it the dignity and force which had enveloped the little beau for the first time when he stood before the assembled thousands still clung to him his eyes were steady and bright and purposeful he had lost his wavering deprecatory manner yes ive just come of age he declared with some satisfaction i realize that im free white and twentyone for the first time im going to quit idling and do something what for instance well im going to marry felicite to begin with then maybe some of my friends will give me a job i will said blake thanks but id rather impose on somebody else at the start i want to make good on my own merits understand ive lived off my relatives long enough its just as bad to let the deceased members of your family support you as to allow the live ones bernie blake interrupted gravely im afraid i wont marry myra nell you think she wont have you eh she has been acting queerly of late but leave it to me norvin was spared the necessity of further explanation by the arrival of the girl herself miss warren seemed strangely lacking in her usual abundance of animal spirits she was obviously ill at ease and the sight of her brother did not lessen her embarrassment during the brief interchange of pleasantries her eyes were fixed upon blake with a troubled gaze we i just ran in for a moment she said and seemed upon the point of leaving after inquiring solicitously about his health my dear said bernie with elaborate unction norvin and i have just been discussing your engagement miss warren gasped and turned pale blake stammered with a desperate effort the girl inquired d do you love me norvin of course i do see bernie nodded his satisfaction oh lordy said myra nell i cant marry you dear what blake knew that his expression was changing and tried to stifle his relief as for bernie he flushed angrily and his voice rang with his newly born determination dont be silly didnt he just say he loved you and for heavens sake dont look so scared we wont devour you i cant marry him declared the girl once more why bebecause im already married there jimmy ive been trying to get that out for a month dreux gasped myra nell youre crazy she nodded then turned to blake with a look of entreaty pplease dont kill yourself dear i couldnt help it why you poor frightened little thing im delighted i am indeed he told her reassuringly dont you care arent you going to storm and and raise the dickens she queried maybe this is your way of hiding your despair not at all im glad so long as youre happy and youre not mad with anguish nor crushed with why the idea im perfectly furious i ran away because i was afraid of you and i havent seen my husband once not once do you understand since we were married oh you brute by this time dreux had recovered his power of speech and yelled in furious voice who is the reptile there came a timid rap the office door opened and lecompte rilleau inserted his head saying gently me i im it blake rose so suddenly that his chair upset whereupon rilleau who saw in this abrupt movement a threat propelled himself fully into view crying with determination here dont you touch her shes mine you take it out of me blakes answering laugh seemed so out of character that the bridegroom took it as merely a new phase of insanity and edged in front of his wife protectingly i wanted to come in at first and break the news but she wouldnt let me he explained you have a weak heart you you mustnt fight implored myra nell but lecompte only shrugged illustration pplease dont kill yourself dear i couldnt help it thats all a bluff then to norvin ill admit it was a mean trick and i guess my heart really might have petered out if shed married you but im all right now and you can have satisfaction i dont know whether to be angry or amused at you children norvin told them understand once for all that our engagement wasnt serious there have been a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings thats all now tell us how and when this all happened yyes echoed bernie who was still dazed myra nell seemed more chagrined than relieved it was perfectly simple she informed them it happened during the carnival i never heard a man talk the way he did and i was really worried about his heart i said no for fifteen minutes then we arranged to be married secretly when it was all over i was frightened and ran away youre such a deep desperate unforgiving person norvin i i think it was positively horrid of you good lord breathed her brother what a perverted sense of responsibility are we forgiven its all right with me if it is with norvin said bernie somewhat doubtfully forgiven blake took the youthful pair by the hands and in his eyes was a brightness they had never seen of course you are and let me tell you that you havent cornered all the love in the world ive never cared but for one woman perhaps you will wish me as much happiness as i wish you both then you have found your italian girl queried myra nell with flashing eagerness vittoria vittoria miss warren shrieked vittoria a countess so shes the one who spoiled everything gee youll be a count said rilleau there followed a period of laughing incoherent explanations and then the beaming bridegroom tugged at myra nells sleeve saying now that its all over im mighty tired of being a widower she flung her arms about his neck and lifted her blushing face to his explaining to her halfbrother when she could i dont know what youll do without some one to look after you bernie but its perfectly grand to elope dreux rose with a grin and winked at norvin as he said oh dont mind me ill get along all right and seizing his hat he rushed out with his thin face all ablaze when blake was finally alone he closed his desk and with bounding heart set out for the foreign quarter his day had dawned he could hardly contain himself but as he neared his goal strange doubts and indecisions arose in his mind and when he had reached olivetas house he passed on lacking courage to enter he decided it was too soon after the tragedy at the parish prison to press his suit that to intrude himself now would be in offensively bad taste then too he began to reason that if margherita had wished to see him she would have sent for him all in all the hour was decidedly unpropitious he dared not risk his future happiness upon a blundering illtimed declaration therefore he walked onward but no sooner had he passed the house than a thousand voices urged him to return in this the hour of the girls loneliness and lay his devotion at her feet torn thus by hesitation and by the sense of his unworthiness he walked the streets hour after hour at one moment he approached the house desperately determined the next he fled mastered by the fear of dismissal so he continued his miserable wanderings on into the dusk twilight was settling when margherita ginini finished her packing the big livingroom was stripped of its furnishings trunks and cases stood about in a desolate confusion there was no look of home or comfort remaining anywhere and the whole house echoed dismally to her footsteps from the rear came the sound of olivetas listless preparations pausing at an open window margherita looked down upon the street which she had grown to love the suggestion of darkness had softened it mellowed it with a twilight beauty like the face of an old friend seen in the glow of lamplight the shouting of urchins at play floated upward stirring the chords of motherhood in her breast and emphasizing her loneliness with oliveta gone what would be left nothing but an austere life compressed within drab walls nothing but sickness and suffering on every side she had begun to think a great deal about those walls of late and the bells of a convent pealed out softly in the distance bringing a tightness to her throat in spite of herself she shuddered those laughing childrens voices mocked at her empty life they seemed always to jeer at that hungry motherlove but never quite so loudly as now she remembered surprising norvin blake at play with these very children one day and the halfabashed halfdefiant light in his eyes when he discovered her watching him thinking of him she recalled just such another twilight hour as this when in a whirl of shamed emotion she had been compelled to face the fact of her love a sudden trembling weakness seized her at the memory and she saw again those cold gray walls which never echoed to the gleeful crowing of babes or the thrilling merriment of little voices in that brief hour of her awakening life had opened gloriously bewilderingly only to close again leaving her soul bruised and sore with rebellion she crossed the floor listlessly in answer to a knock for the repeated attentions of her neighbors although sincere and touching were intrusive then she fell back at sight of the man who entered the magic of this evening hour had brought him to her in spite of all his fears but his heart was in his throat and he could hardly manage a greeting as he passed the threshold of the disordered room he looked round him in dismay what is this he asked oliveta is going home to sicily it is our parting and you tomorrow i go to the sisters no no he cried in a voice which thrilled her i wont let you for hours ive been trying to come here dearest dont answer until you know everything sometimes i fear i was the one who was dreaming at that moment when you confessed you loved me for it is all so unreal but my love is not unreal it has lived with me night and day since that first moment at terranova i couldnt speak before but all these years seem only hours and ive been living in the gardens of sicily where you first smiled at me and awoke this love you asked me to take no part i had to refuse ive tried to make a man of myself not for my own sake not for what the world would say but for you in the tumult of feeling that his words aroused she held fast to one thought what what about myra nell she gasped myra nell is married the curling lashes which had lain half closed during his headlong speech flew open to display a look of wonderment and dawning gladness yes he reiterated she is married she has been married ever since the carnival and shes very happy but i didnt know i was tied by a miserable misunderstanding so i couldnt come to you honestly until today and now i im afraid what do you fear she heard herself say the breathless delight of this moment was so intense that she toyed with it fearing to lose the smallest part she withheld the confession trembling upon her lips which he was too timid to take for granted too blind to see can you take me in spite of my wretched cowardice back there in sicily i would understand dear if you couldnt forget it but i love you so i tried so hard to make myself worthy youll never know how hard it was i couldnt do what you asked me the other day but thank god my hands are clean he held them out as if in evidence then to his great his neverending surprise she came forward and placed her two palms in his she stood looking gravely at him her surrender plain in the curve of her tremulous lip the droop of her faltering silkfringed lids knowledge came to him with a blinding suffocating suddenness which set his brain to reeling and wrung a rapturous cry from his throat after a long time he felt her shudder in his arms what is it heart of my life he whispered without lifting his lips from her tawny cloud of hair those walls she said those cold gray walls a sob rose caught then changed to a laugh of deep contentment and she nestled closer childrens voices were wafted up to them through the fragrant peaceful dusk and the two fell silent again until oliveta came and stood beside them with her face transfigured god be praised said the peasant girl as she put her hands in theirs something told me i should not return to sicily alone the end
