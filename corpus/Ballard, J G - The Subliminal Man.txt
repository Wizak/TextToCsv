j g ballard the subliminal man j g ballard is a british writer who has been called a poet of death but ballard especially in the early part of his career also wrote excellent extrapolative science fiction on social themes and this haunting story is one of his finest here ballard speaks of the enslavement of the unconscious of an economic system that forces people to consume against their will through the use of technology ballard makes an important assumptionthe belief that people would not want to consume at high rates if they were not forced to do so in a profound sense the subliminal man is a basic critique of the underlying dichotomy that pervades the concept of advertisingthat of needs versus wants we all have basic needs like food sex clothing and shelter almost everything else is wants often artificially created by the culture in which we live think how much more difficult resistance would become if the technology of subliminal advertising were forced upon us this threat goes beyond the financial difficulties that families would be in we would also be threatened with dehumanization for it is the ability to think and chose that separates us from the rest of the animal world ballards story also assumes that industry will continue to manufacture products that will easily and quickly wear out or if this is not the case then it will find ways to make us dissatisfied with the products we now have there is little evidence that things will change for the better the signs doctor have you see the signs frowning with annoyance dr franklin quickened his pace and hurried down the hospital steps toward the line of parked cars over his shoulder he caught a glimpse of a thin scruffy young man in ragged sandals and limestained jeans waving to him from the far side of the drive then break into a run when he saw franklin try to evade him dr franklin the signs head down franklin swerved around an elderly couple approaching the outpatients department his car was over a hundred yards away too tired to start running himself he waited for the young man to catch him up all right hathaway what is it this time he snapped irritably im getting sick of you hanging around here all day hathaway lurched to a halt in front of him uncut black hair like an awning over his eyes he brushed it back with a clawlike hand and turned on a wild smile obviously glad to see franklin and oblivious of the latters hostility ive been trying to reach you at night doctor but your wife always puts the phone down on me he explained without a hint of rancor as if well used to this kind of snub and i didnt want to look for you inside the clinic they were standing by a privet hedge that shielded them from the lower windows of the main administrative block but franklins regular rendezvous with hathaway and his strange messianic cries had already been the subject of amused comment franklin began to say i appreciate that but hathaway brushed this aside forget it doctor there are more important things happening now theyve started to build the first big signs over a hundred feet high on the traffic islands just outside town theyll soon have all the approach roads covered when they do we might as well stop thinking your trouble is that youre thinking too much franklin told him youve been rambling about these signs for weeks now tell me have you actually seen one signaling hathaway tore a handful of leaves from the hedge exasperated by this irrelevancy of course i havent thats the whole point doctor he dropped his voice as a group of nurses walked past watching him uneasily out of the corners of their eyes the construction gangs were out again last night laying huge power cables youll see them on the way home everythings nearly ready now theyre traffic signs franklin explained patiently the flyover has just been completed hathaway for gods sake relax try to think of dora and the child i am thinking of them hathaways voice rose to a controlled scream those cables were volt lines doctor with terrific switch gear the trucks were loaded with enormous metal scaffolds tomorrow theyll start lifting them up all over the city theyll block off half the sky what do you think dora will be like after six months of that weve got to stop them doctor theyre trying to transistorize our brains embarrassed by hathaways highpitched shouting franklin had momentarily lost his sense of direction and helplessly searched the sea of cars for his own hathaway i cant waste any more time talking to you believe me you need skilled help these obsessions are beginning to master you hathaway started to protest and franklin raised his right hand firmly listen for the last time if you can show me one of these new signs and prove that its transmitting subliminal commands ill go to the police with you but you havent got a shred of evidence and you know it subliminal advertising was banned thirty years ago and the laws have never been repealed anyway the technique was unsatisfactory any success it had was marginal your idea of a huge conspiracy with all these thousands of giant signs everywhere is preposterous all right doctor hathaway leaned against the bonnet of one of the cars his moods seemed to switch abruptly from one level to the next he watched franklin amiably whats the matterlost your car all your damned shouting has confused me franklin pulled out his ignition key and read the number off the tag nyn can you see it hathaway leaned around lazily one sandal up on the bonnet surveying the square of a thousand or so cars facing them difficult isnt it when theyre all identical even the same color thirty years ago there were about ten different makes each in a dozen colors franklin spotted his car began to walk toward it sixty years ago there were a hundred makes what of it the economies of standardization are obviously bought at a price hathaway drummed his palm lightly on the roofs but these cars arent all that cheap doctor in fact comparing them on an average income basis with those of thirty years ago theyre about forty percent more expensive with only one make being produced youd expect a substantial reduction in price not an increase maybe franklin said opening his door but mechanically the cars of today are far more sophisticated theyre lighter more durable safer to drive hathaway shook his head skeptically they bore me the same model same styling same color year after year its a sort of communism he rubbed a greasy finger over the windshield this is a new one again isnt it doctor wheres the old oneyou only had it for three months i traded it in franklin told him starting the engine if you ever had any money youd realize that its the most economical way of owning a car you dont keep driving the same one until it falls apart its the same with everything elsetelevision sets washing machines refrigerators but you arent faced with the problemyou havent got any hathaway ignored the gibe and leaned his elbow on franklins window not a bad idea either doctor it gives me time to think im not working a twelvehour day to pay for a lot of things im too busy to use before theyre obsolete he waved as franklin reversed the car out of its line then shouted into the wake of exhaust drive with your eyes closed doctor on the way home franklin kept carefully to the slowest of the fourspeed lanes as usual after his discussions with hathaway he felt vaguely depressed he realized that unconsciously he envied hathaway his footloose existence despite the grimy coldwater apartment in the shadow and roar of the flyover despite his nagging wife and their sick child and the endless altercations with the landlord and the supermarket credit manager hathaway still retained his freedom intact spared any responsibilities he could resist the smallest encroachment upon him by the rest of society if only by generating obsessive fantasies such as his latest one about subliminal advertising the ability to react to stimuli even irrationally was a valid criterion of freedom by contrast what freedom franklin possessed was peripheral sharply demarked by the manifold responsibilities in the center of his lifethe three mortgages on his home the mandatory rounds of cocktail and tv parties the private consultancy occupying most of saturday which paid the installments on the multitude of household gadgets clothes and past holidays about the only time he had to himself was driving to and from work but at least the roads were magnificent whatever other criticisms might be leveled at the present society it certainly knew how to build roads eight ten and twelvelane expressways interlaced across the continent plunging from overhead causeways into the giant car parks in the center of the cities or dividing into the great suburban arteries with their multiacre parking aprons around the marketing centers together the roadways and car parks covered more than a third of the countrys entire area and in the neighborhood of the cities the proportion was higher the old cities were surrounded by the vast dazzling abstract sculptures of the cloverleafs and flyovers but even so the congestion was unremitting the tenmile journey to his home in fact covered over twentyfive miles and took him twice as long as it had done before the construction of the expressway the additional miles contained within the three giant cloverleafs new cities were springing from the motels cafs and car marts around the highways at the slightest hint of an intersection a shantytown of shacks and filling stations sprawled away among the forest of electric signs and route indicators many of them substantial cities all around him cars bulleted along streaming toward the suburbs relaxed by the smooth motion of the car franklin edged outward into the next speed lane as he accelerated from to mph a strident earjarring noise drummed out from his tires shaking the chassis of the car ostensibly as an aid to lane discipline the surface of the road was covered with a mesh of smaller rubber studs spaced progressively farther apart in each of the lanes so that the tire hum resonated exactly on and mph driving at an intermediate speed for more than a few seconds became physiologically painful and soon resulted in damage to the car and tires when the studs wore out they were replaced by slightly different patterns matching those on the latest tires so that regular tire changes were necessary increasing the safety and efficiency of the expressway it also increased the revenues of the car and tire manufacturers for most cars over six months old soon fell to pieces under the steady battering but this was regarded as a desirable end the greater turnover judith started to protest he added firmly look i dont want a new infrared barbecue spit weve only had this one for two months damn it its not even a different model but darling dont you see it makes it cheaper if you keep buying new ones well have to trade ours in at the end of the year anyway we signed the contract and this way we save at least twenty dollars these spot bargains arent just a gimmick you know ive been glued to that set all day a note of irritation had crept into her voice but franklin sat his ground doggedly ignoring the clock right we lose twenty dollars its worth it before she could remonstrate he said judith pleas e you probably took the wrong number down anyway as she shrugged and went over to the bar he called make it a stiff one i see we have health foods on the menu theyre good for you darling you know you cant live on ordinary foods all the time they dont contain any proteins or vitamins youre always saying we ought to be like people in the old days and eat nothing but health foods i would but they smell so awful franklin lay back nose in the glass of whiskey gazing at the darkened skyline outside a quarter of a mile away gleaming out above the roof of the neighborhood supermarket were the five red beacon lights now and then as the headlamps of the spot bargainers swung up across the face of the building he could see the square massive bulk of the giant sign clearly silhouetted against the evening sky judith he went into the kitchen and took her over to the window that sign just behind the supermarket when did they put it up i dont know judith peered at him curiously why are you so worried robert isnt it something to do with the airport franklin stared thoughtfully at the dark hull of the sign so everyone probably thinks carefully he poured his whiskey into the sink after parking his car on the supermarket apron at seven oclock the next morning franklin carefully emptied his pockets and stacked the coins in the dashboard locker the supermarket was already busy with earlymorning shoppers and the line of thirty turnstiles clicked and slammed since the introduction of the hour spending day the shopping complex was never closed the bulk of the shoppers were discount buyers housewives contracted to make huge volume purchases of food clothing and appliances against substantial overall price cuts and forced to drive around all day from supermarket to supermarket frantically trying to keep pace with their purchase schedules and grappling with the added incentives inserted to keep the schemes alive many of the women had teamed up and as franklin walked over to the entrance a pack of them charged toward their cars stuffing their pay slips into their bags and gesticulating at each other a moment later their cars roared off in a convoy to the next marketing zone a large neon sign over the entrance listed the latest discounta mere percent calculated on the volume of turnover the highest discounts sometimes up to percent were earned in the housing estates where junior whitecollar workers lived there spending had a strong social incentive and the desire to be the highest spender in the neighborhood was given moral reinforcement by the system of listing all the names and their accumulating cash totals on a huge electric sign in the supermarket foyers the higher the spender the greater his contribution to the discounts enjoyed by others the lowestspending were regarded as social criminals freeriding on the backs of others luckily this system had yet to be adopted in franklins neighborhood not because the professional men and their wives were able to exercise more discretion but because their higher incomes allowed them to contract into more expensive discount schemes operated by the big department stores in the city ten yards from the entrance franklin paused looking up at the huge metal sign mounted in an enclosure at the edge of the car park unlike the other signs and billboards that proliferated everywhere no attempt had been made to decorate it or disguise the gaunt bare rectangle of riveted steel mesh power lines wound down its sides and the concrete surface of the car park was crossed by a long scar where a cable had been sunk franklin strolled along then fifty feet from the sign stopped and turned realizing that he would be late for the hospital and needed a new carton of cigarettes a dim but powerful humming emanated from the transformers below the sign fading as he retraced his steps to the supermarket going over to the automats in the foyer he felt for his change then whistled sharply when he remembered why he had deliberately emptied his pockets the cunning thing he said loud enough for two shoppers to stare at him reluctant to look directly at the sign he watched its reflection in one of the glass door panes so that any subliminal message would be reversed almost certainly he had received two distinct signalskeep away and buy cigarettes the people who normally parked their cars along the perimeter of the apron were avoiding the area under the enclosure the cars describing a loose semicircle fifty feet around it he turned to the janitor sweeping out the foyer whats that sign for the man leaned on his broom gazing dully at the sign dunno he said must be something to do with the airport he had an almost fresh cigarette in his mouth but his right hand reached unconsciously to his hip pocket and pulled out a pack he drummed the second cigarette absently on his thumbnail as franklin walked away everyone entering the supermarket was buying cigarettes cruising quietly along the mph lane franklin began to take a closer interest in the landscape around him usually he was either too tired or too preoccupied to do more than think about his driving but now he examined the expressway methodically scanning the roadside cafs for any smaller versions of the new signs a host of neon displays covered the doorways and windows but most of them seemed innocuous and he turned his attention to the larger billboards erected along the open stretches of the expressway many of these were as high as fourstory houses elaborate threedimensional devices in which giant glossyskinned housewives with electric eyes and teeth jerked and postured around their ideal kitchens neon flashes exploding from their smiles the areas of either side of the expressway were wasteland continuous junkyards filled with cars and trucks washing machines and refrigerators all perfectly workable but jettisoned by the economic pressure of the succeeding waves of discount models their intact chrome hardly tarnished the mounds of metal shells and cabinets glittered in the sunlight nearer the city the billboards were sufficiently close together to hide them but now and then as he slowed to approach one of the flyovers franklin caught a glimpse of the huge pyramids of metal gleaming silently like the refuse grounds of some forgotten el dorado that evening hathaway was waiting for him as he came down the hospital steps franklin waved him across the court then led the way quickly to his car whats the matter doctor hathaway asked as franklin wound up the windows and glanced around the lines of parked cars is someone after you franklin laughed somberly i dont know i hope not but if what you say is right i suppose there is hathaway leaned back with a chuckle propping one knee up on the dashboard so youve seen something doctor after all well im not sure yet but theres just a chance you may be right this morning at the fairlawne supermarket he broke off uneasily remembering the huge blank sign and the abrupt way in which he had turned back to the supermarket as he approached it then described his encounter hathaway nodded slowly ive seen the sign there its big but not as big as some that are going up theyre building them everywhere now all over the city what are you going to do doctor franklin gripped the wheel tightly hathaways thinly veiled amusement irritated him nothing of course damn it it may be just autosuggestion youve probably got me imagining hathaway sat up with a jerk his face mottled and savage dont be absurd doctor if you cant believe your own senses what chance have you left theyre invading your brain if you dont defend yourself theyll take it over completely weve got to act now before were all paralyzed wearily franklin raised one hand to restrain him just a minute assuming that these signs are going up everywhere what would be their object apart from wasting the enormous amount of capital invested in all the other millions of signs and billboards the amounts of discretionary spending power still available must be infinitesimal some of the present mortgage and discount schemes reach half a century ahead so there cant be much slack left to take up a big trade war would be disastrous quite right doctor hathaway rejoined evenly but youre forgetting one thing what would supply that extra spending power a big increase in production already theyve started to raise the working day from twelve hours to fourteen in some of the appliance plants around the city sunday working is being introduced as a norm can you visualize it doctora sevenday week everyone with at least three jobs franklin shook his head people wont stand for it they will within the last twentyfive years the gross national product has risen by fifty percent but so have the average hours worked ultimately well all be working and spending twentyfour hours a day seven days a week no one will dare refuse think what a slump would meanmillions of layoffs people with time on their hands and nothing to spend it on real leisure not just time spent buying things he seized franklin by the shoulder well doctor are you going to join me franklin freed himself half a mile away partly hidden by the four story bulk of the pathology department was the upper half of one of the giant signs workmen still crawling across its girders the airlines over the city had deliberately been routed away from the hospital and the sign obviously had no connection with approaching aircraft isnt there a prohibition on subliminal living how can the unions accept it the fear of a slump you know the new economic dogmas unless output rises by a steady inflationary five percent the economy is stagnating ten years ago increased efficiency alone would raise output but the advantages there are minimal now and only one thing is left more work increased consumption and subliminal advertising will provide the spur what are you planning to do i cant tell you doctor unless you accept equal responsibility for it sounds rather quixotic franklin commented tilting at windmills you wont be able to chop those things down with an ax i wont try hathaway suddenly gave up and opened the door dont wait too long to make up your mind doctor by then it may not be yours to make up with a wave he was gone on the way home franklins skepticism returned the idea of the conspiracy was preposterous and the economic arguments were too plausible as usual though there had been a hook in the soft bait hathaway dangled before himsunday working his own consultancy had been extended into sunday morning with his appointment as visiting factory doctor to one of the automobile plants that had started sunday shifts but instead of resenting this incursion into his already meager hours of leisure he had been glad for one frightening reason he needed the extra income looking out over the lines of scurrying cars he noticed that at least a dozen of the great signs had been erected along the expressway as hathaway had said more were going up everywhere rearing over the supermarkets in the housing developments like rusty metal sails judith was in the kitchen when he reached home watching the tv program on the handset over the cooker franklin climbed past a big cardboard carton its seals still unbroken which blocked the doorway kissed her on the cheek as she scribbled numbers down on her pad the pleasant odor of potroast chickenor rather a gelatine dummy of a chicken fully flavored and free of any toxic or nutritional propertiesmollified his irritation at finding her still playing the spot bargains he tapped the carton with his foot whats this no idea darling somethings always coming these days i cant keep up with it all she peered through the glass door at the chickenan economy pounder the size of a turkey with stylized legs and wings and an enormous breast most of which would be discarded at the end of the meal and then glanced at him pointedly you look rather worried robert bad day franklin murmured noncommittally the hours spent trying to detect false clues in the faces of the spot bargain announcers had sharpened judiths perceptions and he felt a pang of sympathy for the legion of husbands similarly outmatched have you been talking to that crazy beatnik again hathaway as a matter of fact i have hes not all that crazy he stepped backward into the carton almost spilling his drink well what is this thing as ill be working for the next fifty sundays to pay for it id like to find out he searched the sides finally located the label a tv set judith do we need another one weve already got three lounge dining room and the handset whats the fourth for the guest room dear dont get so excited we cant leave a handset in the guest room its rude im trying to economize but four tv sets is the bare minimum all the magazines say so and three radios franklin stared irritably at the carton if we do invite a guest here how much time is he going to spend alone in his room watching television judith weve got to call a halt its not as if these things were free or even cheap anyway television is a total waste of time theres only one program its ridiculous to have four sets robert there are four channels but only the commercials are different before judith could reply the telephone rang franklin lifted the kitchen receiver listened to the gabble of noise that poured from it at first he wondered whether this was some offbeat prestige commercial then realized it was hathaway in a manic swing hathaway he shouted back relax man whats the matter now doctor youll have to believe me this time i tell you i got on to one of the islands with a stroboscope theyve got hundreds of high speed shutters blasting away like machine guns straight into peoples faces and they cant see a thing its fantastic the next big campaigns going to be cars and tv sets theyre trying to swing a two month model changecan you imagine it doctor a new car every two months god almighty its just franklin waited impatiently as the fivesecond commercial break cut in but just before it ended he abruptly put the telephone down then removed the receiver from the cradle judith came over and took his arm robert whats the matter you look terribly strained franklin picked up his drink and walked through into the lounge its just hathaway as you say im getting a little too involved with him hes starting to prey on my mind he looked at the dark outline of the sign over the supermarket its red warning lights glowing in the night sky blank and nameless like an area forever closed off in an insane mind what frightened him was its total anonymity yet im not sure he muttered so much of what hathaway says makes sense these subliminal techniques are the sort of last ditch attempt youd expect from an overcapitalized industrial system he waited for judith to reply then looked up at her she stood in the center of the carpet hands folded limply her sharp intelligent face curiously dull and blunted he followed her gaze out over the rooftops then with an effort turned his head and quickly switched on the tv set come on he said grimly lets watch television god were going to need that fourth set a week later franklin began to compile his inventory he saw nothing more of hathaway as he left the hospital in the evening the familiar scruffy figure was absent when the first of the explosions sounded dimly around the city and he read of the attempts to sabotage the giant signs he automatically assumed that hathaway was responsible but later he heard on a newscast that the detonations had been set off by construction workers excavating foundations more of the signs appeared over the rooftops isolated on the palisaded islands near the suburban shopping centers already there were over thirty on the tenmile route from the hospital standing shoulder to shoulder over the speeding cars like giant dominoes franklin had given up his attempt to avoid looking at them but the slim possibility that the explosions might be hathaways counterattack kept his suspicions alive he began his inventory after hearing the newscast discovered that in the previous fortnight he and judith had traded in their car tv sets power mower electric cooker hair dryer refrigerator radios record player cocktail bar half these purchases had been made by himself but exactly when he could never recall realizing at the time the car for example he had left in the garage near the hospital to be greased that evening had signed for the new model as he sat at its wheel accepting the sales mans assurance that the depreciation on the twomonth tradein was virtually less than the cost of the grease job ten minutes later aass hhee sped along the expressway he suddenly realized that he had bought a new car similarly the tv sets had been replaced by identical models after developing the same irritating interference pattern not once had he actually decided of his own volition that he wanted something and then gone out to a store and bought it he carried the inventory around with him adding to it as necessary quietly and without protest analyzing these new sales techniques wondering whether total capitulation might be the only way of defeating them as long as he kept up even a token resistance the inflationary growth curve would show a controlled annual percent climb with that resistance removed however it would begin to rocket upward out of control then driving home from the hospital two months later he saw one of the signs for the first time he was in the mph lane unable to keep up with the flood of new cars had just passed the second of the three clover leafs when the traffic half a mile away began to slow down hundreds of cars had driven up onto the grass verge and a large crowd was gathering around one of the signs two small black figures were climbing up the metal face and a series of huge gridlock patterns of light flashed on and off illuminating the evening air the patterns were random and broken as if the sign was being tested for the first time relieved that hathaways suspicions had been completely groundless franklin turned off onto the soft shoulder then walked forward through the spectators as the lights blinked and stuttered in their faces below behind the steel palisades around the island was a large group of police and engineers craning up at the men scaling the sign a hundred feet over their heads suddenly franklin stopped the sense of relief fading instantly with a jolt he saw that several of the police on the ground were armed with shotguns and that the two policemen climbing the sign carried submachine guns slung over their shoulders they were converging on a third figure crouched by a switchbox on the penultimate tier a ragged bearded man in a grimy shirt a bare knee poking through his jeans hathaway franklin hurried toward the island the sign hissing and spluttering fuses blowing by the dozen then the flicker of lights cleared and steadied blazing out continuously and together the crowd looked up at the decks of brilliant letters the phrases and every combination of them possible were entirely familiar and franklin knew that he had been reading them unconsciously in his mind for weeks as he passed up and down the expressway buy now buy now buy now buy now buy now new car now new car now new car now yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes sirens blaring two patrol cars swung up onto the verge through the crowd and plunged across the damp grass police spilled from its doors batons in their hands quickly began to force back the crowd franklin held his ground as they approached started to say officer i know the man but the policeman punched him in the chest with the flatof his hand winded he stumbled back among the cars leaned helplessly against a fender as the police began to break the windshields the hapless drivers protesting angrily those farther back rushing for their vehicles the noise fell away abruptly when one of the submachine guns fired a brief roaring burst then rose in a massive gasp of horror as hathaway arms outstretched let out a cry of triumph and pain and jumped but robert what does it really matter judith asked as franklin sat inertly in the lounge the next morning i know its tragic for his wife and daughter but hathaway was in the grip of an obsession if he hated advertising signs so much why didnt he dynamite those we can see instead of worrying so much about those we cant franklin stared at the tv screen hoping the program would distract him hathaway was right he said simply was he advertising is here to stay weve no real freedom of choice anyway we cant spend more than we can afford the finance companies soon clamp down you accept that franklin went over to the window a quarter of a mile away in the center of the estate another of the signs was being erected it was due east from them and in the early morning light the shadows of its rectangular superstructure fell across the garden reaching almost to the steps of the french windows at his feet as a concession to the neighborhood and perhaps to allay any suspicions while it was being erected by an appeal to petty snobbery the lowest sections had been encased in mock tudor paneling franklin stared at it numbly counting the halfdozen police lounging by their patrol cars as the construction gang unloaded prefabricated grilles from a couple of trucks then he looked at the sign by the supermarket trying to repress his memories of hathaway and the pathetic attempts the man had made to convince franklin and gain his help he was still standing there an hour later when judith came in putting on her hat and coat ready to visit the supermarket franklin followed her to the door ill drive you down there judith he said in a flat voice dead voice i have to see about booking a new car the next models are coming out at the end of the month with luck well get one of the early deliveries they walked out into the trim drive the shadows of the great signs swinging across the quiet neighborhood as the day progressed sweeping over the heads of the people on their way to the supermarket like the dark blades of enormous scythes
