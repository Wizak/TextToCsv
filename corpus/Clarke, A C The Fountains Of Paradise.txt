dock view from the balcony the last dawn epilogue kalidasas triumph afterword sources and acknowledgments foreword from paradise to taprobane is forty leagues there may be heard the sound of the fountains of paradise traditional reported by friar marignolli the country i have called taprobane does not quite exist but is about ninety percent congruent with the island of ceylon though the afterword will make clear what locations events and personalities are based on fact the reader will not go far wrong in assuming that the more unlikely the story the closer it is to reality the name taprobane is now usually spoken to rhyme with plain but the correct classical pronunciation is taprobanee as milton of course well knew from india and the golden chersoness and utmost indian isle taprobane i the palace kalidasa the crown grew heavier with each passing year when the venerable bodhidharma mahanayake thero had so reluctantly first placed it upon his head prince kalidasa was surprised by its lightness now twenty years later king kalidasa gladly relinquished the jewelencrusted band of gold whenever court etiquette allowed there was little of that here upon the windswept summit of the rock fortress few envoys or petitioners sought audience on its forbidding heights many of those who made the journey to yakkagala turned back at the final ascent through the very jaws of the crouching lion that seemed always about to spring from the face of the rock an old king could never sit upon this heavenaspiring throne one day kalidasa might be too feeble to reach his own palace but he doubted if that day would ever come his many enemies would spare him the humiliations of age these enemies were gathering now he glanced towards the north as if he could already see the armies of his halfbrother returning to claim the bloodstained throne of taprobane but that threat was still far off across monsoonriven seas although kalidasa put more trust in his spies than his astrologers it was comforting to know that they agreed on this malgara had waited almost twenty years making his plans and gathering the support of foreign kings a still more patient and subtle enemy lay much nearer at hand forever watching from the southern sky the perfect cone of sri kanda the sacred mountain looked very close today as it towered above the central plain since the beginning of history it had struck awe into the heart of every man who saw it always kalidasa was aware of its brooding presence and of the power that it symbolised and yet the mahanayake thero had no armies no screaming war elephants tossing brazen tusks as they charged into battle the high priest was only an old man in an orange robe whose sole material possessions were a begging bowl and a palm leaf to shield him from the sun while the lesser monks and acolytes chanted the scriptures around him he merely sat in crosslegged silence and somehow tampered with the destinies of kings it was very strange the air was so clear today that kalidasa could see the temple dwarfed by distance to a tiny white arrowhead on the very summit of sri kanda it did not look like any work of man and it reminded the king of the still greater mountains he had glimpsed in his youth when he had been halfguest halfhostage at the court of mahinda the great all the giants that guarded mahindas empire bore such crests formed of a dazzling crystalline substance for which there was no word in the language of taprobane the hindus believed that it was a kind of water magically transformed but kalidasa laughed at such superstitions that ivory gleam was only three days march away one along the royal road through forests and paddyfields two more up the winding stairway which he could never climb again because at its end was the only enemy he feared and could not conquer sometimes he envied the pilgrims when he saw their torches marking a thin line of fire up the face of the mountain the humblest beggar could greet that holy dawn and receive the blessings of the gods the ruler of all this land could not but he had his consolations if only for a little while there guarded by moat and rampart lay the pools and fountains and pleasure gardens on which he had lavished the wealth of his kingdom and when he was tired of these there were the ladies of the rockthe ones of flesh and blood whom he summoned less and less frequentlyand the two hundred changeless immortals with whom he often shared his thoughts because there were no others he could trust thunder boomed along the western sky kalidasa turned away from the brooding menace of the mountain towards the distant hope of rain the monsoon was late this season the artificial lakes that fed the islands complex irrigation system were almost empty by this time of year he should have seen the glint of water in the mightiest of them al l which as he well knew his subjects still dared to call by his fathers name paravana samudra the sea of paravana it had been completed only thirty years ago after generations of toil in happier days young prince kalidasa had stood proudly beside his father when the great sluicegates were opened and the lifegiving waters had poured out across the thirsty land in all the kingdom there was no lovelier sight than the gently rippling mirror of that immense manmade lake when it reflected the domes and spires of ranapura city of goldthe ancient capital which he had abandoned for his dream once more the thunder rolled but kalidasa knew that its promise was false even here on the summit of demon rock the air hung still and lifeless there were none of the sudden random gusts that heralded the onset of the monsoon before the rains came at last famine might be added to his troubles your majesty said the patient voice of the court adigar the envoys are about to leave they wish to pay their respects ah yes those two pale ambassadors from across the western ocean he would be sorry to see them go for they had brought news in their abominable taprobani of many wondersthough none they were willing to admit that equalled this fortresspalace in the sky kalidasa turned his back upon the whitecapped mountain and the parched shimmering landscape and began to descend the granite steps to the audience chamber behind him the chamberlain and his aides bore gifts of ivory and gems for the tall proud men who were waiting to say farewell soon they would carry the treasures of taprobane across the sea to a city younger by centuries than ranapura and perhaps for a little while divert the brooding thoughts of the emperor hadrian his robes a flare of orange against the white plaster of the temple walls the mahanayake thero walked slowly to the northern parapet far below lay the chequerboard of paddyfields stretching from horizon to horizon the dark lines of irrigation channels the blue gleam of the paravana samudraand beyond that inland sea the sacred domes of ranapura floating like ghostly bubbles impossibly huge when one realised their true distance for thirty years he had watched that everchanging panorama but he knew that he would never grasp all the details of its fleeting complexity colours boundaries altered with every season indeed with every passing cloud on the day that he too passed thought bodhidharma he would still see something new only one thing jarred in all this exquisitely patterned landscape tiny though it appeared from this altitude the grey boulder of demon rock seemed an alien intruder indeed legend had it that yakkagala was a fragment of the herbbearing himalayan peak that the monkey god hanuman had dropped as he hastily carried both medicine and mountain to his injured comrades when the battles of the ramayana were over from this distance of course it was impossible to see any details of kalidasas folly except for a faint line that hinted at the outer rampart of the pleasure gardens yet once it had been experienced such was the impact of demon rock that it was impossible to forget the mahanayake thero could see in imagination as clearly as if he stood between them the immense lions claws protruding from the sheer face of the cliff while overhead loomed the battlements upon which it was easy to believe the accursed king still walked thunder crashed down from above rising swiftly to such a crescendo of power that it seemed to shake the mountain itself in a continuous sustained concussion it raced across the sky dwindling away into the east for long seconds echoes rolled around the rim of the horizon noone could mistake this as any herald of the coming rains they were not scheduled for another three weeks and monsoon control was never in error by more than twentyfour hours when the reverberations had died away the mahanayake turned to his companion so much for dedicated reentry corridors he said with slightly more annoyance than an exponent of the dharma should permit himself did we get a meter reading the younger monk spoke briefly into his wrist microphone and waited for a reply yesit peaked at a hundred and twenty thats five db above the previous record send the usual protest to kennedy or gagarin control whichever it is on second thoughts complain to them both not that it will make any difference of course as his eye traced the slowly dissolving vapour trail across the sky bodhidharma mahanayake thero eightyfifth of his name had a sudden and most unmonkish fantasy kalidasa would have had a suitable treatment for spaceline operators who thought only of dollars per kilo to orbit something that probably involved impalement or metalshod elephants or boiling oil but life of course had been so much simpler two thousand years ago the engineer his friends whose numbers dwindled sadly every year called him johan the world when it remembered him called him raja his full name epitomised five hundred years of history johan oliver de alwis sri rajasinghe there had been a time when the tourists visiting the rock bad sought him out with cameras and recorders but now a whole generation knew nothing of the days when he was the most familiar face in the solar system he did not regret his past glory for it had brought him the gratitude of all mankind but it had also brought vain regrets for the mistakes he had made and sorrow for the lives he had squandered when a little more foresight or patience might have saved them of course it was easy now in the perspective of history to see what should have been done to avert the auckland crisis or to assemble the unwilling signatories of the treaty of samarkand to blame himself for the unavoidable errors of the past was folly yet there were times when his conscience hurt him more than the fading twinges of that old patagonian bullet noone had believed that his retirement would last so long youll be back within six months world president chu had told him power is addictive not to me he had answered truthfully enough for power had come to him he had never sought it and it had always been a very special limited kind of power advisory not executive he was only special assistant for political affairs directly responsible to president and council with a staff that never exceeded teneleven if one included aristotle but towards the end the council had invariably accepted his advice and the world had given him much of the credit that should have gone to the unsung unhonoured bureaucrats of the peace division and so it was ambassadoratlarge rajasinghe who got all the publicity as he moved from one troublespot to another massaging egos here defusing crises there and manipulating the truth with consummate skill never actually lying of course that would have been fatal without aris infallible memory he could never have kept control of the intricate webs he was sometimes compelled to spin that mankind might live in peace when he had begun to enjoy the game for its own sake it was time to quit that had been twenty years ago and he had never regretted his decision those who predicted that boredom would succeed where the temptations of power had failed did not know their man or understand his origins he had gone back to the fields and forests of his youth and was living only a kilometre from the great brooding rock that had dominated his childhood indeed his villa was actually inside the wide moat that surrounded the pleasure gardens and the fountains that kalidasas architect had designed now splashed in johans own courtyard after a silence of two thousand years the water still flowed in the original stone conduits nothing had been changed except that the cisterns high up on the rock were now filled by electric pumps not relays of sweating slaves securing this historydrenched piece of land for his retirement had given johan more satisfaction than anything in his whole career fulfilling a dream that he had never really believed could come true the achievement had required all his diplomatic skills plus some delicate blackmail in the department of archaeology later questions had been asked in the state assembly but fortunately not answered he was insulated from all but the most determined tourists and students by an extension of the moat and screened from their gaze by a thick wall of mutated ashoka trees blazing with flowers throughout the year the trees also supported several families of monkeys who were amusing to watch but occasionally invaded the villa and made off with any portable objects that took their fancy then there would be a brief interspecies war with firecrackers and recorded dangercries that distressed the humans at least as much as the simians who would be back quickly enough for they had long ago learned that noone would really harm them one of taprobanes more outrageous sunsets was transfiguring the western sky when the small electrotrike came silently through the trees and drew up beside the granite columns of the portico through long and bitter experience rajasinghe had learned never to trust first impressions but also never to ignore them he had halfexpected that like his achievements vannevar morgan would be a large imposing man instead the engineer was well below average height and at first glance might even have been called frail that slender body however was all sinew and the ravenblack hair framed a face that looked considerably younger than its fiftyone years the video display from aris biog file had not done him justice he should have been a romantic poet or a concert pianist or perhaps a great actor holding thousands spellbound by his skill rajasinghe knew power when he saw it for power had been his business and it was power that he was facing now beware of small men he had often told himself for they are the movers and shakers of the world and with this thought there came the first flicker of apprehension almost every week old friends and old enemies came to this remote spot to exchange news and to reminisce about the past he welcomed such visits for they gave a continuing pattern to his life yet always he knew to a high degree of accuracy the purpose of the meeting and the ground that would be covered but as far as rajasinghe was aware he and morgan had no interests in common beyond those of any men in this day and age they had never met or had any prior communication indeed he had barely recognised morgans name still more unusual was the fact that the engineer had asked him to keep this meeting confidential though rajasinghe had complied it was with a feeling of resentment there was no need any more for secrecy in his peaceful life the very last thing he wanted now was for some important mystery to impinge upon his wellordered existence he had finished with security for ever ten years ago or was it even longer his personal guards had been removed at his own request yet what upset him most was not the mild secrecy but his own total bewilderment the chief engineer of the terran construction corporation was not going to travel thousands of kilometres merely to ask for his autograph or to express the usual tourist platitudes he must have come here for some specific purpose and try as he might rajasinghe was unable to imagine it even in his days as a public servant rajasinghe had never had occasion to deal with tcc its three divisions land sea space huge though they were made perhaps the least news of all the world federations specialised bodies only when there was some resounding technical failure or a headon collision with an environmental or historical group did tcc emerge from the shadows the last confrontation of this kind had involved the antarctic pipeline that miracle of twentyfirstcentury engineering built to pump fluidised coal from the vast polar deposits to the power plants and factories of the world in a mood of ecological euphoria tcc had proposed demolishing the last remaining section of the pipeline and restoring the land to the penguins instantly there had been cries of protest from the industrial archaeologists outraged at such vandalism and from the naturalists who pointed out that the penguins simply loved the abandoned pipeline it had provided housing of a standard they had never before enjoyed and thus contributed to a population explosion that the killer whales could barely handle so tcc had surrendered without a fight rajasinghe did not know if morgan had been associated with this minor dйbacle it hardly mattered since his name was now linked with tccs greatest triumph the ultimate bridge it had been christened and perhaps with justice rajasinghe had watched with half the world when the final section was lifted gently skywards by the graf zeppelin itself one of the marvels of the age all the airships luxurious fittings had been removed to save weight the famous swimming pool had been drained and the reactors were pumping their excess heat into the gasbags to give extra lift it was the first time that a deadweight of more than a thousand tons had even been hoisted three kilometres straight up into the sky and everything doubtless to the disappointment of millions had gone without a hitch no ship would ever again pass the pillars of hercules without saluting the mightiest bridge that man had ever built or in all probability would ever build the twin towers at the junction of mediterranean and atlantic were themselves the tallest structures in the world and faced each other across fifteen kilometres of space empty save for the incredible delicate arch of the gibraltar bridge it would be a privilege to meet the man who had conceived it even though he was an hour late my apologies ambassador said morgan as he climbed out of the trike i hope the delay hasnt inconvenienced you not at all my time is my own youve eaten i hope yes when they cancelled my rome connexion at least they gave me an excellent lunch probably better than youd get at the hotel yakkagala ive arranged a room for the night its only a kilometre from here im afraid well have to postpone our discussion until breakfast morgan looked disappointed but gave a shrug of acquiescence well ive plenty of work to keep me busy i assume that the hotel has full executive facilities or at least a standard terminal rajasinghe laughed i wouldnt guarantee anything much more sophisticated than a telephone but i have a better suggestion in just over halfanhour im taking some friends to the rock theres a sonetlumiиre performance that i strongly recommend and youre very welcome to join us he could tell that morgan was hesitating as he tried to think of a polite excuse thats very kind of you but i really must contact my office you can use my console i can promise you youll find the show fascinating and it only lasts an hour oh id forgotten you dont want anyone to know youre here well ill introduce you as doctor smith from the university of tasmania im sure my friends wont recognise you rajasinghe had no intention of offending his visitor but there was no mistaking morgans brief flash of irritation the exdiplomats instincts automatically came into play he filed the reaction for future reference im sure they wont morgan said and rajasinghe noted the unmistakable tone of bitterness in his voice doctor smith would be fine and now if i might use your console interesting thought rajasinghe as he led his guest into the villa but probably not important provisional hypothesis morgan was a frustrated perhaps even a disappointed man it was hard to see why since he was one of the leaders of his profession what more could he want there was one obvious answer rajasinghe knew the symptoms well if only because in his case the disease had long since burned itself out fame is the spur he recited in the silence of his thoughts how did the rest of it go that last infirmity of noble mind to scorn delights and live laborious days yes that might explain the discontent his stillsensitive antennae had detected and he suddenly recalled that the immense rainbow linking europe and africa was almost invariably called the bridge occasionally the gibraltar bridge but never morgans bridge well rajasinghe thought to himself if youre looking for fame dr morgan you wont find it here then why in the name of a thousand yakkas have you come to quiet little taprobane the fountains for days elephants and slaves had toiled in the cruel sun hauling the endless chains of buckets up the face of the cliff is it ready the king had asked time and again no majesty the master craftsman had answered the tank is not yet full but tomorrow perhaps tomorrow had come at last and now the whole court was gathered in the pleasure gardens beneath awnings of brightly coloured cloth the king himself was cooled by large fans waved by supplicants who had bribed the chamberlain for this risky privilege it was an honour which might lead to riches or to death all eyes were on the face of the rock and the tiny figures moving upon its summit a flag fluttered far below a horn sounded briefly at the base of the cliff workmen frantically manipulated levers hauled on ropes yet for a long time nothing happened a frown began to spread across the face of the king and the whole court trembled even the waving fans lost momentum for a few seconds only to speed up again as the wielders recalled the hazards of their task then a great shout came from the workers at the foot of yakkagalaa cry of joy and triumph that swept steadily closer as it was taken up along the flowerlined paths and with it came another sound one not so loud yet giving the impression of irresistible pentup forces rushing towards their goal one after the other springing from the earth as if by magic the slim columns of water leaped towards the cloudless sky at four times the height of a man they burst into flowers of spray the sunlight breaking through them created a rainbowhued mist that added to the strangeness and beauty of the scene never in the whole history of taprobane had the eyes of men witnessed such a wonder the king smiled and the courtiers dared to breathe again this time the buried pipes had not burst beneath the weight of water unlike their luckless predecessors the masons who had laid them had as good a chance of reaching old age as anyone who laboured for kalidasa almost as imperceptibly as the westering sun the jets were losing altitude presently they were no taller than a man the painfully filled reservoirs were nearly drained but the king was well satisfied he lifted his hand and the fountains dipped and rose again as if in one last curtsey before the throne then silently collapsed for a little while ripples raced back and forth across the surface of the reflecting pools then they once again became still mirrors framing the image of the eternal rock the workmen have done well said kalidasa give them their freedom how well of course they would never understand for none could share the lonely visions of an artistking as kalidasa surveyed the exquisitely tended gardens that surrounded yakkagala he felt as much contentment as he would ever know here at the foot of the rock he had conceived and created paradise it only remained upon its summit to build heaven demon rock this cunningly contrived pageant of light and sound still had power to move rajasinghe though he had seen it a dozen times and knew every trick of the programming it was of course obligatory for every visitor to the rock though critics like professor sarath complained that it was merely instant history for tourists yet instant history was better than no history at all and it would have to serve while sarath and his colleagues still vociferously disagreed about the precise sequence of events here two thousand years ago the little amphitheatre faced the western wall of yakkagala its two hundred seats all carefully orientated so that each spectator looked up into the laser projectors at the correct angle the performance always began at exactly the same time throughout the year hours as the last glow of the invariant equatorial sunset faded from the sky already it was so dark that the rock was invisible revealing its presence only as a huge black shadow eclipsing the early stars then out of that darkness there came the slow beating of a muffled drum and presently a calm dispassionate voice this is the story of a king who murdered his father and was killed by his brother in the bloodstained history of mankind that is nothing new but this king left an abiding monument and a legend which has endured for centuries rajasinghe stole a glance at vannevar morgan sitting there in the darkness on his right though he could see the engineers features only in silhouette he could tell that his visitor was already caught in the spell of the narration on his left his other two guests old friends from his diplomatic days were equally entranced as he had assured morgan they had not recognised dr smith or if they had indeed done so they had politely accepted the fiction his name was kalidasa and he was born a hundred years after christ in ranapura city of gold for centuries the capital of the taprobanean kings but there was a shadow across his birth the music became louder as flutes and strings joined the throbbing drum to trace out a haunting regal melody in the night air a point of light began to burn on the face of the rock then abruptly it expanded and suddenly it seemed that a magic window had opened into the past to reveal a world more vivid and colourful than life itself the dramatisation thought morgan was excellent he was glad that for once he had let courtesy override his impulse to work he saw the joy of king paravana when his favourite concubine presented him with his firstborn son and understood how that joy was both augmented and diminished when only twentyfour hours later the queen herself produced a better claimant to the throne though first in time kalidasa would not be first in precedence and so the stage was set for tragedy yet in the early years of their boyhood kalidasa and his halfbrother malgara were the closest of friends they grew up together quite unconscious of their rival destinies and the intrigues that festered around them the first cause of trouble had nothing to do with the accident of birth it was only a wellintentioned innocent gift to the court of king paravana came envoys bearing tribute from many lands silk from cathay gold from hindustan burnished armour from imperial rome and one day a simple hunter from the jungle ventured into the great city bearing a gift which he hoped would please the royal family all around him morgan heard a chorus of involuntary oohs and aahs from his unseen companions although he had never been very fond of animals he had to admit that the tiny snowwhite monkey that nestled so trustingly in the arms of young prince kalidasa was very endearing out of the wrinkled little face two huge eyes stared across the centuries and across the mysterious yet not wholly unbridgeable gulf between man and beast according to the chronicles nothing like it had ever been seen before its hair was white as milk its eyes pink as rubies some thought it a good omen others an evil one because white is the colour of death and of mourning and their fears alas were well founded prince kalidasa loved his little pet and called it hanuman after the valiant monkeygod of the ramayana the kings jeweller constructed a small golden cart in which hanuman would sit solemnly while he was drawn through the court to the amusement and delight of all who watched for his part hanuman loved kalidasa and would allow noone else to handle him he was especially jealous of prince malgara almost as if he sensed the rivalry to come and then one unlucky day he bit the heir to the throne the bite was trifling its consequences immense a few days later hanuman was poisoned doubtless by order of the queen that was the end of kalidasas childhood thereafter it is said he never loved or trusted another human being and his friendship towards malgara turned to bitter enmity nor was this the only trouble that stemmed from the death of one small monkey by command of the king a special tomb was built for hanuman in the shape of the traditional bellshaped shrine or dagoba now this was an extraordinary thing to do for it aroused the instant hostility of the monks dagobas were reserved for relics of the buddha and this act appeared to be one of deliberate sacrilege indeed that may well have been its intention for king paravana had now come under the sway of a hindu swami and was turning against the buddhist faith although prince kalidasa was too young to be involved in this conflict much of the monks hatred was now directed against him so began a feud that in the years to come was to tear the kingdom apart like many of the other tales recorded in the ancient chronicles of taprobane for almost two thousand years there was no proof that the story of hanuman and young prince kalidasa was anything but a charming legend then in a team of harvard archaeologists discovered the foundations of a small shrine in the grounds of the old ranapura palace the shrine appeared to have been deliberately destroyed for all the brickwork of the superstructure had vanished the usual relic chamber set in the foundations was empty obviously robbed of its contents centuries ago but the students had tools of which the oldtime treasurehunters never dreamed their neutrino survey disclosed a second relic chamber much deeper the upper one was only a decoy and it had served its purpose well the lower chamber still held the burden of love and hate it had carried down the centuries to its restingplace today in the ranapura museum morgan had always considered himself with justification reasonably hardheaded and unsentimental not prone to gusts of emotion yet now to his considerable embarrassment he hoped that his companions wouldnt notice he felt his eyes brim with sudden tears how ridiculous he told himself angrily that some saccharine music and a maudlin narration could have such an impact on a sensible man he would never have believed that the sight of a childs toy could have set him weeping and then he knew in a sudden lightning flash of memory that brought back a moment more than forty years in the past why he had been so deeply moved he saw again his beloved kite dipping and weaving above the sydney park where he had spent much of his childhood he could feel the warmth of the sun the gentle wind on his bare back the treacherous wind that suddenly failed so that the kite plunged earthwards it became snagged in the branches of the giant oak that was supposed to be older than the country itself and foolishly he had tugged at the string trying to pull it free it was his first lesson in the strength of materials and one that he was never to forget the string had broken just at the point of capture and the kite had rolled crazily away into the summer sky slowly losing altitude he had rushed down to the waters edge hoping that it would fall on land but the wind would not listen to the prayers of a little boy for a long time he had stood weeping as he watched the shattered fragments like some dismasted sailboat drift across the great harbour and out towards the open sea until they were lost from sight that had been the first of those trivial tragedies that shape a mans childhood whether he remembers them or not yet what morgan had lost then was only an inanimate toy his tears were of frustration rather than grief prince kalidasa had much deeper cause for anguish inside the little golden cart which still looked as if it had come straight from the craftsmans workshop was a bundle of tiny white bones morgan missed some of the history that followed when he had cleared his eyes a dozen years had passed a complex family quarrel was in progress and he was not quite sure who was murdering whom after the armies had ceased to clash and the last dagger had fallen crown prince malgara and the queen mother had fled to india and kalidasa had seized the throne imprisoning his father in the process that the usurper had refrained from executing paravana was not due to any filial devotion but to his belief that the old king still possessed some secret treasure which he was saving for malgara as long as kalidasa believed this paravana knew that he was safe but at last he grew tired of the deception i will show you my real wealth he told his son give me a chariot and i will take you to it but on his last journey unlike little hanuman paravana rode in a decrepit oxcart the chronicles record that it had a damaged wheel which squeaked all the way the sort of detail that must be true because no historian would have bothered to invent it to kalidasas surprise his father ordered the cart to carry him to the great artificial lake that irrigated the central kingdom the completion of which had occupied most of his reign he walked along the edge of the huge bund and gazed at his own statue twice lifesize that looked out across the waters farewell old friend he said addressing the towering stone figure which symbolised his lost power and glory and which held forever in its hands the stone map of this inland sea protect my heritage then closely watched by kalidasa and his guards he descended the spillway steps not pausing even at the edge of the lake when he was waist deep he scooped up the water and threw it over his head then turned towards kalidasa with pride and triumph here my son he cried waving towards the leagues of pure lifegiving water here here is all my wealth kill him screamed kalidasa mad with rage and disappointment and the soldiers obeyed so kalidasa became the master of taprobane but at a price that few men would be willing to pay for as the chronicles recorded always he lived in fear of the next world and of his brother sooner or later malgara would return to seek his rightful throne for a few years like the long line of kings before him kalidasa held court in ranapura then for reasons about which history is silent he abandoned the royal capital for the isolated rock monolith of yakkagala forty kilometres away in the jungle there were some who argued that he sought an impregnable fortress safe from the vengeance of his brother yet in the end he spurned its protection and if it was merely a citadel why was yakkagala surrounded by immense pleasure gardens whose construction must have demanded as much labour as the walls and moat themselves above all why the frescoes as the narrator posed this question the entire western face of the rock materialised out of the darkness not as it was now but as it must have been two thousand years ago a band starting a hundred metres from the ground and running the full width of the rock had been smoothed and covered with plaster upon which were portrayed scores of beautiful women lifesize from the waist upwards some were in profile others fullface and all followed the same basic pattern ochreskinned voluptuously bosomed they were clad either in jewels alone or in the most transparent of upper garments some wore towering and elaborate headdresses others apparently crowns many carried bowls of flowers or held single blossoms nipped delicately between thumb and forefinger though about half were darkerskinned than their companions and appeared to be handmaidens they were no less elaborately coifed and bejeweled once there were more than two hundred figures but the rains and winds of centuries have destroyed all except twenty which were protected by an overhanging ledge of rock the image zoomed forward one by one the last survivors of kalidasas dream came floating out of the darkness to the hackneyed yet singularly appropriate music of anitras dance defaced though they were by weather decay and even vandals they had lost none of their beauty down the ages the colours were still fresh unfaded by the light of more than half a million westering suns goddesses or women they had kept alive the legend of the rock no one knows who they were what they represented and why they were created with such labour in so inaccessible a spot the favourite theory is that they were celestial beings and that all kalidasas efforts here were devoted to creating a heaven on earth with its attendant goddesses perhaps he believed himself a godking as the pharaohs of egypt had done perhaps that is why he borrowed from them the image of the sphinx guarding the entrance to his palace now the scene shifted to a distant view of the rock seen reflected in the small lake at its base the water trembled the outlines of yakkagala wavered and dissolved when they had reformed the rock was crowned by walls and battlements and spires clinging to its entire upper surface it was impossible to see them clearly they remained tantalisingly out of focus like the images in a dream no man would ever know what kalidasas aerial palace had really looked like before it was destroyed by those who sought to extirpate his very name and here he lived for almost twenty years awaiting the doom that he knew would come his spies must have told him that with the help of the kings of southern hindustan malgara was patiently gathering his armies and at last malgara came from the summit of the rock kalidasa saw the invaders marching from the north perhaps he believed himself impregnable but he did not put it to the test for he left the safety of his great fortress and rode out to meet his brother in the neutral ground between the two armies one would give much to know what words they spoke at that last encounter some say they embraced before they parted it may be true then the armies met like the waves of the sea kalidasa was fighting on his own territory with men who knew the land and at first it seemed certain that victory would go to him but then occurred another of those accidents that determine the fate of nations kalidasas great war elephant caparisoned with the royal banners turned aside to avoid a patch of marshy ground the defenders thought that the king was retreating their morale broke they scattered as the chronicles record like chaff from the winnowing fan kalidasa was found on the battlefield dead by his own hand malgara became king and yakkagala was abandoned to the jungle not to be discovered again for seventeen hundred years through the telescope my secret vice rajasinghe called it with wry amusement but also with regret it had been years since he had climbed to the summit of yakkagala and though he could fly there whenever he wished that did not give the same feeling of achievement to do it the easy way bypassed the most fascinating architectural details of the ascent noone could hope to understand the mind of kalidasa without following his footsteps all the way from pleasure garden to aerial palace but there was a substitute which could give an ageing man considerable satisfaction years ago he had acquired a compact and powerful twentycentimetre telescope through it he could roam the entire western wall of the rock retracing the path he had followed to the summit so many times in the past when he peered through the binocular eyepiece he could easily imagine that he was hanging in midair close enough to the sheer granite wall to reach out and touch it in the late afternoon as the rays of the westering sun reached beneath the rock overhang that protected them rajasinghe would visit the frescoes and pay tribute to the ladies of the court though he loved them all he had his favourites sometimes he would talk silently to them using the most archaic words and phrases that he knewwell aware of the fact that his oldest taprobani lay a thousand years in their future it also amused him to watch the living and to study their reactions as they scrambled up the rock took photographs of each other on the summit or admired the frescoes they could have no idea that they were accompanied by an invisibleand envious spectator moving effortlessly beside them like a silent ghost and so close that he could see every expression and every detail of their clothing for such was the power of the telescope that if rajasinghe had been able to lipread he could have eavesdropped on the tourists conversation if this was voyeurism it was harmless enough and his little vice was hardly a secret for he was delighted to share it with visitors the telescope provided one of the best introductions to yakkagala and it had often served other useful purposes rajasinghe had several times alerted the guards to attempted souvenir hunting and more than one astonished tourist had been caught carving his initials on the face of the rock rajasinghe seldom used the telescope in the morning because the sun was then on the far side of yakkagala and little could be seen on the shadowed western face and as far as he could recall he had never used it so soon after dawn while he was still enjoying the delightful local custom of bedtea introduced by the european planters three centuries ago yet now as he glanced out of the wide picturewindow that gave him an almost complete view of yakkagala he was surprised to see a tiny figure moving along the crest of the rock partly silhouetted against the sky visitors never climbed to the top so soon after dawn the guard wouldnt even unlock the elevator to the frescoes for another hour idly rajasinghe wondered who the early bird could be he rolled out of bed clambered into his bright batik sarong and made his way barebodied out on to the verandah and thence to the stout concrete pillar supporting the telescope making a mental note for about the fiftieth time that he really should get the instrument a new dustcover he swung the stubby barrel towards the rock i might have guessed it he told himself with considerable pleasure as he switched to high power so last nights show had impressed morgan as well it should have done the engineer was seeing for himself in the short time available how kalidasas architects had met the challenge imposed upon them then rajasinghe noticed something quite alarming morgan was walking briskly around at the very edge of the plateau only centimetres away from the sheer drop that few tourists ever dared to approach not many had the courage even to sit in the elephant throne with their feet dangling over the abyss but now the engineer was actually kneeling beside it holding on to the carved stonework with one casual arm and leaning right out into nothingness as he surveyed the rockface below rajasinghe who had never been very happy even with such familiar heights as yakkagalas could scarcely bear to watch after a few minutes of incredulous observation he decided that morgan must be one of those rare people who are completely unaffected by heights rajasinghes memory which was still excellent but delighted in playing tricks on him was trying to bring something to his notice hadnt there once been a frenchman who had tightroped across niagara falls and even stopped in the middle to cook a meal if the documentary evidence had not been overwhelming rajasinghe would never have believed such a story and there was something else that was relevant here an incident that concerned morgan himself what could it possibly be morgan morgan he had known virtually nothing about him until a week ago yes that was it there had been a brief controversy that had amused the news media for a day or so and that must have been the first time he had ever heard morgans name the chief designer of the proposed gibraltar bridge had announced a startling innovation as all vehicles would be on automatic guidance there was absolutely no point in having parapets or guard rails at the edge of the roadway eliminating them would save thousands of tons of course everyone thought that this was a perfectly horrible idea what would happen the public demanded if some cars guidance failed and the vehicle headed towards the edge the chief designer had the answers unfortunately he had rather too many if the guidance failed then as everyone knew the brakes would go on automatically and the vehicle would stop in less than a hundred metres only on the outermost lanes was there any possibility that a car could go over the edge that would require a total failure of guidance sensors and brakes and might happen once in twenty years so far so good but then the chief engineer added a caveat perhaps he did not intend it for publication possibly he was halfjoking but he went on to say that if such an accident did occur the quicker the car went over the edge without damaging his beautiful bridge the happier he would be needless to say the bridge was eventually built with wire deflectorcables along the outer lanes and as far as rajasinghe knew noone had yet taken a highdive into the mediterranean morgan however appeared suicidally determined to sacrifice himself to gravity here on yakkagala otherwise it was hard to account for his actions now what was he doing he was on his knees at the side of the elephant throne and was holding a small rectangular box about the shape and size of an oldfashioned book rajasinghe could catch only glimpses of it and the manner in which the engineer was using it made no sense at all possibly it was some kind of analysis device though he did not see why morgan should be interested in the composition of yakkagala was he planning to build something here not that it would be allowed of course and rajasinghe could imagine no conceivable attractions for such a site megalomaniac kings were fortunately now in short supply in any event he was quite certain from the engineers reactions on the previous evening that morgan had never heard of yakkagala before coming to taprobane and then rajasinghe who had always prided himself on his self control in even the most dramatic and unexpected situations gave an involuntary cry of horror vannevar morgan had stepped casually backwards off the face of the cliff out into empty space the artist bring the persian to me said kalidasa as soon as he had recovered his breath the climb from the frescoes back to the elephant throne was not difficult and it was perfectly safe now that the stairway down the sheer rock face had been enclosed with walls but it was tiring for how many more years kalidasa wondered would he be able to make this journey unaided though slaves could carry him that did not befit the dignity of a king and it was intolerable that any eyes but his should look upon the hundred goddesses and their hundred equally beautiful attendants who formed the retinue of his celestial court so from now on night and day there would always be a guard standing at the entrance to the stairs the only way down from the palace to the private heaven that kalidasa had created after ten years of toil his dream was now complete whatever the jealous monks on their mountaintop might claim to the contrary he was a god at last despite his years in the taprobanean sun firdaz was still as lightskinned as a roman today as he bowed before the king he looked even paler and ill at ease kalidasa regarded him thoughtfully then gave one of his rare smiles of approval you have done well persian he said is there any artist in the world who could do better pride obviously strove with caution before firdaz gave his hesitant reply none that i know majesty and have i paid you well i am quite satisfied that reply thought kalidasa was hardly accurate there had been continuous pleas for more money more assistants expensive materials that could only be obtained from distant lands but artists could not be expected to understand economics or to know how the royal treasury had been drained by the awesome cost of the palace and its surroundings and now that your work here is finished what do you wish i would like your majestys permission to return to ishfahan so that i may see my own people once again it was the answer that kalidasa had expected and he sincerely regretted the decision he must make but there were too many other rulers on the long road to persia who would not let the masterartist of yakkagala slip through their greedy fingers and the painted goddesses of the western wall must remain forever unchallenged there is a problem he said flatly and firdaz turned yet paler his shoulders slumping at the words a king did not have to explain anything but this was one artist speaking to another you have helped me to become a god that news has already reached many lands if you leave my protection there are others who will make similar requests of you for a moment the artist was silent the only sound was the moaning of the wind which seldom ceased to complain when it met this unexpected obstacle upon its journey then firdaz said so quietly that kalidasa could hardly hear him am i then forbidden to leave you may go and with enough wealth for the rest of your life but only on condition that you never work for any other prince i am willing to give that promise replied firdaz with almost unseemly haste sadly kalidasa shook his head i have learned not to trust the word of artists he said especially when they are no longer within my power so i will have to enforce that promise to kalidasas surprise firdaz no longer looked so uncertain it was almost as if he had made some great decision and was finally at ease i understand he said drawing himself up to his full height then deliberately he turned his back upon the king as though his royal master no longer existed and stared straight into the blazing sun the sun kalidasa knew was the god of the persians and those words firdaz was murmuring must be a prayer in his language there were worse gods to worship and the artist was staring into that blinding disc as if he knew it was the last thing he would ever see hold him cried the king the guards rushed swiftly forward but they were too late blind though he must now have been firdaz moved with precision in three steps he had reached the parapet and vaulted over it he made no sound in his long arc down to the gardens he had planned for so many years nor was there any echo when the architect of yakkagala reached the foundations of his masterwork kalidasa grieved for many days but his grief turned to rage when the persians last letter to ishfahan was intercepted someone had warned firdaz that he would be blinded when his work was done and that was a damnable falsehood he never discovered the source of the rumour though not a few men died slowly before they proved their innocence it saddened him that the persian had believed such a lie surely he should have known that a fellow artist would never have robbed him of the gift of sight for kalidasa was not a cruel man nor an ungrateful one he would have laden firdaz with gold or at least silver and sent him on his way with servants to take care of him for the remainder of his life he would never have needed to use his hands again and after a while he would not have missed them the godkings palace vannevar morgan had not slept well and that was most unusual he had always taken pride in his selfawareness and his insight into his own drives and emotions if he could not sleep he wanted to know why slowly as he watched the first predawn light glimmer on the ceiling of his hotel bedroom and heard the belllike cries of alien birds he began to marshal his thoughts he would never have become a senior engineer of terran construction if he had not planned his life to avoid surprises although no man could be immune to the accidents of chance and fate he had taken all reasonable steps to safeguard his career and above all his reputation his future was as failsafe as he could make it even if he died suddenly the programmes stored in his computer bank would protect his cherished dream beyond the grave until yesterday he had never heard of yakkagala indeed until a few weeks ago he was only vaguely aware of taprobane itself until the logic of his quest directed him inexorably towards the island by now he should already have left whereas in fact his mission had not yet begun he did not mind the slight disruption of his schedule what did perturb him was the feeling that he was being moved by forces beyond his understanding yet the sense of awe had a familiar resonance he had experienced it before when as a child he had flown his lost kite in kiribilli park beside the granite monoliths that had once been the piers of the longdemolished sydney harbour bridge those twin mountains had dominated his boyhood and had controlled his destiny perhaps in any event he would have been an engineer but the accident of his birthplace had determined that he would be a builder of bridges and so he had been the first man to step from morocco to spain with the angry waters of the mediterranean three kilometres below never dreaming in that moment of triumph of the far more stupendous challenge that still lay ahead if he succeeded in the task that confronted him he would be famous for centuries to come already his mind strength and will were being taxed to the utmost he had no time for idle distractions yet he had become fascinated by the achievements of an engineerarchitect two thousand years dead belonging to a totally alien culture and there was the mystery of kalidasa himself what was his purpose in building yakkagala the king might have been a monster but there was something about his character which struck a chord in the secret places of morgans own heart sunrise would be in thirty minutes it was still two hours before his breakfast with ambassador rajasinghe that would be long enough and he might have no other opportunity morgan was never one to waste time slacks and sweater were on in less than a minute but the careful checking of his footwear took considerably longer though he had done no serious climbing for years he always carried a pair of strong lightweight boots in his profession he often found them essential he had already closed the door of his room when he had a sudden afterthought for a moment he stood hesitantly in the corridor then he smiled and shrugged his shoulders it wouldnt do any harm and one never knew once more back in the room morgan unlocked his suitcase and took out a small flat box about the size and shape of a pocket calculator he checked the battery charge tested the manual override then clipped it to the steel buckle of his strong synthetic waistbelt now he was indeed ready to enter kalidasas haunted kingdom and to face whatever demons it held the sun rose pouring welcome warmth upon his back as morgan passed through the gap in the massive rampart that formed the outer defences of the fortress before him spanned by a narrow stone bridge were the still waters of the great moat stretching in a perfectly straight line for half a kilometre on either side a small flotilla of swans sailed hopefully towards him through the lilies then dispersed with ruffled feathers when it was clear that he had no food to offer on the far side of the bridge he came to a second smaller wall and climbed the narrow flight of stairs cut through it and there before him were the pleasure gardens with the sheer face of the rock looming beyond them the fountains along the axis of the gardens rose and fell together with a languid rhythm as if they were breathing slowly in unison there was not another human being in sight he had the whole expanse of yakkagala to himself the fortresscity could hardly have been lonelier even during the seventeen hundred years when the jungle had overwhelmed it between the death of kalidasa and its rediscovery by nineteenthcentury archaeologists morgan walked past the line of fountains feeling their spray against his skin and stopped once to admire the beautifully carved stone guttering obviously original which carried the overflow he wondered how the oldtime hydraulic engineers lifted the water to drive the fountains and what pressure differences they could handle these soaring vertical jets must have been truly astonishing to those who first witnessed them and now ahead was a steep flight of granite steps their treads so uncomfortably narrow that they could barely accommodate morgans boots did the people who built this extraordinary place really have such tiny feet he wondered or was it a clever ruse of the architect to discourage unfriendly visitors it would certainly be difficult for soldiers to charge up this sixtydegree slope on steps that seemed to have been made for midgets a small platform then another identical flight of steps and morgan found himself on a long slowly ascending gallery cut into the lower flanks of the rock he was now more than fifty metres above the surrounding plain but the view was completely blocked by a high wall coated with smooth yellow plaster the rock above him overhung so much that he might almost have been walking along a tunnel for only a narrow band of sky was visible overhead the plaster of the wall looked completely new and unworn it was almost impossible to believe that the masons had left their work two thousand years ago here and there however the gleaming mirrorflat surface was scarred with scratched messages where visitors had made their usual bids for immortality very few of the inscriptions were in alphabets that morgan could recognise and the latest date he noticed was thereafter presumably the department of archaeology had intervened to prevent such vandalism most of the graffiti were in flowing rounded taprobani morgan recalled from the previous nights entertainment that many were poems dating back to the second and third century for a little while after the death of kalidasa yakkagala had known its first brief spell as a tourist attraction thanks to the still lingering legends of the accursed king halfway along the stone gallery morgan came to the now locked door of the little elevator leading to the famous frescoes twenty metres directly above he craned his head to see them but they were obscured by the platform of the visitors viewing cage clinging like a metal birdsnest to the outwardleaning face of the rock some tourists rajasinghe had told him took one look at the dizzy location of the frescoes and decided to satisfy themselves with photographs now for the first time morgan could appreciate one of the chief mysteries of yakkagala it was not how the frescoes were painted a scaffolding of bamboo could have taken care of that problem but why once they were completed noone could ever have seen them properly from the gallery immediately beneath they were hopelessly foreshortened and from the base of the rock they would have been no more than tiny unrecognisable patches of colour perhaps as some had suggested they were of purely religious or magical significance like those stone age paintings found in the depths of almost inaccessible caves the frescoes would have to wait until the attendant arrived and unlocked the elevator there were plenty of other things to see he was still only a third of the way to the summit and the gallery was still slowly ascending as it clung to the face of the rock the high yellowplastered wall gave way to a low parapet and morgan could once more see the surrounding countryside there below him lay the whole expanse of the pleasure gardens and for the first time he could appreciate not only their huge scale but also their skilful planning and the way in which the moat and outer ramparts protected them from the forest beyond noone knew what trees and shrubs and flowers had grown here in kalidasas day but the pattern of artificial lakes canals pathways and fountains was still exactly as he had left it as he looked down on those dancing jets of water morgan suddenly remembered a quotation from the previous nights commentary from taprobane to paradise is forty leagues there may be heard the sound of the fountains of paradise he savoured the phrase in his mind the fountains of paradise was kalidasa trying to create here on earth a garden fit for the gods in order to establish his claim to divinity if so it was no wonder that the priests had accused him of blasphemy and placed a curse upon all his work at last the long gallery which had skirted the entire western face of the rock ended in another steeply rising stairway though this time the steps were much more generous in size but the palace was still far above for the stairs ended on a large plateau obviously artificial here was all that was left of the gigantic leonine monster who had once dominated the landscape and struck terror into the hearts of everyone who looked upon it for springing from the face of the rock were the paws of a gigantic crouching beast the claws alone were half the height of a man nothing else remained save yet another granite stairway rising up through the piles of rubble that must once have formed the head of the creature even in ruin the concept was aweinspiring anyone who dared to approach the kings ultimate stronghold had first to walk through gaping jaws the final ascent up the sheer indeed slightly overhanging face of the cliff was by a series of iron ladders with guardrails to reassure nervous climbers but the real danger here morgan had been warned was not vertigo swarms of normally placid hornets occupied small caves in the rock and visitors who made too much noise had sometimes disturbed them with fatal results two thousand years ago this northern face of yakkagala had been covered with walls and battlements to provide a fitting background to the taprobanean sphinx and behind those walls there must have been stairways that gave easy access to the summit now time weather and the vengeful hand of man had swept everything away there was only the bare rock grooved with myriads of horizontal slots and narrow ledges that had once supported the foundations of vanished masonry abruptly the climb was over morgan found himself standing on a small island floating two hundred metres above a landscape of trees and fields that was flat in all directions except southwards where the central mountains broke up the horizon he was completely isolated from the rest of the world yet felt master of all he surveyed not since he had stood among the clouds straddling europe and africa had he known such a moment of aerial ecstasy this was indeed the residence of a godking and the ruins of his palace were all round a baffling maze of broken walls none more than waist high piles of weathered brick and granitepaved pathways covered the entire surface of the plateau right to the precipitous edge morgan could also see a large cistern cut deeply into the solid rock presumably a waterstorage tank as long as supplies were available a handful of determined men could have held this place forever but if yakkagala had indeed been intended as a fortress its defences had never been put to the test kalidasas fateful last meeting with his brother had taken place far beyond the outer ramparts almost forgetting time morgan roamed among the foundations of the palace that had once crowned the rock he tried to enter the mind of the architect from what he could see of his surviving handiwork why was there a pathway here did this truncated flight of steps lead to an upper floor if this coffinshaped recess in the stone was a bath how was the water supplied and how did it drain away his research was so fascinating that he was quite oblivious of the increasing heat of the sun striking down from a cloudless sky far below the emeraldgreen landscape was waking into life like brightlycoloured beetles a swarm of little robot tractors was heading towards the ricefields improbable though it seemed a helpful elephant was pushing an overturned bus back on to the road which it had obviously left while cornering at too high a speed morgan could even hear the shrill voice of the rider perched just behind the enormous ears and a stream of tourists was pouring like army ants through the pleasure gardens from the general direction of the hotel yakkagala he would not enjoy his solitude much longer still he had virtually completed his exploration of the ruins though one could of course spend a lifetime investigating them in detail he was happy to rest for a while on a beautifullycarved granite bench at the very edge of the twohundredmetre drop overlooking the entire southern sky morgan let his eyes scan the distant line of mountains still partly concealed by a blue haze which the morning sun had not yet dispersed as he examined it idly he suddenly realised that what he had assumed to be a part of the cloudscape was nothing of the sort that misty cone was no ephemeral construct of wind and vapour there was no mistaking its perfect symmetry as it towered above its lesser brethren for a moment the shock of recognition emptied his mind of everything except wonder and an almost superstitious awe he had not realised that one could see the sacred mountain so clearly from yakkagala but there it was slowly emerging from the shadow of night preparing to face a new day and if he succeeded a new future he knew all its dimensions all its geology he had mapped it through stereophotographs and had scanned it from satellites but to see it for the first time with his own eyes made it suddenly real until now everything had been theory and sometimes not even that more than once in the small grey hours before dawn morgan had woken from nightmares in which his whole project had appeared as some preposterous fantasy which far from bringing him fame would make him the laughingstock of the world morgans folly some of his peers had once dubbed the bridge what would they call his latest dream but manmade obstacles had never stopped him before nature was his real antagonistthe friendly enemy who never cheated and always played fair yet never failed to take advantage of the tiniest oversight or omission and all the forces of nature were epitomised for him now in the distant blue cone which he knew so well but had yet to feel beneath his feet as kalidasa had done so often from this very spot morgan stared across the fertile green plain measuring the challenge and considering his strategy to kalidasa sri kanda represented both the power of the priesthood and the power of the gods conspiring together against him now the gods were gone but the priests remained they represented something that morgan did not understand and would therefore treat with wary respect it was time to descend he must not be late again especially through his own miscalculation as he rose from the stone slab on which he had been sitting a thought that had been worrying him for several minutes finally rose to consciousness it was strange to have placed so ornate a seat with its beautifully carved supporting elephants at the very edge of a precipice morgan could never resist such an intellectual challenge leaning out over the abyss he once again tried to attune his engineers mind to that of a colleague two thousand years dead malgara not even his closest comrades could read the expression on prince malgaras face when for the last time he gazed upon the brother who had shared his boyhood the battlefield was quiet now even the cries of the injured had been silenced by healing herb or yet more potent sword after a long while the prince turned to the yellowrobed figure standing by his side you crowned him venerable bodhidharma now you can do him one more service see that he receives the honours of a king for a moment the prelate did not reply then he answered softly he destroyed our temples and scattered the priests if he worshipped any god it was siva malgara bared his teeth in the fierce smile that the mahanayake was to know all too well in the years that were left to him revered sire said the prince in a voice that dripped venom he was the firstborn of paravana the great he sat on the throne of taprobane and the evil that he did dies with him when the body is burned you will see that the relics are properly entombed before you dare set foot upon sri kanda again the mahanayake thero bowed ever so slightly it shall be done according to your wishes and there is another thing said malgara speaking now to his aides the fame of kalidasas fountains reached us even in hindustan we would see them once before we march on ranapura from the heart of the pleasure gardens which had given him such delight the smoke of kalidasas funeral pyre rose into the cloudless sky disturbing the birds of prey who had gathered from far and wide grimly content though sometimes haunted by sudden memories malgara watched the symbol of his triumph spiralling upwards announcing to all the land that the new reign had begun as if in continuation of their ancient rivalry the water of the fountains challenged the fire leaping skyward before it fell back to shatter the surface of the reflecting pool but presently long before the flames had finished their work the reservoirs began to fail and the jets collapsed in watery ruin before they rose again in the gardens of kalidasa imperial rome would have passed away the armies of islam would have marched across africa copernicus would have dethroned the earth from the centre of the universe the declaration of independence would have been signed and men would have walked upon the moon malgara waited until the pyre had disintegrated in a final brief flurry of sparks as the last smoke drifted against the towering face of yakkagala he raised his eyes towards the palace on its summit and stared for a long time in silent appraisal no man should challenge the gods he said at last let it be destroyed filament you nearly gave me a heart attack said rajasinghe accusingly as he poured the morning coffee at first i thought you had some antigravity device but even i know thats impossible how did you do it my apologies morgan answered with a smile if id known you were watching id have warned you though the whole exercise was entirely unplanned id merely intended to take a scramble over the rock but then i got intrigued by that stone bench i wondered why it was on the very edge of the cliff and started to explore theres no mystery about it at one time there was a floor probably wood extending outwards and a flight of steps leading down to the frescoes from the summit you can still see the grooves where it was keyed into the rockface so i discovered said morgan a little ruefully i might have guessed that someone would have found that out already two hundred and fifty years ago thought rajasinghe that crazy and energetic englishman arnold lethbridge taprobanes first director of archaeology he had himself lowered down the face of the rock exactly as you did well not exactly morgan had now produced the metal box that had allowed him to perform his miracle its only features were a few pressbuttons and a small readout panel it looked for all the world like some form of simple communications device this is it he said proudly since you saw me make a hundredmetre vertical walk you must have a very good idea how it operates commonsense gave me one answer but even my excellent telescope didnt confirm it i could have sworn there was absolutely nothing supporting you that wasnt the demonstration id intended but it must have been effective now for my standard salespitchplease hook your finger through this ring rajasinghe hesitated morgan was holding the small metal torus about twice the size of an ordinary weddingring almost as if it was electrified will it give me a shock he asked not a shock but perhaps a surprise try to pull it away from me rather gingerly rajasinghe took hold of the ring then almost dropped it for it seemed alive it was straining towards morgan or rather towards the box that the engineer was holding in his hand then the box gave a slight whirring noise and rajasinghe felt his finger being dragged forward by some mysterious force magnetism he asked himself of course not no magnets could behave in this fashion his tentative but improbable theory was correct indeed there was really no alternative explanation they were engaged in a perfectly straightforward tugofwar but with an invisible rope though rajasinghe strained his eyes he could see no trace of any thread or wire connecting the ring through which his finger was hooked and the box which morgan was operating like a fisherman reeling in his catch he reached out his free hand to explore the apparently empty space but the engineer quickly knocked it away sorry he said everyone tries that when they realise whats happening you could cut yourself very badly so you do have an invisible wire clever but what use is it except for parlour tricks morgan gave a broad smile i cant blame you for jumping to that conclusion its the usual reaction but its quite wrong the reason you cant see this sample is that its only a few microns thick much thinner than a spiders web for once thought rajasinghe an overworked adjective was fully justified thats incredible what is it the result of about two hundred years of solid state physics for whatever good that does its a continuous pseudoonedimensional diamond crystal though its not actually pure carbon there are several trace elements in carefully controlled amounts it can only be massproduced in the orbiting factories where theres no gravity to interfere with the growth process fascinating whispered rajasinghe almost to himself he gave little tugs on the ring hooked around his finger to test that the tension was still there and that he was not hallucinating i can appreciate that this may have all sorts of technical applications it would make a splendid cheesecutter morgan laughed one man can bring a tree down with it in a couple of minutes but its tricky to handle even dangerous weve had to design special dispensers to spool and unspool it we call them spinnerettes this is a poweroperated one made for demonstration purposes the motor can lift a couple of hundred kilos and im always finding new uses for it todays little exploit wasnt the first by any means almost reluctantly rajasinghe unhooked his finger from the ring it started to fall then began to pendulum back and forth without visible means of support until morgan pressed a button and the spinnerette reeled it in with a gentle whirr you havent come all this way dr morgan just to impress me with this latest marvel of science though i am impressed i want to know what all this has to do with me a very great deal mister ambassador answered the engineer suddenly equally serious and formal you are quite correct in thinking that this material will have many applications some of which we are only now beginning to foresee and one of them for better or for worse is going to make your quiet little island the centre of the world no not merely the world the whole solar system thanks to this filament taprobane will be the steppingstone to all the planets and one day perhaps the stars the ultimate bridge paul and maxine were two of his best and oldest friends yet until this moment they had never met nor as far as rajasinghe knew even communicated there was little reason why they should noone outside taprobane had ever heard of professor sarath but the whole solar system would instantly recognise maxine duval either by sight or by sound his two guests were reclining in the librarys comfortable lounge chairs while rajasinghe sat at the villas main console they were all staring at the fourth figure who was standing motionless too motionless a visitor from the past knowing nothing of the everyday electronic miracles of this age might have decided after a few seconds that he was looking at a superbly detailed wax dummy however more careful examination would have revealed two disconcerting facts the dummy was transparent enough for highlights to be clearly visible through it and its feet blurred out of focus a few centimetres above the carpet do you recognise this man rajasinghe asked ive never seen him in my life sarath replied instantly hed better be important for you to have dragged me back from maharamba we were just about to open the relic chamber i had to leave my trimaran at the beginning of the lake saladin races said maxine duval her famous contralto voice containing just enough annoyance to put anyone less thickskinned than professor sarath neatly in his place and i know him of course does he want to build a bridge from taprobane to hindustan rajasinghe laughed no weve had a perfectly serviceable causeway for two centuries and im sorry to have dragged you both here though you maxine have been promising to come for twenty years true she sighed but i have to spend so much time in my studio that i sometimes forget theres a real world out there occupied by about five thousand dear friends and fifty million intimate acquaintances in which category would you put dr morgan ive met him oh three or four times we did a special interview when the bridge was completed hes a very impressive character coming from maxine duval thought rajasinghe that was tribute indeed for more than thirty years she had been perhaps the most respected member of her exacting profession and had won every honour that it could offer the pulitzer prize the global times trophy the david frost award these were merely the tip of the iceberg and she had only recently returned to active work after two years as walter cronkite professor of electronic journalism at columbia all this had mellowed her though it had not slowed her down she was no longer the sometimes fiery chauvinist who had once remarked since women are better at producing babies presumably nature has given men some talent to compensate but for the moment i cant think of it however she had only recently embarrassed a hapless panel chairman with the loud aside im a newswoman dammit not a newsperson of her femininity there had never been any doubt she had been married four times and her choice of rems was famous whatever their sex remotes were always young and athletic so that they could move swiftly despite the encumbrance of up to twenty kilos of communications gear maxine duvals were invariably very male and very handsome it was an old joke in the trade that all her rems were also rams the jest was completely without rancour for even her fiercest professional rivals liked maxine almost as much as they envied her sorry about the race said rajasinghe but i note that marlin iii won very handily without you i think youll admit that this is rather more important but let morgan speak for himself he released the pause button on the projector and the frozen statue came instantly to life my name is vannevar morgan i am chief engineer of terran constructions land division my last project was the gibraltar bridge now i want to talk about something incomparably more ambitious rajasinghe glanced round the room morgan had hooked them just as he had expected he leaned back in his chair and waited for the now familiar yet still almost unbelievable prospectus to unfold odd he told himself how quickly one accepted the conventions of the display and ignored quite large errors of the tilt and level controls even the fact that morgan moved while staying in the same place and the totally false perspective of exterior scenes failed to destroy the sense of reality the space age is almost two hundred years old for more than half that time our civilisation has been utterly dependent upon the host of satellites that now orbit earth global communications weather forecasting and control land and ocean resources banks postal and information services if anything happened to their spaceborne systems we would sink back into a dark age during the resultant chaos disease and starvation would destroy much of the human race and looking beyond the earth now that we have selfsustaining colonies on mars mercury and the moon and are mining the incalculable wealth of the asteroids we see the beginnings of true interplanetary commerce though it took a little longer than the optimists predicted it is now obvious that the conquest of the air was indeed only a modest prelude to the conquest of space but now we are faced with a fundamental problem an obstacle that stands in the way of all future progress although generations of research have made the rocket the most reliable form of propulsion ever invented space vehicles are still grossly inefficient even worse their effect on the environment is appalling despite all attempts to control approach corridors the noise of takeoff and reentry disturbs millions of people exhaust products dumped in the upper atmosphere have triggered climatic changes which may have very serious results everyone remembers the skincancer crisis of the twenties caused by ultraviolet breakthrough and the astronomical cost of the chemicals needed to restore the ozonosphere yet if we project traffic growth to the end of the century we find that earthtoorbit tonnage must be increased almost fifty percent this cannot be achieved without intolerable costs to our way of life perhaps to our very existence and there is nothing that the rocket engineers can do they have almost reached the absolute limits of performance set by the laws of physics what is the alternative for centuries men have dreamed of antigravity or of spacedrives noone has ever found the slightest hint that such things are possible today we believe that they are only fantasy and yet in the very decade that the first satellite was launched one daring russian engineer conceived a system that would make the rocket obsolete it was years before anyone took yuri artsutanov seriously it has taken two centuries for our technology to match his vision each time he played the recording it seemed to rajasinghe that morgan really came alive at this point it was easy to see why now he was on his own territory no longer relaying information from an alien field of expertise and despite all his reservations and fears rajasinghe could not help sharing some of that enthusiasm it was a quality which nowadays seldom impinged upon his life go out of doors any clear night continued morgan and you will see that commonplace wonder of our age the stars that never rise or set but are fixed motionless in the sky we and our parents and their parents have long taken for granted the synchronous satellites and space stations which move above the equator at the same speed as the turning earth and so hang forever above the same spot the question artsutanov asked himself had the childlike brilliance of true genius a merely clever man could never have thought of it or would have dismissed it instantly as absurd if the laws of celestial mechanics make it possible for an object to stay fixed in the sky might it not be possible to lower a cable down to the surface and so to establish an elevator system linking earth to space there was nothing wrong with the theory but the practical problems were enormous calculations showed that no existing materials would be strong enough the finest steel would snap under its own weight long before it could span the thirtysix thousand kilometres between earth and synchronous orbit however even the best steels were nowhere near the theoretical limits of strength on a microscopic scale materials had been created in the laboratory with far greater breaking strength if they could be massproduced artsutanovs dream could become reality and the economics of space transportation would be utterly transformed before the end of the twentieth century superstrength materials hyperfilaments had begun to emerge from the laboratory but they were extremely expensive costing many times their weight in gold millions of tons would be needed to build a system that could carry all earths outbound traffic so the dream remained a dream until a few months ago now the deepspace factories can manufacture virtually unlimited quantities of hyperfilament at last we can build the space elevator or the orbital tower as i prefer to call it for in a sense it is a tower rising clear through the atmosphere and far far beyond morgan faded out like a ghost that had been suddenly exorcised he was replaced by a footballsized earth slowly revolving moving an armsbreadth above it and keeping always poised above the same spot on the equator a flashing star marked the location of a synchronous satellite from the star two thin lines of light started to extendone directly down towards the earth the other in exactly the opposite direction out into space when you build a bridge continued morgans disembodied voice you start from the two ends and meet in the middle with the orbital tower its the exact opposite you have to build upwards and downwards simultaneously from the synchronous satellite according to a careful programme the trick is to keep the structures centre of gravity always balanced at the stationary point if you dont it will move into the wrong orbit and start drifting slowly round the earth the descending line of light reached the equator at the same moment the outward extension also ceased the total height must be at least forty thousand kilometres and the lowest hundred going down through the atmosphere may be the most critical part for there the tower may be subject to hurricanes it wont be stable until its securely anchored to the ground and then for the first time in history we shall have a stairway to heaven a bridge to the stars a simple elevator system driven by cheap electricity will replace the noisy and expensive rocket which will then be used only for its proper job of deepspace transport heres one possible design for the orbital tower the image of the turning earth vanished as the camera swooped down towards the tower and passed through the walls to reveal the structures crosssection youll see that it consists of four identical tubes two for up traffic two for down think of it as a fourtrack vertical subway or railroad from earth to synchronous orbit capsules for passengers freight fuel would ride up and down the tubes at several thousand kilometres an hour fusion power stations at intervals would provide all the energy needed as ninety percent of it would be recovered the net cost per passenger would be only a few dollars for as the capsules fall earthwards again their motors will act as magnetic brakes generating electricity unlike reentering spacecraft they wont waste all their energy heating up the atmosphere and making sonic booms it will be pumped back into the system you could say that the down trains will power the up ones so even at the most conservative estimate the elevator will be a hundred times more efficient than any rocket and theres virtually no limit to the traffic it could handle for additional tubes could be added as required if the time ever comes when a million people a day wish to visit earth or to leave it the orbital tower could cope with them after all the subways of our great cities once did as much rajasinghe touched a button silencing morgan in midsentence the rest is rather technical he goes on to explain how the tower can act as a cosmic sling and send payloads whipping off to the moon and planets without the use of any rocket power at all but i think youve seen enough to get the general idea my mind is suitably boggled said professor sarath but what on earth or off it has all this to do with me or with you for that matter everything in due time paul any comments maxine perhaps i may yet forgive you this could be one of the stories of the decade or the century but why the hurry not to mention the secrecy theres a lot going on that i dont understand which is where you can help me i suspect that morgans fighting a battle on several fronts hes planning an announcement in the very near future but doesnt want to act until hes quite sure of his ground he gave me that presentation on the understanding that it wouldnt be sent over public circuits thats why i had to ask you here does he know about this meeting of course indeed he was quite happy when i said i wanted to talk to you maxine obviously he trusts you and would like you as an ally and as for you paul i assured him that you could keep a secret for up to six days without apoplexy only if theres a very good reason for it i begin to see light said maxine duval several things have been puzzling me and now theyre starting to make sense first of all this is a space project morgan is chief engineer land so yhu should ask johan think of the bureaucratic infighting when the rocket designers and the aerospace industry get to hear about this trillion dollar empires will be at stake just to start with if hes not very careful morgan will be told thank you very much now well take over nice knowing you i can appreciate that but he has a very good case after all the orbital tower is a building not a vehicle not when the lawyers get hold of it it wont be there arent many buildings whose upper floors are moving at ten kilometres a second or whatever it is faster than the basement you may have a point incidentally when i showed signs of vertigo at the idea of a tower going a good part of the way to the moon dr morgan said then dont think of it as a tower going up think of it as a bridge going out im still trying without much success oh said maxine duval suddenly thats another piece of your jigsaw puzzle the bridge what do you mean did you know that terran constructions chairman that pompous ass senator collins wanted to get the gibraltar bridge named after him i didnt that explains several things but i rather like collins the few times weve met i found him very pleasant and very bright didnt he do some firstrate geothermal engineering in his time that was a thousand years ago and you arent any threat to his reputation he can be nice to you how was the bridge saved from its fate there was a small palace revolution among terrans senior engineering staff dr morgan of course was in no way involved so thats why hes keeping his cards close to his chest im beginning to admire him more and more but now hes come up against an obstacle he doesnt know how to handle he only discovered it a few days ago and its stopped him dead in his tracks let me go on guessing said maxine its good practice helps me to keep ahead of the pack i can see why hes here the earthend of the system has to be on the equator otherwise it cant be vertical it would be like that tower they used to have in pisa before it fell over i dont see said professor sarath waving his arms vaguely up and down oh of course his voice trailed away into a thoughtful silence now continued maxine there are only a limited number of possible sites on the equator its mostly ocean isnt it and taprobanes obviously one of them though i dont see what particular advantages it has over africa or south america or is morgan covering all his bets as usual my dear maxine your powers of deduction are phenomenal youre on the right line but you wont get any further though morgans done his best to explain the problem to me i dont pretend to understand all the scientific details anyway it turns out that africa and south america are not suitable for the space elevator its something to do with unstable points in the earths gravitational field only taprobane will do worse still only one spot in taprobane and that paul is where you come into the picture mamada yelped professor sarath indignantly reverting to taprobani in his surprise yes you to his great annoyance dr morgan has just discovered that the one site he must have is already occupied to put it mildly he wants my advice on dislodging your good friend buddy now it was maxines turn to be baffled who she queried sarath answered at once the venerable anandatissa bodhidharma mahanayake thero incumbent of the sri kanda temple he intoned almost as if chanting a litany so thats what its all about there was silence for a moment then a look of pure mischievous delight appeared on the face of paul sarath emeritus professor of archaeology of the university of taprobane ive always wanted he said dreamily to know exactly what would happen when an irresistible force meets an immovable object the silent princess when his visitors had left in a very thoughtful mood rajasinghe depolarised the library windows and sat for a long time staring out at the trees around the villa and the rock walls of yakkagala looming beyond he had not moved when precisely on the stroke of four the arrival of his afternoon tea jolted him out of his reverie rani he said ask dravindra to get out my heavy shoes if he can find them im going up the rock rani pretended to drop the tray in astonishment ayo mahathaya she keened in mock distress you must be mad remember what doctor mcpherson told you that scots quack always reads my cardiogram backwards anyway my dear what have i got to live for when you and dravindra leave me he spoke not entirely in jest and was instantly ashamed of his selfpity for rani detected it and the tears started in her eyes she turned away so that he could not see her emotion and said in english i did offer to stay at least for dravindras first year i know you did and i wouldnt dream of it unless berkeleys changed since i last saw it hell need you there and whether you take your own degree or not you cant start training too early to be a college presidents wife rani smiled im not sure thats a fate id welcome from some of the horrid examples ive seen she switched back to taprobani you arent really serious are you quite serious not to the top of course only the frescoes its five years since i visited them if i leave it much longer there was no need to complete the sentence rani studied him in silence for a few moments then decided that argument was futile ill tell dravindra she said and jaya in case they have to carry you back very wellthough im sure dravindra could manage that by himself rani gave him a delighted smile mingling pride and pleasure this couple he thought fondly had been his luckiest draw in the state lottery and he hoped that their two years of social service had been as enjoyable to them as it had been to him in this age personal servants were the rarest of luxuries awarded only to men of outstanding merit rajasinghe knew of no other private citizen who had three to conserve his strength he rode a sunpowered trike through the pleasure gardens dravindra and jaya preferred to walk claiming that it was quicker he climbed very slowly pausing several times for breath until he had reached the long corridor of the lower gallery where the mirror wall ran parallel to the face of the rock watched by the usual inquisitive tourists a young archaeologist from one of the african countries was searching the wall for inscriptions with the aid of a powerful oblique light rajasinghe felt like warning her that the chance of making a new discovery was virtually zero paul sarath had spent twenty years going over every square millimetre of the surface and the threevolume takkagala graffiti was a monumental work of scholarship which would never be superseded if only because no other man would ever again be so skilled at reading archaic taprobani inscriptions they had both been young men when paul had begun his lifes work rajasinghe could remember standing at this very spot while the then deputy assistant epigrapher of the department of archaeology had traced out the almost indecipherable marks on the yellow plaster and translated the poems addressed to the beauties on the rock above after all these centuries the lines could still strike echoes in the human heart i am tissa captain of the guard i came fifty leagues to see the doeeyed ones but they would not speak to me is this kind may you remain here for a thousand years like the hare which the king of the gods painted on the moon i am the priest mahinda from the vihara of tuparama that hope had been partly fulfilled partly denied the ladies of the rock had been standing here for twice the time that the cleric had imagined and had survived into an age beyond his uttermost dreams but how few of them were left some of the inscriptions referred to five hundred goldenskinned maidens even allowing for considerable poetic licence it was clear that not onetenth of the original frescoes had escaped the ravages of time or the malevolence of man but the twenty that remained were now safe forever their beauty stored in countless films and tapes and crystals certainly they had outlasted one proud scribe who had thought it quite unnecessary to give his name i ordered the road to be cleared so that pilgrims could see the fair maidens standing on the mountainside i am the king over the years rajasinghe himself the bearer of a royal name and doubtless host to many regal genes had often thought of those words they demonstrated so perfectly the ephemeral nature of power and the futility of ambition i am the king ah but which king the monarch who had stood on these granite flagstones scarcely worn then eighteen hundred years ago was probably an able and intelligent man but he failed to conceive that the time could ever come when he would fade into an anonymity as deep as that of his humblest subjects the attribution was now lost beyond trace at least a dozen kings might have inscribed those haughty lines some had reigned for years some only for weeks and few indeed had died peacefully in their beds noone would ever know if the king who felt it needless to give his name was mahatissa ii or bhatikabhaya or vijayakumara iii or gajabahukagamani or candamukhasiva or moggallana i or kittisena or sirisamghabodhi or some other monarch not even recorded in the long and tangled history of taprobane the attendant operating the little elevator was astonished to see his distinguished visitor and greeted rajasinghe deferentially as the cage slowly ascended the full fifteen metres he remembered how he would once have spurned it for the spiral stairway up which dravindra and jaya were bounding even now in the thoughtless exuberance of youth the elevator clicked to a halt and he stepped on to the small steel platform built out from the face of the cliff below and behind were a hundred metres of empty space but the strong wire mesh gave ample security not even the most determined suicide could escape from the cage large enough to hold a dozen people clinging to the underside of the eternally breaking wave of stone here in this accidental indentation where the rockface formed a shallow cave and so protected them from the elements were the survivors of the kings heavenly court rajasinghe greeted them silently then sank gratefully into the chair that was offered by the official guide i would like he said quietly to be left alone for ten minutes jaya dravindra see if you can head off the tourists his companions looked at him doubtfully so did the guide who was supposed never to leave the frescoes unguarded but as usual ambassador rajasinghe had his way without even raising his voice ayu bowan he greeted the silent figures when he was alone at last im sorry to have neglected you for so long he waited politely for an answer but they paid no more attention to him than to all their other admirers for the last twenty centuries rajasinghe was not discouraged he was used to their indifference indeed it added to their charm i have a problem my dears he continued you have watched all the invaders of taprobane come and go since kalidasas time you have seen the jungle flow like a tide around yakkagala and then retreat before the axe and the plough but nothing has really changed in all those years nature has been kind to little taprobane and so has history it has left her alone now the centuries of quiet may be drawing to a close our land may become the centre of the world of many worlds the great mountain you have watched so long there in the south may be the key to the universe if that is so the taprobane we knew and loved will cease to exist perhaps there is not much that i can do but i have some power to help or to hinder i still have many friends if i wish i can delay this dream or nightmare at least beyond my lifetime should i do so or should i give aid to this man whatever his real motives may be he turned to his favourite the only one who did not avert her eyes when he gazed upon her all the other maidens stared into the distance or examined the flowers in their hands but the one he had loved since his youth seemed from a certain angle to catch his glance ah karuna its not fair to ask you such questions for what could you possibly know of the real worlds beyond the sky or of mens need to reach them even though you were once a goddess kalidasas heaven was only an illusion well whatever strange futures you may see i shall not share them we have known each other a long time by my standards if not by yours while i can i shall watch you from the villa but i do not think that we shall meet again farewell and thank you beautiful ones for all the pleasure you have brought me down the years give my greetings to those who come after me yet as he descended the spiral stairs ignoring the elevator rajasinghe did not feel at all in a valedictory mood on the contrary it seemed to him that he had shed quite a few of his years he could tell that dravindra and jaya had noticed the spring in his step by the way their faces lit up perhaps his retirement had been getting a little dull perhaps both he and taprobane needed a breath of fresh air to blow away the cobwebs just as the monsoon brought renewed life after the months of torpid heavy skies whether morgan succeeded or not his was an enterprise to fire the imagination and stir the soul kalidasa would have envied and approved ii the temple while the different religions wrangle with one another as to which of them is in possession of the truth in our view the truth of religion may be altogether disregarded if one attempts to assign to religion its place in mans evolution it seems not so much to be a lasting acquisition as a parallel to the neurosis which the civilised individual must pass through on his way from childhood to maturity freud new introductory lectures on psychoanalysis of course man made god in his own image but what was the alternative just as a real understanding of geology was impossible until we were able to study other worlds beside earth so a valid theology must await contact with extraterrestrial intelligences there can be no such subject as comparative religion as long as we study only the religions of man el hadj mohammed ben selim professor of comparative religion inaugural address brigham young university we must await not without anxiety the answers to the following questions what if any are the religious concepts of entities with zero one two or more than two parents is religious belief found only among organisms that have close contact with their direct progenitors during their formative years if we find that religion occurs exclusively among intelligent analogs of apes dolphins elephants dogs etc but not among extraterrestrial computers termites fish turtles or social amoebae we may have to draw some painful conclusions perhaps both love and religion can arise only among mammals and for much the same reasons this is also suggested by a study of their pathologies anyone who doubts the connection between religious fanaticism and perversion should take a long hard look at the malleus maleficarium or huxleys the devils of loudon dr charles willis notorious remark that religion is a byproduct of malnutrition is not in itself much more helpful than gregory batesons somewhat indelicate onesyllable refutation what dr willis apparently meant was the hallucinations caused by voluntary or involuntary starvation are readily interpreted as religious visions hunger in this life encourages belief in a compensatory afterlife as a perhaps essential psychological survival mechanism it is indeed one of the ironies of fate that research into the socalled consciousnessexpanding drugs proved that they did exactly the opposite by leading to the detection of the naturally occurring apothetic chemicals in the brain the discovery that the most devout adherent of any faith could be converted to any other by a judicious dose of orthoparatheosamine was perhaps the most devastating blow ever received by religion until of course the advent of starglider r gabor the pharmacological basis of religion starglider something of the sort had been expected for a hundred years and there had been many false alarms yet when it finally happened mankind was taken by surprise the radio signal from the direction of alpha centauri was so powerful that it was first detected as interference on normal commercial circuits this was highly embarrassing to all the radio astronomers who for so many decades had been seeking intelligent messages from space especially as they had long ago dismissed the triple system of alpha beta and proxima centauri from all serious consideration at once every radio telescope that could scan the southern hemisphere was focused upon centaurus within hours a still more sensational discovery was made the signal was not coming from the centaurus system at all but from a point half a degree away and it was moving that was the first hint of the truth when it was confirmed all the normal business of mankind came to a halt the power of the signal was no longer surprising its source was already well inside the solar system and moving sunward at six hundred kilometres a second the longawaited longfeared visitors from space had arrived at last yet for thirty days the intruder did nothing as it fell past the outer planets broadcasting an unvarying series of pulses that merely announced here i am it made no attempt to answer the signals beamed at it nor did it make any adjustments to its natural cometlike orbit unless it had slowed down from some much higher speed its voyage from centaurus must have lasted two thousand years some found this reassuring since it suggested that the visitor was a robot spaceprobe others were disappointed feeling that the absence of real live extraterrestrials would be an anticlimax the whole spectrum of possibilities was argued ad nauseam in all the media of communications all the parliaments of man every plot that had ever been used in science fiction from the arrival of benevolent gods to an invasion of bloodsucking vampires was disinterred and solemnly analysed lloyds of london collected substantial premiums from people insuring against every possible future including some in which there would have been very little chance of collecting a penny then as the alien passed the orbit of jupiter mans instruments began to learn something about it the first discovery created a shortlived panic the object was five hundred kilometres in diameter the size of a small moon perhaps after all it was a mobile world carrying an invading army this fear vanished when more precise observations showed that the solid body of the intruder was only a few metres across the fivehundredkilometre halo around it was something very familiar a flimsy slowly revolving parabolic reflector the exact equivalent of the astronomers orbiting radio telescopes presumably this was the antenna through which the visitor kept in touch with its distant base and through which even now it was doubtless beaming back its discoveries as it scanned the solar system and eavesdropped upon all the radio tv and data broadcasts of mankind then came yet another surprise that asteroidsized antenna was not pointed in the direction of alpha centauri but towards a totally different part of the sky it began to look as if the centauri system was merely the vehicles last port of call not its origin the astronomers were still brooding over this when they had a remarkable stroke of luck a solar weather probe on routine patrol beyond mars became suddenly dumb then recovered its radio voice a minute later when the records were examined it was found that the instruments had been momentarily paralysed by intense radiation the probe had cut right across the visitors beam and it was then a simple matter to calculate precisely where it was aimed there was nothing in that direction for fiftytwo lightyears except a very faint and presumably very old red dwarf star one of those abstemious little suns that would still be shining peacefully billions of years after the galaxys splendid giants had burned themselves out no radio telescope had ever examined it closely now all those that could be spared from the approaching visitor were focused upon its suspected origin and there it was beaming a sharplytuned signal in the one centimetre band the makers were still in contact with the vehicle they had launched thousands of years ago but the messages it must be receiving now were from only half a century in the past then as it came within the orbit of mars the visitor showed its first awareness of mankind in the most dramatic and unmistakable way that could be imagined it started transmitting standard line television pictures interleaved with video text in fluent though stilted english and mandarin the first cosmic conversation had begun and not as had always been imagined with a delay of decades but only of minutes shadow at dawn morgan had left his hotel in ranapura at four am on a clear moonless night he was not too happy about the choice of time but professor sarath who had made all the arrangements had promised him that it would be well worthwhile you wont understand anything about sri kanda he had said unless you have watched the dawn from the summit and buddy er the maha thero wont receive visitors at any other time he says its a splendid way of discouraging the merely curious so morgan had acquiesced with as much good grace as possible to make matters worse the taprobanean driver had persisted in carrying on a brisk though rather onesided conversation apparently designed to establish a complete profile of his passengers personality this was all done with such ingenuous good nature that it was impossible to take offence but morgan would have preferred silence he also wished sometimes devoutly that his driver would pay rather more attention to the countless hairpin bends round which they zipped in the neardarkness perhaps it was just as well that he could not see all the cliffs and chasms they were negotiating as the car climbed up through the foothill this road was a triumph of nineteenthcentury military engineering the work of the last colonial power built in the final campaign against the proud mountain folk of the interior but it had never been converted to automatic operation and there were times when morgan wondered if he would survive the journey and then suddenly he forgot his fears and his annoyance at the loss of sleep there it is said the driver proudly as the car rounded the flank of a hill sri kanda itself was still completely invisible in a darkness which as yet bore no hint of the approaching dawn its presence was revealed by a thin ribbon of light zigzagging back and forth under the stars hanging as if by magic in the sky morgan knew that he was merely seeing the lamps set two hundred years ago to guide pilgrims as they ascended the longest stairway in the world but in its defiance of logic and gravity it appeared almost a prevision of his own dream ages before he was born inspired by philosophers he could barely imagine men had begun the work he hoped to finish they had quite literally built the first crude steps on the road to the stars no longer feeling drowsy morgan watched as the band of light grew closer and resolved itself into a necklace of innumerable twinkling beads now the mountain was becoming visible as a black triangle eclipsing half the sky there was something sinister about its silent brooding presence morgan could almost imagine that it was indeed the abode of gods who knew of his mission and were gathering their strength against him these ominous thoughts were entirely forgotten when they arrived at the cable car terminus and morgan discovered to his surprise it was still only five am that at least a hundred people were milling around in the little waitingroom he ordered a welcome hot coffee for himself and his garrulous driver who rather to his relief showed no interest in making the ascent ive done it at least twenty times he said with perhaps exaggerated boredom im going to sleep in the car until you come down morgan purchased his ticket did a quick calculation and estimated that he would be in the third or fourth load of passengers he was glad that he had taken saraths advice and slipped a thermocloak in his pocket at a mere twokilometre altitude it was already quite cold at the summit three kilometres higher still it must be freezing as he slowly shuffled forward in the rather subdued and sleepy line of visitors morgan noted with amusement that he was the only one not carrying a camera where were the genuine pilgrims he wondered then he remembered they would not be here there was no easy way to heaven or nirvana or whatever it was that the faithful sought merit was acquired solely by ones own efforts not with the aid of machines an interesting doctrine and one containing much truth but there were also times when only machines could do the job at last he got a seat in the car and with a considerable creaking of cables they were on their way once again morgan felt that eerie sense of anticipation the elevator he was planning would hoist loads more than ten thousand times as high as this primitive system which probably dated right back to the twentieth century and yet when all was said and done its basic principles were very much the same outside the swaying car was total darkness except when a section of the illuminated stairway came into view it was completely deserted as if the countless millions who had toiled up the mountain during the last three thousand years had left no successor but then morgan realised that those making the ascent on foot would already be far above on their appointment with the dawn they would have left the lower slopes of the mountain hours ago at the fourkilometre level the passengers had to change cars and walk a short distance to another cablestation but the transfer involved little delay now morgan was indeed glad of his cloak and wrapped its metallised fabric closely round his body there was frost underfoot and already he was breathing deeply in the thin air he was not at all surprised to see racks of oxygen cylinders in the small terminus with instructions for their use prominently displayed and now at last as they began the final ascent there came the first intimation of the approaching day the eastern stars still shone with undiminished glory venus most brilliantly of all but a few thin high clouds began to glow faintly with the coming dawn morgan looked anxiously at his watch and wondered if he would be in time he was relieved to see that daybreak was still thirty minutes away one of the passengers suddenly pointed to the immense stairway sections of which were occasionally visible beneath them as it zigzagged back and forth up the mountains now rapidly steepening slopes it was no longer deserted moving with dreamlike slowness dozens of men and women were toiling painfully up the endless steps every minute more and more came into view for how many hours morgan wondered had they been climbing certainly all through the night and perhaps much longerfor many of the pilgrims were quite elderly and could hardly have managed the ascent in a single day he was surprised to see that so many still believed a moment later he saw the first monk a tall saffronrobed figure moving with a gait of metronomelike regularity looking neither to the right nor to the left and completely ignoring the car floating above his shaven head he also appeared capable of ignoring the elements for his right arm and shoulder were bare to the freezing wind the cable car was slowing down as it approached the terminus presently it made a brief halt disgorged its numbed passengers and set off again on its long descent morgan joined the crowd of two or three hundred people huddling in a small amphitheatre cut in the western face of the mountain they were all staring out into the darkness though there was nothing to see but the ribbon of light winding down into the abyss some belated climbers on the last section of the stairway were making a final effort as faith strove to overcome fatigue morgan looked again at his watch ten minutes to go he had never before been among so many silent people cameratouting tourists and devout pilgrims were united now in the same hope the weather was perfect soon they would all know if they had made this journey in vain there came a delicate tinkling of bells from the temple still invisible in the darkness a hundred metres above their heads and at the same instant all the lights along that unbelievable stairway were extinguished now they could see as they stood with their backs towards the hidden sunrise that the first faint gleam of day lay on the clouds far below but the immense bulk of the mountain still delayed the approaching dawn second by second the light was growing on either side of sri kanda as the sun outflanked the last strongholds of the night then there came a low murmur of awe from the patiently waiting crowd one moment there was nothing then suddenly it was there stretching half the width of taprobane a perfectly symmetrical sharpedged triangle of deepest blue the mountain had not forgotten its worshippers there lay its famous shadow across the sea of clouds a symbol for each pilgrim to interpret as he wished it seemed almost solid in its rectilinear perfection like some overturned pyramid rather than a mere phantom of light and shade as the brightness grew around it and the first direct rays of the sun struck past the flanks of the mountain it appeared by contrast to grow even darker and denser yet through the thin veil of cloud responsible for its brief existence morgan could dimly discern the lakes and hills and forests of the awakening land the apex of that misty triangle must be racing towards him at enormous speed as the sun rose vertically behind the mountain yet morgan was conscious of no movement time seemed to have been suspended this was one of the rare moments of his life when he gave no thought to the passing minutes the shadow of eternity lay upon his soul as did that of the mountain upon the clouds now it was fading swiftly the darkness draining from the sky like a stain dispersing in water the ghostly glimmering landscape below was hardening into reality halfway to the horizon there was an explosion of light as the suns rays struck upon some buildings eastern windows and even beyond that unless his eyes had tricked him morgan could make out the faint dark band of the encircling sea another day had come to taprobane slowty the visitors dispersed some returned to the cablecar terminus while others more energetic headed for the stairway in the mistaken belief that the descent was easier than the climb most of them would be thankful enough to catch the car again at the lower station few indeed would make it all the way down only morgan continued upwards followed by many curious glances along the short flight of steps that led to the monastery and to the very summit of the mountain by the time he had reached the smoothlyplastered outer wall now beginning to glow softly in the first direct rays of the sun he was very short of breath and was glad to lean for a moment against the massive wooden door someone must have been watching before he could find a bellpush or signal his presence in any way the door swung silently open and he was welcomed by a yellowrobed monk who saluted him with clasped hands ayu bowan dr morgan the mahanayake thero will be glad to see you the education of starglider we now know that the interstellar spaceprobe generally referred to as starglider is completely autonomous operating according to general instructions programmed into it sixty thousand years ago while it is cruising between suns it uses its fivehundredkilometre antenna to send back information to its base at a relatively slow rate and to receive occasional updates from starholme to adopt the lovely name coined by the poet liwellyn ap cymru while it is passing through a solar system however it is able to tap the energy of a sun and so its rate of information transfer increases enormously it also recharges its batteries to use a doubtless crude analogy and since like our own early pioneers and voyagers it employs the gravitational fields of the heavenly bodies to deflect it from star to star it will operate indefinitely unless mechanical failure or cosmic accident terminates its career centaurus was its eleventh port of call after it had rounded our sun like a comet its new course was aimed precisely at tau ceti twelve light years away if there is anyone there it will be ready to start its next conversation soon after ad for starglider combines the functions both of ambassador and explorer when at the end of one of its millennial journeys it discovers a technological culture it makes friends with the natives and starts to trade information in the only form of interstellar commerce that may ever be possible and before it departs again on its endless voyage after its brief transit of their solar system starglider gives the location of its home world already awaiting a direct call from the newest member of the galactic telephone exchange in our case we can take some pride in the fact that even before it had transmitted any star charts we had identified its parent sun and even beamed our first transmissions to it now we have only to wait years for an answer how incredibly lucky we are to have neighbours so close at hand it was obvious from its very first messages that starglider understood the meaning of several thousand basic english and chinese words which it had deduced from an analysis of television radio and especially broadcast videotext services but what it had picked up during its approach was a very unrepresentative sample from the whole spectrum of human culture it contained little advanced science still less advanced mathematics and only a random selection of literature music and the visual arts like any selftaught genius therefore starglider had huge gaps in its education on the principle that it was better to give too much than too little as soon as contact was established starglider was presented with the oxford english dictionary the great chinese dictionary and the encyclopaedia terrae their digital transmission required little more than fifty minutes and it was notable that immediately thereafter starglider was silent for almost four hours its longest period off the air when it resumed contact its vocabulary was immensely enlarged and for over percent of the time it could pass the turing test with ease ie there was no way of telling from the messages received that starglider was a machine and not a highly intelligent human there were occasional giveaways for example incorrect use of ambiguous words and the absence of emotional content in the dialogue this was only to be expected unlike advanced terrestrial computers which could replicate the emotions of their builders when necessary stargliders feelings and desires were presumably those of a totally alien species and therefore largely incomprehensible to man and of course vice versa starglider could understand precisely and completely what was meant by the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides but it could scarcely have the faintest glimmer of what lay in keats mind when he wrote charmed magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn still less shall i compare thee to a summers day thou art more lovely and more temperate nevertheless in the hope of correcting this deficiency starglider was also presented with thousands of hours of music drama and scenes from terrestrial life both human and otherwise by general agreement a certain amount of censorship was enforced here although mankinds propensity for violence and warfare could hardly be denied only a few carefully selected examples were broadcast and until starglider was safely out of range the normal fare of the video networks was uncharacteristically bland for centuries perhaps indeed until it had reached its next target philosophers would be debating stargliders real understanding of human affairs and problems but on one point there was no serious disagreement the hundred days of its passage through the solar system altered irrevocably mens views of the universe its origin and their place in it human civilisation could never be the same after starglider had gone bodhidharma as the massive door carved with intricate lotus patterns clicked softly shut behind him morgan felt that he had entered another world this was by no means the first time he had been on ground once sacred to some great religion he had seen notre dame saint sophia stonehenge the parthenon karnak saint pauls and at least a dozen other major temples and mosques but he had viewed them all as frozen relics of the past splendid examples of art or engineering but with no relevance to the modern mind the faiths that had created and sustained them had all passed into oblivion though some had survived until well into the twentysecond century but here it seemed time had stood still the hurricanes of history had blown past this lonely citadel of faith leaving it unshaken as they had done for three thousand years the monks still prayed and meditated and watched the dawn during his walk across the worn flagstones of the courtyard polished smooth by the feet of innumerable pilgrims morgan experienced a sudden and wholly uncharacteristic indecision in the name of progress he was attempting to destroy something ancient and noble and something that he would never fully understand the sight of the great bronze bell hanging in a campanile that grew out of the monastery wall stopped morgan in his tracks instantly his engineers mind had estimated its weight at not less than five tons and it was obviously very old how on earth the monk noticed his curiosity and gave a smile of understanding two thousand years old he said it was a gift from kalidasa the accursed which we felt it expedient not to refuse according to legend it took ten years to carry it up the mountain and the lives of a hundred men when is it used asked morgan after he had digested this information because of its hateful origin it is sounded only in time of disaster i have never heard it nor has any living man it tolled once without human aid during the great earthquake of and the time before that was when the iberian invaders burned the temple of the tooth and seized the sacred relic so after all that effort its never been used perhaps a dozen times in the last two thousand years kalidasas doom still lies upon it that might be good religion morgan could not help thinking but hardly sound economics and he wondered irreverently how many monks had succumbed to the temptation of tapping the bell ever so gently just to hear for themselves the unknown timbre of its forbidden voice they were walking now past a huge boulder up which a short flight of steps led to a gilded pavilion this morgan realised was the very summit of the mountain he knew what the shrine was supposed to hold but once again the monk enlightened him the footprint he said the muslims believed it was adams he stood here after he was expelled from paradise the hindus attributed it to siva or saman but to the buddhists of course it was the imprint of the enlightened one i notice your use of the past tense morgan answered in a carefully neutral voice what is the belief now the monks face showed no emotion as he replied the buddha was a man like you and me the impression in the rock and it is very hard rock is two metres long that seemed to settle the matter and morgan had no further questions while he was led along a short cloister that ended at an open door the monk knocked but did not wait for any response as he waved the visitor to enter morgan had halfexpected to find the mahanayake thero sitting crosslegged on a mat probably surrounded by incense and chanting acolytes there was indeed just a hint of incense in the chill air but the chief incumbent of the sri kanda vihare sat behind a perfectly ordinary office desk equipped with standard display and memory units the only unusual item in the room was the head of the buddha slightly larger than life on a plinth in one corner morgan could not tell whether it was real or merely a projection despite his conventional setting there was little likelihood that the head of the monastery would be mistaken for any other type of executive quite apart from the inevitable yellow robe the mahanayake thero had two other characteristics that in this age were very rare indeed he was completely bald and he was wearing spectacles both morgan assumed were by deliberate choice since baldness could be so easily cured that shining ivory dome must have been shaved or depilated and he could not remember when he had last seen spectacles except in historical recordings or dramas the combination was fascinating and disconcerting morgan found it virtually impossible to guess the mahanayake theros age it could be anything from a mature forty to a wellpreserved eighty and those lenses transparent though they were somehow concealed the thoughts and emotions behind them ayu bowan dr morgan said the prelate gesturing his visitor to the only empty chair this is my secretary the venerable parakarma i trust you wont mind if he makes notes of course not said morgan inclining his head towards the remaining occupant of the small room he noticed that the younger monk had flowing hair and an impressive beard presumably shaven pates were optional so dr morgan the mahanayake thero continued you want our mountain im afraid so your er reverence part of it at any rate out of all the world these few hectares the choice is not ours but natures the earth terminus has to be on the equator and at the greatest possible altitude where the low air density maintains wind forces there are higher equatorial mountains in africa and south america here we go again morgan groaned silently bitter experience had shown him that it was almost impossible to make laymen however intelligent and interested appreciate this problem and he anticipated even less success with these monks if only the earth was a nice symmetrical body with no dents and bumps in its gravitational field believe me he said fervently weve looked at all the alternatives cotopaxi and mount kenya and even kilimanjaro though thats three degrees southwould be fine except for one fatal flaw when a satellite is established in the stationary orbit it wont stay exactly over the same spot because of gravitational irregularities which i wont go into it will slowly drift along the equator so all our synchronous satellites and spacestations have to burn propellent to keep them on station luckily the amount involved is quite small but you cant keep nudging millions of tons especially when its in the form of slender rod tens of thousands of kilometres long back into position and theres no need to fortunately for us not for us interjected the mahanayake thero almost throwing morgan off his stride there are two stable points on the synchronous orbit a satellite placed at them will stay there it wont drift away just as if its stuck at the bottom of an invisible valley one of those points is out over the pacific so its no use to us the other is directly above our heads surely a few kilometres one way or the other would make no difference there are other mountains in taprobane none more than half the height of sri kanda which brings us down to the level of critical wind forces true there are not many hurricanes exactly on the equator but there are enough to endanger the structure at its very weakest point we can control the winds it was the first contribution the young secretary had made to the discussion and morgan looked at him with heightened interest to some extent yes naturally i have discussed this point with monsoon control they say that absolute certainty is out of the question especially with hurricanes the best odds they will give me are fifty to one thats not good enough for a trillion dollar project the venerable parakarma seemed inclined to argue there is an almost forgotten branch of mathematics called catastrophe theory which could make meteorology a really precise science i am confident that i should explain the mahanayake thero interjected blandly that my colleague was once rather celebrated for his astronomical work i imagine you have heard of dr choam goldberg morgan felt that a trapdoor had been suddenly opened beneath him he should have been warned then he recalled that professor sarath had indeed told him with a twinkle in his eye that he should watch out for buddys private secretary hes a very smart character morgan wondered if his cheeks were burning as the venerable parakarma alias dr choam goldberg looked back at him with a distinctly unfriendly expression so he had been trying to explain orbital instabilities to these innocent monks the mahanayake thero had probably received much better briefing on the subject than he had done and he remembered that the worlds scientists were neatly divided on the subject of dr goldberg those who were sure that he was crazy and those who had not yet made up their minds for he had been one of the most promising young men in the field of astrophysics when five years ago he had announced now that starglider has effectively destroyed all traditional religions we can at last pay serious attention to the concept of god and with that he had disappeared from public view conversations with starglider of all the thousands of questions put to starglider during its transit of the solar system those whose answers were most eagerly awaited concerned the living creatures and civilisations of other stars contrary to some expectations the robot answered willingly though it admitted that its last update on the subject had been received over a century ago considering the immense range of cultures produced on earth by a single species it was obvious that there would be even greater variety among the stars where every conceivable type of biology might occur several thousand hours of fascinating often incomprehensible sometimes horrifying scenes of life on other planets left no doubt that this was the case nevertheless the starholmers had managed a rough classification of cultures according to their standards of technology perhaps the only objective basis possible humanity was interested to discover that it came number five on a scale which was defined approximately by stone tools metals fire writing handicrafts ships steam power basic science atomic energy space travel when starglider had begun its mission sixty thousand years ago its builders were like the human race still in category five they had now graduated to six characterised by the ability to convert matter completely into energy and to transmute all elements on an industrial scale and is there a class seven starglider was immediately asked the reply was a brief affirmative when pressed for details the probe explained i am not allowed to describe the technology of a higher grade culture to a lower one there the matter remained right up to the moment of the final message despite all the leading questions designed by the most ingenious legal brains of earth for by this time starglider was more than a match for any terrestrial logician this was partly the fault of the university of chicagos department of philosophy in a fit of monumental hubris it had clandestinely transmitted the whole of the summa theologica with disastrous results june gmt message sequence starglider to earth i have analysed the arguments of your saint thomas aquinas as requested in your message sequence of june gmt most of the content appears to be sensefree random noise and so devoid of information but the printout that follows lists fallacies expressed in the symbolic logic of your reference mathematics of may gmt fallacy i as the log timings show it took starglider rather less than an hour to demolish saint thomas although philosophers were to spend the next several decades arguing over the analysis they found only two errors and even those could have been due to a misunderstanding of terminology it would have been most interesting to know what fraction of its processing circuits starglider applied to this task unfortunately noone thought of asking before the probe had switched to cruise mode and broken contact by then even more deflating messages had been received june gmt message sequence starglider to earth i am unable to distinguish clearly between your religious ceremonies and apparently identical behaviour at the sporting and cultural functions you have transmitted to me i refer you particularly to the beatles the world soccer final and the farewell appearance of the johann sebastian clones june gmt message sequence starglider to earth my last update on this matter is years old but if i understand you correctly the answer is as follows behaviour of the type you call religious occurred among of the known class one cultures of the class two cultures of the class three cultures of the class four cultures and of the class five cultures you will appreciate that we have many more examples of class five because only they can be detected over astronomical distances june gmt message sequence starglider to earth you are correct in deducing that the class five cultures that engaged in religious activities all had twoparent reproduction and the young remained in family groups for a large fraction of their lifetime how did you arrive at this conclusion june gmt message sequence starglider to earth the hypothesis you refer to as god though not disprovable by logic alone is unnecessary for the following reason if you assume that the universe can be quote explained unquote as the creation of an entity known as god he must obviously be of a higher degree of organisation than his product thus you have more than doubled the size of the original problem and have taken the first step on a diverging infinite regress william of ockham pointed out as recently as your fourteenth century that entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily i cannot therefore understand why this debate continues june gmt message sequence starglider to earth starholme informed me years ago that the origin of the universe has been discovered but that i do not have the appropriate circuits to comprehend it you must communicate direct for further information i am now switching to cruise mode and must break contact goodbye in the opinion of many that final and most famous of all its thousands of messages proved that starglider had a sense of humour for why else would it have waited until the very end to explode such a philosophical bombshell or was the entire conversation all part of a careful plan designed to put the human race in the right frame of reference when the first direct messages from starholme arrived in presumably years there were some who suggested following starglider since it was carrying out of the solar system not only immeasurable stores of knowledge but the treasures of a technology centuries ahead of anything possessed by man although no spaceship now existed that could overtake starglider and return again to earth after matching its enormous velocity one could certainly be built however wiser councils prevailed even a robot spaceprobe might have very effective defences against boarders including as a last resort the ability to selfdestruct but the most telling argument was that its builders were only fiftytwo light years away during the millennia since they had launched starglider their spacefaring ability must have improved enormously if the human race did anything to provoke them they might arrive slightly annoyed in a very few hundred years meanwhile among all its countless other effects upon human culture starglider had brought to its climax a process that was already well under way it had put an end to the billions of words of pious gibberish with which apparently intelligent men had addled their minds for centuries parakarma as he quickly checked back on his conversation morgan decided that he had not made a fool of himself indeed the mahanayake thero might have lost a tactical advantage by revealing the identity of the venerable parakarma yet it was no particular secret perhaps he thought that morgan already knew at this point there was a rather welcome interruption as two young acolytes filed into the office one carrying a tray loaded with small dishes of rice fruits and what appeared to be thin pancakes while the other followed with the inevitable pot of tea there was nothing that looked like meat after his long night morgan would have welcomed a couple of eggs but he assumed that they too were forbidden no that was too strong a word sarath had told him that the order prohibited nothing believing in no absolutes but it had a nicely calibrated scale of toleration and the taking of life even potential life was very low on the list as he started to sample the various items most of them quite unknown to him morgan looked enquiringly at the mahanayake thero who shook his head we do not eat before noon the mind functions more clearly in the morning hours and so should not be distracted by material things as he nibbled at some quite delicious papaya morgan considered the philosophical gulf represented by that simple statement to him an empty stomach could be very distracting indeed completely inhibiting the higher mental functions having always been blessed with good health he had never tried to dissociate mind and body and saw no reason why one should make the attempt while morgan was eating his exotic breakfast the mahanayake thero excused himself and for a few minutes his fingers danced with dazzling speed over the keyboard of his console as the readout was in full view politeness compelled morgan to look elsewhere inevitably his eyes fell upon the head of the buddha it was probably real for the plinth cast a faint shadow on the wall behind yet even that was not conclusive the plinth might be solid enough and the head a projection carefully positioned on top of it the trick was a common one here like the mona lisa was a work of art that both mirrored the emotions of the observer and imposed its own authority upon them but la giocondas eyes were open though what they were looking at noone would ever know the eyes of the buddha were completely blank empty pools in which a man might lose his soul or discover a universe upon the lips there lingered a smile even more ambiguous than the mona lisas yet was it indeed a smile or merely a trick of the lighting already it was gone replaced by an expression of superhuman tranquillity morgan could not tear his eyes away from that hypnotic countenance and only the familiar rustling whirr of a hardcopy readout from the console brought him back to reality if this was reality i thought you might like a souvenir of your visit said the mahanayake thero as morgan accepted the proffered sheet he was surprised to see that it was archival quality parchment not the usual flimsy paper destined to be thrown away after a few hours of use he could not read a single word except for an unobtrusive alphanumeric reference in the bottom lefthand corner it was all in the flowery curlicues which he could now recognise as taprobani script thank you he said with as much irony as he could muster what is it he had a very good idea legal documents had a close family resemblance whatever their languages or eras a copy of the agreement between king ravindra and the maha sangha dated vesak ad of your calendar it defines the ownership of the temple land in perpetuity the rights set out in this document were even recognised by the invaders by the caledonians and the hollanders i believe but not by the iberians if the mahanayake thero was surprised by the thoroughness of morgans briefing not even the twitch of an eyebrow betrayed the fact they were hardly respecters of law and order particularly where other religions were concerned i trust that their philosophy of might equals right does not appeal to you morgan gave a somewhat forced smile it certainly does not he answered but where did one draw the line he asked himself silently when the overwhelming interests of great organizations were at stake conventional morality often took second place the best legal minds on earth human and electronic would soon be focused upon this spot if they could not find the right answers a very unpleasant situation might develop one which could make him a villain not a hero since you have raised the subject of the agreement let me remind you that it refers only to the land inside the temple boundaries which are clearly defined by the walls correct but they enclose the entire summit you have no control over the ground outside this area we have the rights of any owner of property if the neighbours create a nuisance we would have legal redress this is not the first time the point has been raised i know in connexion with the cablecar system a faint smile played over the maha theros lips you have done your homework he commended yes we opposed it vigorously for a number of reasons though i admit that now it is here we have often been very thankful for it he paused thoughtfully then added there have been some problems but we have been able to coexist casual sightseers and tourists are content to stay on the lookout platform genuine pilgrims of course we are always happy to welcome at the summit then perhaps some accommodation could be worked out in this case a few hundred metres of altitude would make no difference to us we could leave the summit untouched and carve out another plateau like the cable car terminus morgan felt distinctly uncomfortable under the prolonged scrutiny of the two monks he had little doubt that they recognized the absurdity of the suggestion but for the sake of the record he had to make it you have a most peculiar sense of humour dr morgan the mahanayake thero replied at last what would be left of the spirit of the mountain of the solitude we have sought for three thousand years if this monstrous device is erected here do you expect us to betray the faith of all the millions who have come to this sacred spot often at the cost of their health even their lives i sympathise with your feelings morgan answered we would of course do our best to minimise any disturbance all the support facilities would be buried inside the mountain only the elevator would emerge and from any distance it would be quite invisible the general aspect of the mountain would be totally unchanged even your famous shadow which i have just admired would be virtually unaffected the mahanayake thero turned to his colleague as if seeking confirmation the venerable parakarma looked straight at morgan and said what about noise damn morgan thought my weakest point the payloads would emerge from the mountain at several hundred kilometres an hour the more velocity they could be given by the groundbased system the less the strain on the suspended tower of course passengers couldnt take more than half a gee or so but the capsules would still pop out at a substantial fraction of the speed of sound there will be some aerodynamic noise morgan admitted but nothing like that near a large airport very reassuring said the mahanayake thero morgan was certain that he was being sarcastic yet could detect no trace of irony in his voice he was either displaying an olympian calm or testing his visitors reactions the younger monk on the other hand made no attempt to conceal his anger for years he said with indignation we have been protesting about the disturbance caused by reentering spacecraft now you want to generate shock waves in in our back garden our operations will not be transonic at this altitude morgan replied firmly and the tower structure will absorb most of the sound energy in fact he added trying to press what he had suddenly seen as an advantage in the long run well help to eliminate reentry booms the mountain will actually be a quieter place i understand instead of occasional concussions we shall have a steady roar im not getting anywhere with this character thought morgan and id expected the mahanayake thero to be the biggest obstacle sometimes it was best to change the subject entirely he decided to dip one cautious toe into the quaking quagmire of theology isnt there something appropriate he said earnestly in what we are trying to do our purposes may be different but the net results have much in common what we hope to build is only an extension of your stairway if i may say so were continuing it all the way to heaven for a moment the venerable parakarma seemed taken aback at such effrontery before he could recover his superior answered smoothly an interesting concept but our philosophy does not believe in heaven such salvation as may exist can be found only in this world and i sometimes wonder at your anxiety to leave it do you know the story of the tower of babel vaguely i suggest you look it up in the old christian bible genesis ii that too was an engineering project to scale the heavens it failed owing to difficulties in communication though we shall have our problems i dont think that will be one of them but looking at the venerable parakarma morgan was not so sure here was a communications gap which seemed in some ways greater than that between homo sapiens and starglider they spoke the same language but there were gulfs of incomprehension which might never be spanned may i ask continued the mahanayake with imperturbable politeness how successful you were with the department of parks and forests they were extremely cooperative i am not surprised they are chronically underbudgeted and any new source of revenue would be welcome the cable system was a financial windfall and doubtless they hope your project will be an even bigger one they will be right and they have accepted the fact that it wont create any environmental hazards suppose it falls down morgan looked the venerable monk straight in the eye it wont he said with all the authority of the man whose inverted rainbow now linked two continents but he knew and the implacable parakarma must also know that absolute certainty was impossible in such matters two hundred and two years ago on november that lesson had been driven home in a way that no engineer could ever forget morgan had few nightmares but that was one of them even at this moment the computers at terran construction were trying to exorcise it but all the computing power in the universe could provide no protection against the problems he had not foreseen the nightmares that were still unborn the golden butterflies despite the brilliant sunlight and the magnificent views that assailed him on every side morgan was fast asleep before the car had descended into the lowlands even the innumerable hairpin bends failed to keep him awake but he was suddenly snapped back into consciousness when the brakes were slammed on and he was pitched forward against his seatbelt for a moment of utter confusion he thought that he must still be dreaming the breeze blowing gently through the halfopen windows was so warm and humid that it might have escaped from a turkish bath yet the car had apparently come to a halt in the midst of a blinding snowstorm morgan blinked screwed up his eyes and opened them to reality this was the first time he had ever seen golden snow a dense swarm of butterflies was crossing the road headed due east in a steady purposeful migration some had been sucked into the car and fluttered around frantically until morgan waved them out many more had plastered themselves on the windscreen with what were doubtless a few choice taprobani expletives the driver emerged and wiped the glass clear by the time he had finished the swarm had thinned out to a handful of isolated stragglers did they tell you about the legend he asked glancing back at his passenger no said morgan curtly he was not at all interested being anxious to resume his interrupted nap the golden butterflies theyre the souls of kalidasas warriors the army he lost at yakkagala morgan gave an unenthusiastic grunt hoping that the driver would get the message but he continued remorselessly every year around this time they head for the mountain and they all die on its lower slopes sometimes youll meet them halfway up the cable ride but thats the highest they get which is lucky for the vihara the vihara asked morgan sleepily the temple if they ever reach it kalidasa will have conquered and the bhikkus the monks will have to leave thats the prophecy its carved on a stone slab in the ranapura museum i can show it to you some other time said morgan hastily as he settled back into the padded seat but it was many kilometres before he could doze off again for there was something haunting about the image that the driver had conjured up he would remember it often in the months ahead when waking and in moments of stress or crisis once again he would be immersed in that golden snowstorm as the doomed millions spent their energies in a vain assault upon the mountain and all that it symbolised even now at the very beginning of his campaign the image was too close for comfort by the shores of lake saladin almost all the alternative history computer simulations suggest that the battle of tours was one of the crucial disasters of mankind had charles martel been defeated islam might have resolved the internal differences that were tearing it apart and gone on to conquer europe thus centuries of christian barbarism would have been avoided the industrial revolution would have started almost a thousand years earlier and by now we would have reached the nearer stars instead of merely the further planets but fate ruled otherwise and the armies of the prophet turned back into africa islam lingered on a fascinating fossil until the end of the twentieth century then abruptly it was dissolved in oil did you know said sheik farouk abdullah that i have now appointed myself grand admiral of the sahara fleet it wouldnt surprise me mr president morgan answered as he gazed out across the sparkling blue expanse of lake saladin if its not a naval secret how many ships do you have ten at the moment the largest is a thirtymetre hydroskimmer run by the red crescent it spends every weekend rescuing incompetent sailors my people still arent much good on the water look at that idiot trying to tack after all two hundred years really isnt long enough to switch from camels to boats you had cadillacs and rollsroyces in between surely that should have eased the transition and we still have them my greatgreatgreatgrandfathers silver ghost is just as good as new but i must be fair its the visitors who get into trouble trying to cope with our local winds we stick to powerboats and next year im getting a submarine guaranteed to reach the lakes maximum depth of metres whatever for for they tell us that the erg was full of archaeological treasures of course noone bothered about them before it was flooded it was no use trying to hurry the president of anar the autonomous north african republic and morgan knew better than to attempt it whatever the constitution might say sheik abdullah controlled more power and wealth than almost any single individual on earth even more to the point he understood the uses of both he came from a family that was not afraid to take risks and very seldom had cause to regret them its first and most famous gamble which had incurred the hatred of the whole arab world for almost half a century was the investment of its abundant petrodollars in the science and technology of israel that farsighted act had led directly to the mining of the red sea the defeat of the deserts and very much later to the gibraltar bridge i dont have to tell you van said the sheik at last how much your new project fascinates me and after all that we went through together while the bridge was being built i know that you could do it given the resources thank you but i have a few questions im still not clear why theres midway station and why its at a height of twentyfive thousand kilometres several reasons we needed a major power plant at about that level which would involve fairly massive construction there in any case then it occurred to us that seven hours was too long to stay cooped up in a rather cramped cabin and splitting the journey gave a number of advantages we shouldnt have to feed the passengers in transitthey could eat and stretch their legs at the station we could also optimise the vehicle design only the capsules on the lower section would have to be streamlined those on the upper run could be much simpler and lighter the midway station would not only serve as a transfer point but as an operations and control center and ultimately we believe as a major tourist attraction and resort in its own right but its not midway its almost ah twothirds of the distance up to stationary orbit true the midpoint would be at eighteen thousand not twentyfive but theres another factor safety if the section above is severed the midway station wont crash back to earth why not it will have enough momentum to maintain a stable orbit of course it will fall earthward but it will always remain clear of the atmosphere so it will be perfectly safe it will simply become a space station moving in a tenhour elliptical orbit twice a day it will be right back where it started from and eventually it could be reconnected in theory at least and in practice oh im sure it could be done certainly the people and equipment on the station could be saved but we wouldnt have even that option if we established it at a lower altitude anything falling from below the twentyfive thousand kilometre limit hits the atmosphere and burns up in five hours or less would you propose advertising this fact to passengers on the earthmidway run we hope they would be too busy admiring the view to worry about it you make it sound like a scenic elevator why not except that the tallest scenic ride on earth only goes up a mere three kilometres were talking about something ten thousand times higher there was a considerable pause while sheik abdullah thought this over we missed an opportunity he said at last we could have had fivekilometre scenic rides up the piers of the bridge they were in the original design but we dropped them for the usual reason economy perhaps we made a mistake they could have paid for themselves and ive just realised something else if this hyperfilament had been available at the time i suppose the bridge could have been built for half the cost i wouldnt lie to you mr president less than a fifth but construction would have been delayed more than twenty years so you havent lost by it i must talk that over with my accountants some of them still arent convinced it was a good idea even though the traffic growth rate is ahead of projection but i keep telling them that money isnt everything the republic needed the bridge psychologically and culturally as well as economically did you know that percent of the people who drive across it do so just because its there not for any other reason and then they go straight back again despite having to pay the toll both ways i seem to recall said morgan dryly giving you similar arguments a long time ago you werent easy to convince true i remember that the sydney opera house was your favourite example you liked to point out how many times that had paid for itself even in hard cash let alone prestige and dont forget the pyramids the sheik laughed what did you call them the best investment in the history of mankind precisely still paying tourist dividends after four thousand years hardly a fair comparison though their running costs dont compare with those of the bridge much less your proposed towers the tower may last longer than the pyramids its in a far more benign environment thats a very impressive thought you really believe that it will operate for several thousand years not in its original form of course but in principle yes whatever technical developments the future brings i dont believe there will ever be a more efficient more economical way of reaching space think of it as another bridge but this time a bridge to the stars or at least to the planets and once again youd like us to help finance it well still be paying for the last bridge for another twenty years its not as if your space elevator was on our territory or was of direct importance to us but i believe it is mr president your republic is a part of the terran economy and the cost of space transportation is now one of the factors limiting its growth if youve looked at those estimates for the s and s i have i have very interesting but though were not exactly poor we couldnt raise a fraction of the funds needed why it would absorb the entire gross world product for a couple of years and pay it back every fifteen for ever afterwards if your projections are correct they were for the bridge but youre right of course and i dont expect anar to do more than start the ball rolling once youve shown your interest it will be that much easier to get other support such as the world bank the planetary banks the federal government and your own employers the terran construction corporation what are you really up to van here it comes thought morgan almost with a sigh of relief now at last he could talk frankly with someone he could trust someone who was too big to be involved in petty bureaucratic intrigues but who could thoroughly appreciate their finer points ive been doing most of this work in my own time im on vacation right now and incidentally thats just how the bridge started i dont know if i ever told you that i was once officially ordered to forget it ive learned a few lessons in the past fifteen years this report must have taken a good deal of computer time who paid for that oh i have considerable discretionary funds and my staff is always doing studies that nobody else can understand to tell the truth ive had quite a little team playing with the idea for several months theyre so enthusiastic that they spend most of their free time on it as well but now we have to commit ourselves or abandon the project does your esteemed chairman know about this morgan smiled without much humour of course not and i dont want to tell him until ive worked out all the details i can appreciate some of the complications said the president shrewdly one of them i imagine is ensuring that senator collins doesnt invent it first he cant do that the idea is two hundred years old but he and a lot of other people could slow it down i want to see it happen in my lifetime and of course you intend to be in charge well what exactly would you like us to do this is merely one suggestion mr president you may have a better idea form a consortium perhaps including the gibraltar bridge authority the suez and panama corporations the english channel company the bering dam corporation then when its all wrapped up approach tcc with a request to do a feasibility study at this stage the investment will be negligible meaning less than a million especially as ive already done percent of the work and then thereafter with your backing mr president i can play it by ear i might stay with tcc or i might resign and join the consortium call it astroengineering it would all depend on circumstances i would do whatever seemed best for the project that seems a reasonable approach i think we can work something out thank you mr president morgan answered with heartfelt sincerity but theres one annoying roadblock we have to tackle at once perhaps even before we set up the consortium we have to go to the world court and establish jurisdiction over the most valuable piece of real estate on earth the bridge that danced even in this age of instantaneous communications and swift global transport it was convenient to have a place that one could call ones office not everything could be stored in patterns of electronic charges there were still such items as good oldfashioned books professional certificates awards and honours engineering models samples of material artists rendering of projects and of course the walltowall carpet which every senior bureaucrat needed to soften the impact of external reality morgans office which he saw on the average ten days per month was on the sixth or land floor of the sprawling terran construction corporation headquarters in nairobi the floor below was sea that above it adminisratinmeaning chairman collins and his empire the architect in a fit of naпve symbolism had devoted the top floor to space there was even a small observatory on the roof with a thirtycentimetre telescope that was always out of order because it was only used during office parties and frequently for most nonastronomical purposes the upper rooms of the triplanetary hotel only a kilometre away were a favourite target as they often held some very strange forms of life or at any rate of behaviour as morgan was in continuous touch with his two secretaries one human the other electronic he expected no surprises when he walked into the office after the brief flight from anar by the standards of an earlier age his was an extraordinarily small organisation he had less than three hundred men and women under his direct control but the computing and informationprocessing power at their command could not be matched by the merely human population of the entire planet well how did you get on with the sheik asked warren kingsley his deputy and long time friend as soon as they were alone together very well i think we have a deal but i still cant believe that were held up by such a stupid problem what does the legal department say well definitely have to get a world court ruling if the court agrees that its a matter of overwhelming public interest our reverend friends will have to move though if they decide to be stubborn there would be a nasty situation perhaps you should send a small earthquake to help them make up their minds the fact that morgan was on the board of general tectonics was an old joke between him and kingsley but gt perhaps fortunately had never found a way of controlling and directing earthquakes nor did it ever expect to do so the best that it could hope for was to predict them and to bleed off their energies harmlessly before they could do major damage even here its record of success was not much better than percent a nice idea said morgan ill think it over now what about our other problem all set to go do you want it now ok lets see the worst the office windows darkened and a grid of glowing lines appeared in the centre of the room watch this van said kingsley heres the regime that gives trouble rows of letters and numbers materialised in the empty air velocities payloads accelerations transit times morgan absorbed them at a glance the globe of the earth with its circles of longitude and latitude hovered just above the carpet and rising from it to little more than the height of a man was the luminous thread that marked the position of the orbital tower five hundred times normal speed lateral scale exaggeration fifty here we go some invisible force had started to pluck at the line of light drawing it away from the vertical the disturbance was moving upwards as it mimicked via the computers millions of calculations a second the ascent of a payload through the earths gravitational field whats the displacement asked morgan as his eyes strained to follow the details of the simulation now about two hundred metres it gets to three before the thread snapped in the leisurely slowmotion that represented real speeds of thousands of kilometres an hour the two segments of the severed tower began to curl away from each other one bending back to earth the other whipping upwards to space but morgan was no longer fully conscious of this imaginary disaster existing only in the mind of the computer superimposed upon it now was the reality that had haunted him for years he had seen that twocenturyold film at least fifty times and there were sections that he had examined frame by frame until he knew every detail by heart it was after all the most expensive movie footage ever shot at least in peacetime it had cost the state of washington several million dollars a minute there stood the slim and graceful bridge spanning the canyon it bore no traffic but a single car had been abandoned midway by its driver and no wonder for the bridge was behaving as none before in the whole history of engineering it seemed impossible that thousands of tons of metal could perform such an aerial ballet one could more easily believe that the bridge was made of rubber than of steel vast slow undulations metres in amplitude were sweeping along the entire width of the span so that the roadway suspended between the piers twisted back and forth like an angry snake the wind blowing down the canyon was sounding a note far too low for any human ears to detect as it hit the natural frequency of the beautiful doomed structure for hours the torsional vibrations had been building up but noone knew when the end would come already the protracted deaththroes were a testimonial that the unlucky designers could well have foregone suddenly the supporting cables snapped flailing upwards like murderous steel whips twisting and turning the roadway pitched into the river fragments of the structure flying in all directions even when projected at normal speed the final cataclysm looked as if shot in slow motion the scale of the disaster was so large that the human mind had no basis of comparison in reality it lasted perhaps five seconds at the end of that time the tacoma narrows bridge had earned an inexpungable place in the history of engineering two hundred years later there was a photograph of its last moments on the wall of morgans office bearing the caption one of our less successful products to morgan that was no joke but a permanent reminder that the unexpected could always strike from ambush when the gibraltar bridge was being designed he had gone carefully through von kбrmбns classic analysis of the tacoma narrows disaster learning all he could from one of the most expensive mistakes of the past there had been no serious vibrational problems even in the worst gales that had come roaring in from the atlantic though the roadway had moved a hundred metres from the centre line precisely as calculated but the space elevator was such a leap forward into the unknown that some unpleasant surprises were a virtual certainty wind forces on the atmospheric section were easy to estimate but it was also necessary to take into account the vibrations induced by the stopping and starting of the payloads and even on so enormous a structure by the tidal effects of the sun and moon and not only individually but acting all together with perhaps an occasional earthquake to complicate the picture in the socalled worst case analysis all the simulations in this tonsofpayloadperhour regime give the same result the vibrations build up until theres a fracture at around five hundred kilometres well have to increase the damping drastically i was afraid of that how much do we need another ten megatons morgan could take some gloomy satisfaction from the figure that was very close to the guess he had made using his engineers intuition and the mysterious resources of his subconscious now the computer had confirmed it they would have to increase the anchor mass in orbit by ten million tons even by terrestrial earthmoving standards such a mass was hardly trivial it was equivalent to a sphere of rock about two hundred metres across morgan had a sudden image of yakkagala as he had last seen it looming against the taprobanean sky imagine lifting that forty thousand kilometres into space fortunately it might not be necessary there were at least two alternatives morgan always let his subordinates do their thinking for themselves it was the only way to establish responsibility it took much of the load off him and on many occasions his staff had arrived at solutions he might have overlooked what do you suggest warren he asked quietly we could use one of the lunar freight launchers and shoot up ten megatons of moonrock it would be a long and expensive job and wed still need a large spacebased operation to catch the material and steer it into final orbit there would also be a psychological problem yes i can appreciate that we dont want another san luiz domingo san luiz had been the fortunately small south american village that had received a stray cargo of processed lunar metal intended for a loworbit space station the terminal guidance had failed resulting in the first manmade meteor crater and two hundred and fifty deaths ever since that the population of planet earth had been very sensitive on the subject of celestial target practice a much better answer is to catch an asteroid were running a search for those with suitable orbits and have found three promising candidates what we really want is a carbonaceous one then we can use it for raw material when we set up the processing plant killing two birds with one stone a rather large stone but thats probably the best idea forget the lunar launcher a million ton shots would tie it up for years and some of them would be bound to go astray if you cant find a large enough asteroid we can still send the extra mass up by the elevator itself though i hate wasting all that energy if it can be avoided it may be the cheapest way with the efficiency of the latest fusion plants it will take only twenty dollars worth of electricity to lift a ton up to orbit are you sure of that figure its a firm quotation from central power morgan was silent for a few minutes then he said the aerospace engineers really are going to hate me almost as much he added to himself as the venerable parakarma no that was not fair hate was an emotion no longer possible to a true follower of the doctrine what he had seen in the eyes of exdoctor choam goldberg was merely implacable opposition but that could be equally dangerous judgement one of paul saraths more annoying specialities was the sudden call gleeful or gloomy as the case might be which invariably opened with the words have you heard the news though rajasinghe had often been tempted to give the generalpurpose answer yes im not at all surprised he had never had the heart to rob paul of his simple pleasure what is it this time he answered without much enthusiasm maxines on global two talking to senator collins i think our friend morgan is in trouble call you back pauls excited image faded from the screen to be replaced a few seconds later by maxine duvals as rajasinghe switched to the main news channel she was sitting in her familiar studio talking to the chairman of the terran construction corporation who seemed to be in a mood of barely suppressed indignation probably synthetic senator collins now that the world court ruling has been given rajasinghe shunted the entire programme to record with a muttered i thought that wasnt until friday as he turned off the sound and activated his private link with aristotle he exclaimed my god it is friday as always ari was on line at once good morning raja what can i do for you that beautiful dispassionate voice untouched by human glottis had never changed in the forty years that he had known it decades perhaps centuries after he was dead it would be talking to other men just as it had spoken to him once this knowledge had depressed rajasinghe now it no longer mattered he did not envy aristotles immortality good morning ari id like todays world court ruling on the case astroengineering corporation versus the sri kanda vihara the summary will do let me have the full printout later decision lease of temple site confirmed in perpetuity under taprobanean and world law as codified unanimous filing decision the construction of the proposed orbital tower with its attendant noise vibration and impact upon a site of great historic and cultural importance would constitute a private nuisance meriting an injunction under the law of torts at this stage public interest not of sufficient merit to affect the issue ruling to one abstention thank you ari cancel printout i wont need it goodbye well that was that just as he had expected yet he did not know whether to be relieved or disappointed rooted as he was in the past he was glad that the old traditions were cherished and protected if one thing had been learned from the bloody history of mankind it was that only individual human beings mattered however eccentric their beliefs might be they must be safeguarded so long as they did not conflict with wider but equally legitimate interests what was it that the old poet had said there is no such thing as the state perhaps that was going a little too far but it was better than the other extreme at the same time rajasinghe felt a mild sense of regret he had half convinced himself that morgans fantastic enterprise might be just what was needed to prevent taprobane from sinking into a comfortable selfsatisfied decline now the court had closed that particular avenue at least for many years he wondered what maxine would have to say on the subject and switched over to delayed playback on global two the news analysis channel senator collins was still gathering momentum undoubtedly exceeding his authority and using the resources of his division on projects which did not concern it but surely senator arent you being somewhat legalistic as i understand it hyperfilament was developed for construction purposes especially bridges and isnt this a kind of bridge ive heard dr morgan use that analogy though he also calls it a tower youre being legalistic now maxine i prefer the name space elevator and youre quite wrong about hyperfilament its the result of two hundred years of aerospace research the fact that the final breakthrough came in the land division of my ah organisation is irrelevant though naturally im proud that my scientists were involved you consider that the whole project should be handed over to the space division what project this is merely a design study one of hundreds that are always going on in tcc i never hear about a fraction of them and i dont want to until they reach the stage when some major decision has to be made which is not the case here definitely not my space transportation experts say that they can handle all projected traffic increases at least for the foreseeable future meaning precisely another twenty years and what happens then the tower will take that long to build according to dr morgan suppose it isnt ready in time then well have something else my staff is looking into all the possibilities and its by no means certain that the space elevator is the right answer the idea though is fundamentally sound it appears to be though further studies are required then surely you should be grateful to dr morgan for his initial work i have the utmost respect for dr morgan he is one of the most brilliant engineers in my organization if not in the world i dont think senator that quite answers my question very well i am grateful to dr morgan for bringing this matter to our notice but i do not approve of the way in which he did it if i may be blunt he tried to force my hand how by going outside my organization his organization and thus showing a lack of loyalty as a result of his manoeuvrings there has been an adverse world court decision which inevitably has provoked much unfavourable comment in the circumstances i have had no choice but to request with the utmost regret that he tender his resignation thank you senator collins as always its been a pleasure talking to you you sweet liar said rajasinghe as he switched off and took the call that had been flashing for the last minute did you get it all asked professor sarath so thats the end of dr vannevar morgan rajasinghe looked thoughtfully at his old friend for a few seconds you were always fond of jumping to conclusions paul how much would you care to bet iii the bell apostate driven to despair by his fruitless attempts to understand the universe the sage devadasa finally announced in exasperation all statements that contain the word god are false instantly his leastfavourite disciple somasiri replied the sentence i am now speaking contains the word god i fail to see oh noble master how that simple statement can be false devadasa considered the matter for several poyas then he answered this time with apparent satisfaction only statements that do not contain the word god can be true after a pause barely sufficient for a starving mongoose to swallow a millet seed somasiri replied if this statement applies to itself oh venerable one it cannot be true because it contains the word god but if it is not true at this point devadasa broke his beggingbowl upon somasiris head and should therefore be honoured as the true founder of zen in the late afternoon when the stairway was no longer blasted by the full fury of the sun the venerable parakarma began his descent by nightfall he would reach the highest of the pilgrim resthouses and by the following day he would have returned to the world of men the maha thero had given neither advice nor discouragement and if he was grieved by his colleagues departure he had shown no sign he had merely intoned all things are impermanent clasped his hands and given his blessing the venerable parakarma who had once been dr choam goldberg and might be so again would have had great difficulty in explaining all his motives right action was easy to say it was not easy to discover at the sri kanda maha vihara he had found peace of mind but that was not enough with his scientific training he was no longer content to accept the orders ambiguous attitude towards god such indifference had come at last to seem worse than outright denial if such a thing as a rabbinical gene could exist dr goldberg possessed it like many before him goldbergparakarma had sought god through mathematics undiscouraged even by the bombshell that kurt gцdel with the discovery of undecidable propositions had exploded early in the twentieth century he could not understand how anyone could contemplate the dynamic asymmetry of eulers profound yet beautifully simple e i without wondering if the universe was the creation of some vast intelligence having first made his name with a new cosmological theory that had survived almost ten years before being refuted goldberg had been widely acclaimed as another einstein or ngoya in an age of ultraspecialisation he had also managed to make notable advances in aero and hydrodynamics long regarded as dead subjects incapable of further surprises then at the height of his powers he had experienced a religious conversion not unlike pascals though without so many morbid undertones for the next decade he had been content to lose himself in saffron anonymity focusing his brilliant mind upon questions of doctrine and philosophy he did not regret the interlude and he was not even sure that he had abandoned the order one day perhaps this great stairway would see him again but his godgiven talents were reasserting themselves there was massive work to be done and he needed tools that could not be found on sri kanda or even for that matter on earth itself he felt little hostility now towards vannevar morgan however inadvertently the engineer had ignited the spark in his blundering way he too was an agent of god yet at all costs the temple must be protected whether or not the wheel of fate ever returned him to its tranquillity parakarma was implacably resolved upon that and so like a new moses bringing down from the mountain laws that would change the destinies of men the venerable parakarma descended to the world he had once renounced he was blind to the beauties of land and sky that were all around him for they were utterly trivial compared to those that he alone could see in the armies of equations that were marching through his mind moondozer your trouble dr morgan said the man in the wheelchair is that youre on the wrong planet i cant help thinking retorted morgan looking pointedly at his visitors lifesupport system that much the same may be said of you the vicepresident of narodny mars gave an appreciative chuckle at least im here only for a week then its back to the moon and a civilised gravity oh i can walk if i really have to but i prefer otherwise if i may ask why do you come to earth at all i do so as little as possible but sometimes one has to be on the spot contrary to general belief you cant do everything by remotes im sure you are aware of that morgan nodded it was true enough he thought of all the times when the texture of some material the feel of rock or soil underfoot the smell of a jungle the sting of spray upon his face had played a vital role in one of his projects some day perhaps even these sensations could be transferred by electronicsindeed it had already been done so crudely on an experimental basis and at enormous cost but there was no substitute for reality one should beware of imitations if youve visited earth especially to meet me morgan replied i appreciate the honour but if youre offering me a job on mars youre wasting your time im enjoying my retirement meeting friends and relatives i havent seen for years and ive no intention of starting a new career i find that surprising after all youre only how do you propose to occupy your time easily i could spend the rest of my life on any one of a dozen projects the ancient engineers the romans the greeks the incas theyve always fascinated me and ive never had time to study them ive been asked to write and deliver a global university course on design science theres a textbook im commissioned to write on advanced structures i want to develop some ideas about the use of active elements to correct dynamic loads winds earthquakes and so forth im still consultant for general tectonics and im preparing a report on the administration of tcc at whose request not i take it senator collins no said morgan with a grim smile i thought it would be useful and it helps to relieve my feelings im sure of it but all these activities arent really creative sooner or later theyll pall like this beautiful norwegian scenery youll grow tired of looking at lakes and fir trees just as youll grow tired of writing and talking you are the sort of man who will never be really happy dr morgan unless you are shaping your universe morgan did not reply the prognosis was much too accurate for comfort i suspect that you agree with me what would you say if i told you that my bank was seriously interested in the space elevator project id be sceptical when i approached them they said it was a fine idea but they couldnt put any money into it at this stage all available funds were needed for the development of mars its the old story well be glad to help you when you dont need any help that was a year ago now there have been some second thoughts wed like you to build the space elevator but not on earth on mars are you interested i might be go on look at the advantages only a third of the gravity so the forces involved are correspondingly smaller the synchronous orbit is also closer less than half the altitude here so at the very start the engineering problems are enormously reduced our people estimate that the mars system would cost less than a tenth of the terran one thats quite possible though id have to check it and thats just the beginning we have some fierce gales on mars despite our thin atmosphere but mountains that get completely above them your sri kanda is only five kilometres high we have mons pavonis twentyone kilometres and exactly on the equator better still there are no martian monks with longterm leases sitting on the summit and theres one other reason why mars might have been designed for a space elevator deimos is only three thousand kilometres above the stationary orbit so we already have a couple of million megatons sitting in exactly the right place for the anchor that will present some interesting problems in synchronisation but i see what you mean id like to meet the people who worked all this out you cant in real time theyre all on mars youll have to go there im tempted but i still have a few other questions go ahead earth must have the elevator for all the reasons you doubtless know but it seems to me that mars could manage without it you have only a fraction of our space traffic and a much smaller projected growth rate frankly it doesnt make a great deal of sense to me i was wondering when youd ask well im asking have you heard of project eos i dont think so eos greek for dawn the plan to rejuvenate mars oh of course i know about that it involves melting the polar caps doesnt it exactly if we could thaw out all that water and co ice several things would happen the atmospheric density would increase until men could work in the open without spacesuits at a later stage the air might even be made breathable there would be running water small seas and above all vegetation the beginnings of a carefully planned biota in a couple of centuries mars could be another garden of eden its the only planet in the solar system we can transform with known technology venus may always be too hot and where does the elevator come into this we have to lift several million tons of equipment into orbit the only practical way to heat up mars is by solar mirrors hundreds of kilometres across and well need them permanently first to melt the icecaps and later to maintain a comfortable temperature couldnt you get all this material from your asteroid mines some of it of course but the best mirrors for the job are made of sodium and thats rare in space well have to get it from the tharsis saltbeds right by the foothills of pavonis luckily enough and how long will all this take if there are no problems the first stage could be complete in fifty years maybe by your hundredth birthday which the actuaries say you have a thirtynine percent chance of seeing morgan laughed i admire people who do a thorough job of research we wouldnt survive on mars unless we paid attention to detail well im favourably impressed though i still have a great many reservations the financing for example thats my job dr morgan im the banker youre the engineer correct but you seem to know a good deal about engineering and ive had to learn a lot of economics often the hard way before id even consider getting involved in such a project i should want a detailed budget breakdown which can be provided and that would just be the start you may not realise that theres still a vast amount of research involved in halfadozen fields mass production of the hyperfilament material stability and control problems i could go on all night that wont be necessary our engineers have read all your reports what they are proposing is a smallscale experiment that will settle many of the technical problems and prove that the principle is sound theres no doubt about that i agree but its amazing what a difference a little practical demonstration can make so this is what we would like you to do design the minimum possible system just a wire with a payload of a few kilogrammes lower it from synchronous orbit to earth yes earth if it works here it will be easy on mars then run some thing up it just to show that rockets are obsolete the experiment will be relatively cheap it will provide essential information and basic training and from our point of view it will save years of argument we can go to the government of earth the solar fund the other interplanetary banks and just point to the demonstration you really have worked all this out when would you like my answer to be honest in about five seconds but obviously theres nothing urgent about the matter take as long as seems reasonable very well give me your design studies cost analyses and all the other material you have once ive been through them ill let you have my decision in oh a week at the most thank you heres my number you can get me at any time morgan slipped the bankers ident card into the memory slot of his communicator and checked the entry confirmed on the visual display before he had returned the card he had already made up his mind unless there was a fundamental flaw in the martian analysis and he would bet a large sum that it was sound his retirement was over he had often noted with some amusement that whereas he frequently thought long and hard over relatively trivial decisions he had never hesitated for a moment at the major turningpoints of his career he had always known what to do and had seldom been wrong and yet at this stage in the game it was better not to invest too much intellectual or emotional capital into a project that might still come to nothing after the banker had rolled out on the first stage of his journey back to port tranquillity via oslo and gagarin morgan found it impossible to settle down to any of the activities he had planned for the long northern evening his mind was in a turmoil scanning the whole spectrum of suddenly changed futures after a few minutes of restless pacing he sat down at his desk and began to list priorities in a kind of reverse order starting with the commitments he could most easily shed before long however he found it impossible to concentrate on such routine matters far down in the depths of his mind something was nagging at him trying to attract his attention when he tried to focus upon it it promptly eluded him like a familiar but momentarily forgotten word with a sigh of frustration morgan pushed himself away from the desk and walked out on to the verandah running along the western face of the hotel though it was very cold the air was quite still and the subzero temperature was more of a stimulus than a discomfort the sky was a blaze of stars and a yellow crescent moon was sinking down towards its reflection in the fjord whose surface was so dark and motionless that it might have been a sheet of polished ebony thirty years ago he had stood at almost this same spot with a girl whose very appearance he could no longer clearly recall they had both been celebrating their first degrees and that had been really all they had in common it had not been a serious affair they were young and enjoyed each others company and that had been enough yet somehow that fading memory had brought him back to trollshavn fjord at this crucial moment of his life what would the young student of twentytwo have thought could he have known how his footsteps would lead him back to this place of remembered pleasures three decades in his future there was scarcely a trace of nostalgia or selfpity in morgans reverieonly a kind of wistful amusement he had never for an instant regretted the fact that he and ingrid had separated amicably without even considering the usual oneyear trial contract she had gone on to make three other men moderately miserable before finding herself a job with the lunar commission and morgan had lost track of her perhaps even now she was up there on that shining crescent whose colour almost matched her golden hair so much for the past morgan turned his thoughts to the future where was mars he was ashamed to admit that he did not even know if it was visible tonight as he ran his eye along the path of the ecliptic from the moon to the dazzling beacon of venus and beyond he saw nothing in all that jewelled profusion that he could certainly identify with the red planet it was exciting to think that in the nottoodistant future he who had never even travelled beyond lunar orbit might be looking with his own eyes at those magnificent crimson landscapes and watching the tiny moons pass swiftly through their phases in that moment the dream collapsed morgan stood for a moment paralysed then dashed back into the hotel forgetting the splendour of the night there was no general purpose console in his room so he had to go down to the lobby to get the information he required as luck would have it the cubicle was occupied by an old lady who took so long to find what she wanted that morgan almost pounded on the door but at last the sluggard left with a mumbled apology and morgan was face to face with the accumulated art and knowledge of all mankind in his student days he had won several retrieval championships racing against the clock while digging out obscure items of information on lists prepared by ingeniously sadistic judges his skill had improved with years and this was a perfectly straightforward question the display came up in thirty seconds in far more detail than he really needed morgan studied the screen for a minute then shook his head in baffled amazement they couldnt possibly have overlooked that he muttered but what can they do about it morgan pressed the hard copy button and carried the thin sheet of paper back to his room for more detailed study the problem was so stunningly appallingly obvious that he wondered if he had overlooked some equally obvious solution and would be making a fool of himself if he raised the matter yet there was no possible escape he looked at his watch already after midnight but this was something he had to settle at once to morgans relief the banker had not pressed his dont disturb button he replied immediately sounding a little surprised i hope i didnt wake you up said morgan not very sincerely no were just about to land at gagarin whats the problem about ten teratons moving at two kilometres a second the inner moon phobos its a cosmic bulldozer going past the elevator every eleven hours ive not worked out the exact probabilities but a collision is inevitable every few days there was silence for a long time from the other end of the circuit then the banker said i could have thought of that so obviously someone has the answer perhaps well have to move phobos impossible the mass is far too great ill have to call mars the time delays twelve minutes at the moment i should have some sort of answer within the hour i hope so morgan told himself and it had better be good that is if i really want this job the finger of god dendrobium macarthiae usually flowered with the coming of the southwest monsoon but this year it was early as johan rajasinghe stood in his orchid house admiring the intricate violetpink blossoms he remembered that last season he had been trapped by a torrential downpour for halfanhour while examining the first blooms he looked anxiously at the sky no there was little danger of rain it was a beautiful day with thin high bands of cloud moderating the fierce sunlight but that was odd rajasinghe had never seen anything quite like it before almost vertically overhead the parallel lanes of cloud were broken by a circular disturbance it appeared to be a tiny cyclonic storm only a few kilometres across but it reminded rajasinghe of something completely different a knothole breaking through the grain in a smoothly planed board he abandoned his beloved orchids and stepped outside to get a better view of the phenomenon now he could see that the small whirlwind was moving slowly across the sky the track of its passage clearly marked by the distortion of the cloud lanes one could easily imagine that the finger of god was reaching down from heaven tracing a furrow through the clouds even rajasinghe who understood the basics of weather control had no idea that such precision was now possible but he could take a modest pride in the fact that almost forty years ago he had played his part in its achievement it had not been easy to persuade the surviving superpowers to relinquish their orbital fortresses and hand them over to the global weather authority in what was if the metaphor could be stretched that far the last and most dramatic example of beating swords into ploughshares now the lasers that had once threatened mankind directed their beams into carefully selected portions of the atmosphere or onto heatabsorbing target areas in remote regions of the earth the energy they contained was trifling compared to that of the smallest storm but so is the energy of the falling stone that triggers an avalanche or the single neutron that starts a chain reaction beyond that rajasinghe knew nothing of the technical details except that they involved networks of monitoring satellites and computers that held within their electronic brains a complete model of the earths atmosphere land surfaces and seas he felt rather like an awestruck savage gaping at the wonders of some advanced technology as he watched the little cyclone move purposefully into the west until it disappeared below the graceful line of palms just inside the ramparts of the pleasure gardens then he glanced up at the invisible engineers and scientists racing round the world in their manmade heavens very impressive he said but i hope you know exactly what youre doing orbital roulette i should have guessed said the banker ruefully that it would have been in one of those technical appendices that i never looked at and now youve seen the whole report id like to know the answer youve had me worrying ever since you raised the problem its brilliantly obvious morgan answered and i should have thought of it myself and i would have done eventually he told himself with a fair degree of confidence in his minds eye he saw again those computer simulations of the whole immense structure twanging like a cosmic violin string as the hourslong vibrations raced from earth to orbit and were reflected back again and superimposed on that he replayed from memory for the hundredth time the scratched movie of the dancing bridge there were all the clues he needed phobos sweeps past the tower every eleven hours and ten minutes but luckily it isnt moving in exactly the same plane or wed have a collision every time it went round it misses on most revolutions and the danger times are exactly predictable to a thousandth of a second if desired now the elevator like any piece of engineering isnt a completely rigid structure it has natural vibration periods which can be calculated almost as accurately as planetary orbits so what your engineers propose to do is to tune the elevator so that its normal oscillations which cant be avoided anyway always keep it clear of phobos every time the satellite passes by the structure it isnt there its sidestepped the danger zone by a few kilometres there was a long pause from the other end of the circuit i shouldnt say this said the martian at last but my hair is standing on end morgan laughed put as bluntly as this it does sound like what was it called russian roulette but remember were dealing with exactly predictable movements we always know where phobos will be and we can control the displacement of the tower simply by the way we schedule traffic along it simply thought morgan was hardly the right word but anyone could see that it was possible and then an analogy flashed into his mind that was so perfect yet so incongruous that he almost burst into laughter no it would not be a good idea to use it on the banker once again he was back at the tacoma narrows bridge but this time in a world of fantasy there was a ship that had to sail beneath it on a perfectly regular schedule unfortunately the mast was a metre too tall no problem just before it was due to arrive a few heavy trucks would be sent racing across the bridge at intervals carefully calculated to match its resonant frequency a gentle wave would sweep along the roadway from pier to pier the crest timed to coincide with the arrival of the ship and so the masthead would glide beneath with whole centimetres to spare on a scale thousands of times larger this was how phobos would miss the structure towering out into space from mons pavonis im glad to have your assurance said the banker but i think id do a private check on the position of phobos before i take a trip then youll be surprised to know that some of your bright young people theyre certainly bright and im assuming theyre young because of their sheer technical effrontery want to use the critical periods as a tourist attraction they think they could charge premium rates for views of phobos sailing past at arms length at a couple of thousand kiometres an hour quite a spectacle wouldnt you agree i prefer to imagine it but they may be right anyway im relieved to hear that there is a solution im also happy to note that you approve of our engineering talent does this mean we can expect a decision soon you can have it now said morgan when can we start work the night before vesak it was still after twentyseven centuries the most revered day of the taprobanean calendar on the may full moon according to legend the buddha had been born had achieved enlightenment and had died though to most people vesak now meant no more than that other great annual holiday christmas it was still a time for meditation and tranquillity for many years monsoon control had guaranteed that there would be no rain on the nights of vesak plus and minus one and for almost as long rajasinghe had gone to the royal city two days before the full moon on a pilgrimage that annually refreshed his spirit he avoided vesak itself on that day ranapura was too crowded with visitors some of whom would be guaranteed to recognise him and disturb his solitude only the sharpest eye could have noticed that the huge yellow moon lifting above the bellshaped domes of the ancient dagobas was not yet a perfect circle the light it gave was so intense that only a few of the most brilliant satellites and stars were visible in the cloudless sky and there was not a breath of wind twice it was said kalidasa had stopped on this road when he had left ranapura forever the first halt was at the tomb of hanuman the loved companion of his boyhood and the second was at the shrine of the dying buddha rajasinghe had often wondered what solace the haunted king had gathered perhaps at this very spot for it was the best point from which to view the immense figure carved from the solid rock the reclining shape was so perfectly proportioned that one had to walk right up to it before its real size could be appreciated from a distance it was impossible to realise that the pillow upon which the buddha rested his head was itself higher than a man though rajasinghe had seen much of the world he knew no other spot so full of peace sometimes he felt that he could sit here forever beneath the blazing moon wholly unconcerned with all the cares and turmoil of life he had never tried to probe too deeply into the magic of the shrine for fear that he would destroy it but some of its elements were obvious enough the very posture of the enlightened one resting at last with closed eyes after a long and noble life radiated serenity the sweeping lines of the robe were extraordinarily soothing and restful to contemplate they appeared to flow from the rock to form waves of frozen stone and like the waves of the sea the natural rhythm of their curves appealed to instincts of which the rational mind knew nothing in timeless moments such as this alone with the buddha and the almost full moon rajasinghe felt that he could understand at last the meaning of nirvana that state which can be defined only by negatives such emotions as anger desire greed no longer possessed any power indeed they were barely conceivable even the sense of personal identity seemed about to fade away like a mist before the morning sun it could not last of course presently he became aware of the buzzing of insects the distant barking of dogs the cold hardness of the stone upon which he was sitting tranquillity was not a state of mind which could be sustained for long with a sigh rajasinghe got to his feet and began the walk back to his car parked a hundred metres outside the temple grounds he was just entering the vehicle when he noticed the small white patch so clearly defined that it might have been painted on the sky rising over the trees to the west it was the most peculiar cloud that rajasinghe had ever seena perfectly symmetrical ellipsoid so sharpedged that it appeared almost solid he wondered if someone was flying an airship through the skies of taprobane but he could see no fins and there was no sound of engines then for a fleeting moment he had a far wilder fancy the starholmers had arrived at last but that of course was absurd even if they had managed to outrun their own radio signals they could hardly have traversed the whole solar system and descended into the skies of earth without triggering all the traffic radars in existence the news would have broken hours ago rather to his surprise rajasinghe felt a mild sense of disappointment and now as the apparition came closer he could see that it undoubtedly was a cloud because it was getting slightly frayed around the edges its speed was impressive it seemed to be driven by a private gale of which there was still no trace here at ground level so the scientists of monsoon control were at it again testing their mastery of the winds what rajasinghe wondered would they think of next ashoka station how tiny the island looked from this altitude thirtysix thousand kilometres below straddling the equator taprobane appeared not much bigger than the moon the entire country seemed too small a target to hit yet he was aiming for an area at its centre about the size of a tennis court even now morgan was not completely certain of his motives for the purpose of this demonstration he could just as easily have operated from kinte station and targeted kilimanjaro or mount kenya the fact that kinte was at one of the most unstable points along the entire stationary orbit and was always jockeying to remain over central africa would not have mattered for the few days the experiment would last for a while he had been tempted to aim at chimborazo the americans had even offered at considerable expense to move columbus station to its precise longitude but in the end despite this encouragement he had returned to his original objective sri kanda it was fortunate for morgan that in this age of computerassisted decisions even a world court ruling could be obtained in a matter of weeks the vihara of course had protested morgan had argued that a brief scientific experiment conducted on grounds outside the temple premises and resulting in no noise pollution or other form of interference could not possibly constitute a tort if he was prevented from carrying it out all his earlier work would be jeopardised he would have no way of checking his calculations and a project vital to the republic of mars would receive a severe setback it was a very plausible argument and morgan had believed most of it himself so had the judges by five to two though they were not supposed to be influenced by such matters mentioning the litigious martians was a clever move the rom already had three complicated cases in progress and the court was slightly tired of establishing precedents in interplanetary law but morgan knew in the coldly analytical part of his mind that his action was not dictated by logic alone he was not a man who accepted defeat gracefully the gesture of defiance gave him a certain satisfaction and yet at a still deeper level he rejected this petty motivation such a schoolboy gesture was unworthy of him what he was really doing was building up his selfassurance and reaffirming his belief in ultimate success though he did not know how or when he was proclaiming to the world and to the stubborn monks within their ancient walls i shall return ashoka station controlled virtually all communications meteorology environmental monitoring and space traffic in the hindu cathay region if it ever ceased to function a billion lives would be threatened with disaster and if its services were not quickly restored death no wonder that ashoka had two completely independent subsatellites bhaba and sarabhai a hundred kilometres away even if some unthinkable catastrophe destroyed all three stations kinte and imhotep to the west or confucius to the east could take over on an emergency basis the human race had learned from harsh experience not to put all its eggs in one basket there were no tourists vacationers or transit passengers here so far from earth they did their business and sightseeing only a few thousand kilometres out and left the high geosynchronous orbit to the scientists and engineers not one of whom had ever visited ashoka on so unusual a mission or with such unique equipment the key to operation gossamer now floated in one of the stations mediumsized docking chambers awaiting the final checkout before launch there was nothing very spectacular about it and its appearance gave no hint of the manyears and the millions that had gone into its development the dull grey cone four metres long and two metres across the base appeared to be made of solid metal it required a close examination to reveal the tightlywound fibre covering the entire surface indeed apart from an internal core and the strips of plastic interleaving that separated the hundreds of layers the cone was made of nothing but a tapering hyperfilament thread forty thousand kilometres of it two obsolete and totally different technologies had been revived for the construction of that unimpressive grey cone three hundred years ago submarine telegraphs had started to operate across the ocean beds men had lost fortunes before they had mastered the art of coiling thousands of kilometres of cable and playing it out at a steady rate from continent to continent despite storms and all the other hazards of the sea then just a century later some of the first primitive guided weapons had been controlled by fine wires spun out as they flew to their targets at a few hundred kilometres an hour morgan was attempting a thousand times the range of those war museum relics and fifty times their velocity however he had some advantages his missile would be operating in a perfect vacuum for all but the last hundred kilometres and its target was not likely to take evasive action the operations manager project gossamer attracted morgans attention with a slightly embarrassed cough we still have one minor problem doctor she said were quite confident about the lowering all the tests and computer simulations are satisfactory as youve seen its reeling the filament in again that has station safety worried morgan blinked rapidly he had given little thought to the question it seemed obvious that winding the filament back again was a trivial problem compared to sending it out all that was needed surely was a simple poweroperated winch with the special modifications needed to handle such a fine variablethickness material but he knew that in space one should never take anything for granted and that intuition especially the intuition of an earthbased engineer could be a treacherous guide lets see when the tests are concluded we cut the earth end and ashoka starts to wind the filament in of course when you tug however hard at one end of a line forty thousand kilometres long nothing happens for hours it would take half a day for the impulse to reach the far end and the system to start moving as a whole so we keep up the tension oh somebody did a few calculations continued the engineer and realised that when we finally got up to speed wed have several tons heading towards the station at a thousand kilometres an hour they didnt like that at all understandably what do they want us to do programme a slower reeling in with a controlled momentum budget if the worst comes to the worst they may make us move offstation to do the windup will that delay the operation no weve worked out a contingency plan for heaving the whole thing out of the airlock in five minutes if we have to and youll be able to retrieve it easily of course i hope youre right that little fishing line cost a lot of money and i want to use it again but where morgan asked himself as he stared at the slowly waxing crescent earth perhaps it would be better to complete the mars project first even if it meant several years of exile once pavonis was fully operational earth would have to follow and he did not doubt that somehow the last obstacles would be overcome then the chasm across which he was now looking would be spanned and the fame that gustave eiffel had earned three centuries ago would be utterly eclipsed the first lowering there would be nothing to see for at least another twenty minutes nevertheless everyone not needed in the control hut was already outside staring up at the sky even morgan found it hard to resist the impulse and kept edging towards the door seldom more than a few metres from him was maxine duvals latest remote a husky youth in his late twenties mounted on his shoulders were the usual tools of his trade twin cameras in the traditional right forward left backward arrangement and above those a small sphere not much larger than a grapefruit the antenna inside that sphere was doing very clever things several thousand times a second so that it was always locked on the nearest comsat despite all the antics of its bearer and at the other end of that circuit sitting comfortably in her studio office maxine duval was seeing through the eyes of her distant alter ego and hearing with his ears but not straining her lungs in the freezing air this time she had the better part of the bargain it was not always the case morgan had agreed to the arrangement with some reluctance he knew that this was an historic occasion and accepted maxines assurance that my man wont get in the way but he was also keenly aware of all the things that could go wrong in such a novel experiment especially during the last hundred kilometres of atmospheric entry on the other hand he also knew that maxine could be trusted to treat either failure or triumph without sensationalism like all great reporters maxine duval was not emotionally detached from the events that she observed she could give all points of view neither distorting nor omitting any facts which she considered essential yet she made no attempt to conceal her own feelings though she did not let them intrude she admired morgan enormously with the envious awe of someone who lacked all real creative ability ever since the building of the gibraltar bridge she had waited to see what the engineer would do next and she had not been disappointed but though she wished morgan luck she did not really like him in her opinion the sheer drive and ruthlessness of his ambition made him both larger than life and less than human she could not help contrasting him with his deputy warren kingsley now there was a thoroughly nice gentle person but noone would ever hear of warren he would always be a dim and faithful satellite of his dazzling primary as indeed he was perfectly content to be it was warren who had patiently explained to her the surprisingly complex mechanics of the descent at first sight it appeared simple enough to drop something straight down to the equator from a satellite hovering motionless above it but astrodynamics was full of paradoxes if you tried to slow down you moved faster if you took the shortest route you burned up the most fuel if you aimed in one direction you travelled in another and that was merely allowing for gravitational fields this time the situation was much more complicated noone had ever before tried to steer a spaceprobe trailing forty thousand kilometres of wire but the ashoka programme had worked perfectly all the way down to the edge of the atmosphere in a few minutes the controller here on sri kanda would take over for the final descent no wonder that morgan looked tense van said maxine softly but firmly over the private circuit stop sucking your thumb it makes you look like a baby morgan registered indignation then surprise and finally relaxed with a slightly embarrassed laugh thanks for the warning he said id hate to spoil my public image he looked with rueful amusement at the missing joint wondering when the selfappointed wits would stop chortling ha the engineer hoist by his own petard after all the times he had cautioned others he had grown careless and had managed to slash himself while demonstrating the properties of hyperfilament there had been practically no pain and surprisingly little inconvenience one day he would do something about it but he simply could not afford to spend a whole week hitched up to an organ regenerator just for two centimetres of thumb altitude two five zero said a calm impersonal voice from the control hut probe velocity one one six zero metres per second wire tension ninety percent nominal parachute deploys in two minutes after his momentary relaxation morgan was once again tense and alert like a boxer maxine duval could not help thinking watching an unknown but dangerous opponent whats the wind situation he snapped another voice answered this time far from impersonal i cant believe this it said in worried tones but monsoon control has just issued a gale warning this is no time for jokes theyre not joking ive just checked back but they guaranteed no gusts above thirty kilometres an hour theyve just raised that to sixty correction eighty somethings gone badly wrong ill say duval murmured to herself then she instructed her distant eyes and ears fade into the woodwork they wont want you around but dont miss anything leaving her rem to cope with these somewhat contradictory orders she switched to her excellent information service it took her less than thirty seconds to discover which meteorological station was responsible for the weather in the taprobane area and it was frustrating but not surprising to find that it was not accepting incoming calls from the general public leaving her competent staff to break through that obstacle she switched back to the mountain and she was astonished to find how much even in this short interval conditions had worsened the sky had become darker the microphones were picking up the faint distant roar of the approaching gale maxine duval had known such sudden changes of weather at sea and more than once had taken advantage of them in her ocean racing but this was unbelievably bad luck she sympathised with morgan whose dreams and hopes might all be swept away by this unscheduled this impossible blast of air altitude two zero zero probe velocity one one five metres a second tension ninetyfive percent nominal so the tension was increasing in more ways than one the experiment could not be called off at this late stage morgan would simply have to go ahead and hope for the best duval wished that she could speak to him but knew better than to interrupt him at this crisis altitude one nine zero velocity one one zero zero tension one hundred five percent first parachute deployment now so the probe was committed it was a captive of the earths atmosphere now the little fuel that remained must be used to steer it into the catching net spread out on the mountainside the cables supporting that net were already thrumming as the wind tore through them abruptly morgan emerged from the control hut and stared up at the sky then he turned and looked directly at the camera whatever happens maxine he said slowly and carefully the test is already ninetyfive percent successful no ninetynine percent weve made it for thirtysix thousand kilometres and have less than two hundred to go duval made no reply she knew that the words were not intended for her but for the figure in the complicated wheelchair just outside the hut the vehicle proclaimed the occupant only a visitor to earth would have need of such a device the doctors could now cure virtually all muscular defects but the physicists could not cure gravity how many powers and interests were now concentrated upon this mountain top the very forces of nature the bank of narodny mars the autonomous north african republic vannevar morgan and those gently implacable monks in their windswept eyrie maxine duval whispered instructions to her patient rem and the camera tilted smoothly upwards there was the summit crowned by the dazzling white walls of the temple here and there along its parapets duval could catch glimpses of orange robes fluttering in the gale as she had expected the monks were watching she zoomed towards them close enough to see individual faces though she had never met the maha thero she was confident that she could identify him but there was no sign of the prelate perhaps he was in the sanctum sanctorum focusing his formidable will upon some spiritual exercise maxine duval was not sure if morgans chief antagonist indulged in anything so naпve as prayer but if he had indeed prayed for this miraculous storm his request was about to be answered the gods of the mountain were awakening from their slumbers final approach with increasing technology goes increasing vulnerability the more man conquers nature the more liable he becomes to artificial catastrophes recent history provides sufficient proof of this for example the sinking of marina city the collapse of the tycho b dome the escape of the arabian iceberg from its towlines and the melting of the thor reactor we can be sure that the list will have even more impressive additions in the future perhaps the most terrifying prospects are those that involve psychological not only technological factors in the past a mad bomber or sniper could kill only a handful of people today it would not be difficult for a deranged engineer to assassinate a city the narrow escape of oneill space colony ii from just such a disaster in has been well documented such incidents in theory at least could be avoided by careful screening and failsafe procedures though all too often these live up only to the first half of their name there is also a most interesting but fortunately very rare type of event where the individual concerned is in a position of such eminence or has such unique powers that noone realises what he is doing until it is too late the devastation created by such mad geniuses can be worldwide as in the case of a hitler in a surprising number of instances nothing is heard of their activities thanks to a conspiracy of silence among their embarrassed peers a classic example has recently come to light with the publication of dame maxine duvals eagerly awaited and much postponed memoirs even now some aspects of the matter are still not entirely clear altitude one five zero velocity ninetyfive repeat ninetyfive heat shield jettisoned so the probe had safely entered the atmosphere and got rid of its excess speed but it was far too soon to start cheering not only were there a hundred and fifty vertical kilometres still to go but three hundred horizontal ones with a howling gale to complicate matters though the probe still carried a small amount of propellent its freedom to manoeuvre was very limited if the operator missed the mountain on the first approach he could not go round and try again altitude one two zero no atmospheric effects yet the little probe was spinning itself down from the sky like a spider descending its silken ladder i hope duval thought to herself that they have enough wire how infuriating if they run out only a few kilometres from the target just such tragedies had occurred with some of the first submarines cables three hundred years ago altitude eight zero approach nominal tension one hundred percent some air drag so the upper atmosphere was beginning to make itself felt though as yet only to the sensitive instruments aboard the tiny vehicle a small remotely controlled telescope had been set up beside the control truck and was now automatically tracking the still invisible probe morgan walked towards it and duvals rem followed him like a shadow anything in sight duval whispered quietly after a few seconds morgan shook his head impatiently and kept on peering through the eyepiece altitude six zero moving off to the left tension one hundred five percent correction one hundred ten still well within limits thought duval but things were starting to happen up there on the other side of the stratosphere surely morgan had the probe in sight now altitude five five giving twosecond impulse correction got it exclaimed morgan i can see the jet altitude five zero tension one hundred five percent hard to keep on course some buffeting it was inconceivable that with a mere fifty kilometres to go the little probe would not complete its thirtysixthousand kilometre journey but for that matter how many aircraft and spacecraft had come to grief in the last few metres altitude four five strong sheer wind going off course again three second impulse lost it said morgan in disgust cloud in the way altitude four zero buffeting badly tension peaking at one fifty i repeat one fifty percent that was bad duval knew that the breaking strain was two hundred percent one bad jerk and the experiment would be over altitude three five wind getting worse one second impulse propellent reserve almost gone tension still peaking up to one seventy another thirty percent thought duval and even that incredible fibre would snap like any other material when its tensile strength has been exceeded range three zero turbulence getting worse drifting badly to the left impossible to calculate correction movements too erratic ive got it morgan cried its through the clouds range two five not enough propellent to get back on course estimate well miss by three kilometres it doesnt matter shouted morgan crash where you can will do soonest range two zero wind forces increasing losing stabilisation payload starting to spin release the brake let the wire run out already done said that maddeningly calm voice duval could have imagined that a machine was speaking if she had not known that morgan had borrowed a top spacestation traffic controller for the job dispenser malfunction payload spin now five revs second wire probably entangled tension one eight zero percent one nine zero two zero zero range one five tension two one zero two two zero two three zero it cant last much longer thought duval only a dozen kilometres to go and the damned wire had got tangled up in the spinning probe tension zero repeat zero that was it the wire had snapped and must be slowly snaking back towards the stars doubtless the operators on ashoka would wind it in again but duval had now glimpsed enough of the theory to realise that this would be a long and complicated task and the little payload would crash somewhere down there in the fields and jungles of taprobane yet as morgan had said it had been more than ninetyfive percent successful next time when there was no wind there it is someone shouted a brilliant star had ignited between two of the cloudgalleons sailing across the sky it looked like a daylight meteor falling down to earth ironically as if mocking its builders the flare installed on the probe to assist terminal guidance had automatically triggered well it could still serve some useful purpose it would help to locate the wreckage duvals rem slowly pivoted so that she could watch the blazing daystar sail past the mountain and disappear into the east she estimated that it would land less than five kilometres away then she said take me back to dr morgan id like a word with him she had intended to make a few cheerful remarks loud enough for the martian banker to hear expressing her confidence that next time the lowering would be a complete success duval was still composing her little speech of reassurance when it was swept out of her mind she was to play back the events of the next thirty seconds until she knew them by heart but she was never quite sure if she fully understood them the legions of the king vannevar morgan was used to setbacks even disasters and this was he hoped a minor one his real worry as he watched the flare vanish over the shoulder of the mountain was that narodny mars would consider its money wasted the hardeyed observer in his elaborate wheelchair had been extremely uncommunicative earths gravity seemed to have immobilised his tongue as effectively as his limbs but this time he addressed morgan before the engineer could speak to him just one question dr morgan i know that this gale is unprecedented yet it happened so it may happen again what if it does when the tower is built morgan thought quickly it was impossible to give an accurate answer at such short notice and he could still scarcely believe what had happened at the very worst we might have to suspend operations briefly there could be some track distortion no wind forces that ever occur at this altitude could endanger the tower structure itself even this experimental fibre would have been perfectly safe if wed succeeded in anchoring it he hoped that this was a fair analysis in a few minutes warren kingsley would let him know whether it was true or not to his relief the martian answered with apparent satisfaction thank you that was all i wanted to know morgan however was determined to drive the lesson home and on mount pavonis of course such a problem couldnt possibly arise the atmospheric density there is less than a hundredth not for decades had he heard the sound that now crashed upon his ears but it was one that no man could ever forget its imperious summons overpowering the roar of the gale transported morgan halfway round the world he was no longer standing on a windswept mountainside he was beneath the dome of the hagia sophia looking up in awe and admiration at the work of men who had died sixteen centuries ago and in his ears sounded the tolling of the mighty bell that had once summoned the faithful to prayer the memory of istanbul faded he was back on the mountain more puzzled and confused than ever what was it that the monk had told him that kalidasas unwelcome gift had been silent for centuries and was allowed to speak only in time of disaster there had been no disaster here indeed as far as the monastery was concerned precisely the opposite just for a moment the embarrassing possibility occurred to morgan that the probe might have crashed into the temple precincts no that was out of the question it had missed the peak with kilometres to spare and in any event it was much too small an object to do any serious damage as it halffell halfglided out of the sky he stared up at the monastery from which the voice of the great bell still challenged the gale the orange robes had all vanished from the parapets there was not a monk in sight something brushed delicately against morgans cheek and he automatically flicked it aside it was hard even to think while that dolorous throbbing filled the air and hammered at his brain he supposed he had better walk up to the temple and politely ask the maha thero what had happened once more that soft silken contact against his face and this time he caught a glimpse of yellow out of the corner of his eye his reactions had always been swift he grabbed and did not miss the insect lay crumpled in the palm of his hand yielding up the last seconds of its ephemeral life even as morgan watched and the universe he had always known seemed to tremble and dissolve around him his miraculous defeat had been converted into an even more inexplicable victory yet he felt no sense of triumph only confusion and astonishment for he remembered now the legend of the golden butterflies driven by the gale in their hundreds and thousands they were being swept up the face of the mountain to die upon its summit kalidasas legions had at last achieved their goal and their revenge exodus what happened said sheik abdullah thats a question ill never be able to answer morgan told himself but he replied the mountain is ours mr president the monks have already started to leave its incredible how could a twothousandyearold legend he shook his head in baffled wonder if enough men believe in a legend it becomes true i suppose so but theres much more to it than that the whole chain of events still seems impossible thats always a risky word to use let me tell you a little story a dear friend a great scientist now dead used to tease me by saying that because politics is the art of the possible it appeals only to secondrate minds for the firstraters he claimed are only interested in the impossible and do you know what i answered no said morgan politely and predictably its lucky there are so many of us because someone has to run the world anyway if the impossible has happened you should accept it thankfully i accept it thought morgan reluctantly there is something very strange about a universe where a few dead butterflies can balance a billionton tower and there was the ironic role of the venerable parakarma who must surely now feel that he was the pawn of some malicious gods the monsoon control administrator had been most contrite and morgan had accepted his apologies with unusual graciousness he could well believe that the brilliant dr choam goldberg had revolutionised micrometeorology that noone had really understood all that he was doing and that he had finally had some kind of a nervous breakdown while conducting his experiments it would never happen again morgan had expressed his quite sincere hopes for the scientists recovery and had retained enough of his bureaucrats instincts to hint that in due course he might expect future considerations from monsoon control the administrator had signed off with grateful thanks doubtless wondering at morgans surprising magnanimity as a matter of interest asked the sheik where are the monks going i might offer them hospitality here our culture has always welcomed other faiths i dont know nor does ambassador rajasinghe but when i asked him he said theyll be all right an order thats lived frugally for three thousand years is not exactly destitute hmm perhaps we could use some of their wealth this little project of yours gets more expensive each time you see me not really mr president that last estimate includes a purely bookkeeping figure for deepspace operations which narodny mars has now agreed to finance they will locate a carbonaceous asteroid and navigate it to earth orbit theyve much more experience at this sort of work and it solves one of our main problems what about the carbon for their own tower they have unlimited amounts on deimos exactly where they need it narodny has already started a survey for suitable mining sites though the actual processing will have to be offmoon dare i ask why because of gravity even deimos has a few centimetres per second squared hyperifilament can only be manufactured in completely zero gee conditions theres no other way of guaranteeing a perfect crystalline structure with sufficient longrange organisation thank you van is it safe for me to ask why youve changed the basic design i liked that original bundle of four tubes two up and two down a straightforward subway system was something i could understandeven if it was upended ninety degrees not for the first time and doubtless not for the last morgan was amazed by the old mans memory and his grasp of details it was never safe to take anything for granted with him though his questions were sometimes inspired by pure curiosity often the mischievous curiosity of a man so secure that he had no need to uphold his dignity he never overlooked anything of the slightest importance im afraid our first thoughts were too earthorientated we were rather like the early motorcar designers who kept producing horseless carriages so now our design is a hollow square tower with a track up each face think of it as four vertical railroads where it starts from orbit its forty metres on a side and it tapers down to twenty when it reaches earth like a stalag stalac stalactite yes i had to look it up from the engineering point of view a good analogy now would be the old eiffel tower turned upside down and stretched out a hundred thousand times as much as that just about well i suppose theres no law that says a tower cant hang downwards we have one going upwards as well remember from the synchronous orbit out of the mass anchor that keeps the whole structure under tension and midway station i hope you havent changed that yes its still at the same place twentyfive thousand kilometres good i know ill never get there but i like to think about it he muttered something in arabic theres another legend you know mahomets coffin suspended between heaven and earth just like midway well arrange a banquet for you there mr president when we inaugurate the service even if you keep to your schedule and i admit you only slipped a year on the bridge ill be ninetyeight then no i doubt if ill make it but i shall said vannevar morgan to himself for now i know that the gods are on my side whatever gods may be iv the tower space express now dont you say begged warren kingsley itll never get off the ground i was tempted chuckled morgan as he examined the fullscale mockup it does look rather like an upended railroad coach thats exactly the image we want to sell kingsley answered you buy your ticket at the station check in your baggage settle down in your swivel seat and admire the view or you can go up to the loungecumbar and devote the next five hours to serious drinking until they carry you off at midway incidentally what do you think of the design sections idea nineteenthcentury pullman decor not much pullman cars didnt have five circular floors one on top of the other better tell design that theyve set their hearts on gaslighting if they want an antique flavour thats a little more appropriate i once saw an old space movie at the sydney art museum there was a shuttle craft of some kind that had a circular observation lounge just what we need do you remember its name oh lets think something like space wars im sure youll be able to trace it ill tell design to look it up now lets go inside do you want a hardhat no answered morgan brusquely that was one of the few advantages of being ten centimetres shorter than average height as they stepped into the mockup he felt an almost boyish thrill of anticipation he had checked the designs watched the computers playing with the graphics and layout everything here would be perfectly familiar but this was real solid true it would never leave the ground just as the old joke said but one day its identical brethren would be hurtling up through the clouds and climbing in only five hours to midway station twentyfive thousand kilometres from earth and all for about one dollars worth of electricity per passenger the fountains of paradise even now it was impossible to realise the full meaning of the coming revolution for the first time space itself would become as accessible as any point on the surface of the familiar earth in a few more decades if the average man wanted to spend a weekend on the moon he could afford to do so even mars would not be out of the question there were no limitations to what might now be possible morgan came back to earth with a bump as he almost tripped over a piece of badlylaid carpet sorry said his guide another of designs ideas that green is supposed to remind people of earth the ceilings are going to be blue getting deeper and deeper on the upper floors and they want to use indirect lighting everywhere so that the stars will be visible morgan shook his head thats a nice idea but it wont work if the lightings good enough for comfortable reading the glare will wipe out the stars youll need a section of the lounge that can be completely blackedout thats already planned for part of the bar you can order your drink and retire behind the curtains they were now standing in the lowest floor of the capsule a circular room eight metres in diameter three metres high all around were miscellaneous boxes cylinders and control panels bearing such labels as oxygen reserve battery co cracker medical temperature control everything was clearly of a provisional temporary nature liable to be rearranged at a moments notice anyone would think we were building a spaceship morgan commented incidentally whats the latest estimate of survival time as long as powers available at least a week even for a full load of fifty passengers which is really absurd since a rescue team could always reach them in three hours either from earth or midway barring a major catastrophe like damage to the tower or tracks if that ever happens i dont think there will be anyone to rescue but if a capsule gets stuck for some reason and the passengers dont go mad and gobble up all our delicious emergency compressed food tablets at once their biggest the old joke said but one day its identical brethren would be hurtling up through the clouds and climbing in only five hours to midway station twentyfive thousand kilometres from earth and all for about one dollars worth of electricity per passenger the fountains of paradise even now it was impossible to realise the full meaning of the coming revolution for the first time space itself would become as accessible as any point on the surface of the familiar earth in a few more decades if the average man wanted to spend a weekend on the moon he could afford to do so even mars would not be out of the question there were no limitations to what might now be possible morgan came back to earth with a bump as he almost tripped over a piece of badlylaid carpet sorry said his guide another of designs ideas that green is supposed to remind people of earth the ceilings are going to be blue getting deeper and deeper on the upper floors and they want to use indirect lighting everywhere so that the stars will be visible morgan shook his head thats a nice idea but it wont work if the lightings good enough for comfortable reading the glare will wipe out the stars youll need a section of the lounge that can be completely blackedout thats already planned for part of the bar you can order your drink and retire behind the curtains they were now standing in the lowest floor of the capsule a circular room eight metres in diameter three metres high all around were miscellaneous boxes cylinders and control panels bearing such labels as oxygen reserve battery co cracker medical temperature control everything was clearly of a provisional temporary nature liable to be rearranged at a moments notice anyone would think we were building a spaceship morgan commented incidentally whats the latest estimate of survival time as long as powers available at least a week even for a full load of fifty passengers which is really absurd since a rescue team could always reach them in three hours either from earth or midway barring a major catastrophe like damage to the tower or tracks if that ever happens i dont think there will be anyone to rescue but if a capsule gets stuck for some reason and the passengers dont go mad and gobble up all our delicious emergency compressed food tablets at once their biggest problem will be boredom the second floor was completely empty devoid even of temporary fittings someone had chalked a large rectangle on the curved plastic panel of the wall and printed inside it airlock here this will be the baggage room though were not sure if well need so much space if not it can be used for extra passengers now this floors much more interesting the third level contained a dozen aircrafttype chairs all of different designs two of them were occupied by realistic dummies male and female who looked very bored with the whole proceedings weve practically decided on this model said kingsley pointing to a luxurious tilting swivelchair with attached small table but well run the usual survey first morgan punched his fist into the seat cushion has anyone actually sat in it for five hours he asked yes a hundredkilo volunteer no bedsores if people complain well remind them of the pioneering days of aviation when it took five hours merely to cross the pacific and of course were offering lowgee comfort almost all the way the floor above was identical in concept though empty of chairs they passed through it quickly and reached the next level to which the designers had obviously devoted most attention the bar looked almost functional and indeed the coffee dispenser was actually working above it in an elaborately gilded frame was an old engraving of such uncanny relevance that it took morgans breath away a huge full moon dominated the upper left quadrant and racing towards it was a bulletshaped train towing four carriages from the windows of the compartment labelled first class tophatted victorian personages could be seen admiring the view where did you get hold of that morgan asked in astonished admiration looks as if the captions fallen off again kingsley apologised hunting round behind the bar ah here it is he handed morgan a piece of card upon which was printed in oldfashioned typeface projectile trains for the moon engraving from edition of from the earth to the moon direct in hours and minutes and a trip around ff by jules verne im sorry to say ive never read it said morgan when he had absorbed this information it might have saved me a lot of trouble but id like to know how he managed without any rails we shouldnt give jules too much credit or blame this picture was never meant to be taken seriously it was a joke of the artist well give design my compliments its one of their better ideas turning away from the dreams of the past morgan and kingsley walked towards the reality of the future through the wide observation window a backprojection system gave a stunning view of earth and not just any view morgan was pleased to note but the correct one taprobane itself was hidden of course being directly below but there was the whole subcontinent of hindustan right out to the dazzling snows of the himalayas you know morgan said suddenly it will be exactly like the bridge all over again people will take the trip just for the view midway station could be the biggest tourist attraction ever he glanced up at the azureblue ceiling anything worth looking at on the last floor not really the upper airlock is finalised but we havent decided where to put the lifesupport backup gear and the electronics for the trackcentring controls any problems there not with the new magnets powered or coasting we can guarantee safe clearance up to eight thousand kilometres an hour fifty percent above maximum design speed morgan permitted himself a mental sigh of relief this was one area in which he was quite unable to make any judgements and had to rely completely on the advice of others from the beginning it had been obvious that only some form of magnetic propulsion could operate at such speeds the slightest physical contact at more than a kilometre a second would result in disaster and yet the four pairs of guidance slots running up the faces of the tower had only centimetres of clearance around the magnets they had to be designed so that enormous restoring forces came instantly into play correcting any movement of the capsule away from the centre line as morgan followed kingsley down the spiral stairway which extended the full height of the mockup he was suddenly struck by a sombre thought im getting old he said to himself oh i could have climbed to the sixth level without any trouble but im glad we decided not to yet im only fiftynine and it will be at least five years even if all goes very well before the first passenger car rides up to midway station then another three years of tests calibration system tuneups make it ten years to be on the safe side though it was warm he felt a sudden chill for the first time it occurred to vannevar morgan that the triumph upon which he had set his soul might come too late for him and quite unconsciously he pressed his hand against the slim metal disc concealed inside his shirt cora why did you leave it until now dr sen had asked in a tone appropriate to a retarded child the usual reason morgan answered as he ran his good thumb along the seal of his shirt i was too busy and whenever i felt short of breath i blamed it on the height altitude was partly to blame of course youd better check all your people on the mountain how could you have overlooked anything so obvious how indeed thought morgan with some embarrassment all those monks some of them were over eighty they seemed so healthy that it never occurred to me the monks have lived up there for years theyre completely adapted but youve been hopping up and down several times a day twice at the most going from sea level to half an atmosphere in a few minutes well theres no great harm done if you follow instructions from now on mine and coras coras coronary alarm oh one of those things yes one of those things they save about ten million lives a year mostly top civil servants senior administrators distinguished scientists leading engineers and similar nitwits i often wonder if its worth the trouble nature may be trying to tell us something and were not listening remember your hippocratic oath bill retorted morgan with a grin and you must admit that ive always done just what you told me why my weight hasnt changed a kilo in the last ten years urn well youre not the worst of my patients said the slightly mollified doctor he fumbled round in his desk and produced a large holopad take your choicehere are the standard models any colour you like as long as its medic red morgan triggered the images and regarded them with distaste where do i have to carry the thing he asked or do you want to implant it that isnt necessary at least for the present in five years time maybe but perhaps not even then i suggest you start with this model its worn just under the breastbone so doesnt need remote sensors after a while you wont notice its there and it wont bother you unless its needed and then listen the doctor threw one of the numerous switches on his desk console and a sweet mezzosoprano voice remarked in a conversational tone i think you should sit down and rest for about ten minutes after a brief pause it continued it would be a good idea to lie down for half an hour another pause as soon as convenient make an appointment with dr sen then please take one of the red pills immediately i have called the ambulance just lie down and relax everything will be all right morgan almost clapped his hands over his ears to cut out the piercing whistle this is a cora alert will anyone within range of my voice please come immediately this is a cora alert will i think you get the general idea said the doctor restoring silence to his office of course the programmes and responses are individually tailored to the subject and theres a wide range of voices including some famous ones that will do very nicely when will my unit be ready ill call you in about three days oh yes theres an advantage to the chestworn units i should mention whats that one of my patients is a keen tennis player he tells me that when he opens his shirt the sight of that little red box has an absolutely devastating effect on his opponents game vertigo there had once been a time when a minor and often major chore of every civilised man had been the regular updating of his address book the universal code had made that unnecessary since once a persons lifetime identity number was known he could be located within seconds and even if his number was not known the standard search programme could usually find it fairly quickly given the approximate date of birth his profession and a few other details the development of global information systems had also rendered obsolete another annoying task it was only necessary to make a special notation against the names of those friends one wished to greet on their birthdays or other anniversaries and the household computer would do the rest on the appropriate day the right message would be automatically flashed to its destination and even though the recipient might shrewdly suspect that the warm words on his screen were entirely due to electronics the nominal sender not having thought of him for years the gesture was nevertheless welcome but the same technology that had eliminated one set of tasks had created even more demanding successors of these perhaps the most important was the design of the personal interest profile most men updated their pip on new years day or their birthday morgans list contained fifty items he had heard of people with hundreds they must spend all their waking hours battling with the flood of information unless they were like those notorious pranksters who enjoyed setting up news alerts on their consoles for such classic improbabilities as eggs dinosaur hatching of circle squaring of atlantis reemergence of christ second coming of loch ness monster capture of or finally world end of usually of course egotism and professional requirements ensured that the subscribers own name was the first item on every list morgan was no exception but the entries that followed were slightly unusual tower orbital tower space tower synchronous elevator space elevator orbital elevator synchronous these names covered most of the variations used by the media and ensured that he saw at least ninety percent of the news items concerning the project the vast majority of these were trivial and sometimes he wondered if it was worth searching for them the ones that really mattered would reach him quickly enough he was still rubbing his eyes and the bed had scarcely retracted itself into the wall of his modest apartment when morgan noticed that the alert was flashing on his console punching the coffee and readout buttons simultaneously he awaited the latest overnight sensation orbital tower shot down said the headline follow up asked the console you bet replied morgan now instantly awake during the next few seconds as he read the text display his mood changed from incredulity to indignation and then to concern he switched the whole news package to warren kingsley with a please call me back as soon as possible tag and settled down to breakfast still fuming less than five minutes later kingsley appeared on the screen well van he said with humorous resignation we should consider ourselves lucky its taken him five years to get round to us its the most ridiculous thing i ever heard of should we ignore it if we answer that will only give him publicity which is just what he wants kingsley nodded that would be the best policy for the present we shouldnt overreact at the same time he may have a point what do you mean kingsley had become suddenly serious and even looked a little uncomfortable there are psychological problems as well as engineering ones he said think it over ill see you at the office the image faded from the screen leaving morgan in a somewhat subdued frame of mind he was used to criticism and knew how to handle it indeed he thoroughly enjoyed the giveandtake of technical arguments with his peers and was seldom upset on those rare occasions when he lost it was not so easy to cope with donald duck that of course was not his real name but dr donald bickerstaffs peculiar brand of indignant negativism often recalled that mythological twentiethcentury character his degree was in pure mathematics his assets were an impressive appearance a mellifluous voice and an unshakeable belief in his ability to deliver judgements on any scientific subject in his own field indeed he was quite good morgan remembered with pleasure an oldstyle public lecture of the doctors which he had once attended at the royal institution for almost a week afterwards he had almost understood the peculiar properties of transfinite numbers unfortunately bickerstaff did not know his limitations though he had a devoted coterie of fans who subscribed to his information service in an earlier age he would have been called a popscientist he had an even larger circle of critics the kinder ones considered that he had been educated beyond his intelligence the others labelled him a selfemployed idiot it was a pity thought morgan that bickerstaff couldnt be locked in a room with dr goldbergparakarma they might annihilate each other like electron and positron the genius of one cancelling out the fundamental stupidity of the other that unshakeable stupidity against which as goethe lamented the gods themselves contend in vain no gods being currently available morgan knew that he would have to undertake the task himself though he had much better things to do with his time it might provide some comic relief and he had an inspiring precedent there were few pictures in the hotel room that had been one of morgans four temporary homes for almost a decade most prominent of them was a photograph so well faked that some visitors could not believe that its components were all perfectly genuine it was dominated by the graceful beautifully restored steamship ancestor of every vessel that could thereafter call itself modern by her side standing on the dock to which she had been miraculously returned a century and a quarter after her launch was dr vannevar morgan he was looking up at the scrollwork of the painted prow and a few metres away looking quizzically at him was isambard kingdom brunel hands thrust in pockets cigar clenched firmly in his mouth and wearing a very rumpled mudspattered suit everything in the photo was quite real morgan had indeed been standing beside the great britain on a sunny day in bristol the year after the gibraltar bridge was completed but brunel was back in still awaiting the launch of his later and more famous leviathan whose misfortunes were to break his body and spirit the photograph had been presented to morgan on his fiftieth birthday and it was one of his most cherished possessions his colleagues had intended it as a sympathetic joke morgans admiration for the greatest engineer of the nineteenth century being well known there were times however when he wondered if their choice was more appropriate than they realised the great eastern had devoured her creator the tower might yet do the same to him brunel of course had been surrounded by donald ducks the most persistent was one doctor dionysius lardner who had proved beyond all doubt that no steamship could ever cross the atlantic an engineer could refute criticisms which were based on errors of fact or simple miscalculations but the point that donald duck had raised was more subtle and not so easy to answer morgan suddenly recalled that his hero had to face something very similar three centuries ago he reached for his small but priceless collection of genuine books and pulled out the one he had read perhaps more often than any other rolts classic biography isambard kingdom brunel leafing through the wellthumbed pages he quickly found the item that had stirred his memory brunel had planned a railway tunnel almost three kilometres long a monstrous and extraordinary most dangerous and impracticable concept it was inconceivable said the critics that human beings could tolerate the ordeal of hurtling through its stygian depths no person would desire to be shut out from daylight with a consciousness that he had a superincumbent weight of earth sufficient to crush him in case of accident the noise of two trains passing would shake the nerves no passenger would be induced to go twice it was all so familiar the motto of the lardners and the bickerstaffs seemed to be nothing shall be done for the first time and yet sometimes they were right if only through the operation of the laws of chance donald duck made it sound so reasonable he had begun by saying in a display of modesty as unusual as it was spurious that he would not presume to criticise the engineering aspects of the space elevator he only wanted to talk about the psychological problems it would pose they could be summed up in one word vertigo the normal human being he had pointed out had a welljustified fear of high places only acrobats and tightrope artistes were immune to this natural reaction the tallest structure on earth was less than five kilometres high and there were not many people who would care to be hauled vertically up the piers of the gibraltar bridge yet that was nothing compared to the appalling prospect of the orbital tower who has not stood bickerstaff declaimed at the foot of some immense building staring up at its sheer precipitous face until it seemed about to topple and fall now imagine such a building soaring on and on through the clouds up into the blackness of space through the ionosphere past the orbits of all the great spacestations up and up until it reaches a large fraction of the way to the moon an engineering triumph no doubt but a psychological nightmare i suggest that some people will go mad at its mere contemplation and how many could face the vertiginous ordeal of the ride straight upwards hanging over empty space for twentyfive thousand kilometres to the first stop at the midway station it is no answer to say that perfectly ordinary individuals can fly in spacecraft to the same altitude and far beyond the situation then is completely different as indeed it is in ordinary atmospheric flight the normal man does not feel vertigo even in the open gondola of a balloon floating through the air a few kilometres above the ground but put him on the edge of a cliff at the same altitude and study his reactions then the reason for this difference is quite simple in an aircraft there is no physical connexion linking the observer and the ground psychologically therefore he is completely detached from the hard solid earth far below falling no longer has terrors for him he can look down upon remote and tiny landscapes which he would never dare to contemplate from any high elevation that saving physical detachment is precisely what the space elevator will lack the hapless passenger whisked up the sheer face of the gigantic tower will be all too conscious of his link with earth what guarantee can there possibly be that anyone not drugged or anaesthetised could survive such an experience i challenge dr morgan to answer dr morgan was still thinking of answers few of them polite when the screen lit up again with an incoming call when he pressed the accept button he was not in the least surprised to see maxine duval well van she said without any preamble what are you going to do im sorely tempted but i dont think i should argue with that idiot incidentally do you suppose that some aerospace organisation has put him up to it my men are already digging ill let you know if they find anything personally i feel its all his own work i recognise the hallmarks of the genuine article but you havent answered my question i havent decided im still trying to digest my breakfast what do you think i should do simple arrange a demonstration when can you fix it in five years if all goes well thats ridiculous youve got your first cable in position not cable tape dont quibble what load can it carry oh at the earth end a mere five hundred tons there you are offer donald duck a ride i wouldnt guarantee his safety would you guarantee mine youre not serious im always serious at this hour of the morning its time i did another story on the tower anyway that capsule mockup is very pretty but it doesnt do anything my viewers like action and so do i the last time we met you showed me drawings of those little cars the engineers will use to run up and down the cable i mean tapes what did you call them spiders ugh thats right i was fascinated by the idea heres something that has never been possible before by any technology for the first time you could sit still in the sky even above the atmosphere and watch the earth beneath something that no spacecraft can ever do id like to be the first to describe the sensation and clip donald ducks wings at the same time morgan waited for a full five seconds staring maxine straight in the eyes before he decided that she was perfectly serious i can understand he said rather wearily just how a poor struggling young mediagirl trying desperately to make a name for herself would jump at such an opportunity i dont want to blight a promising career but the answer is definitely no the doyen of mediapersons emitted several unladylike and even ungentlemanly words not commonly transmitted over public circuits before i strangle you in your own hyperfilament van she continued why not well if anything went wrong id never forgive myself spare the crocodile tears of course my untimely demise would be a major tragedy for your project but i wouldnt dream of going until youd made all the tests necessary and were sure it was one hundred percent safe it would look too much like a stunt as the victorians used to say so what look maxine theres a flash that new zealand has just sunk theyll need you in the studio but thanks for the generous offer dr vannevar morgan i know exactly why youre turning me down you want to be the first as the victorians used to say so what touchй but im warning you van just as soon as you have one of those spiders working youll be hearing from me again morgan shook his head sorry maxine he answered not a chance starglider plus eighty extract from god and starholme exactly eighty years ago the robot interstellar probe now known as starglider entered the solar system and conducted its brief but historic dialogue with the human race for the first time we knew what we had always suspected that ours was not the only intelligence in the universe and that out among the stars were far older and perhaps far wiser civilisations after that encounter nothing would ever be the same again and yet paradoxically in many ways very little has changed mankind still goes about its business much as it has always done how often do we stop to think that the starholmers back on their own planet have already known of our existence for twentyeight years or that almost certainly we shall be receiving their first direct messages only twentyfour years from now and what if as some have suggested they themselves are already on the way men have an extraordinary and perhaps fortunate ability to tune out of their consciousness the most awesome future possibilities the roman farmer ploughing the slopes of vesuvius gave no thought to the mountain smoking overhead half the twentieth century lived with the hydrogen bomb half the twentyfirst with the golgotha virus we have learned to live with the threat or the promise of starholme starglider showed us many strange worlds and races but it revealed almost no advanced technology and so had minimal impact upon the technicallyorientated aspects of our culture was this accidental or the result of some deliberate policy there are many questions one would like to ask starglider now that it is too late or too early on the other hand it did discuss many matters of philosophy and religion and in these fields its influence was profound although the phrase nowhere occurs in the transcripts starglider is generally credited with the famous aphorism belief in god is apparently a psychological artefact of mammalian reproduction but what if this is true it is totally irrelevant to the question of gods actual existence as i shall now proceed to demonstrate swami krisnamurthi the cruel sky the eye could follow the tape much further by night than by day at sunset when the warning lights were switched on it became a thin band of incandescence slowly dwindling away until at some indefinite point it was lost against the background of stars already it was the greatest wonder of the world until morgan put his foot down and restricted the site to essential engineering staff there was a continual flood of visitors pigrims someone had ironically called them paying homage to the sacred mountains last miracle they would all behave in exactly the same way first they would reach out and gently touch the fivecentimetrewide band running their finger tips along it with something approaching reverence then they would listen ears pressed against the smooth cold material of the ribbon as if they hoped to catch the music of the spheres there were some indeed who claimed to have heard a deep bass note at the uttermost threshold of audibility but they were deluding themselves even the highest harmonics of the tapes natural frequency were far below the range of human hearing and some would go away shaking their heads saying youll never get me to ride up that thing but they were the ones who had made just the same remark about the fusion rocket the space shuttle the airplane the automobile even the steam locomotive to these sceptics the usual answer was dont worry this is merely part of the scaffolding one of the four tapes that will guide the tower down to earth riding up the final structure will be exactly like taking an elevator in any high building except that the trip will be longer and much more comfortable maxine duvals trip on the other hand would be very short and not particularly comfortable but once morgan had capitulated he had done his best to make sure that it would be uneventful the flimsy spider a prototype test vehicle looking like a motorised bosuns chair had already made a dozen ascents to twenty kilometres with twice the load it would be carrying now there had been the usual minor teething problems but nothing serious the last five runs had been completely troublefree and what could go wrong if there was a power failure almost unthinkable in such a simple batteryoperated system gravity would bring maxine safely home the automatic brakes limiting the speed of descent the only real risk was that the drive mechanism might jam trapping spider and its passenger in the upper atmosphere and morgan had an answer even for this only fifteen kilometres maxine had protested a glider can do better than that but you cant with nothing more than an oxygen mask of course if you like to wait a year until we have the operational unit with its lifesupport system whats wrong with a spacesuit morgan had refused to budge for his own good reasons though he hoped it would not be needed a small jetcrane was standing by at the foot of sri kanda its highly skilled operators were used to odd assignments they would have no difficulty in rescuing a stranded maxine even at twenty kilometres altitude but there was no vehicle in existence that could reach her at twice that height above forty kilometres was nomans land too low for rockets too high for balloons in theory of course a rocket could hover beside the tape for a very few minutes before it burned up all its propellent the problems of navigation and actual contact with the spider were so horrendous that morgan had not even bothered to think about them it could never happen in real life and he hoped that no producer of videodrama would decide that there was good material here for a cliffhanger that was the sort of publicity he could do without maxine duval looked rather like a typical antarctic tourist as glittering in her metalfoil thermosuit she walked towards the waiting spider and the group of technicians round it she had chosen the time carefully the sun had risen only an hour ago and its slanting rays would show the taprobanean landscape to best advantage her remote even younger and huskier than on the last memorable occasion recorded the sequence of events for her systemwide audience she had as always been thoroughly rehearsed there was no fumbling or hesitation as she strapped herself in pressed the battery charge button took a deep draught of oxygen from her facemask and checked the monitors on all her video and sound channels then like a fighter pilot in some old historical movie she signalled thumbs up and gently eased the speed control forward there was a small burst of ironic clapping from the assembled engineers most of whom had already taken joyrides up to heights of a few kilometres someone shouted ignition we have lift off and moving about as swiftly as a brass birdcage elevator in the reign of victoria i spider began its stately ascent this must be like ballooning maxine told herself smooth effortless silent no not completely silent she could hear the gentle whirr of the motors powering the multiple drive wheels that gripped the flat face of the tape there was none of the sway or vibration that she had half expected despite its slimness the incredible band she was climbing was as rigid as a bar of steel and the vehicles gyros were holding it rocksteady if she closed her eyes she could easily imagine that she was already ascending the final tower but of course she would not close her eyes there was so much to see and absorb there was even a good deal to hear it was amazing how well sound carried for the conversations below were still quite audible she waved to vannevar morgan then looked for warren kingsley to her surprise she was unable to find him though he had helped her aboard spider he had now vanished then she remembered his frank admission sometimes he made it sound almost like a wry boast that the best structural engineer in the world couldnt stand heights everyone had some secret or perhaps notsosecret fear maxine did not appreciate spiders and wished that the vehicle she was riding had some other name yet she could handle one if it was really necessary the creature she could never bear to touch though she had met it often enough on her diving expeditions was the shy and harmless octopus the whole mountain was now visible though from directly above it was impossible to appreciate its true height the two ancient stairways winding up its face might have been oddly twisting level roads along their entire length as far as maxine could observe there was no sign of life indeed one section had been blocked by a fallen tree as if nature had given advance notice after three thousand years that she was about to reclaim her own leaving camera one pointed downwards maxine started to pan with number two fields and forests drifted across the monitor screen then the distant white domes of ranapura then the dark waters of the inland sea and presently there was yakkagala she zoomed on to the rock and could just make out the faint pattern of the ruins covering the entire upper surface the mirror wall was still in shadow as was the gallery of the princesses not that there was any hope of making them out from such a distance but the layout of the pleasure gardens with their ponds and walkways and massive surrounding moat was clearly visible the line of tiny white plumes puzzled her for a moment until she realised that she was looking down upon another symbol of kalidasas challenge to the gods his socalled fountains of paradise she wondered what the king would have thought could he have seen her rising so effortlessly towards the heaven of his envious dreams it was almost a year since she had spoken to ambassador rajasinghe on a sudden impulse she called the villa hello johan she greeted him how do you like this view of yakkagala so youve talked morgan into it how does it feel exhilarating thats the only word for it and unique ive flown and travelled in everything you can mention but this feels quite different to ride secure the cruel sky what was that an english poet early twentieth century i care not if you bridge the seas or ride secure the cruel sky well i care and im feeling secure now i can see the whole island even the hindustan coast how high am i van coming up to twelve kilometres maxine is your oxygen mask on tight confirmed i hope its not muffling my voice dont worry youre still unmistakeable three kilometres to go how much gas is still left in the tank sufficient and if you try to go above fifteen ill use the override to bring you home i wouldnt dream of it and congratulations by the way this is an excellent observing platform you may have customers standing in line weve thought of that the comsat and metsat people are already making bids we can give them relays and sensors at any height they like it will all help to pay the rent i can see you exclaimed rajasinghe suddenly just caught your reflection in the scope now youre waving your arm arent you lonely up there for a moment there was an uncharacteristic silence then maxine duval answered quietly not as lonely as yuri gagarin must have been a hundred kilometres higher still van you have brought something new into the world the sky may still be cruel but you have tamed it there may be some people who could never face this ride i feel very sorry for them the billionton diamond in the last seven years much had been done yet there was still so much to do mountains or at least asteroids had been moved earth now possessed a second natural moon circling just above synchronous altitude it was less than a kilometre across and was rapidly becoming smaller as it was rifled of its carbon and other light elements whatever was left the core of iron tailings and industrial slag would form the counterweight that would keep the tower in tension it would be the stone in the fortythousandkilometrelong sling that now turned with the planet once every twentyfour hours fifty kilometres eastwards of ashoka station floated the huge industrial complex which processed the weightless but not massless megatons of raw material and converted them into hyperfilament because the final product was more than ninety percent carbon with its atoms arranged in a precise crystalline lattice the tower had acquired the popular nickname the billion ton diamond the jewellers association of amsterdam had sourly pointed out that hyperfilament wasnt diamond at all if it was then the tower weighed five times ten to the fifteen carats carats or tons such enormous quantities of material had taxed to the utmost the resources of the space colonies and the skills of the orbital technicians into the automatic mines production plants and zerogravity assembly systems had gone much of the engineering genius of the human race painfully acquired during two hundred years of spacefaring soon all the components of the tower a few standardised units manufactured by the million would be gathered in huge floating stockpiles waiting for the robot handlers then the tower would grow in two opposite directions down to earth and simultaneously up to the orbital massanchor the whole process being adjusted so that it would always be in balance its crosssection would decrease steadily from orbit where it would be under the maximum stress down to earth it would also taper off towards the anchoring counterweight when its task was complete the entire construction complex would be launched into a transfer orbit to mars this was a part of the contract which had caused some heartburning among terrestrial politicians and financiers now that belatedly the space elevators potential was being realised the martians had driven a hard bargain though they would wait another five years before they had any return on their investment they would then have a virtual construction monopoly for perhaps another decade morgan had a shrewd suspicion that the pavonis tower would merely be the first of several mars might have been designed as a location for space elevator systems and its energetic occupants were not likely to miss such an opportunity if they made their world the centre of interplanetary commerce in the years ahead good luck to them morgan had other problems to worry about and some of them were still unsolved the tower for all its overwhelming size was merely the support for something much more complex along each of its four sides must run thirtysix thousand kilometres of track capable of operation at speeds never before attempted this had to be powered for its entire length by superconducting cables linked to massive fusion generators the whole system being controlled by an incredibly elaborate failsafe computer network the upper terminal where passengers and freight would transfer between the tower and the spacecraft docked to it was a major project in itself so was midway station so was earth terminal now being lasered into the heart of the sacred mountain and in addition to all this there was operation cleanup for two hundred years satellites of all shapes and sizes from loose nuts and bolts to entire space villages had been accumulating in earth orbit all that came below the extreme elevation of the tower at any time now had to be accounted for since they created a possible hazard threequarters of this material was abandoned junk much of it long forgotten now it had to be located and somehow disposed of fortunately the old orbital forts were superbly equipped for this task their radars designed to locate oncoming missiles at extreme ranges with no advance warning could easily pinpoint the debris of the early space age then their lasers vapourised the smaller satellites while the larger ones were nudged into higher and harmless orbits some of historic interest were recovered and brought back to earth during this operation there were quite a few surprises for example three chinese astronauts who had perished on some secret mission and several reconnaissance satellites constructed from such an ingenious mix of components that it was quite impossible to discover what country had launched them not of course that it now mattered a great deal since they were at least a hundred years old the multitude of active satellites and space stations forced for operational reasons to remain close to earth all had to have their orbits carefully checked and in some cases modified but nothing of course could be done about the random and unpredictable visitors which might arrive at any minute from the outer reaches of the solar system like all the creations of mankind the tower would be exposed to meteorites several times a day its network of seismometers would detect milligram impacts and once or twice a year minor structural damage might be expected and sooner or later during the centuries to come it might encounter a giant which could put one or more tracks out of action for a while in the worst possible case the tower might even be severed somewhere along its length that was about as likely to happen as the impact of a large meteorite upon london or tokyo which presented roughly the same target area the inhabitants of those cities did not lose much sleep worrying over this possibility nor did vannevar morgan whatever problems might still lie ahead no one doubted now that the orbital tower was an idea whose time had come v ascension a place of silent storms between heaven and earth lies an invisible region of which the old philosophers never dreamed not until the dawn of the twentieth century to be precise on december did it make its first impact upon human affairs on that day guglielmo marconi radioed the three dots of the morse letter s across the atlantic many experts had declared this to be impossible as electromagnetic waves could travel only in straight lines and would be unable to bend round the curve of the globe marconis feat not only heralded the age of worldwide communications but also proved that high up in the atmosphere there exists an electrified mirror capable of reflecting radio waves back to earth the kennellyheaviside layer as it was originally named was soon found to be a region of great complexity containing at least three main layers all subject to major variations in height and intensity at their upper limit they merge into the van allen radiation belts whose discovery was the first triumph of the early space age this vast region beginning at a height of approximately fifty kilometres and extending outwards for several radii of the earth is now known as the ionosphere its exploration by rockets satellites and radio waves has been a continuing process for more than two centuries i should like to pay a tribute to my precursors in this enterprise the americans tuve and breit the englishman appleton the norwegian stшrmer and especially the man who in won the very award i am now so honoured to accept your countryman hannes alfvйn the ionosphere is the wayward child of the sun even now its behaviour is not always predictable in the days when longrange radio depended upon its idiosyncrasies it saved many lives but more men than we shall ever know were doomed when it swallowed their despairing signals without trace for less than one century before the communications satellites took over it was our invaluable but erratic servant a previously unsuspected natural phenomenon worth countless billions of dollars to the three generations who exploited it only for a brief moment in history was it of direct concern to mankind and yet if it had never existed we should not be here in one sense therefore it was of vital importance even to pretechnological humanity right back to the first apeman indeed right back to the first living creatures on this planet for the ionosphere is part of the shield that protects us from the suns deadly xray and ultraviolet radiations if they had penetrated to sea level perhaps some kind of life might still have arisen on earth but it would never have evolved into anything remotely resembling us because the ionosphere like the atmosphere below it is ultimately controlled by the sun it too has its weather during times of solar disturbance it is blasted by planetwide gales of charged particles and twisted into loops and whirls by the earths magnetic field on such occasions it is no longer invisible for it reveals itself in the glowing curtains of the aurora one of natures most awesome spectacles illuminating the cold polar nights with its eerie radiance even now we do not understand all the processes occurring in the ionosphere one reason why it has proved difficult to study is because all our rocket and satelliteborne instruments race through it at thousands of kilometres an hour we have never been able to stand still to make observations now for the very first time the construction of the proposed orbital tower gives us a chance of establishing fixed observatories in the ionosphere it is also possible that the tower may itself modify the characteristics of the ionosphere though it will certainly not as dr bickerstaff has suggested shortcircuit it why should we study this region now that it is no longer important to the communications engineer well apart from its beauty its strangeness and its scientific interest its behaviour is closely linked with that of the sun the master of our destiny we know now that the sun is not the steady wellbehaved star that our ancestors believed it undergoes both long and shortperiod fluctuations at the present time it is still emerging from the socalled maunder minimum of to as a result the climate now is milder than at any time since the early middle ages but how long will this upswing last even more important when will the inevitable downturn begin and what effect will this have upon climate weather and every aspect of human civilization not only on this planet but on the others as well for they are all children of the sun some very speculative theories suggest that the sun is now entering a period of instability which may produce a new ice age more universal than any in the past if this is true we need every scrap of information we can get to prepare for it even a centurys warning might not be long enough the ionosphere helped to create us it launched the communications revolution it may yet determine much of our future that is why we must continue the study of this vast turbulent arena of solar and electric forces this mysterious place of silent storms the wounded sun the last time that morgan had seen dev his nephew had been a child now he was a boy in his early teens and at their next meeting at this rate he would be a man the engineer felt only a mild sense of guilt family ties had been weakening for the last two centuries he and his sister had little in common except the accident of genetics though they exchanged greetings and small talk perhaps halfadozen times a year and were on the best of terms he was not even sure when and where they had last met yet when he greeted the eager intelligent boy morgan was aware of a certain bittersweet wistfulness he had no son to continue the family name long ago he had made that choice between work and life which can seldom be avoided at the highest levels of human endeavour on three occasions not including the liaison with ingrid he might have taken a different path but accident or ambition had deflected him he knew the terms of the bargain he had made and he accepted them it was too late now to grumble about the small print any fool could shuffle genes and most did but whether or not history gave him credit few men could have achieved what he had done and was about to do in the last three hours dev had seen far more of earth terminus than any of the usual run of vips he had entered the mountain at ground level along the almost completed approach to the south station and had been given the quick tour of the passenger and baggage handling facilities the control centre and the switching yard where capsules would be routed from the east and west down tracks to the north and south up ones he had stared up the fivekilometrelong shaft like a giant gun barrel aimed at the stars as several hundred reporters had already remarked in hushed voices along which the lines of traffic would rise and descend and his questions had exhausted three guides before the last one had thankfully handed him over to his uncle here he is van said warren kingsley as they arrived via the highspeed elevator at the truncated summit of the mountain take him away before he grabs my job i didnt know you were so keen on engineering dev the boy looked hurt and a little surprised dont you remember uncle that no meccamax you gave me on my tenth birthday of course of course i was only joking youre not cold up here unlike the wellprotected adults the boy had disdained the usual light thermocoat no im fine what kind of jet is that when are you going to open up the shaft can i touch the tapes see what i mean chuckled kingsley one thats sheik abdullahs special his son feisal is visiting two well keep this lid on until the tower reaches the mountain and enters the shaft we need it as a working platform and it keeps out the rain three you can touch the tapes if you want to dont run its bad for you at this altitude if youre twelve i doubt it said kingsley towards devs rapidly receding back taking their time they caught up with him at the east face anchor the boy was staring as so many thousands of others had already done at the narrow band of dull grey that rose straight out of the ground and soared vertically into the sky devs gaze followed it up up up until his head was tilted as far back as it would go morgan and kingsley did not follow suit though the temptation after all these years was still strong nor did they warn him that some visitors got so giddy that they collapsed and were unable to walk away without assistance the boy was tough he gazed intently at the zenith for almost a minute as if hoping to see the thousands of men and millions of tons of material poised there beyond the deep blue of the sky then he closed his eyes with a grimace shook his head and looked down at his feet for an instant as if to reassure himself that he was still on the solid dependable earth he reached out a cautious hand and stroked the narrow ribbon linking the planet with its new moon what would happen he asked if it broke that was an old question most people were surprised at the answer very little at this point its under practically no tension if you cut the tape it would just hang there waving in the breeze kingsley made an expression of distaste both knew of course that this was a considerable oversimplification at the moment each of the four tapes was stressed at about a hundred tons but that was negligible compared to the design loads they would be handling when the system was in operation and they had been integrated into the structure of the tower there was no point however in confusing the boy with such details dev thought this over then he gave the tape an experimental flick as if he hoped to extract a musical note from it but the only response was an unimpressive click that instantly died away if you hit it with a sledgehammer said morgan and came back about ten hours later youd be just in time for the echo from midway not any longer said kingsley too much damping in the system dont be a spoilsport warren now come and see something really interesting they walked to the centre of the circular metal disc that now capped the mountain and sealed the shaft like a giant saucepan lid here equidistant from the four tapes down which the tower was being guided earthwards was a small geodesic hut looking even more temporary than the surface on which it had been erected it housed an oddlydesigned telescope pointing straight upwards and apparently incapable of being aimed in any other direction this is the best time for viewing just before sunset then the base of the tower is nicely lit up talking of the sun said kingsley just look at it now its even clearer than yesterday there was something approaching awe in his voice as he pointed at the brilliant flattened ellipse sinking down into the western haze the horizon mists had dimmed its glare so much that one could stare at it in comfort not for more than a century had such a group of spots appeared they stretched across almost half the golden disc making it seem as if the sun had been stricken by some malignant disease or pierced by falling worlds yet not even mighty jupiter could have created such a wound in the solar atmosphere the largest spot was a quarter of a million kilometres across and could have swallowed a hundred earths theres another big auroral display predicted for tonight professor sessui and his merry men certainly timed it well lets see how theyre getting on said morgan as he made some adjustments to the eyepiece have a look dev the boy peered intently for a moment then answered i can see the four tapes going inwards i mean upwards until they disappear nothing in the middle another pause no not a sign of the tower correct its still six hundred kilometres up and were on the lowest power of the telescope now im going to zoom fasten your seatbelt dev gave a little laugh at the ancient clichй familiar from dozens of historical dramas yet at first he could see no alteration except that the four lines pointing towards the centre of the field were becoming a little less sharp it took him a few seconds to realise that no change could be expected as his point of view hurtled upwards along the axis of the system the quartet of tapes would look exactly the same at any point along its length then quite suddenly it was there taking him by surprise even though he had been expecting it a tiny bright spot had materialised in the exact centre of the field it was expanding as he watched it and now for the first time he had a real sensation of speed a few seconds later he could make out a small circle no now both brain and eye agreed that it was a square he was looking directly up at the base of the tower crawling earthwards along its guiding tapes at a couple of kilometres a day the four tapes had now vanished being far too small to be visible at this distance but that square fixed magically in the sky continued to grow though now it had become fuzzy under the extreme magnification what do you see asked morgan a bright little square good thats the underside of the tower still in full sunlight when its dark down here you can see it with the naked eye for another hour before it enters the earths shadow now do you see anything else nooo replied the boy after a long pause you should theres a team of scientists visiting the lowest section to set up some research equipment theyve just come down from midway if you look carefully youll see their transporter its on the south track that will be the right side of the picture look for a bright spot about a quarter the size of the tower sorry uncle i cant find it you have a look well the seeing may have got worse sometimes the tower disappears completely though the atmosphere may look even before morgan could take devs place at the eyepiece his personal receiver gave two shrill double beeps a second later kingsleys alarm also erupted it was the first time the tower had ever issued a fourstar emergency alert the end of the line no wonder they called it the transiberian railway even on the easy downhill run the journey from midway station to the base of the tower lasted fifty hours one day it would take only five but that still lay two years in the future when the tracks were energised and their magnetic fields activated the inspection and maintenance vehicles that now ran up and down the faces of the tower were propelled by oldfashioned tyres gripping the interior of the guidance slots even if the limited power of the batteries permitted it was not safe to operate such a system at more than five hundred kilometres an hour yet everyone had been far too busy to be bored professor sessui and his three students had been observing checking their instruments and making sure that no time would be wasted when they transferred into the tower the capsule driver his engineering assistant and the one steward who comprised the entire cabin staff were also fully occupied for this was no routine trip the basement twentyfive thousand kilometres below midway and now only six hundred kilometres from earth had never been visited since it was built until now there had been no purpose in going there since the handful of monitors had never reported anything amiss not that there was much to go wrong as the basement was merely a fifteenmetresquare pressurised chamber one of the scores of emergency refuges at intervals along the tower professor sessui had used all his considerable influence to borrow this unique site now crawling down through the ionosphere at two kilometres a day towards its rendezvous with earth it was essential he had argued forcibly to get his equipment installed before the peak of the current sunspot maximum already solar activity had reached unprecedented levels and sessuis young assistants often found it hard to concentrate on their instruments the magnificent auroral displays outside were too much of a distraction for hours on end both northern and southern hemispheres were filled with slowly moving curtains and streamers of greenish light beautiful and aweinspiring yet only a pale ghost of the celestial firework displays taking place around the poles it was rare indeed for the aurora to wander so far from its normal domains only once in generations did it invade the equatorial skies sessui had driven his students back to work with the admonition that they would have plenty of time for sightseeing during the long climb back to midway yet it was noticeable that even the professor himself sometimes stood at the observation window for minutes at a time entranced by the spectacle of the burning heavens someone had christened the project expedition to earth which as far as distance was concerned was ninetyeight percent accurate as the capsule crawled down the face of the tower at its miserable five hundred klicks the increasing closeness of the planet beneath made itself obvious for gravity was slowly increasing from the delightful lessthanlunar buoyancy of midway to almost its full terrestrial value to any experienced space traveller this was strange indeed feeling any gravity before the moment of atmospheric entry seemed a reversal of the normal order of things apart from complaints about the food stoically endured by the overworked steward the journey had been devoid of incident a hundred kilometres from the basement the brakes had been gently applied and speed had been halved it was halved again at fifty kilometers for as one of the students remarked wouldnt it be embarrassing if we ran off the end of the track the driver retorted that this was inpossible as the guidance slots down which the capsule was falling terminated several metres short of the towers end there was also an elaborate buffer system just in case all four independent sets of brakes failed to work and everyone agreed that the joke besides being perfectly ridiculous was in extremely poor taste meteor the vast artificial lake known for two thousand years as the sea of paravana lay calm and peaceful beneath the stone gaze of its builder though few now visited the lonely statue of kalidasas father his work if not his fame had outlasted that of his son and it had served his country infinitely better bringing food and drink to a hundred generations of men and to many more generations of birds deer buffalo monkeys and their predators like the sleek and wellfed leopard now drinking at the waters edge the big cats were becoming rather too common and were inclined to be a nuisance now that they no longer had anything to fear from hunters but they never attacked men unless they were cornered or molested confident of his security the leopard was leisurely drinking his fill as the shadows round the lake lengthened and twilight advanced from the east suddenly he pricked up his ears and became instantly alert but no mere human senses could have detected any change in land water or sky the evening was as tranquil as ever and then directly out of the zenith came a faint whistling that grew steadily to a rumbling roar with tearing ripping undertones quite unlike that of a reentering spacecraft up in the sky something metallic was sparkling in the last rays of the sun growing larger and larger and leaving a trail of smoke behind it as it expanded it disintegrated pieces shot off in all directions some of them burning as they did so for a few seconds an eye as keen as the leopards might have glimpsed a roughly cylindrical object before it exploded into a myriad fragments but the leopard did not wait for the final catastrophe it had already disappeared into the jungle the sea of paravana erupted in sudden thunder a geyser of mud and spray shot a hundred metres into the air a fountain far surpassing those of yakkagala and one indeed almost as high as the rock itself it hung suspended for a moment in futile defiance of gravity then tumbled back into the shattered lake already the sky was full of waterfowl wheeling in startled flight almost as numerous flapping among them like leathery pterodactyls who had somehow survived into the modern age were the big fruitbats who normally took to the air only after dusk now equally terrified birds and bats shared the sky together the last echoes of the crash died away into the encircling jungle silence swiftly returned to the lake but long minutes passed before its mirror surface was restored and the little waves ceased to scurry back and forth beneath the unseeing eyes of paravana the great death in orbit every large building it is said claims a life fourteen names were engraved on the piers of the gibraltar bridge but thanks to an almost fanatical safety campaign casualties on the tower had been remarkably low there had indeed been one year without a single death and there had been one year with four two of them particularly harrowing a spacestation assembly supervisor accustomed to working under zero gravity had forgotten that though he was in space he was not in orbit and a lifetimes experience had betrayed him he had plummeted more than fifteen thousand kilometres to burn up like a meteor upon entry into the atmosphere unfortunately his suit radio had remained switched on during those last few minutes it was a bad year for the tower the second tragedy had been much more protracted and equally public an engineer on the counterweight far beyond synchronous orbit had failed to fasten her safety belt properly and had been flicked off into space like a stone from a sling she was in no danger at this altitude either of falling back to earth or of being launched on an escape trajectory unfortunately her suit held less than two hours air there was no possibility of rescue at such short notice and despite a public outcry no attempt was made the victim had cooperated nobly she had transmitted her farewell messages and then with thirty minutes of oxygen still unused had opened her suit to vacuum the body was recovered a few days later when the inexorable laws of celestial mechanics brought it back to the perigee of its long ellipse these tragedies flashed through morgans mind as he took the highspeed elevator down to the operations room closely followed by a sombre warren kingsley and the now almost forgotten dev but this catastrophe was of an altogether different type involving an explosion at or near the basement of the tower that the transporter had fallen to earth was obvious even before the garbled report had been received of a giant meteor shower somewhere in central taprobane it was useless to speculate until he had more facts and in this case where all the evidence had probably been destroyed they might never be available he knew that space accidents seldom had a single cause they were usually the result of a chain of events often quite harmless in themselves all the foresight of the safety engineers could not guarantee absolute reliability and sometimes their own overelaborate precautions contributed to disaster morgan was not ashamed of the fact that the safety of the project now concerned him far more than any loss of life nothing could be done about the dead except to ensure that the same accident could never happen again but that the almost completed tower might be endangered was a prospect too appalling to contemplate the elevator floated to a halt and he stepped out into the operations room just in time for the evenings second stunning surprise failsafe five kilometres from the terminus driverpilot rupert chang had reduced speed yet again now for the first time the passengers could see the face of the tower as something more than a featureless blur dwindling away to infinity in both directions upwards it was true the twin grooves along which they were riding still stretched foreveror at least for twentyfive thousand kilometres which on the human scale was much the same but downwards the end was already in sight the truncated base of the tower was clearly silhouetted against the verdant green background of taprobane which it would reach and unite with in little more than a year across the display panel the red alarm symbols flashed yet again chang studied them with a frown of annoyance then pressed the reset button they flickered once then vanished the first time this had happened two hundred kilometres higher there had been a hasty consultation with midway control a quick check of all systems had revealed nothing amiss indeed if all the warnings were to be believed the transporters passengers were already dead everything had gone outside the limits of tolerance it was obviously a fault in the alarm circuits themselves and professor sessuis explanation was accepted with general relief the vehicle was no longer in the pure vacuum environment for which it had been designed the ionospheric turmoil it had now entered was triggering the sensitive detectors of the warning systems someone should have thought of that chang had grumbled but with less than an hour to go he was not really worried he would make constant manual checks of all the critical parameters midway approved and in any case there was no alternative battery condition was perhaps the item that concerned him most the nearest charging point was two thousand kilometres higher up and if they couldnt climb back to that they would be in trouble but chang was quite happy on this score during the braking process the transporters drivemotors had been functioning as dynamos and ninety percent of its gravitational energy had been pumped back into the batteries now that they were fully charged the surplus hundreds of kilowatts still being generated should be diverted into space through the big cooling fins at the rear those fins as changs colleagues had often pointed out to him made his unique vehicle look rather like an oldtime aerial bomb by this time at the very end of the braking process they should have been glowing a dull red chang would have been very worried indeed had he known that they were still comfortably cool for energy can never be destroyed it has to go somewhere and very often it goes to the wrong place when the firebattery compartment sign came on for the third time chang did not hesitate to reset it a real fire he knew would have triggered the extinguishers in fact one of his biggest worries was that these might operate unnecessarily there were several anomalies on the board now especially in the batterycharging circuits as soon as the journey was over and he had powered down the transporter chang was going to climb into the motorroom and give everything a good oldfashioned eyeball inspection as it happened his nose alerted him first when there was barely more than a kilometre to go even as he stared incredulously at the thin wisp of smoke oozing out of the control board the coldly analytical part of his mind was saying what a lucky coincidence that it waited until the end of the trip then he remembered all the energy being produced during the final braking and had a pretty shrewd guess at the sequence of events the protective circuits must have failed to operate and the batteries had been overcharging one failsafe after another had let them down helped by the ionospheric storm the sheer perversity of inanimate things had struck again chang punched the battery compartment fireextinguisher button at least that worked for he could hear the muffled roar of the nitrogen blasts on the other side of the bulkhead ten seconds later he triggered the vacuum dump which would sweep the gas out into space with hopefully most of the heat it had picked up from the fire that too operated correctly it was the first time that chang had ever listened with relief to the unmistakeable shriek of atmosphere escaping from a space vehicle he hoped it would also be the last he dared not rely on the automatic braking sequence as the vehicle finally crawled into the terminus fortunately he had been well rehearsed and recognised all the visual signals so that he was able to stop within a centimetre of the docking adapter in frantic haste the airlocks were coupled together and stores and equipment were hurled through the connecting tube and so was professor sessui by the combined exertions of pilot assistant engineer and steward when he tried to go back for his precious instruments the airlock doors were slammed shut just seconds before the engine compartment bulkhead finally gave way after that the refugees could do nothing but wait in the bleak fifteenmetre square chamber with considerably fewer amenities than a wellfurnished prison cell and hope that the fire would burn itself out perhaps it was well for the passengers peace of mind that only chang and his engineer appreciated one vital statistic the fullycharged batteries contained the energy of a large chemical bomb now ticking away on the outside of the tower ten minutes after their hasty arrival the bomb went off there was a muffled explosion which caused only slight vibrations of the tower followed by the sound of ripping and tearing metal though the breakingup noises were not very impressive they chilled the hearts of the listeners their only means of transport was being destroyed leaving them stranded twentyfive thousand kilometres from safety there was another more protracted explosion then silence the refugees guessed that the vehicle had fallen off the face of the tower still numbed they started to survey their resources and slowly they began to realise that their miraculous escape might have been wholly in vain a cave in the sky deep inside the mountain amid the display and communications equipment of the earth operations centre morgan and his engineering staff stood around the tenthscale hologram of the towers lowest section it was perfect in every detail even to the four thin ribbons of the guiding tapes extending along each face they vanished into thin air just above the floor and it was hard to appreciate that even on this diminished scale they should continue downwards for another sixty kilometers completely through the crust of the earth give us the cutaway said morgan and lift the basement up to eye level the tower lost its apparent solidity and became a luminous ghost a long thinwalled square box empty except for the superconducting cables of the power supply the very lowest section the basement was indeed a good name for it even if it was at a hundred times the elevation of this mountain had been sealed off to form a single square chamber fifteen metres on a side access queried morgan two sections of the image started to glow more brightly clearly defined on the north and south faces between the slots of the guidance tracks were the outer doors of the duplicate airlocks as far apart as possible according to the usual safety precautions for all space habitats they went in through the south door of course explained the duty officer we dont know if it was damaged in the explosion well there were three other entrances thought morgan and it was the lower pair that interested him this had been one of those afterthoughts incorporated at a late stage in the design indeed the whole basement was an afterthought at one time it had been considered unnecessary to build a refuge here in the section of the tower that would eventually become part of earth terminus itself tilt the underside towards me morgan ordered the tower toppled in a falling arc of light and lay floating horizontally in midair with its lower end towards morgan now he could see all the details of the twentymetresquare floor or roof if one looked at it from the point of view of its orbital builders near the north and south edges leading into the two independent airlocks were the hatches that allowed access from below the only problem was to reach them six hundred kilometres up in the sky life support the airlocks faded back into the structure the visual emphasis moved to a small cabinet at the centre of the chamber thats the problem doctor the duty officer answered sombrely theres only a pressure maintenance system no purifiers and of course no power now that theyve lost the transporter i dont see how they can survive the night the temperatures already falling down ten degrees since sunset morgan felt as if the chill of space had entered his own soul the euphoria of discovering that the lost transporters occupants were all still alive faded swiftly away even if there was enough oxygen in the basement to last them for several days that would be of no importance if they froze before dawn id like to speak to professor sessui we cant call him direct the basement emergency phone only goes to midway no problem though that turned out to be not completely true when the connexion was made driverpilot chang came on the line im sorry he said the professor is busy after a moments incredulous silence morgan replied pausing between each word and emphasising his name tell him that dr vannevar morgan wants to speak to him i will doctor but it wont make the slightest difference hes working on some equipment with his students it was the only thing they were able to save a spectroscope of some kind theyre aiming it through one of the observation windows morgan controlled himself with difficulty he was about to retort are they crazy when chang anticipated him you dont know the prof ive spent the last week with him hes well i guess you could say singleminded it took three of us to stop him going back into the cabin to get some more of his gear and hes just told me that if were all going to die anyway hell make damn sure that one piece of equipment is working properly morgan could tell from changs voice that for all his annoyance he felt a considerable admiration for his distinguished and difficult passenger and indeed the professor had logic on his side it made good sense to salvage what he could out of the years of effort that had gone into this illfated expedition very well said morgan at length cooperating with the inevitable since i cant get an appointment id like your summary of the situation so far ive only had it secondhand it now occurred to him that in any event chang could probably give a much more useful report than the professor though the driverpilots insistence on the second half of his title often caused derision among genuine astrologers he was a highly skilled technician with a good training in mechanical and electrical engineering theres not much to say we had such short notice that there was no time to save anything except that damned spectrometer frankly i never thought wed make it through the airlock we have the clothes were wearing and thats about it one of the students grabbed her travel bag guess what it contained her draft thesis written on paper for heavens sake not even flameproofed despite regulations if we could afford the oxygen wed burn it to get some heat listening to that voice from space and looking at the transparent yet apparently solid hologram of the tower morgan had a most curious illusion he could imagine that there were tiny tenthscale human beings moving around there in the lowest compartment it was only necessary to reach in his hand and carry them out to safety next to the cold the big problem is air i dont know how long it will be before co buildup knocks us out perhaps someone will work out that as well whatever the answer im afraid it will be too optimistic changs voice dropped several decibels and he began to speak in an almost conspiratorial tone obviously to prevent being overheard the prof and his students dont know this but the south airlock was damaged in the explosion theres a leak a steady hiss round the gaskets how serious it is i cant tell the speakers voice rose to normal level again well thats the situation well be waiting to hear from you and just what the hell can we say morgan thought to himself except goodbye crisismanagement was a skill which morgan admired but did not envy janos bartok the tower safety officer up at midway was now in charge of the situation those inside the mountain twentyfive thousand kilometres below and a mere six hundred from the scene of the accident could only listen to the reports give helpful advice and satisfy the curiosity of the news media as best they could needless to say maxine duval had been in touch within minutes of the disaster and as usual her questions were very much to the point can midway station reach them in time morgan hesitated the answer to that was undoubtedly no yet it was unwise not to say cruel to abandon hope as early as this and there had been one stroke of good luck i dont want to raise false hopes but we may not need midway theres a crew working much closer at the k tenthousandkilometre station their transporter can reach the basement in twenty hours then why isnt it on the way down safety officer bartok will be making the decision shortly but it could be a waste of effort we think they have air for only half that time and the temperature problem is even more serious what do you mean its night up there and they have no source of heat dont put this out yet maxine but it may be a race between freezing and anoxia there was a pause for several seconds then maxine duval said in an uncharacteristically diffident tone of voice perhaps im being stupid but surely the weather stations with their big infrared lasers thank you maxine im the one whos being stupid just a minute while i speak to midway bartok was polite enough when morgan called but his brisk reply made his opinion of meddling amateurs abundantly clear sorry i bothered you apologised morgan and switched back to maxine sometimes the expert does know his job he told her with rueful pride our man knows his he called monsoon control ten minutes ago theyre computing the beam power now they dont want to overdo it of course and burn everybody up so i was right said maxine sweetly you should have thought of that van what else have you forgotten no answer was possible nor did morgan attempt one he could see maxines computermind racing ahead and guessed what her next question would be he was right cant you use the spiders even the final models are altitudelimited their batteries can only take them up to three hundred kilometres they were designed to inspect the tower when it had already entered the atmosphere well put in bigger batteries in a couple of hours but thats not the problem the only unit under test at the moment cant carry passengers you could send it up empty sorry weve thought of that there must be an operator aboard to manage the docking when the spider comes up to the basement and it would still take days to get out seven people one at a time surely you have some plan several but theyre all crazy if any make sense ill let you know meanwhile theres something you can do for us whats that maxine asked suspiciously explain to your audience just why spacecraft can dock with each other six hundred kilometres up but not with the tower by the time youve done that we may have some news for you as maxines slightly indignant image faded from the screen and morgan turned back once more to the wellorchestrated chaos of the operations room he tried to let his mind roam as freely as possible over every aspect of the problem despite the polite rebuff of the safety officer efficiently doing his duty up on midway he might be able to think of some useful ideas although he did not imagine that there would be any magical solution he understood the tower better than any living man with the possible exception of warren kingsley warren probably knew more of the fine details but morgan had the clearer overall picture seven men and women were stranded in the sky in a situation that was unique in the whole history of space technology there must be a way of getting to safety before they were poisoned by co or the pressure dropped so low that the chamber became in literal truth a tomb like mahomets suspended between heaven and earth the man for the job we can do it said warren kingsley with a broad smile spider can reach the basement youve been able to add enough extra battery power yes but its a very close thing it will have to be a twostage affair like the early rockets as soon as the battery is exhausted it must be jettisoned to get rid of the dead weight that will be around four hundred kilometres spiders internal battery will take it the rest of the way and how much payload will that give kingsleys smile faded marginal about fifty kilos with the best batteries we have only fifty what use will that be it should be enough a couple of those new thousandatmosphere tanks each holding five kilos of oxygen molecular filter masks to keep out the co a little water and compressed food some medical supplies we can bring it all in under fortyfive kilos phew and youre sure thats sufficient yes it will tide them over until the transporter arrives from the k station and if necessary spider can make a second trip what does bartok think he approves after all no one has any better ideas morgan felt that a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders plenty of things could still go wrong but at last there was a ray of hope the feeling of utter helplessness had been dispelled when will all this be ready he asked if there are no holdups within two hours three at the most its all standard equipment luckily spiders being checked out right now theres only one matter still to be decided vannevar morgan shook his head no warren he answered slowly in a calm implacably determined voice that his friend had never heard before theres nothing more to decide im not trying to pull rank on you bartok said morgan its a simple matter of logic true anyone can drive spider but only halfadozen men know all the technical details involved there may be some operational problems when we reach the tower and im in the best position to solve them may i remind you dr morgan said the safety officer that you are sixtyfive it would be wiser to send a younger man im not sixtyfive im sixtysix and age has absolutely nothing to do with it theres no danger and certainly no requirement for physical strength and he might have added the psychological factors were far more important than the physical ones almost anybody could ride passively up and down in a capsule as maxine duval had done and millions of others would be doing in the years ahead it would be quite another matter to face some of the situations that could easily arise six hundred kilometres up in the empty sky i still think said safety officer bartok with gentle persistence that it would be best to send a younger man dr kingsley for example behind him morgan heard his colleagues suddenly indrawn breath for years they had joked over the fact that warren had such an aversion to heights that he never inspected the structures he designed his fear fell short of genuine acrophobia and he could overcome it when absolutely necessary he had after all joined morgan in stepping from africa to europe but that was the only time that anyone had ever seen him drunk in public and he was not seen at all for twentyfour hours afterwards warren was out of the question even though morgan knew that he would be prepared to go there were times when technical ability and sheer courage were not enough no man could fight against fears that had been implanted in him at his birth or during his earliest childhood fortunately there was no need to explain this to the safety officer there was a simpler and equally valid reason why warren should not go only a very few times in his life had vannevar morgan been glad of his small size this was one of them im fifteen kilos lighter than kingsley he told bartok in a marginal operation like this that should settle the matter so lets not waste any more precious time in argument he felt a slight twinge of conscience knowing that this was unfair bartok was only doing his job very efficiently and it would be another hour before the capsule was ready no one was wasting any time for long seconds the two men stared into each others eyes as if the twentyfive thousand kilometres between them did not exist if there was a direct trial of strength the situation could be messy bartok was nominally in charge of all safety operations and could theoretically overrule even the chief engineer and project manager but he might find it difficult to enforce his authority both morgan and spider were far below him on sri kanda and possession was nine points of the law bartok shrugged his shoulders and morgan relaxed you have a point im still not too happy but ill go along with you good luck thank you morgan answered quietly as the image faded from the screen turning to the still silent kingsley he said lets go only as they were leaving the operations room on the way back to the summit did morgan automatically feel for the little pendant concealed beneath his shirt cora had not bothered him for months and not even warren kingsley knew of her existence was he gambling with other lives as well as his own just to satisfy his own selfish pride if safety officer bartok had known about this it was too late now whatever his motives he was committed spider how the mountain had changed thought morgan since he had first seen it the summit had been entirely sheared away leaving a perfectly level plateau at its centre was the giant saucepan lid sealing the shaft which would soon carry the traffic of many worlds strange to think that the greatest spaceport in the solar system would be deep inside the heart of a mountain no one could have guessed that an ancient monastery had once stood here focusing the hopes and fears of billions for at least three thousand years the only token that still remained was the ambiguous bequest of the maha thero now crated and waiting to be moved but so far neither the authorities at yakkagala nor the director of the ranapura museum had shown much enthusiasm for kalidasas illomened bell the last time it had tolled the peak had been swept by that brief but eventful gale a wind of change indeed now the air was almost motionless as morgan and his aides walked slowly to the waiting capsule glittering beneath the inspection lights someone had stencilled the name spider mark ii on the lower part of the housing and beneath that had been scrawled the promise we deliver the goods i hope so thought morgan every time he came here he found it more difficult to breathe and he looked forward to the flood of oxygen that would soon gush into his starved lungs but cora to his surprised relief had never issued even a preliminary admonition when he visited the summit the regime that dr sen had prescribed seemed to be working admirably everything had been loaded aboard spider which had been jacked up so that the extra battery could be hung beneath it mechanics were still making hasty lastminute adjustments and disconnecting power leads the tangle of cabling underfoot was a mild hazard to a man unused to walking in a spacesuit morgans flexisuit had arrived from gagarin only thirty minutes ago and for a while he had seriously considered leaving without one spider mark ii was a far more sophisticated vehicle than the simple prototype that maxine duval had once ridden indeed it was a tiny spaceship with its own lifesupport system if all went well morgan should be able to mate it with the airlock on the bottom of the tower designed years ago for this very purpose but a suit would provide not only insurance in case of docking problems it would give him enormously greater freedom of action almost formfitting the flexisuit bore very little resemblance to the clumsy armour of the early astronauts and even when pressurised would scarcely restrict his movements he had once seen a demonstration by its manufacturers of some spacesuited acrobatics culminating in a swordfight and a ballet the last was hilarious but it had proved the designers claims morgan climbed the short flight of steps stood for a moment on the capsules tiny metal porch then cautiously backed inside as he settled down and fastened the safety belt he was agreeably surprised at the amount of room although the mark ii was certainly a oneman vehicle it was not as claustrophobic as he had feared even with the extra equipment that had been packed into it the two oxygen cylinders had been stowed under the seat and the co masks were in a small box behind the ladder that led up to the overhead airlock it seemed astonishing that such a small amount of equipment could mean the difference between life and death for so many people morgan had taken one personal item a memento of that first day long ago at yakkagala where in a sense all this had started the spinnerette took up little room and weighed only a kilo over the years it had become something of a talisman it was still one of the most effective ways of demonstrating the properties of hyperfilament and whenever he left it behind he almost invariably found that he needed it on this of all trips it might well prove useful he plugged in the quickrelease umbilical of his spacesuit and tested the airflow both on the internal and external supply outside the power cables were disconnected spider was on its own brilliant speeches were seldom forthcoming at such moments and this after all was going to be a perfectly straightforward operation morgan grinned rather stiffly at kingsley and said mind the store warren until i get back then he noticed the small lonely figure in the crowd around the capsule my god he thought to himself id almost forgotten the poor kid dev he called sorry i havent been able to look after you ill make up for it when i get back and i will he told himself when the tower was finished there would be time for everything even the human relations he had so badly neglected dev would be worth watching a boy who knew when to keep out of the way showed unusual promise the curving door of the capsule the upper half of it transparent plastic thudded softly shut against its gaskets morgan pressed the checkout button and spiders vital statistics appeared on the screen one by one all were green there was no need to note the actual figures if any of the values had been outside nominal they would have flashed red twice a second nevertheless with his usual engineers caution morgan observed that oxygen stood at percent main battery power at percent booster battery at percent the quiet calm voice of the controller the same unflappable expert who had watched over all operations since that first abortive lowering years ago sounded in his ear all systems nominal you have control i have control ill wait until the next minute comes up it was hard to think of a greater contrast to an oldtime rocket launch with its elaborate countdown its splitsecond timing its sound and fury morgan merely waited until the last two digits on the clock became zeroes then switched on power at the lowest setting smoothly siently the floodlit mountain top fell away beneath him not even a balloon ascent could have been quieter if he listened carefully he could just hear the whirring of the twin motors as they drove the big friction drivewheels that gripped the tape both above and below the capsule rate of ascent five metres a second said the velocity indicator in slow regular steps morgan increased the power until it read fifty just under two hundred kilometres an hour that gave maximum efficiency at spiders present loading when the auxiliary battery was dropped off speed could be increased by twentyfive percent to almost klicks say something van said warren kingsleys amused voice from the world below leave me alone morgan replied equably i intend to relax and enjoy the view for the next couple of hours if you wanted a running commentary you should have sent maxine duval shes been calling you for the last hour give her my love and say im busy maybe when i reach the tower whats the latest from there temperatures stabilised at twenty monsoon control zaps them with a modest megawattage every ten minutes but professor sessui is furious complains that it upsets his instruments what about the air not so good the pressure has definitely dropped and of course the cos building up but they should be ok if you arrive on schedule theyre avoiding all unnecessary movement to conserve oxygen all except professor sessui ill bet thought morgan it would be interesting to meet the man whose life he was trying to save he had read several of the scientists widelypraised popular books and considered them florid and overblown morgan suspected that the man matched the style and the status at k another two hours before the transporter can leave theyre installing some special circuits to make quite sure that nothing catches fire on this trip a very good idea bartoks i suppose probably and theyre coming down the north track just in case the south one was damaged by the explosion if all goes well theyll arrive in oh twentyone hours plenty of time even if we dont send spider up again with a second load despite his only halfjesting remark to kingsley morgan knew that it was far too early to start relaxing yet all did seem to be going as well as could be expected and there was certainly nothing else that he could do for the next three hours except admire the everexpanding view he was already thirty kilometres up in the sky rising swiftly and silently through the tropical night there was no moon but the land beneath was revealed by the twinkling constellations of its towns and villages when he looked at the stars above and the stars below morgan found it easy to imagine that he was far from any world lost in the depths of space soon he could see the whole island of taprobane faintly outlined by the lights of the coastal settlements far to the north a dull glowing patch was creeping up over the horizon like the herald of some displaced dawn it puzzled him for a moment until he realised that he was looking at one of the great cities of southern hindustan he was higher now than any aircraft could climb and what he had already done was unique in the history of transportation although spider and its precursors had made innumerable trips up to twenty kilometres no one had been allowed to go higher because of the impossibility of rescue it had not been planned to commence serious operations until the base of the tower was much closer and spider had at least two companions who could spin themselves up and down the other tapes of the system morgan pushed aside the thought of what could happen if the drive mechanism jammed that would doom the refugees in the basement as well as himself fifty kilometres he had reached what would in normal times have been the lowest level of the ionosphere he did not of course expect to see anything but he was wrong the first intimation was a faint crackling from the capsule speaker then out of the corner of his eye he saw a flicker of light it was immediately below him glimpsed in the downwardviewing mirror just outside spiders little baywindow he twisted the mirror around as far as it would adjust until it was aimed at a point a couple of metres below the capsule for a moment he stared with astonishment and more than a twinge of fear then he called the mountain ive got company he said i think this is in professor sessuis department theres a ball of light oh about twenty centimetres across running along the tape just below me its keeping at a constant distance and i hope it stays there but i must say its quite beautiful a lovely bluish glow flickering every few seconds and i can hear it on the radio link it was a full minute before kingsley answered in a reassuring tone of voice dont worry its only st elmos fire weve had similar displays along the tape during thunderstorms they can make your hair stand on end aboard the mark i but you wont feel anything youre too well shielded id no idea it could happen at this altitude neither did we youd better take it up with the professor oh its fading out getting bigger and fainter now its gone i suppose the airs too thin for it im sorry to see it go thats only a curtain raiser said kingsley look whats happening directly above you a rectangular section of the starfield flashed by as morgan tilted the mirror towards the zenith at first he could see nothing unusual so he switched off all the indicators on his control panel and waited in total darkness slowly his eyes adapted and in the depths of the mirror a faint red glow began to burn and spread and consume the stars it grew brighter and brighter and flowed beyond the limits of the mirror now he could see it directly for it extended halfway down the sky a cage of light with flickering moving bars was descending upon the earth and now morgan could understand how a man like professor sessui could devote his life to unravelling its secrets on one of its rare visits to the equator the aurora had come marching down from the poles beyond the aurora morgan doubted if even professor sessui five hundred kilometres above had so spectacular a view the storm was developing rapidly shortwave radio still used for many nonessential services would by now have been disrupted all over the world morgan was not sure if he heard or felt a faint rustling like the whisper of falling sand or the crackle of dry twigs unlike the static of the fireball it certainly did not come from the speaker system because it was still there when he switched off the circuit curtains of pale green fire edged with crimson were being drawn across the sky then shaken slowly back and forth as if by an invisible hand they were trembling before the gusts of the solar wind the millionkilometreanhour gale blowing from sun to earth and far beyond even above mars a feeble auroral ghost was flickering now and sunward the poisonous skies of venus were ablaze above the pleated curtains long rays like the ribs of a halfopened fan were sweeping around the horizon sometimes they shone straight into morgans eyes like the beams of a giant searchlight leaving him dazzled for minutes there was no need any longer to turn off the capsule illumination to prevent it from blinding him the celestial fireworks outside were brilliant enough to read by two hundred kilometres spider was still climbing silently effortlessly it was hard to believe that he had left earth exactly an hour ago hard indeed to believe that earth still existed for he was now rising between the walls of a canyon of fire the illusion lasted only for seconds then the momentary unstable balance between magnetic fields and incoming electric clouds was destroyed but for that brief instant morgan could truly believe that he was ascending out of a chasm that would dwarf even valles marineris the grand canyon of mars then the shining cliffs at least a hundred kilometres high became translucent and were pierced by stars he could see them for what they really were mere phantoms of fluorescence and now like an airplane breaking through a ceiling of lowlying clouds spider was climbing above the display morgan was emerging from a fiery mist twisting and turning beneath him many years ago he had been aboard a tourist liner cruising through the tropical night and he remembered how he had joined the other passengers on the stern entranced by the beauty and wonder of the bioluminescent wake some of the greens and blues flickering below him now matched the planktongenerated colours he had seen then and he could easily imagine that he was again watching the byproducts of life the play of giant invisible beasts denizens of the upper atmosphere he had almost forgotten his mission and it was a distinct shock when he was recalled to duty hows power holding up asked kingsley youve only another twenty minutes on that battery morgan glanced at his instrument panel its dropped to ninetyfive percent but my rate of climb has increased by five percent im doing klicks thats about right spiders feeling the lower gravity its already down by ten percent at your altitude that was not enough to be noticeable particularly if one was strapped in a seat and wearing several kilos of spacesuit yet morgan felt positively buoyant and he wondered if he was getting too much oxygen no the flowrate was normal it must be the sheer exhilaration produced by that marvellous spectacle beneath him though it was diminishing now drawing back to north and south as if retreating to its polar strongholds that and the satisfaction of a task well begun using a technology that no man had ever before tested to such limits this explanation was perfectly reasonable but he was not satisfied with it it did not wholly account for his sense of happiness even of joy warren kingsley who was fond of diving had often told him that he felt such an emotion in the weightless environment of the sea morgan had never shared it but now he knew what it must be like he seemed to have left all his cares down there on the planet hidden below the fading loops and traceries of the aurora the stars were coming back into their own no longer challenged by the eerie intruder from the poles morgan began to search the zenith not with any high expectations wondering if the tower was yet in sight but he could make out only the first few metres still lit by the faint auroral glow of the narrow ribbon up which spider was swiftly and smoothly climbing that thin band upon which his own life and seven others now depended was so uniform and featureless that it gave no hint of the capsules speed morgan found it difficult to believe that it was flashing through the drive mechanism at more than two hundred kilometres an hour and with that thought he was suddenly back in his childhood and knew the source of his contentment he had quickly recovered from the loss of that first kite and had graduated to larger and more elaborate models then just before he had discovered meccano and abandoned kites forever he had experimented briefly with toy parachutes morgan liked to think that he had invented the idea himself though he might well have come across it somewhere in his reading or viewing the technique was so simple that generations of boys must have rediscovered it first he had whittled a thin strip of wood about five centimetres long and fastened a couple of paperclips on to it then he had hooked these around the kitestring so that the little device could slide easily up and down next he had made a handkerchiefsized parachute of rice paper with silk strings a small square of cardboard served as payload when he had fastened that square to the wooden strip by a rubber band not too firmly he was in business blown by the wind the little parachute would go sailing up the string climbing the graceful catenary to the kite then morgan would give a sharp tug and the cardboard weight would slip out of the rubber band the parachute would float away into the sky while the woodandwire rider came swiftly back to his hand in readiness for the next launch with what envy he had watched his flimsy creations drift effortlessly out to sea most of them fell back into the water before they had travelled even one kilometre but sometimes a little parachute would still be bravely maintaining altitude when it vanished from sight he liked to imagine that these lucky voyagers reached the enchanted islands of the pacific but though he had written his name and address on the cardboard squares he never received any reply morgan could not help smiling at these longforgotten memories yet they explained so much the dreams of childhood had been far surpassed by the reality of adult life he had earned the right to his contentment coming up to three eighty said kingsley how is the power level beginning to drop down to eightyfive percent the batterys starting to fade well if it holds out for another twenty kilometres it will have done its job how do you feel morgan was tempted to answer with superlatives but his natural caution dissuaded him im fine he said if we could guarantee a display like this for all our passengers we wouldnt be able to handle the crowds perhaps it could be arranged laughed kingsley we could ask monsoon control to dump a few barrels of electrons in the right places not their usual line of business but theyre good at improvising arent they morgan chuckled but did not answer his eyes were fixed on the instrument panel where both power and rate of climb were now visibly dropping but this was no cause for alarm spider had reached kilometres out of the expected and the booster battery still had some life in it at kilometres morgan started to cut back the rate of climb until spider crept more and more slowly upwards eventually the capsule was barely moving and it finally came to rest just short of kilometres im dropping the battery morgan reported mind your heads a good deal of thought had been given to recovering that heavy and expensive battery but there had been no time to improvise a braking system that would let it slide safely back like one of morgans kiteriders and though a parachute had been available it was feared that the shrouds might become entangled with the tape fortunately the impact area just ten kilometres east of the earth terminus lay in dense jungle the wild life of taprobane would have to take its chances and morgan was prepared to argue with the department of conservation later he turned the safety key and then pressed the red button that fired the explosive charges spider shook briefly as they detonated then he switched to the internal battery slowly released the friction brakes and again fed power into the drive motors the capsule started to climb on the last lap of its journey but one glance at the instrument panel told morgan that something was seriously wrong spider should have been rising at over two hundred klicks it was doing less than one hundred even at full power no tests or calculations were necessary morgans diagnosis was instant for the figures spoke for themselves sick with frustration he reported back to earth were in trouble he said the charges blew but the battery never dropped somethings still holding it on it was unnecessary of course to add that the mission must now be aborted everyone knew perfectly well that spider could not possibly reach the base of the tower carrying several hundred kilos of deadweight night at the villa ambassador rajasinghe needed little sleep these nights it was as if a benevolent nature was granting him the maximum use of his remaining years and at a time like this when the taprobanean skies were blazing with their greatest wonder for centuries who could have stayed abed how he wished that paul sarath was here to share the spectacle he missed his old friend more than he would have thought possible there was noone who could annoy and stimulate him in the way that paul had done noone with the same bond of shared experience stretching back to boyhood rajasinghe had never thought that he would outlive paul or would see the fantastic billionton stalactite of the tower almost span the gulf between its orbital foundation and taprobane thirtysix thousand kilometres below to the end paul had been utterly opposed to the project he had called it a sword of damocles and had never ceased to predict its eventual plunge to earth yet even paul had admitted that the tower had already produced some benefits for perhaps the first time in history the rest of the world actually knew that taprobane existed and was discovering its ancient culture yakkagala with its brooding presence and its sinister legends had attracted special attention as a result paul had been able to get support for some of his cherished projects the enigmatic personality of yakkagalas creator had already given rise to numerous books and videodramas and the sonetlumiиre display at the foot of the rock was invariably sold out shortly before his death paul had remarked wryly that a minor kalidasa industry was in the making and it was becoming more and more difficult to distinguish fiction from reality soon after midnight when it was obvious that the auroral display had passed its climax rajasinghe had been carried back into his bedroom as he always did when he had said goodnight to his household staff he relaxed with a glass of hot toddy and switched on the late news summary the only item that really interested him was the progress that morgan was making by this time he should be approaching the base of the tower the news editor had already starred the latest development a line of continuously flashing type announced morgan stuck km short of goal rajasinghes fingertips requested the details and he was relieved to find that his first fears were groundless morgan was not stuck he was unable to complete the journey he could return to earth whenever he wished but if he did professor sessui and his colleagues would certainly be doomed directly above his head the silent drama was being played out at this very moment rajasinghe switched from text to video but there was nothing new indeed the item now being screened in the news recap was maxine duvals ascent years ago in spiders precursor i can do better than that muttered rajasinghe and switched to his beloved telescope for the first months after he had become bedridden he had been unable to use it then morgan had paid one of his brief courtesy calls analysed the situation and swiftly prescribed the remedy a week later to rajasinghes surprise and pleasure a small team of technicians had arrived at the villa yakkagala and had modified the instrument for remote operation now he could lie comfortably in bed and still explore the starry skies and the looming face of the rock he was deeply grateful to morgan for the gesture it had shown a side of the engineers personality he had not suspected he was not sure what he could see in the darkness of the night but he knew exactly where to look for he had long been watching the slow descent of the tower when the sun was at the correct angle he could even glimpse the four guiding tapes converging into the zenith a quartet of shining hairlines scratched upon the sky he set the azimuth bearing on the telescope control and swung the instrument around until it pointed above sri kanda as he began to track slowly upwards looking for any sign of the capsule he wondered what the maha thero was thinking about this latest development though rajasinghe had not spoken to the prelate now well into his nineties since the order had moved to lhasa he gathered that the potala had not provided the hopedfor accommodation the huge palace was slowly falling into decay while the dalai lamas executors haggled with the chinese federal government over the cost of maintenance according to rajasinghes latest information the maha thero was now negotiating with the vatican also in chronic financial difficulties but at least still master of its own house all things were indeed impermanent but it was not easy to discern any cyclic pattern perhaps the mathematical genius of parakarmagoldberg might be able to do so the last time rajasinghe had seen him he was receiving a major scientific award for his contributions to meteorology rajasinghe would never have recognised him he was cleanshaven and wearing a suit cut in the very latest neonapoleonic fashion but now it seemed he had switched religions again the stars slid slowly down the big monitor screen at the end of the bed as the telescope tilted up towards the tower but there was no sign of the capsule though rajasinghe was sure that it must now be in the field of view he was about to switch back to the regular news channel when like an erupting nova a star flashed out near the lower edge of the picture for a moment rajasinghe wondered if the capsule had exploded then he saw that it was shining with a perfectly steady light he centred the image and zoomed to maximum power long ago he had seen a twocenturyold videodocumentary of the first aerial wars and he suddenly remembered a sequence showing a night attack upon london an enemy bomber had been caught in a cone of searchlights and had hung like an incandescent mote in the sky he was seeing the same phenomenon now on a hundredfold greater scale but this time all the resources on the ground were combined to help not to destroy the determined invader of the night a bumpy ride warren kingsleys voice had regained its control now it was merely dull and despairing were trying to stop that mechanic from shooting himself he said but its hard to blame him he was interrupted by another rush job on the capsule and simply forgot to remove the safetystrap so as usual it was human error while the explosive links were being attached the battery had been held in place by two metal bands and only one of them had been removed such things happened with monotonous regularity sometimes they were merely annoying sometimes they were disastrous and the man responsible had to carry the guilt for the rest of his days in any event recrimination was pointless the only thing that mattered now was what to do next morgan adjusted the external viewing mirror to its maximum downward tilt but it was impossible to see the cause of the trouble now that the auroral display had faded the lower part of the capsule was in total darkness and he had no means of illuminating it but that problem at least could be readily solved if monsoon control could dump kilowatts of infrared into the basement of the tower it could easily spare him a few visible photons we can use our own searchlights said kingsley when morgan passed on his request no good theyll shine straight into my eyes and i wont be able to see a thing i want a light behind and above me there must be somebody in the right position ill check kingsley answered obviously glad to make some useful gesture it seemed a long time before he called again looking at his timer morgan was surprised to see that only three minutes had elapsed monsoon control could manage it but theyd have to retune and defocus i think theyre scared of frying you but kinte can light up immediately they have a pseudowhite laser and theyre in the right position shall i tell them to go ahead morgan checked his bearings lets see kinte would be very high in the west that would be fine im ready he answered and closed his eyes almost instantly the capsule exploded with light very cautiously morgan opened his eyes again the beam was coming from high in the west still dazzlingly brilliant despite its journey of almost forty thousand kilometres it appeared to be pure white but he knew that it was actually a blend of three sharplytuned lines in the red green and blue parts of the spectrum after a few seconds adjustment of the mirror he managed to get a clear view of the offending strap half a metre beneath his feet the end that he could see was secured to the base of spider by a large butterfly nut all be had to do was to unscrew that and the battery would drop off morgan sat silently analysing the situation for so many minutes that kingsley called him again for the first time there was a trace of hope in his deputys voice weve been doing some calculations van what do you think of this idea morgan heard him out then whistled softly youre certain of the safety margin he asked of course answered kingsley sounding somewhat aggrieved morgan hardly blamed him but he was not the one who would be risking his neck well ill give it a try but only for one second the first time that wont be enough still its a good idea youll get the feel of it gently morgan released the friction brakes that were holding spider motionless on the tape instantly he seemed to rise out of the seat as weight vanished he counted one two and engaged the brakes again spider gave a jerk and for a fraction of a second morgan was pressed uncomfortably down into the seat there was an ominous squeal from the braking mechanism then the capsule was at rest again apart from a slight torsional vibration that quickly died away that was a bumpy ride said morgan but im still here and so is that infernal battery so i warned you youll have to try harder two seconds at least morgan knew that he could not outguess kingsley with all the figures and computing power at his command but he still felt the need for some reassuring mental arithmetic two seconds of free fall say half a second to put on the brakes allowing one ton for the mass of spider the question was which would go first the strap retaining the battery or the tape that was holding him here four hundred kilometres up in the sky in the usual way it would be no contest in a trial between hyperfilament and ordinary steel but if he applied the brakes too suddenly or they seized owing to this maltreatment both might snap and then he and the battery would reach the earth at very nearly the same time two seconds it is he told kingsley here we go this time the jerk was nerveracking in its violence and the torsional oscillations took much longer to die out morgan was certain that he would have felt or heard the breaking of the strap he was not surprised when a glance in the mirror confirmed that the battery was still there kingsley did not seem too worried it may take three or four tries he said morgan was tempted to retort are you after my job but then thought better of it warren would be amused other unknown listeners might not after the third fall he felt he had dropped kilometres but it was only about a hundred metres even kingsleys optimism started to fade it was obvious that the trick was not going to work id like to send my compliments to the people who made that safety strap said morgan wryly now what do you suggest a threesecond drop before i slam on the brakes he could almost see warren shake his head too big a risk im not so much worried about the tape as the braking mechanism it wasnt designed for this sort of thing well it was a good try morgan answered but im not giving up yet im damned if ill be beaten by a simple butterfly nut fifty centimetres in front of my nose im going outside to get at it the falling fireflies this is friendship seven ill try to describe what im in here i am in a big mass of some very small particles that are brilliantly lit up like theyre luminescent theyre coming by the capsule and they look like little stars a whole shower of them coming by theyre very slow theyre not going away from me more than maybe three or four miles an hour sunrise has just come up behind in the periscope as i looked back out of the window i had literally thousands of small luminous particles swirling round the capsule with the oldstyle spacesuits reaching that butterfly nut would have been completely out of the question even with the flexisuit that morgan was now wearing it might still be difficult but at least he would make the attempt very carefully because more lives than his own now depended upon it he rehearsed the sequence of events he must check the suit depressurise the capsule and open the hatch which luckily was almost fulllength then he must release the safety belt get down on his knees if he could and reach for that butterfly nut everything depended upon its tightness there were no tools of any kind aboard spider but morgan was prepared to match his fingers even in spacegloves against the average small wrench he was just about to describe his plan of operations in case anyone on the ground could find a fatal flaw when he became aware of a certain mild discomfort he could readily tolerate it for much longer if necessary but there was no point in taking chances if he used the capsules own plumbing he would not have to bother with the awkward divers friend incorporated in the suit when he had finished he turned the key of the urine dump and was startled by a tiny explosion near the base of the capsule almost instantly to his astonishment a cloud of twinkling stars winked into existence as if a microscopic galaxy had been suddenly created morgan had the illusion that just for a fraction of a second it hovered motionless outside the capsule then it started to fall straight down as swiftly as any stone dropped on earth within seconds it had dwindled to a point and then was gone nothing could have brought home more clearly the fact that he was still wholly a captive of the earths gravitational field he remembered how in the very early days of orbital flight the first astronauts were puzzled and then amused by the haloes of ice crystals that accompanied them around the planet there had been some feeble jokes about the constellation urion that could not happen here anything that he dropped however fragile it might be would crash straight back into the atmosphere he must never forget that despite his altitude he was not an astronaut revelling in the freedom of weightlessness he was a man inside a building four hundred kilometres high preparing to open the window and go out on to the ledge on the porch though it was cold and uncomfortable on the summit the crowd continued to grow there was something hypnotic about that brilliant little star in the zenith upon which the thoughts of the world as well as the laser beam from kinte were now focused as they arrived all the visitors would head for the north tape and stroke it in a shy halfdefiant manner as if to say i know this is silly but makes me feel im in contact with morgan then they would gather round the coffee dispenser and listen to the reports coming over the speaker system there was nothing new from the refugees in the tower they were all sleeping or trying to sleep in an attempt to conserve oxygen as morgan was not yet overdue they had not been informed of the holdup but within the next hour they would undoubtedly be calling midway to find what had happened maxine duval had arrived at sri kanda just ten minutes too late to see morgan there was a time when such a nearmiss would have made her very angry now she merely shrugged her shoulders and reassured herself with the thought that she would be the first to grab the engineer on his return kingsley had not allowed her to speak to him and she had accepted even this ruling with good grace yes she was growing old for the last five minutes the only sound that had come from the capsule was a series of checks as morgan went through the suit routine with an expert up in midway that was now complete everyone was waiting tensely for the crucial next step valving the air said morgan his voice overlaid with a slight echo now that he had closed the visor of his helmet capsule pressure zero no problem with breathing a thirty second pause then opening the front door there it goes now releasing the seatbelt there was an unconscious stirring and murmuring among the watchers in imagination every one of them was up there in the capsule aware of the void that had suddenly opened before him quickrelease buckle operated im stretching my legs not much headroom just getting the feel of the suit quite flexible now im going out on the porch dont worry ive got the seatbelt wrapped around my left arm phew hard work bending as much as this but i can see that butterfly nut underneath the porch grille im working out how to reach it on my knees now not very comfortable ive got it now to see if it will turn the listeners became rigid silent then in unison relaxed with virtually simultaneous sighs of relief no problem i can turn it easily two revs already any moment now just a bit more i can feel it coming off look out down below there was a burst of clapping and cheering some people put their hands over their heads and cowered in mock terror one or two not fully understanding that the falling nut would not arrive for five minutes and would descend ten kilometres to the east looked genuinely alarmed only warren kingsley failed to share the rejoicing dont cheer too soon he said to maxine were not out of the woods yet the seconds dragged by one minute two minutes its no use said morgan at last his voice thick with rage and frustration i cant budge the strap the weight of the battery is holding it jammed in the threads those jolts we gave must have welded it to the bolt come back as quickly as you can said kingsley theres a new powercell on the way and we can manage a turnaround in less than an hour so we can still get up to the tower inoh say six hours barring any further accidents of course precisely thought morgan and he would not care to take spider up again without a thorough check of the muchabused braking mechanism nor would he trust himself to make a second trip he was already feeling the strain of the last few hours and fatigue would soon be slowing down his mind and body just when he needed maximum efficiency from both he was back in the seat now but the capsule was still open to space and he had not yet refastened the safety belt to do so would be to admit defeat and that had never been easy for morgan the unwinking glare of the kinte laser coming from almost immediately above still transfixed him with its pitiless light he tried to focus his mind upon the problem as sharply as that beam was focused upon him all that he needed was a metal cutter a hacksaw or a pair of shears that could sever the retaining strap once again he cursed the fact that there was no toolkit aboard spider even so it would hardly have contained what he needed there were megawatthours of energy stored in spiders own battery could he use that in any way he had a brief fantasy of establishing an arc and burning through the strap but even if suitable heavy conductors were available and of course they werent the main power supply was inaccessible from the control cab warren and all the skilled brains gathered around him had failed to find any solution he was on his own physically and intellectually it was after all the situation he had always preferred and then just as he was about to reach out and close the capsule door morgan knew what he had to do all the time the answer had been right by his fingertips the other passenger to morgan it seemed that a huge weight had lifted from his shoulders he felt completely irrationally confident this time surely it had to work nevertheless he did not move from his seat until he had planned his actions in minute detail and when kingsley sounding a little anxious once again urged him to hurry back he gave an evasive answer he did not wish to raise any false hopeson earth or in the tower im trying an experiment be said leave me alone for a few minutes he picked up the fibre dispenser that he had used for so many demonstrations the little spinnerette that years ago had allowed him to descend the face of yakkagala one change had been made for reasons of safety the first metre of filament had been coated with a layer of plastic so that it was no longer quite invisible and could be handled cautiously even with bare fingers as morgan looked at the little box in his hand he realised how much he had come to regard it as a talisman almost a good luck charm of course he did not really believe in such things he always had a perfectly logical reason for carrying the spinnerette around with him on this ascent it had occurred to him that it might be useful because of its strength and unique lifting power he had almost forgotten that it had other abilities as well once more he clambered out of the seat and knelt down on the metal grille of spiders tiny porch to examine the cause of all the trouble the offending bolt was only ten centimetres on the other side of the grid and although its bars were too close together for him to put his hand through them he had already proved that he could reach around it without too much difficulty he released the first metre of coated fibre and using the ring at the end as a plumbbob lowered it down through the grille tucking the dispenser itself firmly in a corner of the capsule so that he could not accidentally knock it overboard he then reached round the grille until he could grab the swinging weight this was not as easy as he had expected because even this remarkable spacesuit would not allow his arm to bend quite freely and the ring eluded his grasps as it pendulumed back and forth after halfadozen attempts tiring rather than annoying because he knew that he would succeed sooner or later he had looped the fibre around the shank of the bolt just behind the strap it was still holding in place now for the really tricky part he released just enough filament from the spinnerette for the naked fibre to reach the bolt and to pass around it then he drew both ends tight until he felt the loop catch in the thread morgan had never attempted this trick with a rod of tempered steel more than a centimetre thick and had no idea how long it would take bracing himself against the porch he began to operate his invisible saw after five minutes he was sweating badly and could not tell if he had made any progress at all he was afraid to slacken the tension lest the fibre should escape from the equally invisible slot it was he hoped slicing through the bolt several times warren had called him sounding more and more alarmed and he had given a brief reassurance soon he would rest for a while recover his breath and explain what he was trying to do this was the least that he owed to his anxious friends van said kingsley just what are you up to the people in the tower have been calling what shall i say to them give me another few minutes im trying to cut the bolt the calm but authoritative womans voice that interrupted morgan gave him such a shock that he almost let go of the precious fibre the words were muffled by his suit but that did not matter he knew them all too well though it had been months since he had last heard them dr morgan said cora please lie down and relax for the next ten minutes would you settle for five he pleaded im rather busy at the moment cora did not deign to reply although there were units that could conduct simple conversations this model was not among them morgan kept his promise breathing deeply and steadily for a full five minutes then he started sawing again back and forth back and forth he worked the filament as he crouched over the grille and the fourhundredkilometre distant earth he could feel considerable resistance so he must be making some progress through that stubborn steel but just how much there was no way of telling dr morgan said cora you really must lie down for halfanhour morgan swore softly to himself youre making a mistake young lady he retorted im feeling fine but he was lying cora knew about the ache in his chest who the hell are you talking to van asked kingsley just a passing angel answered morgan sorry i forgot to switch off the mike im going to take another rest what progress are you making cant say but im sure the cuts pretty deep by this time it must be he wished that he could switch off cora but that of course was impossible even if she had not been out of reach between his breastbone and the fabric of his spacesuit a heart monitor that could be silenced was worse than useless it was dangerous dr morgan said cora now distinctly annoyed i really must insist at least halfanhours complete rest this time morgan did not feel like answering he knew that cora was right but she could not be expected to understand that his was not the only life involved and he was also sure that like one of his bridges she had a builtin safety factor her diagnosis would be pessimistic his condition would not be as serious as she was pretending or so he devoutly hoped the pain in his chest certainly seemed to be getting no worse he decided to ignore both it and cora and started to saw away slowly but steadily with the loop of fibre he would keep going he told himself grimly just as long as was necessary the warning he had relied upon never came spider lurched violently as a quarterton of deadweight ripped away and morgan was almost pitched out into the abyss he dropped the spinnerette and grabbed for the safety belt everything seemed to happen in dreamlike slow motion he had no sense of fear only an utter determination not to surrender to gravity without a fight but he could not find the safety belt it must have swung back into the cabin he was not even conscious of using his left hand but suddenly he realised that it was clamped around the hinges of the open door yet still he did not pull himself back into the cabin he was hypnotised by the sight of the falling battery slowly rotating like some strange celestial body as it dwindled from sight it took a long time to vanish completely and not until then did morgan drag himself to safety and collapse into his seat for a long time he sat there his heart hammering awaiting coras next indignant protest to his surprise she was silent almost as if she too had been equally startled well he would give her no further cause for complaint from now on he would sit quietly at the controls trying to relax his jangled nerves when he was himself again he called the mountain ive got rid of the battery he said and heard the cheers float up from earth as soon as ive closed the hatch ill be on my way again tell sessui and co to expect me in just over an hour and thank kinte for the light i dont need it now he repressurised the cabin opened the helmet of his suit and treated himself to a long cold sip of fortified orange juice then he engaged drive and released the brakes and lay back with a sense of overwhelming relief as spider came up to full speed he had been climbing for several minutes before he realised what was missing in anxious hope he peered out at the metal grille of the porch no it was not there well he could always get another spinnerette to replace the one now following the discarded battery back to earth it was a small sacrifice for such an achievement strange therefore that he was so upset and unable fully to enjoy his triumph he felt that he had lost an old and faithful friend fade out the fact that he was still only thirty minutes behind schedule seemed too good to be true morgan would have been prepared to swear that the capsule had halted for at least an hour up there in the tower now much less than two hundred kilometres away the reception committee would be preparing to welcome him he refused even to consider the possibility of any further problems when he passed the fivehundredkilometre mark still going strong there was a message of congratulations from the ground by the way added kingsley the game warden in the ruhana sanctuarys reported an aircraft crashing we were able to reassure him if we can find the hole we may have a souvenir for you morgan had no difficulty in restraining his enthusiasm he was glad to see the last of that battery now if they could find the spinnerette but that would be a hopeless task the first sign of trouble came at fivefifty kilometres by now the rate of ascent should have been over two hundred klicks it was only one nine eight slight though the discrepancy was and it would make no appreciable difference to his arrival time it worried morgan when he was only thirty kilometres from the tower he had diagnosed the problem and knew that this time there was absolutely nothing he could do about it although there should have been ample reserve the battery was beginning to fade perhaps those sudden jolts and restarts had brought on the malaise possibly there was even some physical damage to the delicate components whatever the explanation the current was slowly dropping and with it the capsules speed there was consternation when morgan reported the indicator readings back to the ground im afraid youre right kingsley lamented sounding almost in tears we suggest you cut speed back to one hundred klicks well try to calculate battery life though it can only be an educated guess twentyfive kilometres to go a mere fifteen minutes even at this reduced speed if morgan had been able to pray he would have done so we estimate you have between ten and twenty minutes judging by the rate the current is dropping it will be a close thing im afraid shall i reduce speed again not for the moment were trying to optimise your discharge rate and this seems about right well you can switch on your beam now if i cant get to the tower at least i want to see it neither kinte nor the other orbiting stations could help him now that he wished to look up at the underside of the tower this was a task for the searchlight on sri kanda itself pointing vertically towards the zenith a moment later the capsule was impaled by a dazzling beam from the heart of taprobane only a few metres away indeed so close that he felt he could touch them the other three guiding tapes were ribbons of light converging towards the tower he followed their dwindling perspective and there it was just twenty kilometres away he should be there in a dozen minutes coming up through the floor of that tiny square building he could see glittering in the sky bearing presents like some troglodytic father christmas despite his determination to relax and obey coras orders it was quite impossible to do so he found himself tensing his muscles as if by his own physical exertions he could help spider along the last fraction of its journey at ten kilometres there was a distinct change of pitch from the drive motor morgan had been expecting this and reacted to it at once without waiting for advice from the ground he cut speed back to fifty klicks at this rate he still had twelve minutes to go and he began to wonder despairingly if he was involved in an asymptotic approach this was a variant of the race between achilles and the tortoise if he halved his speed every time he halved the distance would he reach the tower in a finite time once he would have known the answer instantly now he felt too tired to work it out at five kilometres he could see the constructional details of the tower the catwalk and protective rails the futile safety net provided as a sop to public opinion although he strained his eyes he could not yet make out the airlock towards which he was now crawling with such agonising slowness and then it no longer mattered two kilometres short of the goal spiders motors stalled completely the capsule even slid downwards a few metres before morgan was able to apply the brakes yet this time to morgans surprise kingsley did not seem utterly downcast you can still make it he said give the battery ten minutes to recuperate theres still enough energy there for that last couple of kilometres it was one of the longest ten minutes that morgan had ever known though he could have made it pass more swiftly by responding to maxine duvals increasingly desperate pleas he felt too emotionally exhausted to talk he was genuinely sorry about this and hoped that maxine would understand and forgive him he did have one brief exchange with driverpilot chang who reported that the refugees in the basement were still in fairly good shape and much encouraged by his nearness they were taking turns to peer at him through the one small porthole of the airlocks outer door and simply could not believe that he might never be able to bridge the trifling space between them morgan gave the battery an extra minute for luck to his relief the motors responded strongly with an encouraging surge of power spider got within half a kilometre of the tower before stalling again next time does it said kingsley though it seemed to morgan that his friends confidence now sounded somewhat forced sorry for all these delays another ten minutes morgan asked with resignation im afraid so and this time use thirtysecond bursts with a minute between them that way youll get the last erg out of the battery and out of me thought morgan strange that cora had been quiet for so long still this time be had not exerted himself physically it only felt that way in his preoccupation with spider he had been neglecting himself for the last hour he had quite forgotten his zeroresidue glucosebased energy tablets and the little plastic bulb of fruit juice after he had sampled both he felt much better and only wished that he could transfer some of the surplus calories to the dying battery now for the moment of truth the final exertion failure was unthinkable when he was so close to the goal the fates could not possibly be so malevolent now that he had only a few hundred metres to go he was whistling in the dark of course how many aircraft had crashed at the very edge of the runway after safely crossing an ocean how many times had machines or muscles failed when there were only millimetres to go every possible piece of luck bad as well as good happened to somebody somewhere he had no right to expect any special treatment the capsule heaved itself upwards in fits and starts like a dying animal seeking its last haven when the battery finally expired the base of the tower seemed to fill half the sky but it was still twenty metres above him theory of relativity it was to morgans credit that he felt his own fate was sealed in the desolating moment when the last dregs of power were exhausted and the lights on spiders display panel finally faded out not for several seconds did he remember that he had only to release the brakes and he would slide back to earth in three hours he could be safely back in bed noone would blame him for the failure of his mission he had done all that was humanly possible for a brief while he stared in a kind of dull fury at that inaccessible square with the shadow of spider projected upon it his mind revolved a host of crazy schemes and rejected them all if he still had his faithful little spinnerette but there would have been no way of getting it to the tower if the refugees had possessed a spacesuit someone could have lowered a rope to him but there had been no time to collect a suit from the burning transporter of course if this was a videodrama and not a reallife problem some heroic volunteer could sacrifice himself better still herself by going into the lock and tossing down a rope using the fifteen seconds of vacuum consciousness to save the others it was some measure of morgans desperation that for a fleeting moment he even considered this idea before commonsense reasserted itself from the time that spider had given up the battle with gravity until morgan finally accepted that there was nothing more that he could do probably less than a minute had elapsed then warren kingsley asked a question which at such a moment seemed an annoying irrelevance give us your distance again van exactly how far are you from the tower what the hell does it matter it could be a lightyear there was a brief silence from the ground then kingsley spoke again in the sort of tone one uses to address a small child or a difficult invalid it makes all the difference in the world did you say twenty metres yes thats about it incredibly unmistakeably warren gave a clearly audible sigh of relief there was even joy in his voice when he answered and all these years van i thought that you were the chief engineer on this project suppose it is twenty metres exactly morgans explosive shout prevented him from finishing the sentence what an idiot tell sessui ill dock in oh fifteen minutes fourteen point five if youve guessed the distance right and nothing on earth can stop you now that was still a risky statement and morgan wished that kingsley hadnt made it docking adaptors sometimes failed to latch together properly because of minute errors in manufacturing tolerances and of course there had never been a chance of testing this particular system he felt only a slight embarrassment at his mental blackout after all under extreme stress a man could forget his own telephone number even his own date of birth and until this very moment the now dominant factor in the situation had been so unimportant that it could be completely ignored it was all a matter of relativity he could not reach the tower but the tower would reach him at its inexorable two kilometres a day hard dock the record for one days construction had been thirty kilometres when the slimmest and lightest section of the tower was being assembled now that the most massive portion the very root of the structure was nearing completion in orbit the rate was down to two kilometres that was quite fast enough it would give morgan time to check the adaptor lineup and to mentally rehearse the rather tricky few seconds between confirming harddock and releasing spiders brakes if he left them on for too long there would be a very unequal trial of strength between the capsule and the moving megatons of the tower it was a long but relaxed fifteen minutes time enough morgan hoped to pacify cora towards the end everything seemed to happen very quickly and at the last moment he felt like an ant about to be crushed in a stamping press as the solid roof of the sky descended upon him one second the base of the tower was still metres away an instant later he felt and heard the impact of the docking mechanism many lives depended now upon the skill and care with which the engineers and mechanics years ago had done their work if the couplings did not line up within the allowed tolerances if the latching mechanism did not operate correctly if the seal was not airtight morgan tried to interpret the medley of sounds reaching his ears but he was not skilled enough to read their messages then like a signal of victory the docking completed sign flashed on the indicator board there would be ten seconds while the telescopic elements could still absorb the movement of the advancing tower morgan used half of them before he cautiously released the brakes he was prepared to jam them on again instantly if spider started to drop but the sensors were telling the truth tower and capsule were now firmly mated together morgan had only to climb a few rungs of ladder and he would have reached his goal after he had reported to the jubilant listeners on earth and midway he sat for a moment recovering his breath strange to think that this was his second visit but he could remember little of that first one twelve years ago and thirtysix thousand kilometres away during what had for want of a better term been called the foundation laying there had been a small party in the basement and numerous zerogee toasts had been squirted for this was not only the very first section of the tower to be built it would also be the first to make contact with earth at the end of its long descent from orbit some kind of ceremony therefore seemed in order and morgan now recalled that even his old enemy senator collins had been gracious enough to attend and to wish him luck with a barbed but goodhumoured speech there was even better cause for celebration now already morgan could hear a faint tattoo of welcoming raps from the far side of the airlock he undid his safety belt climbed awkwardly on to the seat and started to ascend the ladder the overhead hatch gave a token resistance as if the powers marshalled against him were making one last feeble gesture and air hissed briefly while pressure was equalised then the circular plate swung open and downwards and eager hands helped him up into the tower as morgan took his first breath of the fetid air he wondered how anyone could have survived here if his mission had been aborted he felt quite certain that a second attempt would have been too late the bare bleak cell was lit only by the solarfluorescent panels which had been patiently trapping and releasing sunlight for more than a decade against the emergency that had arrived at last their illumination revealed a scene that might have come from some old war here were homeless and dishevelled refugees from a devastated city huddling in a bomb shelter with the few possessions they had been able to save not many such refugees however would have carried bags labelled projection lunar hotel corporation property of the federal republic of mars or the ubiquitous maynotbe stowed in vacuum nor would they have been so cheerful even those who were lying down to conserve oxygen managed a smile and a languid wave morgan had just returned the salute when his legs buckled beneath him and everything blacked out never before in his life had he fainted and when the blast of cold oxygen revived him his first emotion was one of acute embarrassment his eyes came slowly into focus and be saw masked shapes hovering over him for a moment he wondered if he was in hospital then brain and vision returned to normal while he was still unconscious his precious cargo must have been unloaded those masks were the molecular sieves he had carried up to the tower worn over nose and mouth they would block the co but allow oxygen to pass simple yet technologically sophisticated they would enable men to survive in an atmosphere which would otherwise cause instant suffocation it required a little extra effort to breathe through them but nature never gives something for nothing and this was a very small price to pay rather groggily but refusing any help morgan got to his feet and was belatedly introduced to the men and women he had saved one matter still worried him while he was unconscious had cora delivered any of her set speeches he did not wish to raise the subject but he wondered on behalf of all of us said professor sessui with sincerity yet with the obvious awkwardness of a man who was seldom polite to anyone i want to thank you for what youve done we owe our lives to you any logical or coherent reply to this would have smacked of false modesty so morgan used the excuse of adjusting his mask to mumble something unintelligible he was about to start checking that all the equipment had been unloaded when professor sessui added rather anxiously im sorry we cant offer you a chair this is the best we can do he pointed to a couple of instrument boxes one on top of the other you really should take it easy the phrase was familiar so cora had spoken there was a slightly embarrassed pause while morgan registered this fact and the others admitted that they knew and he showed that he knew they knew all without a word being uttered in the kind of psychological infinite regress that occurs when a group of people share completely a secret which nobody will ever mention again he took a few deep breaths it was amazing how quickly one got used to the masks and then sat down on the proffered seat im not going to faint again he told himself with grim determination i must deliver the goods and get out of here as quickly as possible hopefully before there are any more pronouncements from cora that can of sealant he said pointing to the smallest of the containers he had brought should take care of your leak spray it round the gasket of the airlock it sets hard in a few seconds use the oxygen only when you have to you may need it to sleep theres a co mask for everyone and a couple of spares and heres food and water for three days that should be plenty the transporter from k should be here tomorrow as for the medikit i hope you wont need that at all he paused for breath it was not easy to talk while wearing a co filter and he felt an increasing need to conserve his strength sessuis people could now take care of themselves but he still had one further job to do and the sooner the better morgan turned to driver chang and said quietly please help me to suit up again i want to inspect the track thats only a thirtyminute suit youre wearing ill need ten minutes fifteen at the most dr morgan im a spacequalified operator youre not noones allowed to go out in a thirtyminute suit without a spare pack or an umbilical except in an emergency of course morgan gave a tired smile chang was right and the excuse of immediate danger no longer applied but an emergency was whatever the chief engineer said it was i want to look at the damage he answered and examine the tracks it would be a pity if the people from k cant reach you because they werent warned of some obstacle chang was clearly not too happy about the situation but raised no further arguments as he followed morgan into the north lock just before he closed the visor morgan asked any more trouble with the professor chang shook his head i think the co has slowed him down and if he starts up again well we outnumber him six to one though im not sure if we can count on his students some of them are just as crazy as he is look at that girl who spends all her time scribbling in the corner shes convinced that the suns going out or blowing up im not sure which and wants to warn the world before she dies much good that would do id prefer not to know though morgan could not help smiling he felt quite sure that none of the professors students would be crazy eccentric perhaps but also brilliant they would not be working with sessui otherwise one day he must find out more about the men and women whose lives he had saved but that would have to wait until they had all returned to earth by their separate ways im going to take a quick walk around the tower said morgan and ill describe any damage so that you can report to midway it wont take more than ten minutes and if it does well dont try to get me back driver changs reply as he closed the inner door of the airlock was very practical and very brief how the hell could i he asked view from the balcony the outer door of the north airlock opened without difficulty framing a rectangle of complete darkness running horizontally across that darkness was a line of fire the protective handrail of the catwalk blazing in the beam of the searchlight pointed straight up from the mountain so far below morgan took a deep breath and flexed the suit he felt perfectly comfortable and waved to chang peering at him through the window of the inner door then he stepped out of the tower the catwalk that surrounded the basement was a metal grille about two metres wide beyond it the safety net had been stretched out for another thirty metres the portion that morgan could see had caught nothing whatsoever during its years of patient waiting he started his circumnavigation of the tower shielding his eyes against the glare blasting up from underfoot the oblique lighting showed up every least bump and imperfection in the surface that stretched above him like a roadway to the stars which in a sense it was as he had hoped and expected the explosion on the far side of the tower had caused no damage here that would have required an atomic bomb not a mere electrochemical one the twin grooves of the track now awaiting their first arrival stretched endlessly upwards in their pristine perfection and fifty metres below the balcony though it was hard to look in that direction because of the glare he could just make out the terminal buffers ready for a task which they should never have to perform taking his time and keeping close to the sheer face of the tower morgan walked slowly westwards until he came to the first corner as he turned he looked back at the open door of the airlock and the relative indeed safety that it represented then he continued boldly along the blank wall of the west face he felt a curious mixture of elation and fear such as he had not known since he had learned to swim and found himself for the first time in water out of his depth although he was certain that there was no real danger there could be he was acutely aware of cora biding her time but morgan bad always hated to leave any job undone and his mission was not yet complete the west face was exactly like the north one except for the absence of an airlock again there was no sign of damage even though it was closer to the scene of the explosion checking the impulse to hurry after all he had been outside for only three minutes morgan strolled on to the next corner even before he turned it he could see that he was not going to complete his planned circuit of the tower the catwalk had been ripped off and was dangling out into space a twisted tongue of metal the safety net had vanished altogether doubtless torn away by the falling transporter i wont press my luck morgan told himself but he could not resist peering round the corner holding on to the section of the guard rail that still remained there was a good deal of debris stuck in the track and the face of the tower had been discoloured by the explosion but as far as morgan could see even here there was nothing that could not be put right in a couple of hours by a few men with cutting torches he gave a careful description to chang who expressed relief and urged morgan to get back into the tower as soon as possible dont worry said morgan ive still got ten minutes and all of thirty metres to go i could manage on the air i have in my lungs now but he did not intend to put it to the test he had already had quite enough excitement for one night more than enough if cora was to be believed from now on he would obey her orders implicitly when he had walked back to the open door of the airlock he stood for a few final moments beside the guardrail drenched by the fountain of light leaping up from the summit of sri kanda far below it threw his own immensely elongated shadow directly along the tower vertically upwards towards the stars that shadow must stretch for thousands of kilometres and it occurred to morgan that it might even reach the transporter now dropping swiftly down from the k station if he waved his arms the rescuers might be able to see his signals he could talk to them in morse code this amusing fantasy inspired a more serious thought would it be best for him to wait here with the others and not risk the return to earth in spider but the journey up to midway where he could get good medical attention would take a week that was not a sensible alternative since he could be back on sri kanda in less than three hours time to go inside his air must be getting low and there was nothing more to see that was a disappointing irony considering the spectacular view one would normally have here by day or by night now however the planet below and the heavens above were both banished by the blinding glare from sri kanda he was floating in a tiny universe of light surrounded by utter darkness on every side it was almost impossible to believe that he was in space if only because of his sense of weight he felt as secure as if he were standing on the mountain itself instead of six hundred kilometres above it that was a thought to savour and to carry back to earth he patted the smooth unyielding surface of the tower more enormous in comparison to him than an elephant to an amoeba but no amoeba could ever conceive of an elephant still less create one see you on earth in a years time morgan whispered and slowly closed the airlock door behind him the last dawn morgan was back in the basement for only five minutes this was no time for social amenities and he did not wish to consume any of the precious oxygen he had brought here with such difficulty he shook hands all round and scrambled back into spider it was good to breathe again without a mask better still to know that his mission had been a complete success and that in less than three hours he would be safely back on earth yet after all the effort that had gone into reaching the tower he was reluctant to cast off again and to surrender once more to the pull of gravity even though it was now taking him home but presently he released the docking latches and started to fall downwards becoming weightless for several seconds when the speed indicator reached three hundred klicks the automatic braking system came on and weight returned the brutally depleted battery would be recharging now but it must have been damaged beyond repair and would have to be taken out of service there was an ominous parallel here morgan could not help thinking of his own overstrained body but a stubborn pride still kept him from asking for a doctor on standby he had made a little bet with himself he would do so only if cora spoke again she was silent now as he dropped swiftly through the night morgan felt totally relaxed and left spider to look after itself while he admired the heavens few spacecraft provided so panoramic a view and not many men could ever have seen the stars under such superb conditions the aurora had vanished completely the searchlight had been extinguished and there was nothing left to challenge the constellations except of course the stars that man himself had made almost directly overhead was the dazzling beacon of ashoka poised forever above hindustan and only a few hundred kilometres from the tower complex halfway down in the east was confucius much lower still kamehameha while high up from the west shone kinte and imhotep these were merely the brightest signposts along the equator there were literally scores of others all of them far more brilliant than sirius how astonished one of the old astronomers would have been to see this necklace around the sky and how bewildered he would have become when after an hour or sos observation he discovered that they were quite immobile neither rising nor setting while the familiar stars drifted past in their ancient courses as he stared at the diamond necklace stretched across the sky morgans sleepy mind slowly transformed it into something far more impressive with only a slight effort of the imagination those manmade stars became the lights of a titanic bridge he drifted into still wilder fantasies what was the name of the bridge into valhalla across which the heroes of the norse legends passed from this world to the next he could not remember but it was a glorious dream and had other creatures long before man tried in vain to span the skies of their own worlds he thought of the splendid rings encircling saturn the ghostly arches of uranus and neptune although he knew perfectly well that none of these worlds had ever felt the touch of life it amused him to think that here were the shattered fragments of bridges that had failed he wanted to sleep but against his will imagination had seized upon the idea like a dog that had just discovered a new bone it would not let go the concept was not absurd it was not even original many of the synchronous stations were already kilometres in extent or linked by cables which stretched along appreciable fractions of their orbit to join them together thus forming a ring completely around the world would be an engineering task much simpler than the building of the tower and involving much less material no not a ring a wheel this tower was only the first spoke there would be others spaced along the equator when they were all connected rigidly up there in orbit the problems of stability that plagued a single tower would vanish africa south america the gilbert islands indonesia they could all provide locations for earth terminals if desired for some day as materials improved and knowledge advanced the towers could be made invulnerable even to the worst hurricanes and mountain sites would no longer be necessary if he had waited another hundred years perhaps he need not have disturbed the maha thero while he was dreaming the thin crescent of the waning moon had lifted unobtrusively above the eastern horizon already aglow with the first hint of dawn earthshine lit the entire lunar disc so brilliantly that morgan could see much of the nightland detail he strained his eyes in the hope of glimpsing that loveliest of sights never seen by earlier ages a star within the arms of the crescent moon but none of the cities of mans second home was visible tonight only two hundred kilometers less than an hour to go there was no point in trying to keep awake spider had automatic terminal programming and would touch gently down without disturbing his sleep the pain woke him first cora was a fraction of a second later dont try to move she said soothingly ive radioed for help the ambulance is on the way that was funny but dont laugh morgan ordered himself shes only doing her best he felt no fear though the pain beneath his breastbone was intense it was not incapacitating he tried to focus his mind upon it and the very act of concentration relieved the symptoms long ago he had discovered that the best way of handling pain was to study it objectively warren was calling him but the words were far away and had little meaning he could recognise the anxiety in his friends voice and wished that he could do something to alleviate it but he had no strength left to deal with this problem or with any other now he could not even hear the words a faint but steady roar had obliterated all other sounds though he knew that it existed only in his mind or the labyrinthine channels of his ears it seemed completely real he could believe that he was standing at the foot of some great waterfall it was growing fainter softer more musical and suddenly he recognised it how pleasant to hear once more on the silent frontier of space the sound he remembered from his very first visit to yakkagala gravity was drawing him home again as through the centuries its invisible hand had shaped the trajectory of the fountains of paradise but he had created something that gravity could never recapture as long as men possessed the wisdom and the will to preserve it how cold his legs were what had happened to spiders lifesupport system but soon it would be dawn then there would be warmth enough the stars were fading far more swiftly than they had any right to do that was strange though the day was almost here everything around him was growing dark and the fountains were sinking back into the earth their voices becoming fainter fainter fainter and now there was another voice but vannevar morgan did not hear it between brief piercing bleeps cora cried to the approaching dawn help will anyone who hears me please come at once this is a cora emergency help will anyone who hears me please come at once she was still calling when the sun came up and its first rays caressed the summit of mountain that had once been sacred far below the shadow of sri kanda leaped forth upon the clouds its perfect cone still unblemished despite all that man had done there were no pilgrims now to watch that symbol of eternity lie across the face of the awakening land but millions would see it in the centuries ahead as they rode in comfort and safety to the stars epilogue kalidasas triumph in the last days of that last brief summer before the jaws of ice clenched shut around the equator one of the starholme envoys came to yakkagala a master of the swarms it had recently conjugated itself into human form apart from one minor detail the likeness was excellent but the dozen children who had accompanied the holmer in the autocopter were in a constant state of mild hysteria the younger ones frequently dissolving into giggles whats so funny it had asked in its perfect solar or is this a private joke but they would not explain to the starholmer whose normal colour vision lay entirely in the infrared that the human skin was not a random mosaic of greens and reds and blues even when it had threatened to turn into a tyrannosaurus rex and eat them all up they still refused to satisfy its curiosity indeed they quickly pointed out to an entity that had crossed scores of lightyears and collected knowledge for thirty centuries that a mass of only a hundred kilogrammes would scarcely make an impressive dinosaur the holmer did not mind it was patient and the children of earth were endlessly fascinating in both their biology and their psychology so were the young of all creatures all of course that did have young having studied nine such species the holmer could now almost imagine what it must be like to grow up mature and die almost but not quite spread out before the dozen humans and one nonhuman lay the empty land its once luxuriant fields and forests blasted by the cold breaths from north and south the graceful coconut palms had long since vanished and even the gloomy pines that had succeeded them were naked skeletons their roots destroyed by the spreading permafrost no life was left upon the surface of the earth only in the oceanic abyss where the planets internal heat kept the ice at bay did a few blind starveling creatures crawl and swim and devour each other yet to a being whose home had circled a faint red star the sun that blazed down from the cloudless sky still seemed intolerably bright though all its warmth had gone drained away by the sickness that had attacked its core a thousand years ago its fierce cold light revealed every detail of the stricken land and flashed in splendour from the approaching glaciers for the children still revelling in the powers of their awakening minds the subzero temperatures were an exciting challenge as they danced naked through the snowdrifts bare feet kicking up clouds of powderdry shining crystals their symbiotes often had to warn them dont override your frostbite signals for they were not yet old enough to replicate new limbs without the help of their elders the oldest of the boys was showing off he had launched a deliberate assault on the cold announcing proudly that he was a fireelemental all that could be seen of the small exhibitionist was a column of flame and steam dancing to and fro along the ancient brickwork the other children pointedly ignored this rather crude display to the starholmer however it presented an interesting paradox just why had these people retreated to the inner planets when they could have fought back the cold with the powers that they now possessed as indeed their cousins were doing on mars that was a question to which it had still not received a satisfactory answer it considered again the enigmatic reply it had been given by aristotle the entity with which it most easily communicated for everything there is a season the global brain had replied there is a time to battle against nature and a time to obey her true wisdom lies in making the right choice when the long winter is over man will return to an earth renewed and refreshed and so during the past few centuries the whole terrestrial population had streamed up the equatorial towers and flowed sunwards towards the young oceans of venus the fertile plains of mercurys temperate zone five hundred years hence when the sun had recovered the exiles would return mercury would be abandoned except for the polar regions but venus would be a permanent second home the quenching of the sun had given the incentive and the opportunity for the taming of that hellish world important though they were these matters concerned the starholmer only indirectly its interest was focused upon more subtle aspects of human culture and society every species was unique with its own surprises its own idiosyncrasies this one had introduced the starholmer to the baffling concept of negative information or in the local terminology humour fantasy myth as it grappled with these strange phenomena the starholmer had sometimes said despairingly to itselves we shall never understand human beings on occasion it had been so frustrated that it had feared an involuntary conjugation with all the risks that entailed but now it had made real progress it could still remember its satisfaction the first time it had made a joke and the children had all laughed working with children had been the clue again provided by aristotle there is an old saying the child is father of the man although the biological concept of father is equally alien to us both in this context the word has a double meaning so here it was hoping that the children would enable it to understand the adults into which they eventually metamorphosed sometimes they told the truth but even when they were being playful and dispensed negative information the starholmer could now recognise the signs yet there were times when neither the children nor the adults nor even aristotle knew the truth there seemed to be a continuous spectrum between absolute fantasy and hard historical facts with every possible graduation in between at the one end were such figures as columbus and leonardo and einstein and lenin and newton and washington whose very voices and images had often been preserved at the other extreme were zeus and alice and king kong and gulliver and siegfried and merlin who could not possibly have existed in the real world but what was one to make of robin hood or tarzan or christ or sherlock holmes or odysseus or frankenstein allowing for a certain amount of exaggeration they might well have been actual historic personages the elephant throne had changed little in three thousand years but never before had it supported the weight of so alien a visitor as the starholmer stared into the south it compared the halfkilometrewide column soaring from the mountain peak with the feats of engineering it had seen on other worlds for such a young race this was indeed impressive though it seemed always on the point of toppling from the sky it had stood now for fifteen centuries not of course in its present form the first hundred kilometres was now a vertical citystill occupied at some of its widelyspaced levels through which the sixteen sets of tracks had often carried a million passengers a day only two of those tracks were operating now in a few hours the starholmer and its escorts would be racing up that huge fluted column on the way back to the ring city that encircled the globe the holmer everted its eyes to give telescopic vision and slowly scanned the zenith yes there it was hard to see by day but easy by night when the sunlight streaming past the shadow of earth still blazed upon it the thin shining band that split the sky into two hemispheres was a whole world in itself where halfabillion humans had opted for permanent zerogravity life and up there beside ring city was the starship that had carried the envoy and all the other companions of the hive across the interstellar gulfs even now it was being readied for departure not with any sense of urgency but several years ahead of schedule in preparation for the next sixhundredyear lap of its journey that would represent no time at all to the starholmer of course for it would not reconjugate until the end of the voyage but then it might well face the greatest challenge of its long career for the first time a starprobe had been destroyed or at least silenced soon after it had entered a solar system perhaps it had at last made contact with the mysterious hunters of the dawn who had left their marks upon so many worlds so inexplicably close to the beginning itself if the starholmer had been capable of awe or of fear it would have known both as it contemplated its future six hundred years hence but now it was on the snowdusted summit of yakkagala facing mankinds pathway to the stars it summoned the children to its side and pointed to the mountain in the south you know perfectly well it said with an exasperation that was only partly feigned that earthport one was built two thousand years later than this ruined palace the children all nodded in solemn agreement then why asked the starholmer tracing the line from the zenith down to the summit of the mountain why do you call that column the tower of kalidasa afterword sources and ackowledgments the writer of historical fiction has a peculiar responsibility to his readers especially when he is dealing with unfamiliar times and places he should not distort facts or events when they are known and when he invents them as he is often compelled to do it is his duty to indicate the dividing line between imagination and reality the writer of science fiction has the same responsibility squared i hope that these notes will not only discharge that obligation but also add to the readers enjoyment taprobane and ceylon for dramatic reasons i have made three trifling changes to the geography of ceylon i have moved the island eight hundred kilometres south so that it straddles the equator as indeed it did twenty million years ago and may some day do again at the moment it lies between six and ten degrees north in addition i have doubled the height of the sacred mountain and moved it closer to yakkagala for both places exist very much as i have described them sri pada or adams peak is a striking coneshaped mountain sacred to the buddhists the muslims the hindus and the christians and bearing a small temple on its summit inside the temple is a stone slab with a depression which though two metres long is reputed to be the footprint of the buddha every year for many centuries thousands of pilgrims have made the long climb to the metrehigh summit the ascent is no longer dangerous for there are two stairways to the very top i have climbed once at the instigation of the new yorkers jeremy bernstein and my legs were paralysed for several days afterwards but it was worth the effort for we were lucky enough to see the beautiful and aweinspiring spectacle of the peaks shadow at dawn a perfectly symmetrical cone visible only for the few minutes after sunrise and stretching almost to the horizon on the clouds far below i have since explored the mountain with much less effort in a sri lanka air force helicopter getting close enough to the temple to observe the resigned expressions on the faces of the monks now accustomed to such noisy intrusions the rock fortress of yakkagala is actually sigiriya the reality of which is so astonishing that i have had no need to change it in any way the only liberties i have taken are chronological for the palace on the summit was built during the reign of the parricide king kasyapa i however it seems incredible that so vast an undertaking could have been carried out in a mere eighteen years by a usurper expecting to be challenged at any moment and the real history of sigiriya may well go back for many centuries before these dates the character motivation and actual fate of kasyapa have been the subject of much controversy recently fuelled by the posthumous the story of sigiri by the sinhalese scholar professor senerat paranavitana i am also indebted to his monumental twovolume study of the inscriptions on the mirror wall sigiri graffiti some of the verses i have quoted are genuine other i have only slightly invented the frescoes which are sigiriyas greatest glory have been handsomely reproduced in ceylon paintings from temple shrine and rock plate v shows the most interesting and the one alas destroyed in the s by unknown vandals the attendant is clearly listening to the mysterious hinged box she is holding in her right hand it remains unidentified the local archaeologists refusing to take seriously my suggestion that it is an early sinhalese transistor radio the legend of sigiriya has recently been brought to the screen by dimitri de grunwald in his production the god king with leigh lawson as a very impressive kasyapa the space elevator this apparently outrageous concept was first presented to the west in a letter in the issue of science for february satellite elongation into a true skyhook by john d isaacs hugh bradner and george b backus of scripps institute of oceanography and allyn c vine of woods hole oceanographic institute though it may seem odd that oceanographers should get involved with such an idea this is not surprising when one realises that they are about the only people who concern themselves with very long cables hanging under their own weight it was later discovered that the concept had already been developed six years earlier and on a much more ambitious scale by a leningrad engineer y n artsutanov artsutanov considered a heavenly funicular to use his engaging name for the device lifting no less than tons a day to synchronous orbit it seems surprising that this daring idea received so little publicity the only mention i have ever seen of it is in the handsome volume of paintings by alexei leonov and sokolov the stars are awaiting us one colour plate shows the space elevator in action the caption reads the satellite will so to say stay fixed in a certain point in the sky if a cable is lowered from the satellite to the earth you will have a ready cableroad an earthsputnikearth elevator for freight and passengers can then be built and it will operate without any rocket propulsion although general leonov gave me a copy of his book at the vienna peaceful uses of space conference in the idea simply failed to register on me despite the fact that the elevator is shown hovering exactly over sri lanka i probably thought that cosmonaut leonov a noted humorist was just having a little joke also a superb diplomat after the vienna screening he made quite the nicest comment on ive ever heard now i feel ive been in space twice presumably after the apollosoyuz mission he would say three times the space elevator is quite clearly an idea whose time has come as is demonstrated by the fact that within a decade of the isaacs letter it was independently reinvented at least three times a very detailed treatment containing many new ideas was published by jerome pearson of wrightpaterson air force base in acta astronautica for septemberoctober dr pearson was astonished to hear of the earlier studies which his computer survey had failed to locate he discovered them through reading my own testimony to the house of representatives space committee in july six years earlier a r collar and j w flower had come to essentially the same conclusions in their paper a low altitude hour satellite they were looking into the possibility of suspending a synchronous communications satellite far below the natural kilometre altitude and did not discuss taking the cable all the way down to the surface of the earth but this is an obvious extension of their treatment and now for a modest cough back in in an essay commissioned by unesco and published in astronautics for february the world of the communications satellite i wrote as a much longer term possibility it might be mentioned that there are a number of theoretical ways of achieving a lowaltitude twentyfourhour satellite but they depend upon technical developments unlikely to occur in this century i leave their contemplation as an exercise for the student the first of these theoretical ways was of course the suspended satellite discussed by collar and flower my crude backofanenvelope calculations based on the strength of existing materials made me so sceptical of the whole idea that i did not bother to spell it out in detail if i had been a little less conservative or if a larger envelope had been available i might have been ahead of everyone except artsutanov himself as this book is more of a novel than an engineering treatise those who wish to go into technical details are referred to the now rapidly expanding literature on the subject recent examples include jerome pearsons using the orbital tower to launch earthescape payloads daily and a remarkable paper by hans moravec a nonsynchronous orbital skyhook i am much indebted to my friends the late a v cleaver of rollsroyce dr ing harry ruppe professor of astronautics at the technical university of munichs lehrstuhl fьr raumfahrttechnic and dr alan bond of the culham laboratories for their valuable comments on the orbital tower they are not responsible for my modifications walter l morgan and gary gordon of the comsat laboratories as well as l perek of the united nations outer space affairs division have provided most useful information on the stable regions of the synchronous orbit they point out that natural forces would cause major oscillations especially in the northsouth directions thus taprobane might not be as advantageous as i have suggested but it would still be better than anywhere else the importance of a highaltitude site is also debatable and i am indebted to sam brand of the naval environmental prediction research facility monterey for information on equatorial winds if it turns out that the tower could be safely taken down to sea level then the maldivian island of gan may be the twentysecond centurys most valuable piece of real estate finally it seems a very strange and even scary coincidence that years before i ever thought of the subject of this novel i myself should have unconsciously gravitated towards its locale for the house i acquired a decade ago on my favourite sri lankan beach is at precisely the closest spot on any large body of land to the point of maximum geosynchronous stability so in my retirement i hope to watch the other superannuated relics of the early space age milling around in the orbital sargasso sea immediately above my head colombo and now one of those extraordinary coincidences i have learned to take for granted while correcting the proofs of this novel i received from dr jerome pearson a copy of nasa technical memorandum tm a space necklace about the earth by g polyakov this is a translation of kosmicheskoye ozherelye zemli published in teknika moloaezhi no pp in this brief but stimulating paper dr polyakov of the astrakhan teaching institute describes in precise engineering details morgans final vision of a continuous ring around the world he sees this as a natural extension of the space elevator whose construction and operation he also discusses in a manner virtually identical with my own treatment i salute tovarich polyakov and am beginning to wonder if yet again i have been too conservative perhaps the orbital tower may be an achievement of the twentyfirst century not the twentysecond our own grandchildren may demonstrate that sometimes gigantic is
