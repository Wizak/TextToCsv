 three soldiers contents part one making the mould part two the metal cools part three machines part four rust part five the world outside part six under the wheels les contemporains qui souffrent de certaines choses ne peuvent sen souvenir quavec une horreur qui paralyse tout autre plaisir meme celui de lire un conte stendhal part one making the mould i the company stood at attention each man looking straight before him at the empty parade ground where the cinder piles showed purple with evening on the wind that smelt of barracks and disinfectant there was a faint greasiness of food cooking at the other side of the wide field long lines of men shuffled slowly into the narrow wooden shanty that was the mess hall chins down chests out legs twitching and tired from the afternoons drilling the company stood at attention each man stared straight in front of him some vacantly with resignation some trying to amuse themselves by noting minutely every object in their field of vision the cinder piles the long shadows of the barracks and mess halls where they could see men standing about spitting smoking leaning against clapboard walls some of the men in line could hear their watches ticking in their pockets someone moved his feet making a crunching noise in the cinders the sergeants voice snarled out you men are at attention quit yer wrigglin there you the men nearest the offender looked at him out of the corners of their eyes two officers far out on the parade ground were coming towards them by their gestures and the way they walked the men at attention could see that they were chatting about something that amused them one of the officers laughed boyishly turned away and walked slowly back across the parade ground the other who was the lieutenant came towards them smiling as he approached his company the smile left his lips and he advanced his chin walking with heavy precise steps sergeant you may dismiss the company the lieutenants voice was pitched in a hard staccato the sergeants hand snapped up to salute like a block signal companee dismissed he rang out the row of men in khaki became a crowd of various individuals with dusty boots and dusty faces ten minutes later they lined up and marched in a column of fours to mess a few red filaments of electric lights gave a dusty glow in the brownish obscurity where the long tables and benches and the board floors had a faint smell of garbage mingled with the smell of the disinfectant the tables had been washed off with after the last meal the men holding their oval mess kits in front of them filed by the great tin buckets at the door out of which meat and potatoes were splashed into each plate by a sweating kp in blue denims dont look so bad tonight said fuselli to the man opposite him as he hitched his sleeves up at the wrists and leaned over his steaming food he was sturdy with curly hair and full vigorous lips that he smacked hungrily as he ate it aint said the pink flaxenhaired youth opposite him who wore his broadbrimmed hat on the side of his head with a certain jauntiness i got a pass tonight said fuselli tilting his head vainly goin to tear things up mani got a girl at home back in frisco shes a good kid yer right not to go with any of the girls in this goddam town they aint clean none of em that is if ye want to go overseas the flaxenhaired youth leaned across the table earnestly im goin to git some more chow wait for me will yer said fuselli what yer going to do down town asked the flaxenhaired youth when fuselli came back dunno run round a bit an go to the movies he answered filling his mouth with potato gawd its time fer retreat they overheard a voice behind them fuselli stuffed his mouth as full as he could and emptied the rest of his meal reluctantly into the garbage pail a few moments later he stood stiffly at attention in a khaki row that was one of hundreds of other khaki rows identical that filled all sides of the parade ground while the bugle blew somewhere at the other end where the flagpole was somehow it made him think of the man behind the desk in the office of the draft board who had said handing him the papers sending him to camp i wish i was going with you and had held out a white bony hand that fuselli after a moments hesitation had taken in his own stubby brown hand the man had added fervently it must be grand just grand to feel the danger the chance of being potted any minute good luck young feller good luck fuselli remembered unpleasantly his paperwhite face and the greenish look of his bald head but the words had made him stride out of the office sticking out his chest brushing truculently past a group of men in the door even now the memory of it mixing with the strains of the national anthem made him feel important truculent squads right same an order crunch crunch crunch in the gravel the companies were going back to their barracks he wanted to smile but he didnt dare he wanted to smile because he had a pass till midnight because in ten minutes hed be outside the gates outside the green fence and the sentries and the strands of barbed wire crunch crunch crunch oh they were so slow in getting back to the barracks and he was losing time precious free minutes hep hep hep cried the sergeant glaring down the ranks with his aggressive bulldog expression to where someone had fallen out of step the company stood at attention in the dusk fuselli was biting the inside of his lips with impatience minutes at last as if reluctantly the sergeant sang out dismissed fuselli hurried towards the gate brandishing his pass with an important swagger once out on the asphalt of the street he looked down the long row of lawns and porches where violet arc lamps already contested the faint afterglow drooping from their iron stalks far above the recently planted saplings of the avenue he stood at the corner slouched against a telegraph pole with the camp fence surmounted by three strands of barbed wire behind him wondering which way he would go this was a hell of a town anyway and he used to think he wanted to travel round and see places homell be good enough for me after this he muttered walking down the long street towards the centre of town where was the movingpicture show he thought of his home of the dark apartment on the ground floor of a sevenstorey house where his aunt lived gee she used to cook swell he murmured regretfully on a warm evening like this he would have stood round at the corner where the drugstore was talking to fellows he knew giggling when the girls who lived in the street walking arm and arm twined in couples or trios passed by affecting ignorance of the glances that followed them or perhaps he would have gone walking with al who worked in the same opticalgoods store down through the glaring streets of the theatre and restaurant quarter or along the wharves and ferry slips where they would have sat smoking and looking out over the dark purple harbor with its winking lights and its moving ferries spilling swaying reflections in the water out of their square reddishglowing windows if they had been lucky they would have seen a liner come in through the golden gate growing from a blur of light to a huge moving brilliance like the front of a highclass theatre that towered above the ferry boats you could often hear the thump of the screw and the swish of the bow cutting the calm baywater and the sound of a band playing that came alternately faint and loud when i git rich fuselli had liked to say to al im going to take a trip on one of them liners yer dad come over from the old country in one didnt he al would ask oh he came steerage id stay at home if i had to do that man first class for me a cabin de lux when i git rich but here he was in

powers bill powers mines fuselli goin to the movies mr eisenstein no im trying to find a skirt the little man leered wanly glad to have got ackwainted goddam kike said powers as eisenstein walked off up a side street planted like the avenue with saplings on which the sickly leaves rustled in the faint breeze that smelt of factories and coal dust kikes aint so bad said fuselli i got a good friend whos a kike they were coming out of the movies in a stream of people in which the blackish clothes of factoryhands predominated i came near bawlin at the picture of the feller leavin his girl to go off to the war said fuselli did yer it was just like it was with me ever been in frisco powers the tall youth shook his head then he took off his broadbrimmed hat and ran his fingers over his stubby

go with coosies ye dont have to say goodby to them ever gone with a coosie not exactly admitted the tall youth blushing all over his pink face so that it was noticeable even under the ashen glare of the arc lights on the avenue that led towards camp i have said fuselli with a certain pride i used to go with a portugee girl my but she was a toughie ive given all that up now im engaged though but i was tellin ye well we finally made up an i kissed her an mabe said shed never marry any one but me so when we was walkin up the street i spied a silk service flag in a winder that was all fancy with a

back an say dont make yerself sick dan an shed had it all the time without my knowin it aint girls clever yare said the tall youth vaguely along the rows of cots when fuselli got back to the barracks men were talking excitedly theres hell to pay somebodys broke out of the jug how damned if i know sergeant timmons said he made a rope of his blankets no the feller on guard helped him to get away like hell he did it was like this i was walking by the guardhouse when they found out about it what company did he belong ter dunno whats his name some guy on trial for insubordination punched an officer in the jaw id a liked to have seen that anyhow hes fixed himself this time youre goddam right will you fellers quit talkin its after taps thundered the sergeant who sat reading the paper at a little board desk at the door of the barracks under the feeble light of one small bulb carefully screened youll have the o d down on us fuselli wrapped the blanket round his head and prepared to sleep snuggled down into the blankets on the narrow cot he felt sheltered from the sergeants thundering voice and from the cold glare of officers eyes he felt cosy and happy like he had felt in bed at home when he had been a little kid for a moment he pictured to himself the other man the man who had punched an officers jaw dressed like he was maybe only nineteen the same age like he was with a girl like mabe waiting for him somewhere how cold and frightful it must feel to be out of the camp with the guard looking for you he pictured himself running breathless down a long street pursued by a company with guns by officers whose eyes glinted cruelly like the pointed tips of bullets he pulled the blanket closer round his head enjoying the warmth and softness of the wool against his cheek he must remember to smile at the sergeant when he passed him off duty somebody had said thered be promotions soon oh he wanted so hard to be promoted itd be so swell if he could write back to mabe and tell her to address her letters corporal dan fuselli he must be more careful not to do anything that would get him in wrong with anybody he must never miss an opportunity to show them what a clever kid he was oh when were ordered overseas ill show them he thought ardently and picturing to himself long movie reels of heroism he went off to sleep a sharp voice beside his cot woke him with a jerk get up you the white beam of a pocket searchlight was glaring in the face of the man next to him the o d said fuselli to himself get up you came the sharp voice again the man in the next cot stirred and opened his eyes get up here sir muttered the man in the next cot his eyes blinking sleepily in the glare of the flashlight he got out of bed and stood unsteadily at attention dont you know better than to sleep in your o d shirt take it off yes sir whats your name the man looked up blinking too dazed to speak dont know your own name eh said the officer glaring at the man savagely using his curt voice like a whip quick take off yer shirt and pants and get back to bed the officer of the day moved on flashing his light to one side and the other in his midnight inspection of the barracks intense blackness again and the sound of men breathing deeply in sleep of men snoring as he went to sleep fuselli could hear the man beside him swearing monotonously in an even whisper pausing now and then to think of new filth of new combinations of words swearing away his helpless anger soothing himself to sleep by the monotonous reiteration of his swearing a little later fuselli woke with a choked nightmare cry he had dreamed that he had smashed the o d in the jaw and had broken out of the jug and was running breathless stumbling falling while the company on guard chased him down an avenue lined with little driedup saplings gaining on him while with voices metallic as the clicking of rifle triggers officers shouted orders so that he was certain to be caught certain to be shot he shook himself all over shaking off the nightmare as a dog shakes off water and went back to sleep again snuggling into his blankets ii john andrews stood naked in the center of a large bare room of which the walls and ceiling and floor were made of raw pine boards the air was heavy from the steam heat at a desk in one corner a typewriter clicked spasmodically say young feller dyou know how to spell imbecility john andrews walked over to the desk told him and added are you going to examine me the man went on typewriting without answering john andrews stood in the center of the floor with his arms folded half amused half angry shifting his weight from one foot to the other listening to the sound of the typewriter and of the mans voice as he read out each word of the report he was copying recommendation for dischargeclick clickdamn this typewriter private coe elbertclick click damn these rotten army typewriters reasonmental deficiency history of case at that moment the recruiting sergeant came back look here if you dont have that recommendation ready in ten minutes captain arthursll be mad as hell about it hill for gods sake get it done he said already that if you couldnt do the work to get somebody who could you dont want to lose your job do you hullo the sergeants eyes lit on john andrews id forgotten you run around the room a little no not that way just a little so i can test yer heart god these rookies are thick while he stood tamely being prodded and measured feeling like a prize horse at a fair john andrews listened to the man at the typewriter whose voice went on monotonously norecord of sexual dep o hell this erasers no good pravity or alcoholism spentnormalyouth on farm appearance normal though imsay how many ms in immature all right put yer clothes on said the recruiting sergeant quick i cant spend all day why the hell did they send you down here alone the papers were balled up said andrews scores ten yearsin test b went on the voice of the man at the typewriter senexal mentmentality that of child of eight seems unableto either goddam this mans writin how kin i copy it when he dont write out his words all right i guess youll do now there are some forms to fill out come over here andrews followed the recruiting sergeant to a desk in the far corner of the room from which he could hear more faintly the click click of the typewriter and the mans voice mumbling angrily forgets to obey orders responds to no form of persuasion memory nil all right take this to barracks b fourth building to the right shake a leg said the recruiting sergeant andrews drew a deep breath of the sparkling air outside he stood irresolutely a moment on the wooden steps of the building looking down the row of hastily constructed barracks some were painted green some were of plain boards and some were still mere skeletons above his head great piled rosetinted clouds were moving slowly across the immeasurable free sky his glance slid down the sky to some tall trees that flamed bright yellow with autumn outside the camp limits and then to the end of the long street of barracks where was a picket fence and a sentry walking to and fro to and fro his brows contracted for a moment then he walked with a sort of swagger towards the fourth building to the right john andrews was washing windows he stood in dirty blue denims at the top of a ladder smearing with a soapy cloth the small panes of the barrack windows his nostrils were full of a smell of dust and of the sandy quality of the soap a little man with one lined greyishred cheek puffed out by tobacco followed him up also on a ladder polishing the panes with a dry cloth till they shone and reflected the mottled cloudy sky andrewss legs were tired from climbing up and down the ladder his hands were sore from the grittiness of the soap as he worked he looked down without thinking on rows of cots where the blankets were all folded the same way on some of which men were sprawled in attitudes of utter relaxation he kept remarking to himself how strange it was that he was not thinking of anything in the last few days his mind seemed to have become a hard meaningless core how long do we have to do this he asked the man who was working with him the man went on chewing so that andrews thought he was not going to answer at all he was just beginning to speak again when the man balancing thoughtfully on top of his ladder drawled out four oclock we wont finish today then the man shook his head and wrinkled his face into a strange spasm as he spat been here long not so long how long three months aint so long the man spat again and climbing down from his ladder waited leaning against the wall until andrews should finish soaping his window ill go crazy if i stay here three months ive been here a week muttered andrews between his teeth as he climbed down and moved his ladder to the next window they both climbed their ladders again in silence hows it youre in casuals asked andrews again aint got no lungs why dont they discharge you reckon theyre going to soon they worked on in silence for a long time andrews stared at the upper righthand corner and smeared with soap each pane of the window in turn then he climbed down moved his ladder and started on the next window at times he would start in the middle of the window for variety as he worked a rhythm began pushing its way through the hard core of his mind leavening it making it fluid it expressed the vast dusty dullness the men waiting in rows on drill fields standing at attention the monotony of feet tramping in unison of the dust rising from the battalions going back and forth over the dusty drill fields he felt the rhythm filling his whole body from his sore hands to his legs tired from marching back and forth from making themselves the same length as millions of other legs his mind began unconsciously from habit working on it orchestrating it he could imagine a vast orchestra swaying with it his heart was beating faster he must make it into music he must fix it in himself so that he could make it into music and write it down so that orchestras could play it and make the ears of multitudes feel it make their flesh tingle with it he went on working through the endless afternoon climbing up and down his ladder smearing the barrack windows with a soapy rag a silly phrase took the place of the welling of music in his mind arbeit und rhythmus he kept saying it over and over to himself arbeit und rhythmus he tried to drive the phrase out of his mind to bury his mind in the music of the rhythm that had come to him that expressed the dusty boredom the harsh constriction of warm bodies full of gestures and attitudes and aspirations into moulds like the moulds toy soldiers are cast in the phrase became someone shouting raucously in his ears arbeit und rhythmus drowning everything else beating his mind hard again parching it but suddenly he laughed aloud why it was in german he was being got ready to kill men who said that if anyone said that he was going to kill him they were going to kill everybody who spoke that language he and all the men whose feet he could hear tramping on the drill field whose legs were all being made the same length on the drill field iii it was saturday morning directed by the corporal a bandylegged italian who even on the army diet managed to keep a faint odour of garlic about him three soldiers in blue denims were sweeping up the leaves in the street between the rows of barracks you fellers are slow as molasses inspection in twentyfive minutes he kept saying the soldiers raked on doggedly paying no attention you dont give a damn if we dont pass inspection i get hell not you please queeck here you pick up all those goddam cigarette butts andrews made a grimace and began collecting the little grey sordid ends of burntout cigarettes as he leant over he found himself looking into the darkbrown eyes of the soldier who was working beside him the eyes were contracted with anger and there was a flush under the tan of the boyish face ah didnt git in this here army to be ordered around by a goddam wop he muttered doesnt matter much who youre ordered around by youre ordered around just the same said andrews where dye come from buddy oh i come from new york my folks are from virginia said andrews indianas ma state the tornado country git to work heres that bastard wop comin around the buildin dont pick em up thataway sweep em up shouted the corporal andrews and the indiana boy went round with a broom and a shovel collecting chewedout quids of tobacco and cigar butts and stained bits of paper whats your name mahns chrisfield folks all call me chris mines andrews john andrews ma dad uster have a hired man named andy took sick an died last summer how long dye reckon itll be before usguys git overseas god i dont know ah want to see that country over there you do dont you you bet i do all right what you fellers stand here for go and dump them garbage cans lively shouted the corporal waddling about importantly on his bandy legs he kept looking down the row of barracks muttering to himself goddam time fur inspectin now goddam wont never pass this time his face froze suddenly into obsequious immobility he brought his hand up to the brim of his hat a group of officers strode past him into the nearest building john andrews coming back from emptying the garbage pails went in the back door of his barracks attention came the cry from the other end he made his neck and arms as rigid as possible through the silent barracks came the hard clank of the heels of the officers inspecting a sallow face with hollow eyes and heavy square jaw came close to andrewss eyes he stared straight before him noting the few reddish hairs on the officers adams apple and the new insignia on either side of his collar sergeant who is this man came a voice from the sallow face dont know sir a new recruit sir corporal valori who is this man the names andrews sergeant said the italian corporal with an obsequious whine in his voice the officer addressed andrews directly speaking fast and loud how long have you been in the army one week sir dont you know you have to be clean and shaved and ready for inspection every saturday morning at nine i was cleaning the barracks sir to teach you not to answer back when an officer addresses you the officer spaced his words carefully lingering on them as he spoke he glanced out of the corner of his eye at his superior and noticed the major was frowning his tone changed ever so slightly if this ever occurs again you may be sure that disciplinary action will be taken attention there at the other end of the barracks a man had moved again amid absolute silence could be heard the clanking of the officers heels as the inspection continued now fellows all together cried the y man who stood with his arms stretched wide in front of the movie screen the piano started jingling and the roomful of crowded soldiers roared out hail hail the gangs all here were going to get the kaiser were going to get the kaiser were going to get the kaiser now the rafters rang with their deep voices the y man twisted his lean face into a facetious expression somebody tried to put one over on the y man and sing what the hell do we care but you do care dont you buddy he shouted there was a little rattle of laughter now once more said the y man again and lots of guts in the get and lots of kill in the kaiser now all together the moving pictures had begun john andrews looked furtively about him at the face of the indiana boy beside him intent on the screen at the tanned faces and the closecropped heads that rose above the mass of khakicovered bodies about him here and there a pair of eyes glinted in the white flickering light from the screen waves of laughter or of little exclamations passed over them they were all so alike they seemed at moments to be but one organism this was what he had sought when he had enlisted he said to himself it was in this that he would take refuge from the horror of the world that had fallen upon him he was sick of revolt of thought of carrying his individuality like a banner above the turmoil this was much better to let everything go to stamp out his maddening desire for music to humble himself into the mud of common slavery he was still tingling with sudden anger from the officers voice that morning sergeant who is this man the officer had stared in his face as a man might stare at a piece of furniture aint this some film chrisfield turned to him with a smile that drove his anger away in a pleasant feeling of comradeship the part thats comins fine i seen it before out in frisco said the man on the other side of andrews gee it makes ye hate the huns the man at the piano jingled elaborately in the intermission between the two parts of the movie the indiana boy leaned in front of john andrews putting an arm round his shoulders and talked to the other man you from frisco yare thats goddam funny youre from the coast this fellers from new york an ahm from ole indiana right in the middle what company you in ah aint yet this feller an mes in casuals thats a hell of a place say my names fuselli mahns chrisfield mines andrews how soons it take a feller to git out o this camp dunno some guys says three weeks and some says six months say mebbe youll get into our company they transferred a lot of men out the other day an the corporal says theyre going to give us rookies instead goddam it though but ah want to

torino wheres that i dunno hes an eyetalian say how long does it take to git overseas oh a week or two said andrews as long as that but the movie had begun again unfolding scenes of soldiers in spiked helmets marching into belgian cities full of little milk carts drawn by dogs and old women in peasant costume there were hisses and catcalls when a german flag was seen and as the troops were pictured advancing bayonetting the civilians in wide dutch pants the old women with starched caps the soldiers packed into the stuffy y m c a hut shouted oaths at them andrews felt blind hatred stirring like something that had a life of its own in the young men about him he was lost in it carried away in it as in a stampede of wild cattle the terror of it was like ferocious hands clutching his throat he glanced at the faces round him they were all intent and flushed glinting with sweat in the heat of the room as he was leaving the hut pressed in a tight stream of soldiers moving towards the door andrews heard a man say i never raped a woman in my life but by god im going to id give a lot to rape some of those goddam german women i hate em too came another voice men women children and unborn children theyre either jackasses or full of the lust for power like their rulers are to let themselves be governed by a bunch of warlords like that ahd lahk te cepture a german officer an make him shine ma boots an then shoot him dead said chris to andrews as they walked down the long row towards their barracks you would but ahd a damn side rather shoot somebody else ah know went on chris intensely dont stay far from here either an ahll do it too if he dont let off pickin on me whos that that big squirt anderson they made a file closer at drill yesterday he seems to think that just because ahm littler than him he can do anything he likes with me andrews turned sharply and looked in his companions face something in the gruffness of the boys tone startled him he was not accustomed to this he had thought of himself as a passionate person but never in his life had he wanted to kill a man dyou really want to kill him not now but he gits the hell started in me the way he teases me ah pulled ma knife on him yisterday you wasnt there didnt ye notice ah looked sort o upsot at drill yesbut how old are you chris ahm twenty youre older than me aint yer im twentytwo they were leaning against the wall of their barracks looking up at the brilliant starry night say is the stars the same over there overseas as they is here i guess so said andrews laughing though ive never been to see ah never had much schoolin went on chris i lef school when i was twelve cause it warnt much good an dad drank so the folks needed me to work on the farm what do you grow in your part of the country

there till daylight an got mud all through ma hair ah dont scarcely tech a drop now though so youre in a hurry to get overseas chris like me said andrews after a long pause ahll push that guy anderson into the sea if we both go over on the same boat said chrisfield laughing but he added after a pause it would have been hell if ahd killed that feller though honest ah wouldnt awanted to do that thats the job that pays a violinist said somebody no it dont came a melancholy drawling voice from a lanky man who sat doubled up with his long face in his hands and his elbows resting on his knees just brings a living wagea living wage several men were grouped at the end of the barracks from them the long row of cots with here and there a man asleep or a man hastily undressing stretched lighted by occasional feeble electriclight bulbs to the sergeants little table beside the door youre gettin a discharge arent you asked a man with a brogue and the red face of a jovial gorilla that signified the bartender yes flannagan i am said the lanky man dolefully aint he got hard luck came a voice from the crowd yes i have got hard luck buddy said the lanky man looking at the faces about him out of sunken eyes i ought to be getting forty dollars a week and here i am getting seven and in the army besides i meant that you were gettin out of this goddam army the army the army the democratic army chanted someone under his breath but begorry i want to go overseas and ave a look at the uns said flannagan who managed with strange skill to combine a cockney whine with his irish brogue overseas took up the lanky man if i could have gone an studied overseas id be making as much as kubelik i had the makings of a good player in me why dont you go asked andrews who stood on the outskirts with fuselli and chris look at met b said the lanky man well they cant get me over there soon enough said flannagan must be funny not bein able to understand what folks say they say we over there when they

an set the goddam kaiser up to a drink the kaiserll be strung up on a telephone pole by that time ye neednt worry flannagan they ought to torture him to death like they do niggers when they lynch em down south a bugle sounded far away outside on the parade ground everyone slunk away silently to his cot john andrews arranged himself carefully in his blankets promising himself a quiet time of thought before going to sleep he needed to be awake and think at night this way so that he might not lose entirely the thread of his own life of the life he would take up again some day if he lived through it he brushed away the thought of death it was uninteresting he didnt care anyway but some day he would want to play the piano again to write music he must not let himself sink too deeply into the helpless mentality of the soldier he must keep his will power no but that was not what he had wanted to think about he was so bored with himself at any cost he must forget himself ever since his first year at college he seemed to have done nothing but think about himself talk about himself at least at the bottom in the utterest degradation of slavery he could find forgetfulness and start rebuilding the fabric of his life out of real things this time out of work and comradeship and scorn scorn that was the quality he needed it was such a raw fantastic world he had suddenly fallen into his life before this week seemed a dream read in a novel a picture he had seen in a shop window it was so different could it have been in the same world at all he must have died without knowing it and been born again into a new futile hell when he had been a child he had lived in a dilapidated mansion that stood among old oaks and chestnuts beside a road where buggies and oxcarts passed rarely to disturb the sandy ruts that lay in the mottled shade he had had so many dreams lying under the crepemyrtle bush at the end of the overgrown garden he had passed the long virginia afternoons thinking while the dryflies whizzed sleepily in the sunlight of the world he would live in when he grew up he had planned so many lives for himself a general like caesar he was to conquer the world and die murdered in a great marble hall a wandering minstrel he would go through all countries singing and have intricate endless adventures a great musician he would sit at the piano playing like chopin in the engraving while beautiful women wept and men with long curly hair hid their faces in their hands it was only slavery that he had not foreseen his race had dominated for too many centuries for that and yet the world was made of various slaveries john andrews lay on his back on his cot while everyone about him slept and snored in the dark barracks a certain terror held him in a week the great structure of his romantic world so full of many colors and harmonies that had survived school and college and the buffeting of making a living in new york had fallen in dust about him he was utterly in the void how silly he thought this is the world as it has appeared to the majority of men this is just the lower half of the pyramid he thought of his friends of fuselli and chrisfield and that funny little man eisenstein they seemed at home in this army life they did not seem appalled by the loss of their liberty but they had never lived in the glittering other world yet he could not feel the scorn of them he wanted to feel he thought of them singing under the direction of the y man hail hail the gangs all here were going to get the kaiser were going to get the kaiser were going to get the kaiser now he thought of himself and chrisfield picking up cigarette butts and the tramp tramp tramp of feet on the drill field where was the connection was this all futile madness theyd come from such various worlds all these men sleeping about him to be united in this and what did they think of it all these sleepers had they too not had dreams when they were boys or had the generations prepared them only for this he thought of himself lying under the crepemyrtle bush through the hot droning afternoon watching the pale magenta flowers flutter down into the dry grass and felt again wrapped in his warm blankets among all these sleepers the straining of limbs burning with desire to rush untrammelled through some new keen air suddenly darkness overspread his mind he woke with a start the bugle was blowing outside all right look lively the sergeant was shouting another day iv the stars were very bright when fuselli eyes stinging with sleep stumbled out of the barracks they trembled like bits of brilliant jelly in the black velvet of the sky just as something inside him trembled with excitement anybody know where the electricity turns on asked the sergeant in a goodhumored voice here it is the light over the door of the barracks snapped on revealing a rotund cheerful man with a little yellow mustache and an unlit cigarette dangling out of the corner of his mouth grouped about him in overcoats and caps the men of the company rested their packs against their knees all right line up men eyes looked curiously at fuselli as he lined up with the rest he had been transferred into the company the night before attenshun shouted the sergeant then he wrinkled up his eyes and grinned hard at the slip of paper he had in his hand while the men of his company watched him affectionately answer here when your name is called allan bc yo came a shrill voice from the end of the line anspach here meanwhile outside the other barracks other companies could be heard calling the roll somewhere from the end of the street came a cheer well i guess i can tell you now fellers said the sergeant with his air of quiet omniscience when he had called the last name were going overseas everybody cheered shut up you dont want the huns to hear us do you the company laughed and there was a broad grin on the sergeants round face seem to have a pretty decent topkicker whispered fuselli to the man next to him you bet yer kid hes a peach said the other man in a voice full of devotion this is some company i can tell you that you bet it is said the next man along the corporals in the red sox outfield the lieutenant appeared suddenly in the area of light in front of the barracks he was a pinkfaced boy his trench coat a little too large was very new and stuck out stiffly from his legs everything all right sergeant everything all right he asked several times shifting his weight from one foot to the other all ready for entrainment sir said the sergeant heartily very good ill let you know the order of march in a minute fusellis ears pounded with strange excitement these phrases entrainment order of march had a businesslike sound he suddenly started to wonder how it would feel to be under fire memories of movies flickered in his mind gawd aint i glad to git out o this hellhole he said to the man next him the next one may be more of a hellhole yet buddy said the sergeant striding up and down with his important confident walk everybody laughed hes some sergeant our sergeant is said the man next to fuselli hes got brains in his head that boy has all right break ranks said the sergeant but if anybody moves away from this barracks ill put him in k p till till hell be able to peel spuds in his sleep the company laughed again fuselli noticed with displeasure that the tall man with the shrill voice whose name had been called first on the roll did not laugh but spat disgustedly out of the corner of his mouth well there are bad eggs in every good bunch thought fuselli it gradually grew grey with dawn fusellis legs were tired from standing so long outside all the barracks as far as he could see up the street men stood in ragged lines waiting the sun rose hot on a cloudless day a few sparrows twittered about the tin roof of the barracks hell were not goin this day why asked somebody savagely troops always leaves at night the hell they do here comes sarge everybody craned their necks in the direction pointed out the sergeant strolled up with a mysterious smile on his face put away your overcoats and get out your mess kits mess kits clattered and gleamed in the slanting rays of the sun they marched to the mess hall and back again lined up again with packs and waited some more everybody began to get tired and peevish fuselli wondered where his old friends of the other company were they were good kids too chris and that educated fellow andrews tough luck they couldnt have come along the sun rose higher men sneaked into the barracks one by one and lay down on the bare cots what you want to bet we wont leave this camp for a week yet asked someone at noon they lined up for mess again ate dismally and hurriedly as fuselli was leaving the mess hall tapping a tattoo on his kit with two dirty finger nails the corporal spoke to him in a low voice be sure to wash yer kit buddy we may have pack inspection the corporal was a slim yellowfaced man with a wrinkled skin though he was still young and an arrowshaped mouth that opened and shut like the paper mouths children make all right corporal fuselli answered cheerfully he wanted to make a good impression fellersll be sayin all right corporal to me soon he thought an idea that he repelled came into his mind the corporal didnt look strong he wouldnt last long overseas and he pictured mabe writing corporal dan fuselli oard at the end of the afternoon the lieutenant appeared suddenly his face flushed his trench coat stiffer than ever all right sergeant line up your men he said in a breathless voice all down the camp street companies were forming one by one they marched out in columns of fours and halted with their packs on the day was getting amber with sunset retreat sounded fusellis mind had suddenly become very active the notes of the bugle and of the band playing the star spangled banner sifted into his consciousness through a dream of what it would be like over there he was in a place like the exposition ground full of old men and women in peasant costume like in the song when its apple blossom time in normandy men in spiked helmets who looked like firemen kept charging through like the kuklux klan in the movies jumping from their horses and setting fire to buildings with strange outlandish gestures spitting babies on their long swords those were the huns then there were flags blowing very hard in the wind and the sound of a band the yanks were coming everything was lost in a scene from a movie in which khakiclad regiments marched fast fast across the scene the memory of the shouting that always accompanied it drowned out the picture the guns must make a racket though he added as an afterthought attenshun forwa ard march the long street of the camp was full of the tramping of feet they were off as they passed through the gate fuselli caught a glimpse of chris standing with his arm about andrewss shoulders they both waved fuselli grinned and expanded his chest they were just rookies still he was going overseas the weight of the pack tugged at his shoulders and made his feet heavy as if they were charged with lead the sweat ran down his closeclipped head under the overseas cap and streamed into his eyes and down the sides of his nose through the tramp of feet he heard confusedly cheering from the sidewalk in front of him the backs of heads and the swaying packs got smaller rank by rank up the street above them flags dangled from windows flags leisurely swaying in the twilight but the weight of the pack as the column marched under arc lights glaring through the afterglow inevitably forced his head to droop forward the soles of boots and legs wrapped in puttees and the bottom strap of the pack of the man ahead of him were all he could see the pack seemed heavy enough to push him through the asphalt pavement and all about him was the faint jingle of equipment and the tramp of feet every part of him was full of sweat he could feel vaguely the steam of sweat that rose from the ranks of struggling bodies about him but gradually he forgot everything but the pack tugging at his shoulders weighing down his thighs and ankles and feet and the monotonous rhythm of his feet striking the pavement and of the other feet in front of him behind him beside him crunching crunching the train smelt of new uniforms on which the sweat had dried and of the smoke of cheap cigarettes fuselli awoke with a start he had been asleep with his head on bill greys shoulder it was already broad daylight the train was jolting slowly over crosstracks in some dismal suburb full of long sootsmeared warehouses and endless rows of freight cars beyond which lay brown marshland and slategrey stretches of water god that must be the atlantic ocean cried fuselli in excitement aint yer never seen it before thats the perth river said bill grey scornfully no i come from the coast they stuck their heads out of the window side by side so that their cheeks touched gee theres some skirts said bill grey the train jolted to a stop two untidy redhaired girls were standing beside the track waving their hands give us a kiss cried bill grey sure said a girl anythin fer one of our boys she stood on tiptoe and grey leaned far out of the window just managing to reach the girls forehead fuselli felt a flush of desire all over him hol onter my belt he said ill kiss her right he leaned far out and throwing his arms around the girls pink gingham shoulders lifted her off the ground and kissed her furiously on the lips lemme go lemme go cried the girl men leaning out of the other windows of the car cheered and shouted fuselli kissed her again and then dropped her yere too rough damn ye said the girl angrily a man from one of the windows yelled ill go an tell mommer and everybody laughed the train moved on fuselli looked about him proudly the image of mabe giving him the fivepound box of candy rose a moment in his mind aint no harm in havin a little fun dont mean nothin he said aloud you just wait till we hit france well hit it up some with the madimerzels wont we kid said bill grey slapping fuselli on the knee beautiful katy kikikaty youre the only gugugugirl that i adore and when the momoon shines over the cowshed ill be waiting at the kikikikitchen door everybody sang as the thumping of wheels over rails grew faster fuselli looked about contentedly at the company sprawling over their packs and equipment in the smoky car its great to be a soldier he said to bill grey ye kin do anything ye goddam please this said the corporal as the company filed into barracks identical to those they had left two days before is an embarkation camp but id like to know where the hell we embark at he twisted his face into a smile and then shouted with lugubrious intonation fall in for mess it was pitch dark in that part of the camp the electric lights had a sparse reddish glow fuselli kept straining his eyes expecting to see a wharf and the masts of a ship at the end of every alley the line filed into a dim mess hall where a thin stew was splashed into the mess kits behind the counter of the kitchen the noncoms the jovial first sergeant and the businesslike sergeant who looked like a preacher and the wrinkledfaced corporal who had been on the red sox outfield could be seen eating steak a faint odor of steak frying went through the mess hall and made the thin chilly stew utterly tasteless in comparison fuselli looked enviously towards the kitchen and thought of the day when he would be a noncom too i got to get busy he said to himself earnestly overseas under fire hed have a chance to show what he was worth and he pictured himself heroically carrying a wounded captain back to a dressing tent pursued by fiercewhiskered men with spiked helmets like firemens helmets the strumming of a guitar came strangely down the dark street of the camp some guy sure can play said bill grey who with his hands in his pockets slouched along beside fuselli they looked in the door of one of the barracks a lot of soldiers were sitting in a ring round two tall negroes whose black faces and chests glistened like jet in the faint light come on charley give us another said someone do ah git it now or mus ah hesitate one negro began chanting while the other strummed carelessly on the guitar no give us the titanic the guitar strummed in a crooning ragtime for a moment the negros voice broke into it suddenly pitched high dis is de song ob de titanic sailin on de sea the guitar strummed on there had been a tension in the negros voice that had made everyone stop talking the soldiers looked at him curiously how de titanic ran in dat cole iceberg how de titanic ran in dat cole iceberg sailin on de sea his voice was confidential and soft and the guitar strummed to the same sobbing ragtime verse after verse the voice grew louder and the strumming faster de titanics sinkin in de deep blue sinkin in de deep blue deep blue sinkin in de sea o de women an de chilen afloatin in de sea o de women an de chilen afloatin in de sea roun dat cole iceberg sung nearer my gawd to thee sung nearer my gawd to thee nearer to thee the guitar was strumming the hymntune the negro was singing with every cord in his throat taut almost sobbing a man next to fuselli took careful aim and spat into the box of sawdust in the middle of the ring of motionless soldiers the guitar played the ragtime again fast almost mockingly the negro sang in low confidential tones o de women an de chilen dey sank in de sea o de women an de chilen dey sank in de sea roun dat cole iceberg before he had finished a bugle blew in the distance everybody scattered fuselli and bill grey went silently back to their barracks it must be an awful thing to drown in the sea said grey as he rolled himself in his blankets if one of those bastard uboats i dont give a damn said fuselli boisterously but as he lay staring into the darkness cold terror stiffened him suddenly he thought for a moment of deserting pretending he was sick anything to keep from going on the transport o de women an de chilen dey sank in de sea roun dat cole iceberg he could feel himself going down through icy water its a hell of a thing to send a guy over there to drown he said to himself and he thought of the hilly streets of san francisco and the glow of the sunset over the harbor and ships coming in through the golden gate his mind went gradually blank and he went to sleep the column was like some curious khakicolored carpet hiding the road as far as you could see in fusellis company the men were shifting their weight from one foot to the other muttering what the hell a they waiting for now bill grey next to fuselli in the ranks stood bent double so as to take the weight of his pack off his shoulders they were at a crossroads on fairly high ground so that they could see the long sheds and barracks of the camp stretching away in every direction in rows and rows broken now and then by a grey drill field in front of them the column stretched to the last bend in the road where it disappeared on a hill among mustardyellow suburban houses fuselli was excited he kept thinking of the night before when he had helped the sergeant distribute emergency rations and had carried about piles of boxes of hard bread counting them carefully without a mistake he felt full of desire to do things to show what he was good for gee he said to himself this wars a lucky thing for me i might have been in the rc vicker companys store for five years an never got a raise an here in the army i got a chance to do almost anything far ahead down the road the column was beginning to move voices shouting orders beat crisply on the morning air fusellis heart was thumping he felt proud of himself and of the company the damn best company in the whole outfit the company ahead was moving it was their turn now forwa ard march they were lost in the monotonous tramp of feet dust rose from the road along which like a drab brown worm crawled the column a sickening unfamiliar smell choked their nostrils what are they taking us down here for damned if i know they were filing down ladders into the terrifying pit which the hold of the ship seemed to them every man had a blue card in his hand with a number on it in a dim place like an empty warehouse they stopped the sergeant shouted out i guess this is our diggings well have to make the best of it then he disappeared fuselli looked about him he was sitting in one of the lowest of three tiers of bunks roughly built of new pine boards electric lights placed here and there gave a faint reddish tone to the gloom except at the ladders where highpower lamps made a white glare the place was full of tramping of feet and the sound of packs being thrown on bunks as endless files of soldiers poured in down every ladder somewhere down the alley an officer with a shrill voice was shouting to his men speed it up there speed it up there fuselli sat on his bunk looking at the terrifying confusion all about feeling bewildered and humiliated for how many days would they be in that dark pit he suddenly felt angry they had no right to treat a feller like that he was a man not a bale of hay to be bundled about as anybody liked an if were torpedoed a fat chance well have down here he said aloud they got sentries posted to keep us from goin up on deck said someone god damn them they treat you like you was a steer being taken over for meat well youre not a damn sight more meat for the guns a little man lying in one of the upper bunks had spoken suddenly contracting his sallow face into a curious spasm as if the words had burst from him in spite of an effort to keep them in everybody looked up at him angrily that goddam kike eisenstein muttered someone say tie that bull outside shouted bill grey goodnaturedly fools muttered eisenstein turning over and burying his face in his hands gee i wonder what it is makes it smell so funny down here said fuselli fuselli lay flat on deck resting his head on his crossed arms when he looked straight up he could see a leadcolored mast sweep back and forth across the sky full of clouds of light grey and silver and dark purplishgrey showing yellowish at the edges when he tilted his head a little to one side he could see bill greys heavy colorless face and the dark bristles of his unshaven chin and his mouth a little twisted to the left from which a cigarette dangled unlighted beyond were heads and bodies huddled together in a mass of khaki overcoats and life preservers and when the roll tipped the deck he had a view of moving green waves and of a steamer striped grey and white and the horizon a dark taut line broken here and there by the tops of waves o god i feel sick said bill grey taking the cigarette out of his mouth and looking at it revengefully id be all right if everything didnt stink so an that mess hall nearly makes a guy puke to think of it fuselli spoke in a whining voice watching the top of the mast move like a pencil scrawling on paper back and forth across the mottled clouds you bellyachin again a brown moonshaped face with thick black eyebrows and hair curling crisply about a forehead with many horizontal wrinkles rose from the deck on the other side of fuselli get the hell out of here feel sick sonny came the deep voice again and the dark eyebrows contracted in an expression of sympathy funny id have my sixshooter out if i was home and you told me to get the hell out sonny well who wouldnt be sore when they have to go on kp said fuselli peevishly i aint been down to mess in three days a feller who lives on the plains like i do ought to take to the sea like a duck but it dont seem to suit me god theyre a sick lookin bunch i have to sling the hash to said fuselli more cheerfully i dont know how they get that way the fellers in our company aint that way they look like they was askeered somebody was going to hit em ever noticed that meadville well what dye expect of you guys who live in the city all your lives and dont know the butt from the barrel of a gun an never straddled anything more like a horse than a broomstick yere juss made to be sheep no wonder they have to herd you round like calves meadville got to his feet and went unsteadily to the rail keeping as he threaded his way through the groups that covered the transports after deck a little of his cowboys bowlegged stride i know what it is that makes mens eyes blink when they go down to that putrid mess came a nasal voice fuselli turned round eisenstein was sitting in the place meadville had just left you do do you its part of the system youve got to turn men into beasts before ye can get em to act that way ever read tolstoi no say you want to be careful how you go talkin around the way you do fuselli lowered his voice confidentially i heard of a feller bein shot at camp merritt for talkin around i dont care im a desperate man said eisenstein dont ye feel sick gawd i do did you get rid o any of it meadville why dont they fight their ole war somewhere a man can get to on a horse say thats my seat the place was empty i sat down in it said eisenstein lowering his head sullenly you kin have three winks to get out o my place said meadville squaring his broad shoulders you are stronger than me said eisenstein moving off god its hell not to have a gun muttered meadville as he settled himself on the deck again dye know sonny i nearly cried when i found i was going to be in this damn medical corps i enlisted for the tanks this is the first time in my life i havent had a gun i even think i had one in my cradle thats funny said fuselli the sergeant appeared suddenly in the middle of the group his face red say fellers he said in a low voice go down an straighten out the bunks as fast as you goddam can theyre having an inspection its a hell of a note they all filed down the gang planks into the foulsmelling hold where there was no light but the invariable reddish glow of electric bulbs they had hardly reached their bunks when someone called attention three officers stalked by their firm important tread a little disturbed by the rolling their heads were stuck forward and they peered from side to side among the bunks with the cruel searching glance of hens looking for worms fuselli said the first sergeant bring up the record book to my stateroom on the lower deck all right sarge said fuselli with alacrity he admired the first sergeant and wished he could imitate his jovial domineering manner it was the first time he had been in the upper part of the ship it seemed a different world the long corridors with red carpets the white paint and the gilt mouldings on the partitions the officers strolling about at their ease it all made him think of the big liners he used to watch come in through the golden gate the liners he was going to europe on some day when he got rich oh if he could only get to be a sergeant firstclass all this comfort and magnificence would be his he found the number and knocked on the door laughter and loud talking came from inside the stateroom wait a sec came an unfamiliar voice sergeant olster here oh its one o my gang came the sergeants voice let him in he wont peach on us the door opened and he saw sergeant olster and two other young men sitting with their feet dangling over the red varnished boards that enclosed the bunks they were talking gaily and had glasses in their hands paris is some town i can tell you one was saying they say the girls come up an put their arms round you right in the main street heres the records sergeant said fuselli stiffly in his best military manner oh thanks theres nothing else i want said the sergeant his voice more jovial than ever dont fall overboard like the guy in company c fuselli laughed as he closed the door growing serious suddenly on noticing that one of the young men wore in his shirt the gold bar of a second lieutenant gee he said to himself i ought to have saluted he waited a moment outside the closed door of the stateroom listening to the talk and the laughter wishing he were one of that merry group talking about women in paris he began thinking sure hed get private firstclass as soon as they got overseas then in a couple of months he might be corporal if they saw much service hed move along all right once he got to be a noncom oh i mustnt get in wrong oh i mustnt get in wrong he kept saying to himself as he went down the ladder into the hold but he forgot everything in the seasickness that came on again as he breathed in the fetid air the deck now slanted down in front of him now rose so that he was walking up an incline dirty water slushed about from one side of the passage to the other with every lurch of the ship when he reached the door the whistling howl of the wind through the hinges and cracks made fuselli hesitate a long time with his hand on the knob the moment he turned the knob the door flew open and he was in the full sweep of the wind the deck was deserted the wet ropes strung along it shivered dismally in the wind every other moment came the rattle of spray that rose up in white fringy trees to windward and smashed against him like hail without closing the door he crept forward along the deck clinging as hard as he could to the icy rope beyond the spray he could see huge marbled green waves rise in constant succession out of the mist the roar of the wind in his ears confused him and terrified him it seemed ages before he reached the door of the forward house that opened on a passage that smelt of drugs and breathed out air where men waited in a packed line thrown one against the other by the lurching of the boat to get into the dispensary the roar of the wind came to them faintly and only now and then the hollow thump of a wave against the bow you sick a man asked fuselli naw im not sick but sarge sent me to get some stuff for some guys thats too sick to move an awful lot o sickness on this boat two fellers died this mornin in that there room said another man solemnly pointing over his shoulder with a jerk of the thumb aint buried em yet its too rough whatd they die of asked fuselli eagerly spinal somethin menegitis broke in a man at the end of the line say thats awful catchin aint it it sure is where does it hit yer asked fuselli yer neck swells up an then you juss go stiff all over came the mans voice from the end of the line there was a silence from the direction of the infirmary a man with a packet of medicines in his hand began making his way towards the door many guys in there asked fuselli in a low voice as the man brushed past him when the door closed again the man beside fuselli who was tall and broad shouldered with heavy black eyebrows burst out as if he were saying something hed been trying to keep from saying for a long while it wont be right if that sickness gets me indeed it wont ive got a girl waitin for me at home its two years since i aint touched a woman all on account of her it aint natural for a fellow to go so long as that why didnt you marry her before you left somebody asked mockingly said she didnt want to be no war bride that she could wait for me better if i didnt several men laughed it wouldnt be right if i took sick an died of this sickness after keepin myself clean on account of that girl it wouldnt be right the man muttered again to fuselli fuselli was picturing himself lying in his bunk with a swollen neck while his arms and legs stiffened stiffened a redfaced man half way up the passage started speaking when i thinks to myself how much the folks need me home it makes me feel sort o confidentlike i dunno why i juss cant cash in my checks thats all he laughed jovially no one joined in the laugh is it awfully catchin asked fuselli of the man next him most catchin thing there is he answered solemnly the worst of it is another man was muttering in a shrill hysterical voice bein thrown over to the sharks gee they aint got a right to do that even if it is war time they aint got a right to treat a christian like he was a dead dawg they got a right to do anythin they goddam please buddy whos goin to stop em id like to know cried the redfaced man if he was an awficer they wouldnt throw him over like that came the shrill hysterical voice again cut that said someone else no use gettin in wrong juss for the sake of talkin but aint it dangerous waitin round up here so near where those fellers are with that sickness whispered fuselli to the man next him reckon it is buddy came the other mans voice dully fuselli started making his way toward the door lemme out fellers ive got to puke he said shoot he was thinking ill tell em the place was closed theyll never come to look as he opened the door he thought of himself crawling back to his bunk and feeling his neck swell and his hands burn with fever and his arms and legs stiffen until everything would be effaced in the blackness of death but the roar of the wind and the lash of the spray as he staggered back along the deck drowned all other thought fuselli and another man carried the dripping garbagecan up the ladder that led up from the mess hall it smelt of rancid grease and coffee grounds and greasy juice trickled over their fingers as they struggled with it at last they burst out on to the deck where a free wind blew out of the black night they staggered unsteadily to the rail and emptied the pail into the darkness the splash was lost in the sound of the waves and of churned water fleeing along the sides fuselli leaned over the rail and looked down at the faint phosphorescence that was the only light in the whole black gulf he had never seen such darkness before he clutched hold of the rail with both hands feeling lost and terrified in the blackness in the roaring of the wind in his ears and the sound of churned water fleeing astern the alternative was the stench of below decks ill bring down the rosie dont you bother he said to the other man kicking the can that gave out a ringing sound as he spoke he strained his eyes to make out something the darkness seemed to press in upon his eyeballs blinding him suddenly he noticed voices near him two men were talking i aint never seen the sea before this i didnt know it was like this were in the zone now that means we may go down any minute yare christ how black it is itld be awful to drown in the dark like this itld be over soon say fred have you ever been so skeered that

water speeding along the ships side and the wind roaring in his ears i aint never seen the sea before this time fred an it sort o gits my goat all this sickness an all they dropped three of em overboard yesterday hell kid dont think of it say fred if iif iif youre saved fred an not me youll write to my folks wont you indeed i will but i reckon you an mell both go down together dont say that

if it only wasnt so goddam black part two the metal cools i it was purplish dusk outside the window the rain fell steadily making long flashing stripes on the cracked panes beating a hard monotonous tattoo on the tin roof overhead fuselli had taken off his wet slicker and stood in front of the window looking out dismally at the rain behind him was the smoking stove into which a man was poking wood and beyond that a few broken folding chairs on which soldiers sprawled in attitudes of utter boredom and the counter where the y man stood with a set smile doling out chocolate to a line of men that filed past gee you have to line up for everything here dont you fuselli muttered thats about all you do do in this hellhole buddy said a man beside him the man pointed with his thumb at the window and said again see that rain well i been in this camp three weeks and it aint stopped rainin once what dyer think of that fer a country it certainly aint like home said fuselli im going to have some chauclate its damn rotten i might as well try it once fuselli slouched over to the end of the line and stood waiting his turn he was thinking of the steep streets of san francisco and the glimpses he used to get of the harbor full of yellow lights the color of amber in a cigarette holder as he went home from work through the blue dusk he had begun to think of mabe handing him the fivepound box of candy when his attention was distracted by the talk of the men behind him the man next to him was speaking with hurried nervous intonation fuselli could feel his breath on the back of his neck ill be goddamned the man said was you there too where dyou get yours in the leg its about all right though i aint i wont never be all right the doctor says im all right now but i know im not the lyin fool some time wasnt it ill be damned to hell if i do it again i cant sleep at night thinkin of the shape of the fritzies helmets have you ever thought that there was somethin about the shape of them goddam helmets aint they just ornary shapes asked fuselli half turning round i seen em in the movies he laughed apologetically listen to the rookie tub hes seen em in the movies said the man with the nervous twitch in his voice laughing a croaking little laugh how long you been in this country buddy two days well we only been here two months aint we tub four months youre forgettin kid the y man turned his set smile on fuselli while he filled his tin cup up with chocolate how much a franc one of those looks like a quarter said the y man his wellfed voice full of amiable condescension thats a hell of a lot for a cup of chauclate said fuselli youre at the war young man remember that said the y man severely youre lucky to get it at all a cold chill gripped fusellis spine as he went back to the stove to drink the chocolate of course he mustnt crab he was in the war now if the sergeant had heard him crabbing it might have spoiled his chances for a corporalship he must be careful if he just watched out and kept on his toes hed be sure to get it and why aint there no more chocolate i want to know the nervous voice of the man who had stood in line behind fuselli rose to a sudden shriek everybody looked round the y man was moving his head from side to side in a flustered way saying in a shrill little voice ive told you theres no more go away you aint got no right to tell me to go away you got to get me some chocolate you aint never been at the front you goddam slacker the man was yelling at the top of his lungs he had hold of the counter with two hands and swayed from side to side his friend was trying to pull him away look here none of that ill report you said the y man is there a noncommissioned officer in the hut go ahead you cant do nothin i cant never have nothing done worse than whats been done to me already the mans voice had reached a singsong fury is there a noncommissioned officer in the room the y man kept looking from side to side his little eyes were hard and spiteful and his lips were drawn up in a thin straight line keep quiet ill get him away said the other man in a low voice cant you see hes not a strange terror took hold of fuselli he hadnt expected things to be like that when he had sat in the grandstand in the training camp and watched the jolly soldiers in khaki marching into towns pursuing terrified huns across potato fields saving belgian milkmaids against picturesque backgrounds does many of em come back that way he asked a man beside him some do its this convalescent camp the man and his friend stood side by side near the stove talking in low voices pull yourself together kid the friend was saying all right tub im all right now tub that slacker got my goat that was all fuselli was looking at him curiously he had a yellow parchment face and a high gaunt forehead going up to sparse curly brown hair his eyes had a glassy look about them when they met fusellis he smiled amiably oh theres the kid whos seen fritzies helmets in the movies come on buddy come and have a beer at the english canteen can you get beer sure over in the english camp they went out into the slanting rain it was nearly dark but the sky had a purplishred color that was reflected a little on the slanting sides of tents and on the roofs of the rows of sheds that disappeared into the rainy mist in every direction a few lights gleamed a very bright polished yellow they followed a boardwalk that splashed mud up from the puddles under the tramp of their heavy boots at one place they flattened themselves against the wet flap of a tent and saluted as an officer passed waving a little cane jauntily how long does a fellow usually stay in these rest camps asked fuselli depends on whats goin on out there said tub pointing carelessly to the sky beyond the peaks of the tents youll leave here soon enough dont you worry buddy said the man with the nervous voice what you in medical replacement unit a medic are you those boys didnt last long at the chateau did they tub no they didnt something inside fuselli was protesting ill last out though ill last out though do you remember the fellers went out to get poor ole corporal jones tub ill be goddamned if anybody ever found a button of their pants he laughed his creaky little laugh they got in the way of a torpedo the wet canteen was full of smoke and a cosy steam of beer it was crowded with redfaced men with shiny brass buttons on their khaki uniforms among whom was a good sprinkling of lanky americans tommies said fuselli to himself after standing in line a while fusellis cup was handed back to him across the counter foaming with beer hello fuselli meadville clapped him on the shoulder you found the liquor pretty damn quick looks like to me fuselli laughed may i sit with you fellers sure come along said fuselli proudly these guys have been to the front you have asked meadville the huns are pretty good scrappers they say tell me do you use your rifle much or is it mostly big gun work naw after all the months i spent learnin how to drill with my goddam rifle ill be a sucker if ive used it once im in the grenade squad someone at the end of the room had started singing o mademerselle from armenteers parley voo the man with the nervous voice went on talking while the song roared about them i dont spend a night without thinkin o them funny helmets the fritzies wear have you ever thought that there was something goddam funny about the shape o them helmets can the helmets kid said his friend you told us all about them onct i aint told you why i cant forgit em have i a german officer crossed the rhine parley voo a german officer crossed the rhine he loved the women and liked the wine hanky panky parley voo listen to this fellers said the man in his twitching nervous voice staring straight into fusellis eyes we made a little attack to straighten out our trenches a bit just before i got winged our barrage cut off a bit of fritzies trench an we ran right ahead juss about dawn an occupied it ill be goddamned if it wasnt as quiet as a sunday morning at home it was said his friend an i had a bunch of grenades an a feller came runnin up to me whisperin theres a bunch of fritzies playin cards in a dugout they dont seem to know theyre captured wed better take em prisners prisners hell says i well go and clear the buggars out so we crept along to the steps and looked down the song had started again o mademerselle from armenteers parley voo their helmets looked so damn like toadstools i came near laughin an they sat round the lamp layin down the cards seriouslike the way ive seen germans do in the rathskeller at home he loved the women and liked the wine parley voo i lay there lookin at em for a hell of a time an then i clicked a grenade an tossed it gently down the steps an all those funny helmets like toadstools popped up in the air an somebody gave a yell an the light went out an the damn grenade went off then i let em have the rest of em an went away cause one o em was still moaninlike it was about that time they let their barrage down on us and i got mine the yanks are havin a hell of a time parley voo an the first thing i thought of when i woke up was how those goddam helmets looked it upsets a feller to think of a thing like that his voice ended in a whine like the broken voice of a child that has been beaten you need to pull yourself together kid said his friend i know what i need tub i need a woman you know where you get one asked meadville id like to get me a nice little french girl a rainy night like this it must be a hell of a ways to the town they say its full of m ps too said fuselli i know a way said the man with the nervous voice come on tub no ive had enough of these goddam frog women they all left the canteen as the two men went off down the side of the building fuselli heard the nervous twitching voice through the metallic patter of the rain i cant find no way of forgettin how funny the helmets looked all round the lamp i cant find no way bill grey and fuselli pooled their blankets and slept together they lay on the hard floor of the tent very close to each other listening to the rain pattering endlessly on the drenched canvas that slanted above their heads hell bill im gettin pneumonia said fuselli clearing his nose thats the only thing that scares me in the whole goddam business id hate to die o sicknessan they say another kids kicked off with that what dthey call it menegitis was that what was the matter with stein the corporal wont say ole corp looks sort o sick himself said fuselli its this rotten climate whispered bill grey in the middle of a fit of coughing for cats sake quit that coughin let a feller sleep came a voice from the other side of the tent go an get a room in a hotel if you dont like it thats it bill tell him where to get off if you fellers dont quit yellin ill put the whole blame lot of you on k p came the sergeants goodnatured voice dont you know that taps has blown the tent was silent except for the fast patter of the rain and bill greys coughing that sergeant gives me a pain in the neck muttered bill grey peevishly when his coughing had stopped wriggling about under the blankets after a while fuselli said in a very low voice so that no one but his friend should hear say bill aint it different from what we thought it was going to be yare i mean fellers dont seem to think about beatin the huns at all theyre so busy crabbin on everything its the guys higher up that does the thinkin said grey grandiloquently hell but i thought itd be excitin like in the movies i guess that was a lot o talk maybe fuselli went to sleep on the hard floor feeling the comfortable warmth of greys body along the side of him hearing the endless monotonous patter of the rain on the drenched canvas above his head he tried to stay awake a minute to remember what mabe looked like but sleep closed down on him suddenly the bugle wrenched them out of their blankets before it was light it was not raining the air was raw and full of white mist that was cold as snow against their faces still warm from sleep the corporal called the roll lighting matches to read the list when he dismissed the formation the sergeants voice was heard from the tent where he still lay rolled in his blankets say corp go an tell fuselli to straighten out lieutenant stanfords room at eight sharp in officers barracks number four did you hear fuselli all right said fuselli his blood boiled up suddenly this was the first time hed had to do servants work he hadnt joined the army to be a slavey to any damned first loot it was against army regulations anyway hed go and kick he wasnt going to be a slavey he walked towards the door of the tent thinking what hed say to the sergeant but he noticed the corporal coughing into his handkerchief with an expression of pain on his face he turned and strolled away it would get him in wrong if he started kicking like that much better shut his mouth and put up with it the poor old corp couldnt last long at this rate no it wouldnt do to get in wrong at eight fuselli with a broom in his hand feeling dull fury pounding and fluttering within him knocked on the unpainted board door whos that to clean the room sir said fuselli come back in about twenty minutes came the voice of the lieutenant all right sir fuselli leaned against the back of the barracks and smoked a cigarette the air stung his hands as if they had been scraped by a nutmeggrater twenty minutes passed slowly despair seized hold of him he was so far from anyone who cared about him so lost in the vast machine he was telling himself that hed never get on would never get up where he could show what he was good for he felt as if he were in a treadmill day after day it would be like this the same routine the same helplessness he looked at his watch twentyfive minutes had passed he picked up his broom and moved round to the lieutenants room come in said the lieutenant carelessly he was in his shirtsleeves shaving a pleasant smell of shaving soap filled the dark clapboard room which had no furniture but three cots and some officers trunks he was a redfaced young man with flabby cheeks and dark straight eyebrows he had taken command of the company only a day or two before looks like a decent feller thought fuselli whats your name asked the lieutenant speaking into the small nickel mirror while he ran the safety razor obliquely across his throat he stuttered a little to fuselli he seemed to speak like an englishman fuselli italian parentage i presume yes said fuselli sullenly dragging one of the cots away from the wall parla italiano you mean do i speak eyetalian naw sir said fuselli emphatically i was born in frisco indeed but get me some more water will you please when fuselli came back he stood with his broom between his knees blowing on his hands that were blue and stiff from carrying the heavy bucket the lieutenant was dressed and was hooking the top hook of the uniform carefully the collar made a red mark on his pink throat all right when youre through report back to the company the lieutenant went out drawing on a pair of khakicolored gloves with a satisfied and important gesture fuselli walked back slowly to the tents where the company was quartered looking about him at the long lines of barracks gaunt and dripping in the mist at the big tin sheds of the cook shacks where the cooks and k ps in greasy blue denims were slouching about amid a steam of cooking food something of the gesture with which the lieutenant drew on his gloves caught in the mind of fuselli he had seen peoople make gestures like that in the movies stout dignified people in evening suits the president of the company that owned the optical goods store where he had worked at home in frisco had had something of that gesture about him and he pictured himself drawing on a pair of gloves that way importantly finger by finger with a little wave of selfsatisfaction when the gesture was completed hed have to get that corporalship theres a long long trail awinding through no mans land in france the company sang lustily as it splashed through the mud down a grey road between high fences covered with great tangles of barbed wire above which peeked the ends of warehouses and the chimneys of factories the lieutenant and the top sergeant walked side by side chatting now and then singing a little of the song in a deprecating way the corporal sang his eyes sparkling with delight even the sombre sergeant who rarely spoke to anyone sang the company strode along its ninetysix legs splashing jauntily through the deep puttycolored puddles the packs swayed merrily from side to side as if it were they and not the legs that were walking theres a long long trail awinding through no mans land in france at last they were going somewhere they had separated from the contingent they had come over with they were all alone now they were going to be put to work the lieutenant strode along importantly the sergeant strode along importantly the corporal strode along importantly the right guard strode along more importantly than anyone a sense of importance of something tremendous to do animated the company like wine made the packs and the belts seem less heavy made their necks and shoulders less stiff from struggling with the weight of the packs made the ninetysix legs tramp jauntily in spite of the oozy mud and the deep puttycolored puddles it was cold in the dark shed of the freight station where they waited some gas lamps flickered feebly high up among the rafters lighting up in a ghastly way white piles of ammunition boxes and ranks and ranks of shells that disappeared in the darkness the raw air was full of coal smoke and a smell of freshlycut boards the captain and the top sergeant had disappeared the men sat about huddled in groups sinking as far as they could into their overcoats stamping their numb wet feet on the mudcovered cement of the floor the sliding doors were shut through them came a monotonous sound of cars shunting of buffers bumping against buffers and now and then the shrill whistle of an engine hell the french railroads are rotten said someone how dyou know snapped eisenstein who sat on a box away from the rest with his lean face in his hands staring at his mudcovered boots look at this bill grey made a disgusted gesture towards the ceiling gas dont even have electric light their trains run faster than ours said eisenstein the hell they do why a fellow back in that rest camp told me that it took four or five days to get anywhere he was stuffing you said eisenstein they used to run the fastest trains in the world in france not so fast as the twentieth century goddam im a railroad man and i know i want five men to help me sort out the eats said the top sergeant coming suddenly out of the shadows fuselli grey eisenstein meadville williamsall right come along say sarge this guy says that frog trains are faster than our trains what dye think o that the sergeant put on his comic expression everybody got ready to laugh well if hed rather take the sidedoor pullmans were going to get aboard tonight than the sunset limited hes welcome ive seen em you fellers havent everybody laughed the top sergeant turned confidentially to the five men who followed him into a small welllighted room that looked like a freight office weve got to sort out the grub fellers see those cases thats three days rations for the outfit i want to sort it into three lots one for each car understand fuselli pulled open one of the boxes the cans of bully beef flew under his fingers he kept looking out of the corner of his eye at eisenstein who seemed very skilful in a careless way the top sergeant stood beaming at them with his legs wide apart once he said something in a low voice to the corporal fuselli thought he caught the words privates firstclass and his heart started thumping hard in a few minutes the job was done and everybody stood about lighting cigarettes well fellers said sergeant jones the sombre man who rarely spoke i certainly didnt reckon when i used to be teachin and preachin and tendin sunday school and the like that id come to be usin cuss words but i think we got a damn good company oh well have you sayin worse things than damn when we get you out on the front with a goddam german aeroplane droppin bombs on you said the top sergeant slapping him on the back now i want you five men to look out for the grub fusellis chest swelled the companyll be in charge of the corporal for the night sergeant jones and i have got to be with the lieutenant understand they all walked back to the dingy room where the rest of the company waited huddled in their coats trying to keep their importance from being too obvious in their step ive really started now thought fuselli to himself ive really started now the bare freight car clattered and rumbled monotonously over the rails a bitter cold wind blew up through the cracks in the grimy splintered boards of the floor the men huddled in the corners of the car curled up together like puppies in a box it was pitch black fuselli lay half asleep his head full of curious fragmentary dreams feeling through his sleep the aching cold and the unending clattering rumble of the wheels and the bodies and arms and legs muffled in coats and blankets pressing against him he woke up with a start his teeth were chattering the clanking rumble of wheels seemed to be in his head his head was being dragged along bumping over cold iron rails someone lighted a match the freight cars black swaying walls the packs piled in the center the bodies heaped in the corners where out of khaki masses here and there gleamed an occasional white face or a pair of eyes all showed clear for a moment and then vanished again in the utter blackness fuselli pillowed his head in the crook of someones arm and tried to go to sleep but the scraping rumble of wheels over rails was too loud he stayed with open eyes staring into the blackness trying to draw his body away from the blast of cold air that blew up through a crack in the floor when the first greyness began filtering into the car they all stood up and stamped and pounded each other and wrestled to get warm when it was nearly light the train stopped and they opened the sliding doors they were in a station a foreignlooking station where the walls were plastered with unfamiliar advertisements versailles fuselli spelt out the name versales said eisenstein thats where the kings of france used to live the train started moving again slowly on the platform stood the top sergeant how dye sleep he shouted as the car passed him say fuselli better start some grub going all right sarge said fuselli the sergeant ran back to the front of the car and climbed on with a delicious feeling of leadership fuselli divided up the bread and the cans of bully beef and the cheese then he sat on his pack eating dry bread and unsavoury beef whistling joyfully while the train rumbled and clattered along through a strange mistygreen countryside whistling joyfully because he was going to the front where there would be glory and excitement whistling joyfully because he felt he was getting along in the world it was noon a pallid little sun like a toy balloon hung low in the reddishgrey sky the train had stopped on a siding in the middle of a russet plain yellow poplars faint as mist rose slender against the sky along a black shining stream that swirled beside the track in the distance a steeple and a few red roofs were etched faintly in the greyness the men stood about balancing first on one foot and then on the other stamping to get warm on the other side of the river an old man with an oxcart had stopped and was looking sadly at the train say wheres the front somebody shouted to him everybody took up the cry say wheres the front the old man waved his hand shook his head and shouted to the oxen the oxen took up again their quiet processional gait and the old man walked ahead of them his eyes on the ground say aint the frogs dumb say dan said bill grey strolling away from a group of men he had been talking to these guys say we are going to the third army say fellers shouted fuselli they say were going to the third army wheres that in the oregon forest ventured somebody thats at the front aint it at that moment the lieutenant strode by a long khaki muffler was thrown carelessly round his neck and hung down his back look here men he said severely the orders are to stay in the cars the men slunk back into the cars sullenly a hospital train passed clanking slowly over the crosstracks fuselli looked fixedly at the dark enigmatic windows at the red crosses at the orderlies in white who leaned out of the doors waving their hands somebody noticed that there were scars on the new green paint of the last car the huns have been shooting at it dye hear that the huns tried to shoot up that hospital train fuselli remembered the pamphlet german atrocities he had read one night in the y m c a his mind became suddenly filled with pictures of children with their arms cut off of babies spitted on bayonets of women strapped on tables and violated by soldier after soldier he thought of mabe he wished he were in a combatant service he wanted to fight fight he pictured himself shooting dozens of men in green uniforms and he thought of mabe reading about it in the papers hed have to try to get into a combatant service no he couldnt stay in the medics the train had started again misty russet fields slipped by and dark clumps of trees that gyrated slowly waving branches of yellow and brown leaves and patches of black lacework against the reddishgrey sky fuselli was thinking of the good chance he had of getting to be corporal at night a dimlighted station platform the company waited in two lines each man sitting on his pack on the opposite platform crowds of little men in blue with mustaches and long soiled overcoats that reached almost to their feet were shouting and singing fuselli watched them with a faint disgust gee they got funny lookin helmets aint they theyre the best fighters in the world said eisenstein not that thats sayin much about a man say thats an m p said bill grey catching fusellis arm lets go ask him how near the front we are i thought i heard guns a minute ago did you i guess were in for it now said fuselli say buddy how near the front are we they spoke together excitedly the front said the m p who was a redfaced irishman with a crushed nose youre way back in the middle of france the m p spat disgustedly you fellers aint never goin to the front dont you worry hell said fuselli ill be goddamned if i dont get there somehow said bill grey squaring his jaw a fine rain was falling on the unprotected platform on the other side the little men in blue were singing a song fuselli could not understand drinking out of their ungainlylooking canteens fuselli announced the news to the company everybody clustered round him cursing but the faint sense of importance it gave him did not compensate for the feeling he had of being lost in the machine of being as helpless as a sheep in a flock hours passed they stamped about the platform in the fine rain or sat in a row on their packs waiting for orders a grey belt appeared behind the trees the platform began to take on a silvery gleam they sat in a row on their packs waiting ii the company stood at attention lined up outside of their barracks a long wooden shack covered with tar paper in front of them was a row of dishevelled plane trees with white trunks that looked like ivory in the faint ruddy sunlight then there was a rutted road on which stood a long line of french motor trucks with hunched grey backs like elephants beyond these were more plane trees and another row of barracks covered with tar paper outside of which other companies were lined up standing at attention a bugle was sounding far away the lieutenant stood at attention very stiffly fusellis eyes followed the curves of his brilliantlypolished puttees up to the braid on his sleeves parade rest shouted the lieutenant in a muffled voice feet and hands moved in unison fuselli was thinking of the town after retreat you could go down the irregular cobbled street from the old fairground where the camp was to a little square where there was a grey stone fountain and a ginmill where you could sit at an oak table and have beer and eggs and fried potatoes served you by a girl with red cheeks and plump white appetizing arms attention feet and hands moved in unison again they could hardly hear the bugle it was so faint men i have some appointments to announce said the lieutenant facing the company and taking on an easy conversational tone at rest youve done good work in the storehouse here men im glad i have such a willing bunch of men under me and i certainly hope that we can manage to make as many promotions as possible as many as possible fusellis hands were icy and his heart was pumping the blood so fast to his ears that he could hardly hear the following privates to private firstclass read the lieutenant in a routine voice grey appleton williams eisenstein portereisenstein will be company clerk fuselli was almost ready to cry his name was not on the list the sergeants voice came after a long pause smooth as velvet you forget fuselli sir oh so i did the lieutenant laughed a small dry laugh and fuselli gee i must write mabe tonight fuselli was saying to himself shell be a proud kid when she gets that letter companee dismissed shouted the sergeant genially o madermoiselle from armenteers parley voo o madermoiselle from armenteers struck up the sergeant in his mellow voice the front room of the cafe was full of soldiers their khaki hid the worn oak benches and the edges of the square tables and the red tiles of the floor they clustered round the tables where glasses and bottles gleamed vaguely through the tobacco smoke they stood in front of the bar drinking out of bottles laughing scraping their feet on the floor a stout girl with red cheeks and plump white arms moved contentedly among them carrying away empty bottles bringing back full ones taking the money to a grim old woman with a grey face and eyes like bits of jet who stared carefully at each coin fingered it with her grey hands and dropped it reluctantly into the cash drawer in the corner sat sergeant olster with a flush on his face and the corporal who had been on the red sox outfield and another sergeant a big man with black hair and a black mustache about them clustered with approbation and respect in their faces fuselli bill grey and meadville the cowboy and earl williams the blueeyed and yellowhaired drugclerk o the yanks are having the hell of a time parley voo they pounded their bottles on the table in time to the song its a good job the top sergeant said suddenly interrupting the song you neednt worry about that fellers i saw to it that we got a good job and about getting to the front you neednt worry about that well all get to the front soon enough tell me this war is going to last ten years i guess well all be generals by that time eh sarge said williams but man i wish i was back jerkin soda water its a great life if you dont weaken murmured fuselli automatically but im beginnin to weaken said williams man im homesick i dont care who knows it i wish i could get to the front and be done with it say have a heart you need a drink said the top sergeant banging his fist on the table say mamselle mame shows mame shows i didnt know you could talk french sarge said fuselli french hell said the top sergeant williams is the boy can talk french voulay vous couchay aveck moy thats all i know everybody laughed hey mamzelle cried the top sergeant voulay vous couchay aveck moy we we champagne everybody laughed uproariously the girl slapped his head goodnaturedly at that moment a man stamped noisily into the cafe a tall broadshouldered man in a loose english tunic who had a swinging swagger that made the glasses ring on all the tables he was humming under his breath and there was a grin on his broad red face he went up to the girl and pretended to kiss her and she laughed and talked familiarly with him in french theres wild dan cohan said the darkhaired sergeant say dan dan here yer honor come over and have a drink were going to have some fizzy never known to refuse they made room for him on the bench well im confined to barracks said dan cohan look at me he laughed and gave his head a curious swift jerk to one side compree aint ye scared theyll nab you said fuselli nab me hell they cant do nothin to me ive had three courtmartials already and theyre gettin a fourth up on me dan cohan pushed his head to one side and laughed i got a friend my old boss is captain and hes goin to fix it up i used to alley around politics chez moy compree the champagne came and dan cohan popped the cork up to the ceiling with dexterous red fingers i was just wondering

knitting and marie of the plump white arms sat beside her leaning her head back among the bottles that rose in tiers behind the bars fuselli was staring at a door on one side of the bar men kept opening it and looking in and closing it again with a peculiar expression on their faces now and then someone would open it with a smile and go into the next room shuffling his feet and closing the door carefully behind him say i wonder what theyve got there said the top sergeant who had been staring at the door mush be looked into mush be looked into he added laughing drunkenly i dunno said fuselli the champagne was humming in his head like a fly against a window pane he felt very bold and important the top sergeant got to his feet unsteadily corporal take charge of the colors he said and walked to the door he opened it a little peeked in winked elaborately to his friends and skipped into the other room closing the door carefully behind him the corporal went over next he said well ill be damned and walked straight in leaving the door ajar in a moment it was closed from the inside come on bill lets see what the hell they got in there said fuselli all right old kid said bill grey they went together over to the door fuselli opened it and looked in he let out a breath through his teeth with a faint whistling sound gee come in bill he said giggling the room was small nearly filled up by a dining table with a red cloth on the mantel above the empty fireplace were candlesticks with dangling crystals that glittered red and yellow and purple in the lamplight in front of a cracked mirror that seemed a window into another dingier room the paper was peeling off the damp walls giving a mortuary smell of mildewed plaster that not even the reek of beer and tobacco had done away with look at her bill aint she got style whispered fuselli bill grey grunted say dye think the jane that feller was tellin us he raised hell with in paris was like that at the end of the table leaning on her elbows was a woman with black frizzy hair cut short that stuck out from her head in all directions her eyes were dark and her lips red with a faint swollen look she looked with a certain defiance at the men who stood about the walls and sat at the table the men stared at her silently a big man with red hair and a heavy jaw who sat next her kept edging up nearer someone knocked against the table making the bottles and liqueur glasses clustered in the center jingle she aint clean shes got bobbed hair said the man next fuselli the woman said something in french only one man understood it his laugh rang hollowly in the silent room and stopped suddenly the woman looked attentively at the faces round her for a moment shrugged her shoulders and began straightening the ribbon on the hat she held on her lap how the hell did she get here i thought the m ps ran them out of town the minute they got here said one man the woman continued plucking at her hat you venay paris said a boy with a soft voice who sat near her he had blue eyes and a milky complexion faintly tanned that went strangely with the rough red and brown faces in the room oui de paris she said after a pause glancing suddenly in the boys face shes a liar i can tell you that said the redhaired man who by this time had moved his chair very close to the womans you told him you came from marseilles and him you came from lyon said the boy with the milky complexion smiling genially vraiment de ou venay vous i come from everywhere she said and tossed the hair back from her face travelled a lot asked the boy again a feller told me said fuselli to bill grey that hed talked to a girl like that whod been to turkey an egypt i bet that girls seen some life the woman jumped to her feet suddenly screaming with rage the man with the red hair moved away sheepishly then he lifted his large dirty hands in the air kamarad he said nobody laughed the room was silent except for feet scraping occasionally on the floor she put her hat on and took a little box from the chain bag in her lap and began powdering her face making faces into the mirror she held in the palm of her hand the men stared at her guess she thinks shes the queen of the may said one man getting to his feet he leaned across the table and spat into the fireplace im going back to barracks he turned to the woman and shouted in a voice full of hatred bon swar the woman was putting the powder puff away in her jet bag she did not look up the door closed sharply come along said the woman suddenly tossing her head back come along one at a time who go with me first nobody spoke the men stared at her silently there was no sound except that of feet scraping occasionally on the floor iii the oatmeal flopped heavily into the messkit fusellis eyes were still glued together with sleep he sat at the dark greasy bench and took a gulp of the scalding coffee that smelt vaguely of dish rags that woke him up a little there was little talk in the mess shack the men that the bugle had wrenched out of their blankets but fifteen minutes before sat in rows eating sullenly or blinking at each other through the misty darkness you could hear feet scraping in the ashes of the floor and mess kits clattering against the tables and here and there a man coughing near the counter where the food was served out one of the cooks swore interminably in a whiny singsing voice gee bill ive got a head said fuselli yere ought to have growled bill grey i had to carry you up into the barracks you said you were goin back and love up that goddam girl did i said fuselli giggling i had a hell of a time getting you past the guard some cognac i got a hangover now said fuselli im goddamned if i can go this much longer what they were washing their messkits in the tub of warm water thick with grease from the hundred messkits that had gone before in front of the shack an electric light illumined faintly the wet trunk of a plane tree and the surface of the water where bits of oatmeal floated and coffee grounds and the garbage pails with their painted signs wet garbage dry garbage and the line of men who stood waiting to reach the tub this hell of a life said bill grey savagely what dye mean doin nothin but pack bandages in packin cases and take bandages out of packin cases ill go crazy ive tried gettin drunk it dont do no good gee ive got a head said fuselli bill grey put his heavy muscular hand round fusellis shoulder as they strolled towards the barracks say dan im goin a w o l dont ye do it bill hell look at the chance weve got to get ahead we can both of us get promoted if we dont get in wrong i dont give a hoot in hell for all that what dye think i got in this goddamed army for because i thought id look nice in the uniform bill grey thrust his hands into his pockets and spat dismally in front of him but bill you dont want to stay a buck private do you i want to get to the front i dont want to stay here till i get in the jug for being spiffed or get a courtmartial say dan will you come with me hell bill you aint goin youre just kiddin aint yer theyll send us there soon enough i want to get to be a corporal he puffed out his chest a little before i go to the front sos to be able to show what im good for see bill a bugle blew theres fatigue an i aint done my bunk me neither they wont do nothin dan dont let them ride yer dan they lined up in the dark road feeling the mud slopping under their feet the ruts were full of black water in which gleamed a reflection of distant electric lights all you fellows work in storehouse a today said the sergeant who had been a preacher in his sad drawling voice lieutenant says thats all got to be finished by noon theyre sending it to the front today somebody let his breath out in a whistle of surprise who did that nobody answered dismissed snapped the sergeant disgustedly they straggled off into the darkness towards one of the lights their feet splashing confusedly in the puddles fuselli strolled up to the sentry at the camp gate he was picking his teeth meditatively with the splinter of a pine board say phil you couldnt lend me a half a dollar could you fuselli stopped put his hands in his pockets and looked at the sentry with the splinter sticking out of a corner of his mouth sorry dan said the other man im cleaned out aint had a cent since new years why the hell dont they pay us you guys signed the pay roll yet sure so long fuselli strolled on down the dark road where the mud was frozen into deep ruts towards the town it was still strange to him this town of little houses faced with cracked stucco where the damp made grey stains and green stains of confused redtiled roofs and of narrow cobbled streets that zigzagged in and out among high walls overhung with balconies at night when it was dark except for where a lamp in a window spilt gold reflections out on the wet street or the light streamed out from a store or a cafe it was almost frighteningly unreal he walked down into the main square where he could hear the fountain gurgling in the middle he stopped indecisively his coat unbuttoned his hands pushed to the bottom of his trousers pockets where they encountered nothing but the cloth he listened a long time to the gurgling of the fountain and to the shunting of trains far away in the freight yards an this is the war he thought aint it queer its quieter than it was at home nights down the street at the end of the square a band of white light appeared the searchlight of a staff car the two eyes of the car stared straight into his eyes dazzling him then veered off to one side and whizzed past leaving a faint smell of gasoline and a sound of voices fuselli watched the fronts of houses light up as the car made its way to the main road then the town was dark and silent again he strolled across the square towards the cheval blanc the large cafe where the officers went button yer coat came a gruff voice he saw a stiff tall figure at the edge of the curve he made out the shape of the pistol holster that hung like a thin ham at the mans thigh an m p he buttoned his coat hurriedly and walked off with rapid steps he stopped outside a cafe that had ham and eggs written in white paint on the window and looked in wistfully someone from behind him put two big hands over his eyes he wriggled his head free hello dan he said how did you get out of the jug im a trusty kid said dan cohan got any dough not a damn cent me neither come on in anyway said cohan ill fix it up with marie fuselli followed doubtfully he was a little afraid of dan cohan he remembered how a man had been courtmartialed last week for trying to bolt out of a cafe without paying for his drinks he sat down at a table near the door dan had disappeared into the back room fuselli felt homesick he was thinking how long it was since he had had a letter from mabe i bet shes got another feller he told himself savagely he tried to remember how she looked but he had to take out his watch and peep in the back before he could make out if her nose were straight or snub he looked up clicking the watch in his pocket marie of the white arms was coming laughing out of the inner room her large firm breasts neatly held in by the closefitting blouse shook a little when she laughed her cheeks were very red and a strand of chestnut hair hung down along her neck she picked it up hurriedly and caught it up with a hairpin walking slowly into the middle of the room as she did so with her hands behind her head dan cohan followed her into the room a broad grin on his face all right kid he said i told her yould pay when uncle sam came across ever had any kummel what the hells that youll see they sat down before a dish of fried eggs at the table in the corner the favoured table where marie herself often sat and chatted when wizened madame did not have her eye upon her several men drew up their chairs wild dan cohan always had an audience looks like there was going to be another offensive at verdun said dan cohan someone answered vaguely funny how little we know about whats going on out there said one man i knew more about the war when i was home in minneapolis than i do here i guess were lightin into em all right said fuselli in a patriotic voice hell nothin doin this time o year anyway said cohan a grin spread across his red face last time i was at the front the boche had just made a coup de main and captured a whole trenchful of who of americans of us the hell you say thats a goddam lie shouted a blackhaired man with an illshaven jaw who had just come in there aint never been an american captured an there never will be by god how long were you at the front buddy asked cohan coolly i guess you been to berlin already aint yer i say that any man who says an americanld let himself be captured by a stinkin hun is a goddam liar said the man with the illshaven jaw sitting down sullenly well youd better not say it to me said cohan laughing looking meditatively at one of his big red fists there had been a look of apprehension on maries face she looked at cohans fist and shrugged her shoulders and laughed another crowd had just slouched into the cafe well if that isnt wild dan hello old kid how are you hello dook a small man in a coat that looked almost like an officers coat it was so well cut was shaking hands effusively with cohan he wore a corporals stripes and a british aviators fatigue cap cohan made room for him on the bench what are you doing in this hole dook the man twisted his mouth so that his neat black mustache was a slant g o he said battle of paris said cohan in a sympathetic voice battle of nice im going back to my section soon id never have got a courtmartial if id been with my outfit i was in the base hospital with pneumonia tough luck it was a hell of a note say dook your outfit was working with ours at chamfort that time wasnt it you mean when we evacuated the nut hospital yes wasnt that hell dan cohan gulped down half a glass of red wine smacked his thick lips and began in his storytelling voice our section had just come out of verdun where wed been getting hell for three weeks on the bras road there was one little hill where wed have to get out and shove every damn time the mud was so deep and god it stank there with the shells turning up the ground all full of mackabbies as the poilus call them say dook have you got any money ive got some said dook without enthusiasm well the champagnes damn good here im part of the outfit in this gin mill theyll give it to you at a reduction all right dan cohan turned round and whispered something to marie she laughed and dived down behind the curtain but that chamfort was worse yet everybody was sort o nervous because the germans had dropped a message sayin theyd give em three days to clear the hospital out and that then theyd shell hell out of the place the germans done that quit yer kiddin said fuselli they did it at souilly too said dook hell yes a funny thing happened there the hospital was in a big rambling house looked like an atlantic city hotel we used to run our car in back and sleep in it it was where we took the shellshock cases fellows who were roarin mad and tremblin all over and some of em paralysed like there was a man in the wing opposite where we slept who kept laughin bill rees was on the car with me and we laid in our blankets in the bottom of the car and every now and then one of usld turn over and whisper aint this hell kid cause that feller kept laughin like a man who had just heard a joke that was so funny he couldnt stop laughin it wasnt like a crazy mans laugh usually is when i first heard it i thought it was a man really laughin and i guess i laughed too but it didnt stop bill rees an me laid in our car shiverin listenin to the barrage in the distance with now and then the big noise of an aeroplane bomb an that feller laughin laughin like hed just heard a joke like something had struck him funny cohan took a gulp of champagne and jerked his head to one side an that damn laughin kept up until about noon the next day when the orderlies strangled the feller got their goat i guess fuselli was looking towards the other side of the room where a faint murmur of righteous indignation was rising from the dark man with the unshaven jaw and his companions fuselli was thinking that it wasnt good to be seen round too much with a fellow like cohan who talked about the germans notifying hospitals before they bombarded them and who was waiting for a courtmartial might get him in wrong he slipped out of the cafe into the dark a dank wind blew down the irregular street ruffling the reflected light in the puddles making a shutter bang interminably somewhere fuselli went to the main square again casting an envious glance in the window of the cheval blanc where he saw officers playing billiards in a welllighted room painted white and gold and a blond girl in a raspberrycolored shirtwaist enthroned haughtily behind the bar he remembered the m p and automatically hastened his steps in a narrow street the other side of the square he stopped before the window of a small grocery shop and peered inside keeping carefully out of the oblong of light that showed faintly the grassgrown cobbles and the green and grey walls opposite a girl sat knitting beside the small counter with her two little black feet placed demurely side by side on the edge of a box full of red beets she was very small and slender the lamplight gleamed on her black hair done close to her head her face was in the shadow several soldiers lounged awkwardly against the counter and the jambs of the door following her movements with their eyes as dogs watch a plate of meat being moved about in a kitchen after a little the girl rolled up her knitting and jumped to her feet showing her face an oval white face with large dark lashes and an impertinent mouth she stood looking at the soldiers who stood about her in a circle then twisted up her mouth in a grimace and disappeared into the inner room fuselli walked to the end of the street where there was a bridge over a small stream he leaned on the cold stone rail and looked into the water that was barely visible gurgling beneath between rims of ice o this is a hell of a life he muttered he shivered in the cold wind but remained leaning over the water in the distance trains rumbled interminably giving him a sense of vast desolate distances the village clock struck eight the bell had a soft note like the bass string of a guitar in the darkness fuselli could almost see the girls face grimacing with its broad impertinent lips he thought of the sombre barracks and men sitting about on the end of their cots hell he couldnt go back yet his whole body was taut with desire for warmth and softness and quiet he slouched back along the narrow street cursing in a dismal monotone before the grocery store he stopped the men had gone he went in jauntily pushing his cap a little to one side so that some of his thick curly hair came out over his forehead the little bell in the door clanged the girl came out of the inner room she gave him her hand indifferently comment ca va yvonne bon his pidginfrench made her show her little pearly teeth in a smile good she said in english they laughed childishly say will you be my girl yvonne she looked in his eyes and laughed non compris she said we we voulez vous et ma fille she shrieked with laughter and slapped him hard on the cheek venez she said still laughing he followed her in the inner room was a large oak table with chairs round it at the end eisenstein and a french soldier were talking excitedly so absorbed in what they were saying that they did not notice the other two yvonne took the frenchman by the hair and pulled his head back and told him still laughing what fuselli had said he laughed no you must not say that he said in english turning to fuselli fuselli was angry and sat down sullenly at the end of the table keeping his eyes on yvonne she drew the knitting out of the pocket of her apron and holding it up comically between two fingers glanced towards the dark corner of the room where an old woman with a lace cap on her head sat asleep and then let herself fall into a chair boom she said fuselli laughed until the tears filled his eyes she laughed too they sat a long while looking at each other and giggling while eisenstein and the frenchman talked suddenly fuselli caught a phrase that startled him what would you americans do if revolution broke out in france wed do what we were ordered to said eisenstein bitterly were a bunch of slaves fuselli noticed that eisensteins puffy sallow face was flushed and that there was a flash in his eyes he had never seen before how do you mean revolution asked fuselli in a puzzled voice the frenchman turned black eyes searchingly upon him i mean stop the butchery overthrow the capitalist government the social revolution but youre a republic already aint yer as much as you are you talk like a socialist said fuselli they tell me they shoot guys in america for talkin like that you see said eisenstein to the frenchman are they all like that except a very few its hopeless said eisenstein burying his face in his hands i often think of shooting myself better shoot someone else said the frenchman it will be more useful fuselli stirred uneasily in his chair whered you fellers get that stuff anyway he asked in his mind he was saying a kike and a frog thats a good combination his eye caught yvonnes and they both laughed yvonne threw her knitting ball at him it rolled down under the table and they both scrambled about under the chairs looking for it twice i have thought it was going to happen said the frenchman when was that a little while ago a division started marching on paris and when i was in verdun o there will be a revolution france is the country of revolutions well always be here to shoot you down said eisenstein wait till youve been in the war a little while a winter in the trenches will make any army ready for revolution but we have no way of learning the truth and in the tyranny of the army a man becomes a brute a piece of machinery remember you are freer than we are we are worse than the russians it is curious o but you must have some feeling of civilization i have always heard that americans were free and independent will they let themselves be driven to the slaughter always o i dont know eisenstein got to his feet wed better be getting to barracks coming fuselli he said guess so said fuselli indifferently without getting up eisenstein and the frenchman went out into the shop bon swar said fuselli softly leaning across the table hey girlie he threw himself on his belly on the wide table and put his arms round her neck and kissed her feeling everything go blank in a flame of desire she pushed him away calmly with strong little arms stop she said and jerked her head in the direction of the old woman in the chair in the dark corner of the room they stood side by side listening to her faint wheezy snoring he put his arms round her and kissed her long on the mouth demain he said she nodded her head fuselli walked fast up the dark street towards the camp the blood pounded happily through his veins he caught up with eisenstein say eisenstein he said in a comradely voice i dont think you ought to go talking round like that youll get yourself in too deep one of these days i dont care but hell man you dont want to get in the wrong that bad they shoot fellers for less than you said let them christ man you dont want to be a damn fool expostulated fuselli how old are you fuselli im twenty now im thirty ive lived more kid i know whats good and whats bad this butchery makes me unhappy god i know its a hell of a note but who brought it on if somebody had shot that kaiser eisenstein laughed bitterly at the entrance of camp fuselli lingered a moment watching the small form of eisenstein disappear with its curious waddly walk into the darkness im going to be damn careful who im seen goin into barracks with he said to himself that damn kike may be a german spy or a secretservice officer a cold chill of terror went over him shattering his mood of joyous selfsatisfaction his feet slopped in the puddles breaking through the thin ice as he walked up the road towards the barracks he felt as if people were watching him from everywhere out of the darkness as if some gigantic figure were driving him forward through the darkness holding a fist over his head ready to crush him when he was rolled up in his blankets in the bunk next to bill grey he whispered to his friend say bill i think ive got a skirt all fixed up in town who yvonne dont tell anybody bill grey whistled softly youre some highflyer dan fuselli chuckled hell man the best aint good enough for me well im going to leave you said bill grey when damn soon i cant go this life i dont see how you can fuselli did not answer he snuggled warmly into his blankets thinking of yvonne and the corporalship in the light of the one flickering lamp that made an unsteady circle of reddish glow on the station platform fuselli looked at his pass from reveille on february fourth to reveille on february fifth he was a free man his eyes smarted with sleep as he walked up and down the cold station platform for twentyfour hours he wouldnt have to obey anybodys orders despite the loneliness of going away on a train in a night like this in a strange country fuselli was happy he clinked the money in his pocket down the track a red eye appeared and grew nearer he could hear the hard puffing of the engine up the grade huge curves gleamed as the engine roared slowly past him a man with bare arms black with coal dust was leaning out of the cab lit up from behind by a yellowish red glare now the cars were going by flat cars with guns tilted up like the muzzles of hunting dogs freight cars out of which here and there peered a mans head the train almost came to a stop the cars clanged one against the other all down the train fuselli was looking into a pair of eyes that shone in the lamplight a hand was held out to him so long kid said a boyish voice i dont know who the hell you are but so long good luck so long stammered fuselli going to the front yer goddam right answered another voice the train took up speed again the clanging of car against car ceased and in a moment they were moving fast before fusellis eyes then the station was dark and empty again and he was watching the red light grow smaller and paler while the train rumbled on into the darkness a confusion of gold and green and crimson silks and intricate designs of naked pinkfleshed cupids filled fusellis mind when full of wonder he walked down the steps of the palace out into the faint ruddy sunlight of the afternoon a few names napoleon josephine the empire that had never had significance in his mind before flared with a lurid gorgeous light in his imagination like a tableau of living statues at a vaudeville theatre they must have had a heap of money them guys said the man who was with him a private in aviation lets go have a drink fuselli was silent and absorbed in his thoughts here was something that supplemented his visions of wealth and glory that he used to tell al about when theyd sit and watch the big liners come in all glittering with lights through the golden gate they didnt mind having naked women about did they said the private in aviation a morose foulmouthed little man who had been in the woolen business dye blame them no i cant says i do i bet they was immoral them guys he continued vaguely they wandered about the streets of fontainebleau listlessly looking into shop windows staring at women lolling on benches in the parks where the faint sunlight came through a lacework of twigs purple and crimson and yellow that cast intricate lavendergrey shadows on the asphalt lets go have another drink said the private in aviation fuselli looked at his watch they had hours before train time a girl in a loose dirty blouse wiped off the table vin blank said the other man mame shows said fuselli his head was full of gold and green mouldings and silk and crimson velvet and intricate designs in which naked pinkfleshed cupids writhed indecently some day he was saying to himself hed make a hell of a lot of money and live in a house like that with mabe no with yvonne or with some other girl must have been immoral them guys said the private in aviation leering at the girl in the dirty blouse fuselli remembered a revel hed seen in a moving picture of quo vadis people in bath robes dancing around with large cups in their hands and tables full of dishes being upset cognac beaucoup said the private in aviation mame shows said fuselli the cafe was full of gold and green silks and great brocaded beds with heavy carvings above them beds in which writhed pinkfleshed and indecent intricate patterns of cupids somebody said hello fuselli he was on the train his ears hummed and his head had an iron band round it it was dark except for the little light that flickered in the ceiling for a minute he thought it was a goldfish in a bowl but it was a light that flickered in the ceiling hello fuselli said eisenstein feel all right sure said fuselli with a thick voice why shouldnt i how did you find that house said eisenstein seriously hell i dont know muttered fuselli im goin to sleep his mind was a jumble he remembered vast halls full of green and gold silks and great beds with crowns over them where napoleon and josephine used to sleep who were they o yes the empire or was it the abdication then there were patterns of flowers and fruits and cupids all gilded and a dark passage and stairs that smelt musty where he and the man in aviation fell down he remembered how it felt to rub his nose hard on the gritty red plush carpet of the stairs then there were women in openwork skirts standing about or were those the pictures on the walls and there was a bed with mirrors round it he opened his eyes eisenstein was talking to him he must have been talking to him for some time i look at it this way he was saying a feller needs a little of that to keep healthy now if hes abstemious and careful fuselli went to sleep he woke up again thinking suddenly he must borrow that little blue book of army regulations it would be useful to know that in case something came up the corporal who had been in the red sox outfield had been transferred to a base hospital it was t b so sergeant osier said anyway they were going to appoint an acting corporal he stared at the flickering little light in the ceiling how did you get a pass eisenstein was asking oh the sergeant fixed me up with one answered fuselli mysteriously youre in pretty good with the sergeant aint yer said eisenstein fuselli smiled deprecatingly say dye know that little kid stockton the whitefaced little kid whos clerk in that outfit that has the other end of the barracks thats him said eisenstein i wish i could do something to help that kid he just cant stand the discipline you ought to see him wince when the redhaired sergeant over there yells at him the kid looks sicker every day well hes got a good soft job clerk said fuselli ye think its soft i worked twelve hours day before yesterday getting out reports said eisenstein indignantly but the kids lost it and they keep ridin him for some reason or other it hurts a feller to see that he ought to be at home at school hes got to take his medicine said fuselli you wait till we get butchered in the trenches well see how you like your medicine said eisenstein damn fool muttered fuselli composing himself to sleep again the bugle wrenched fuselli out of his blankets half dead with sleep say bill i got a head again he muttered there was no answer it was only then that he noticed that the cot next to his was empty the blankets were folded neatly at the foot sudden panic seized him he couldnt get along without bill grey he said to himself he wouldnt have anyone to go round with he looked fixedly at the empty cot attention the company was lined up in the dark with their feet in the mud puddles of the road the lieutenant strode up and down in front of them with the tail of his trench coat sticking out behind he had a pocket flashlight that he kept flashing at the gaunt trunks of trees in the faces of the company at his feet in the puddles of the road if any man knows anything about the whereabouts of private stclass william grey report at once as otherwise we shall have to put him down a w o l you know what that means the lieutenant spoke in short shrill periods chopping off the ends of his words as if with a hatchet no one said anything i guess hes s o l this from someone behind fuselli and i have one more announcement to make men said the lieutenant in his natural voice im going to appoint fuselli stclass private acting corporal fusellis knees were weak under him he felt like shouting and dancing with joy he was glad it was dark so that no one could see how excited he was sergeant dismiss the company said the lieutenant bringing his voice back to its military tone companee dismissed said out the sergeant jovially in groups talking with crisp voices cheered by the occurrence of events the company straggled across the great stretch of mud puddles towards the mess shack iv yvonne tossed the omelette in the air it landed sizzling in the pan again and she came forward into the light holding the frying pan before her behind her was the dark stove and above it a row of copper kettles that gleamed through the bluish obscurity she flicked the omelette out of the pan into the white dish that stood in the middle of the table full in the yellow lamplight tiens she said brushing a few stray hairs off her forehead with the back of her hand youre some cook said fuselli getting to his feet he had been sprawling on a chair in the other end of the kitchen watching yvonnes slender body in tight black dress and blue apron move in and out of the area of light as she got dinner ready a smell of burnt butter with a faint tang of pepper in it filled the kitchen making his mouth water this is the real stuff he was saying to himself like home he stood with his hands deep in his pockets and his head thrown back watching her cut the bread holding the big loaf to her chest and pulling the knife towards her she brushed some crumbs off her dress with a thin white hand youre my girl yvonne aint yer fuselli put his arms round her sale bete she said laughing and pushing him away there was a brisk step outside and another girl came into the kitchen a thin yellowfaced girl with a sharp nose and long teeth ma cousine mon tit americain they both laughed fuselli blushed as he shook the girls hand il est beau hein said yvonne gruffly mais ma petite il est charmant vot americain they laughed again fuselli who did not understand laughed too thinking to himself theyll let the dinner get cold if they dont sit down soon get maman dan said yvonne fuselli went into the shop through the room with the long oak table in the dim light that came from the kitchen he saw the old womans white bonnet her face was in shadow but there was a faint gleam of light in her small beady eyes supper maam he shouted grumbling in her creaky little voice the old woman followed him back into the kitchen steam gilded by the lamplight rose in pillars to the ceiling from the big tureen of soup there was a white cloth on the table and a big loaf of bread at the end the plates with borders of little roses on them seemed after the army mess the most beautiful things fuselli had ever seen the wine bottle was black beside the soup tureen and the wine in the glasses cast a dark purple stain on the cloth fuselli ate his soup silently understanding very little of the french that the two girls rattled at each other the old woman rarely spoke and when she did one of the girls would throw her a hasty remark that hardly interrupted their chatter fuselli was thinking of the other men lining up outside the dark mess shack and the sound the food made when it flopped into the mess kits an idea came to him hed have to bring sarge to see yvonne they could set him up to a feed it would help me to stay in good with him he had a minutes worry about his corporalship he was acting corporal right enough but he wanted them to send in his appointment the omelette melted in his mouth damn bon he said to yvonne with his mouth full she looked at him fixedly bon bon he said again you dan bon she said and laughed the cousin was looking from one to the other enviously her upper lip lifted away from her teeth in a smile the old woman munched her bread in a silent preoccupied fashion theres somebody in the store said fuselli after a long pause je irey he put his napkin down and went out wiping his mouth on the back of his hand eisenstein and a chalkyfaced boy were in the shop hullo are you keepin house here asked eisenstein sure said fuselli conceitedly have you got any chawclit asked the chalkyfaced boy in a thin bloodless voice fuselli looked round the shelves and threw a cake of chocolate down on the counter anything else nothing thank you corporal how much is it whistling theres a long long trail awinding fuselli strode back into the inner room combien chocolate he asked when he had received the money he sat down at his place at table again smiling importantly he must write al about all this he was thinking and he was wondering vaguely whether al had been drafted yet after dinner the women sat a long time chatting over their coffee while fuselli squirmed uneasily on his chair looking now and then at his watch his pass was till twelve only it was already getting on to ten he tried to catch yvonnes eye but she was moving about the kitchen putting things in order for the night and hardly seemed to notice him at last the old woman shuffled into the shop and there was the sound of a key clicking hard in the outside door when she came back fuselli said goodnight to everyone and left by the back door into the court there he leaned sulkily against the wall and waited in the dark listening to the sounds that came from the house he could see shadows passing across the orange square of light the window threw on the cobbles of the court a light went on in an upper window sending a faint glow over the disorderly tiles of the roof of the shed opposite the door opened and yvonne and her cousin stood on the broad stone doorstep chattering fuselli had pushed himself in behind a big hogshead that had a pleasant tang of old wood damp with sour wine at last the heads of the shadows on the cobbles came together for a moment and the cousin clattered across the court and out into the empty streets her rapid footsteps died away yvonnes shadow was still in the door dan she said softly fuselli came out from behind the hogshead his whole body flushing with delight yvonne pointed to his shoes he took them off and left them beside the door he looked at his watch it was a quarter to eleven viens she said he followed her his knees trembling a little from excitement up the steep stairs the deep broken strokes of the town clock had just begun to strike midnight when fuselli hurried in the camp gate he gave up his pass jauntily to the guard and strolled towards his barracks the long shed was pitch black full of a sound of deep breathing and of occasional snoring there was a thick smell of uniform wool on which the sweat had dried fuselli undressed without haste stretching his arms luxuriously he wriggled into his blankets feeling cool and tired and went to sleep with a smile of selfsatisfaction on his lips the companies were lined up for retreat standing stiff as toy soldiers outside their barracks the evening was almost warm a little playful wind oozing with springtime played with the swollen buds on the plane trees the sky was a drowsy violet color and the blood pumped hot and stinging through the stiffened arms and legs of the soldiers who stood at attention the voices of the noncoms were particularly harsh and metallic this evening it was rumoured that a general was about orders were shouted with fury standing behind the line of his company fusellis chest was stuck out until the buttons of his tunic were in danger of snapping off his shoes were wellshined and he wore a new pair of puttees wound so tightly that his legs ached at last the bugle sounded across the silent camp parade rest shouted the lieutenant fusellis mind was full of the army regulations which he had been studying assiduously for the last week he was thinking of an imaginary examination for the corporalship which he would pass of course when the company was dismissed he went up familiarly to the top sergeant say sarge doin anything this evenin what the hell can a man do when hes broke said the top sergeant well you come down town with me i want to introjuce you to somebody great say sarge have they sent that appointment in yet no they havent fuselli said the top sergeant its all made out he added encouragingly they walked towards the town silently the evening was silveryviolet the few windows in the old greygreen houses that were lighted shone orange well im goin to get it aint i a staff car shot by splashing them with mud leaving them a glimpse of officers leaning back in the deep cushions you sure are said the top sergeant in his goodnatured voice they had reached the square they saluted stiffly as two officers brushed past them whats the regulations about a feller marryin a french girl broke out fuselli suddenly thinking of getting hitched up are you hell no fuselli was crimson i just sort o wanted to know permission of c o thats all i know of they had stopped in front of the grocery shop fuselli peered in through the window the shop was full of soldiers lounging against the counter and the walls in the midst of them demurely knitting sat yvonne lets go and have a drink an then come back said fuselli they went to the cafe where marie of the white arms presided fuselli paid for two hot rum punches you see its this way sarge he said confidentially i wrote all my folks at home id been made corporal an itld be a hell of a note to be let down now the top sergeant was drinking his hot drink in little sips he smiled broadly and put his hand paternalfashion on fusellis knee sure you neednt worry kid ive got you fixed up all right he said then he added jovially well lets go see that girl of yours they went out into the dark streets where the wind despite the smell of burnt gasolene and army camps had a faint suavity something like the smell of mushrooms the smell of spring yvonne sat under the lamp in the shop her feet up on a box of canned peas yawning dismally behind her on the counter was the glass case full of yellow and greenishwhite cheeses above that shelves rose to the ceiling in the brownish obscurity of the shop where gleamed faintly large jars and small jars cans neatly placed in rows glass jars and vegetables in the corner near the glass curtained door that led to the inner room hung clusters of sausages large and small red yellow and speckled yvonne jumped up when fuselli and the sergeant opened the door you are good she said je mourrais de cafard they laughed you know what that mean cafard sure it is only since the war avant la guerre on ne savais pas ce que cetait le cafard the war is no good funny aint it said fuselli to the top sergeant a feller cant juss figure out what the war is like dont you worry well all get there said the top sergeant knowingly this is the sarjon yvonne said fuselli oui oui je sais said yvonne smiling at the top sergeant they sat in the little room behind the shop and drank white wine and talked as best they could to yvonne who very trim in her black dress and blue apron perched on the edge of her chair with her feet in tiny pumps pressed tightly together and glanced now and then at the elaborate stripes on the top sergeants arm fuselli strode familiarly into the grocery shop whistling and threw open the door to the inner room his whistling stopped in the middle of a bar hello he said in an annoyed voice hello corporal said eisenstein eisenstein his french soldier friend a lanky man with a scraggly black heard and burning black eyes and stockton the chalkyfaced boy were sitting at the table that filled up the room chatting intimately and gaily with yvonne who leaned against the yellow wall beside the frenchman and showed all her little pearly teeth in a laugh in the middle of the dark oak table was a pot of hyacinths and some glasses that had had wine in them the odor of the hyacinths hung in the air with a faint warm smell from the kitchen after a seconds hesitation fuselli sat down to wait until the others should leave it was long after payday and his pockets were empty so he had nowhere else to go how are they treatin you down in your outfit now asked eisenstein of stockton after a silence same as ever said stockton in his thin voice stuttering a little sometimes i wish i was dead hum said eisenstein a curious expression of understanding on his flabby face well be civilians some day i wont said stockton hell said eisenstein youve got to keep your upper lip stiff i thought i was goin to die in that troopship coming over here an when i was little an came over with the emigrants from poland i thought i was goin to die a man can stand more than he thinks for i never thought i could stand being in the army bein a slave like an all that an im still here no youll live long and be successful yet he put his hand on stocktons shoulder the boy winced and drew his chair away what for you do that i aint goin to hurt you said eisenstein fuselli looked at them both with a disgusted interest ill tell you what youd better do kid he said condescendingly you get transferred to our company its an al bunch aint it eisenstein weve got a good loot an a good topkicker an a damn good bunch o fellers our topkicker was in here a few minutes ago said eisenstein he was asked fuselli whered he go damned if i know yvonne and the french soldier were talking in low voices laughing a little now and then fuselli leaned back in his chair looking at them feeling out of things wishing despondently that he knew enough french to understand what they were saying he scraped his feet angrily back and forth on the floor his eyes lit on the white hyacinths they made him think of florists windows at home at eastertime and the noise and bustle of san franciscos streets god i hate this rotten hole he muttered to himself he thought of mabe he made a noise with his lips hell she was married by this time anyway yvonne was the girl for him if he could only have yvonne to himself far away somewhere away from the other men and that damn frog and her old mother he thought of himself going to the theatre with yvonne when he was a sergeant he would be able to afford that sort of thing he counted up the months it was march here hed been in europe five months and he was still only a corporal and not that yet he clenched his fists with impatience but once he got to be a noncom it would go faster he told himself reassuringly he leaned over and sniffed loudly at the hyacinths they smell good he said que disay vous yvonne yvonne looked at him as if she had forgotten that he was in the room her eyes looked straight into his and she burst out laughing her glance had made him feel warm all over and he leaned back in his chair again looking at her slender body so neatly cased in its black dress and at her little head with its tightlydone hair with a comfortable feeling of possession yvonne come over here he said beckoning with his head she looked from him to the frenchman provocatively then she came over and stood behind him que voulezvous fuselli glanced at eisenstein he and stockton were deep in excited conversation with the frenchman again fuselli heard that uncomfortable word that always made him angry he did not know why revolution yvonne he said so that only she could hear what you say you and me get married marries moi et toi asked yvonne in a puzzled voice we we she looked him in the eyes a moment and then threw hack her head in a paroxysm of hysterical laughter fuselli flushed scarlet got to his feet and strode out slamming the door behind him so that the glass rang he walked hurriedly back to camp splashed with mud by the long lines of grey motor trucks that were throbbing their way slowly through the main street each with a yellow eye that lit up faintly the tailboards of the truck ahead the barracks were dark and nearly empty he sat down at the sergeants desk and began moodily turning over the pages of the little blue book of army regulations the moonlight glittered in the fountain at the end of the main square of the town it was a warm dark night of faint clouds through which the moon shone palely as through a thin silk canopy fuselli stood by the fountain smoking a cigarette looking at the yellow windows of the cheval blanc at the other end of the square from which came a sound of voices and of billiard balls clinking he stood quiet letting the acrid cigarette smoke drift out through his nose his ears full of the silvery tinkle of the water in the fountain beside him there were little drifts of warm and chilly air in the breeze that blew fitfully from the west fuselli was waiting he took out his watch now and then and strained his eyes to see the time but there was not light enough at last the deep broken note of the bell in the church spire struck once it must be half past ten he started walking slowly towards the street where yvonnes grocery shop was the faint glow of the moon lit up the grey houses with the shuttered windows and tumultuous red roofs full of little dormers and skylights fuselli felt deliciously at ease with the world he could almost feel yvonnes body in his arms and he smiled as he remembered the little faces she used to make at him he slunk past the shuttered windows of the shop and dove into the darkness under the arch that led to the court he walked cautiously on tiptoe keeping close to the mosscovered wall for he heard voices in the court he peeped round the edge of the building and saw that there were several people in the kitchen door talking he drew his head back into the shadow but he had caught a glimpse of the dark round form of the hogshead beside the kitchen door if he only could get behind that as he usually did he would be hidden until the people went away keeping well in the shadow round the edge of the court he slipped to the other side and was just about to pop himself in behind the hogshead when he noticed that someone was there before him he caught his breath and stood still his heart thumping the figure turned and in the dark he recognised the top sergeants round face keep quiet cant you whispered the top sergeant peevishly fuselli stood still with his fists clenched the blood flamed through his head making his scalp tingle still the top sergeant was the top sergeant came the thought it would never do to get in wrong with him fusellis legs moved him automatically back into a corner of the court where he leaned against the damp wall glaring with smarting eyes at the two women who stood talking outside the kitchen door and at the dark shadow behind the hogshead at last after several smacking kisses the women went away and the kitchen door closed the bell in the church spire struck eleven slowly and mournfully when it had ceased striking fuselli heard a discreet tapping and saw the shadow of the top sergeant against the door as he slipped in fuselli heard the top sergeants goodnatured voice in a large stage whisper followed by a choked laugh from yvonne the door closed and the light was extinguished leaving the court in darkness except for a faint marbled glow in the sky fuselli strode out making as much noise as he could with his heels on the cobble stones the streets of the town were silent under the pale moon in the square the fountain sounded loud and metallic he gave up his pass to the guard and strode glumly towards the barracks at the door he met a man with a pack on his back hullo fuselli said a voice he knew is my old bunk still there damned if i know said fuselli i thought theyd shipped you home the corporal who had been on the red sox outfield broke into a fit of coughing hell no he said they kep me at that goddam hospital till they saw i wasnt goin to die right away an then they told me to come back to my outfit so here i am did they bust you said fuselli with sudden eagerness hell no why should they they aint gone and got a new corporal have they no not exactly said fuselli v meadville stood near the camp gate watching the motor trucks go by on the main road grey lumbering and mudcovered they throbbed by sloughing in and out of the mud holes in the worn road in an endless train stretching as far as he could see into the town and as far as he could see up the road he stood with his legs far apart and spat into the center of the road then he turned to the corporal who had been in the red sox outfield and said ill be goddamed if there aint somethin doin a hell of a lot doin said the corporal shaking his head seen that guy daniels whos been to the front no well he says hells broke loose hells broke loose whats happened be gorry we may see some active service said meadville grinning by god id give the best colt on my ranch to see some action got a ranch asked the corporal the motor trucks kept on grinding past monotonously their drivers were so splashed with mud it was hard to see what uniform they wore what dye think asked meadville think i keep store fuselli walked past them towards the town say fuselli shouted meadville corporal says hells broke loose out there we may smell gunpowder yet fuselli stopped and joined them i guess poor old bill greys smelt plenty of gunpowder by this time he said i wish i had gone with him said meadville ill try that little trick myself now the good weathers come on if we dont get a move on soon too damn risky listen to the kid itll be too damn risky in the trenches or do you think youre goin to get a cushy job in camp here hell no i want to go to the front i dont want to stay in this hole well but aint no good throwin yerself in where it dont do no good a guy wants to get on in this army if he can whats the good o gettin on said the corporal wont get home a bit sooner hell but youre a noncom another train of motor trucks went by drowning their talk fuselli was packing medical supplies in a box in a great brownish warehouse full of packing cases where a little sun filtered in through the dusty air at the corrugated sliding tin doors as he worked he listened to daniels talking to meadville who worked beside him an the gas is the goddamndest stuff i ever heard of he was saying ive seen fellers with their arms swelled up to twice the size like blisters from it mustard gas they call it what did you get to go to the hospital said meadville only pneumonia said daniels but i had a buddy who was split right in half by a piece of a shell he was standin as near me as you are an was whistlin tipperary under his breath when all at once there was a big spurt o blood an there he was with his chest split in half an his head hangin a thread like meadville moved his quid of tobacco from one cheek to the other and spat on to the sawdust of the floor the men within earshot stopped working and looked admiringly at daniels well what dye reckons goin on at the front now said meadville damned of i know the goddam hospital at orleans was so full up there was guys in stretchers waiting all day on the pavement outside i know that fellers there said helld broke loose for fair looks to me like the fritzies was advancin meadville looked at him incredulously those skunks said fuselli why they cant advance theyre starvin to death the hell they are said daniels i guess you believe everything you see in the papers eyes looked at daniels indignantly they all went on working in silence suddenly the lieutenant looking strangely flustered strode into the warehouse leaving the tin door open behind him can anyone tell me where sergeant osler is he was here a few minutes ago spoke up fuselli well where is he now snapped the lieutenant angrily i dont know sir mumbled fuselli flushing go and see if you can find him fuselli went off to the other end of the warehouse outside the door he stopped and bit off a cigarette in a leisurely fashion his blood boiled sullenly how the hell should he know where the top sergeant was they didnt expect him to be a mindreader did they and all the flood of bitterness that had been collecting in his spirit seethed to the surface they had not treated him right he felt full of hopeless anger against this vast treadmill to which he was bound the endless succession of the days all alike all subject to orders to the interminable monotony of drills and lineups passed before his mind he felt he couldnt go on yet he knew that he must and would go on that there was no stopping that his feet would go on beating in time to the steps of the treadmill he caught sight of the sergeant coming towards the warehouse across the new green grass scarred by the marks of truck wheels sarge he called then he went up to him mysteriously the loot wants to see you at once in warehouse b he slouched back to his work arriving just in time to hear the lieutenant say in a severe voice to the sergeant sergeant do you know how to draw up courtmartial papers yes sir said the sergeant a look of surprise on his face he followed the precise steps of the lieutenant out of the door fuselli had a moment of panic terror during which he went on working methodically although his hands trembled he was searching his memory for some infringement of a regulation that might be charged against him the terror passed as fast as it had come of course he had no reason to fear he laughed softly to himself what a fool hed been to get scared like that and a summary courtmartial couldnt do much to you anyway he went on working as fast and as carefully as he could through the long monotonous afternoon that night nearly the whole company gathered in a group at the end of the barracks both sergeants were away the corporal said he knew nothing and got sulkily into bed where he lay rolled in his blankets shaken by fit after fit of coughing at last someone said i bet that kike eisensteins turned out to be a spy i bet he has too hes foreign born aint he born in poland or some goddam place he always did talk queer i always thought said fuselli hed get into trouble talking the way he did howd he talk asked daniels oh he said that war was wrong and all that goddamed progerman stuff dye know what they did out at the front said daniels in the second division they made two fellers dig their own graves and then shot em for sayin the war was wrong hell they did youre goddam right they did i tell you fellers it dont do to monkey with the buzzsaw in this army for gods sake shut up taps has blown meadville turn the lights out said the corporal angrily the barracks was dark full of a sound of men undressing in their bunks and of whispered talk the company was lined up for morning mess the sun that had just risen was shining in rosily through the soft clouds of the sky the sparrows kept up a great clattering in the avenue of plane trees their riotous chirping could be heard above the sound of motors starting that came from a shed opposite the mess shack the sergeant appeared suddenly walking past with his shoulders stiff so that everyone knew at once that something important was going on attention men a minute he said mess kits clattered as the men turned round after mess i want you to go immediately to barracks and roll your packs after that every man must stand by his pack until orders come the company cheered and mess kits clattered together like cymbals as you were shouted the top sergeant jovially gluey oatmeal and greasy bacon were hurriedly bolted down and every man in the company his heart pounding ran to the barracks to do up his pack feeling proud under the envious eyes of the company at the other end of the shack that had received no orders when the packs were done up they sat on the empty hunks and drummed their feet against the wooden partitions waiting i dont suppose well leave here till hell freezes over said meadville who was doing up the last strap on his pack its always like this you break your neck to obey orders an outside shouted the sergeant poking his head in the door fall in attenshun the lieutenant in his trench coat and in a new pair of roll puttees stood facing the company looking solemn men he said biting off his words as a man bites through a piece of hard stick candy one of your number is up for courtmartial for possibly disloyal statements found in a letter addressed to friends at home i have been extremely grieved to find anything of this sort in any company of mine i dont believe there is another man in the companylow enough to hold entertain such ideas every man in the company stuck out his chest vowing inwardly to entertain no ideas at all rather than run the risk of calling forth such disapproval from the lieutenant the lieutenant paused all i can say is if there is any such man in the company he had better keep his mouth shut and be pretty damn careful what he writes home dismissed he shouted the order grimly as if it were the order for the execution of the offender that goddam skunk eisenstein said someone the lieutenant heard it as he walked away oh sergeant he said familiarly i think the others have got the right stuff in them the company went into the barracks and waited the sergeantmajors office was full of a clicking of typewriters and was overheated by a black stove that stood in the middle of the floor letting out occasional little puffs of smoke from a crack in the stove pipe the sergeantmajor was a small man with a fresh boyish face and a drawling voice who lolled behind a large typewriter reading a magazine that lay on his lap fuselli slipped in behind the typewriter and stood with his cap in his hand beside the sergeantmajors chair well what do you want asked the sergeantmajor gruffly a feller told me sergeantmajor that you was lookin for a man with optical experience fusellis voice was velvety well i worked three years in an opticalgoods store at home in frisco whats your name rank company daniel fuselli private stclass company c medical supply warehouse all right ill attend to it but sergeant all right out with what youve got to say quick the sergeantmajor fingered the leaves of his magazine impatiently my companys all packed up to go the transferll have to be today sergeant why the hell didnt you come in earlier stevens make out a transfer to headquarters company and get the major to sign it when he goes through thats the way it always is he cried leaning back tragically in his swivel chair everybody always puts everything off on me at the last minute thank you sir said fuselli smiling the sergeantmajor ran his hand through his hair and took up his magazine again peevishly fuselli hurried back to barracks where he found the company still waiting several men were crouched in a circle playing craps the rest lounged in their bare bunks or fiddled with their packs outside it had begun to rain softly and a smell of wet sprouting earth came in through the open door fuselli sat on the floor beside his bunk throwing his knife down so that it stuck in the boards between his knees he was whistling softly to himself the day dragged on several times he heard the town clock strike in the distance at last the top sergeant came in shaking the water off his slicker a serious important expression on his face inspection of medical belts he shouted everybody open up their belt and lay it on the foot of their bunk and stand at attention on the left side the lieutenant and a major appeared suddenly at one end of the barracks and came through slowly pulling the little packets out of the belts the men looked at them out of the corners of their eyes as they examined the belts they chatted easily as if they had been alone yes said the major were in for it this time that damned offensive well well be able to show em what were good for said the lieutenant laughing we havent had a chance yet hum better mark that belt lieutenant and have it changed been to the front yet no sir hum well youll look at things differently when you have said the major the lieutenant frowned well on the whole lieutenant your outfit is in very good shape at ease men the lieutenant and the major stood at the door a moment raising the collars of their coats then they dove out into the rain a few minutes later the sergeant came in all right get your slickers on and line up they stood lined up in the rain for a long while it was a leaden afternoon the even clouds had a faint coppery tinge the rain beat in their faces making them tingle fuselli was looking anxiously at the sergeant at last the lieutenant appeared attention cried the sergeant the roll was called and a new man fell in at the end of the line a tall man with large protruding eyes like a calfs private stclass daniel fuselli fall out and report to headquarters company fuselli saw a look of surprise come over mens faces he smiled wanly at meadville sergeant take the men down to the station squads right cried the sergeant march the company tramped off into the streaming rain fuselli went back to the barracks took off his pack and slicker and wiped the water off his face the rails gleamed gold in the early morning sunshine above the deep purple cinders of the track fusellis eyes followed the track until it curved into a cutting where the wet clay was a bright orange in the clear light the station platform where puddles from the nights rain glittered as the wind ruffled them was empty fuselli started walking up and down with his hands in his pockets he had been sent down to unload some supplies that were coming on that mornings train he felt free and successful since he joined the headquarters company at last he told himself he had a job where he could show what he was good for he walked up and down whistling shrilly a train pulled slowly into the station the engine stopped to take water and the couplings clanked all down the line of cars the platform was suddenly full of men in khaki stamping their feet running up and down shouting where you guys goin asked fuselli were bound for palm beach dont we look it someone snarled in reply but fuselli had seen a familiar face he was shaking hands with two browned men whose faces were grimy with days of travelling in freight cars hullo chrisfield hullo andrews he cried when did you fellows get over here oh bout four months ago said chrisfield whose black eyes looked at fuselli searchingly oh ah member you youre fuselli we was at trainin camp together member him andy sure said andrews how are you makin out fine said fuselli im in the optical department here where the hells that right here fuselli pointed vaguely behind the station weve been training about four months near bordeaux said andrews and now were going to see what its like the whistle blew and the engine started puffing hard clouds of white steam filled the station platform where the soldiers scampered for their cars good luck said fuselli but andrews and chrisfield had already gone he saw them again as the train pulled out two brown and dirtgrimed faces among many other brown and dirtgrimed faces the steam floated up tinged with yellow in the bright early morning air as the last car of the train disappeared round the curve into the cutting the dust rose thickly about the worn broom as it was a dark morning very little light filtered into the room full of great white packing cases where fuselli was sweeping he stopped now and then and leaned on his broom far away he heard a sound of trains shunting and shouts and the sound of feet tramping in unison from the drill ground the building where he was was silent he went on sweeping thinking of his company tramping off through the streaming rain and of those fellows he had known in training camp in america andrews and chrisfield jolting in box cars towards the front where daniels buddy had had his chest split in half by a piece of shell and hed written home hed been made a corporal what was he going to do when letters came for him addressed corporal dan fuselli putting the broom away he dusted the yellow chair and the table covered with order slips that stood in the middle of the piles of packing boxes the door slammed somewhere below and there was a step on the stairs that led to the upper part of the warehouse a little man with a monkeylike greyishbrown face and spectacles appeared and slipped out of his overcoat like a very small bean popping out of a very large pod the sergeants stripes looked unusually wide and conspicuous on his thin arm he grunted at fuselli sat down at the desk and began at once peering among the order slips anything in our mailbox this morning he asked fuselli in a hoarse voice its all there sergeant said fuselli the sergeant peered about the desk some more yell have to wash that window today he said after a pause majors likely to come round here any time ought to have been done yesterday all right said fuselli dully he slouched over to the corner of the room got the worn broom and began sweeping down the stairs the dust rose about him making him cough he stopped and leaned on the broom he thought of all the days that had gone by since hed last seen those fellows andrews and chrisfield at training camp in america and of all the days that would go by he started sweeping again sweeping the dust down from stair to stair fuselli sat on the end of his bunk he had just shaved it was a sunday morning and he looked forward to having the afternoon off he rubbed his face on his towel and got to his feet outside the rain fell in great silvery sheets so that the noise on the tarpaper roof of the barracks was almost deafening fuselli noticed at the other end of the row of bunks a group of men who all seemed to be looking at the same thing rolling down his sleeves with his tunic hitched over one arm he walked down to see what was the matter through the patter of the rain he heard a thin voice say it aint no use sergeant im sick i aint a goin to get up the kids crazy someone beside fuselli said turning away you get up this minute roared the sergeant he was a big man with black hair who looked like a lumberman he stood over the bunk in the bunk at the end of a bundle of blankets was the chalkwhite face of stockton the boys teeth were clenched and his eyes were round and protruding it seemed from terror you get out o bed this minute roared the sergeant again the boy was silent his white cheeks quivered what the hells the matter with him why dont you yank him out yourself sarge you get out of bed this minute shouted the sergeant again paying no attention the men gathered about walked away fuselli watched fascinated from a little distance all right then ill get the lieutenant this is a courtmartial offence here morton and morrison youre guards over this man the boy lay still in his blankets he closed his eyes by the way the blanket rose and fell over his chest they could see that he was breathing heavily say stockton why dont you get up you fool said fuselli you cant buck the whole army the boy didnt answer fuselli walked away hes crazy he muttered the lieutenant was a stoutish redfaced man who came in puffing followed by the tall sergeant he stopped and shook the water off his campaign hat the rain kept up its deafening patter on the roof look here are you sick if you are report sick call at once said the lieutenant in an elaborately kind voice the boy looked at him dully and did not answer you should get up and stand at attention when an officer speaks to you i aint goin to get up came the thin voice the officers red face became crimson sergeant whats the matter with the man he asked in a furious tone i cant do anything with him lieutenant i think hes gone crazy rubbish mere insubordination youre under arrest dye hear he shouted towards the bed there was no answer the rain pattered hard on the roof have him brought down to the guardhouse by force if necessary snapped the lieutenant he strode towards the door and sergeant start drawing up courtmartial papers at once the door slammed behind him now youve got to get him up said the sergeant to the two guards fuselli walked away aint some people damn fools he said to a man at the other end of the barracks he stood looking out of the window at the bright sheets of the rain well get him up shouted the sergeant the boy lay with his eyes closed his chalkwhite face halfhidden by the blankets he was very still well will you get up and go to the guardhouse or have we to carry you there shouted the sergeant the guards laid hold of him gingerly and pulled him up to a sitting posture all right yank him out of bed the frail form in khaki shirt and whitish drawers was held up for a moment between the two men then it fell a limp heap on the floor say sarge hes fainted the hell he has say morrison ask one of the orderlies to come up from the infirmary he aint fainted the kids dead said the other man give me a hand the sergeant helped lift the body on the bed again well ill be goddamned said the sergeant the eyes had opened they covered the head with a blanket part three machines i the fields and the misty bluegreen woods slipped by slowly as the box car rumbled and jolted over the rails now stopping for hours on sidings amid meadows where it was quiet and where above the babel of voices of the regiment you could hear the skylarks now clattering fast over bridges and along the banks of jadegreen rivers where the slim poplars were just coming into leaf and where now and then a fish jumped the men crowded in the door grimy and tired leaning on each others shoulders and watching the plowed lands slip by and the meadows where the goldengreen grass was dappled with buttercups and the villages of huddled red roofs lost among pale budding trees and masses of peach blossom through the smells of steam and coal smoke and of unwashed bodies in uniforms came smells of moist fields and of manure from freshsowed patches and of cows and pasture lands just coming into flower must be right smart ocraps in this country aint like that damn polignac andy said chrisfield well they made us drill so hard there wasnt any time for the grass to grow youre damn right there warnt ahd lak te live in this country a while said chrisfield we might ask em to let us off right here cant be that the fronts like this said judkins poking his head out between andrewss and chrisfields heads so that the bristles of his unshaven chin rubbed against chrisfields cheek it was a large square head with closely cropped light hair and porcelainblue eyes under lids that showed white in the red sunburned face and a square jaw made a little grey by the sprouting beard say andy how the hell long have we all been in this goddam train ahve done lost track o the time whats the matter are you gettin old chris asked judkins laughing chrisfield had slipped out of the place he held and began poking himself in between andrews and judkins weve been on this train four days and five nights an weve got half a days rations left so we must be getting somewhere said andrews it cant be like this at the front it must be spring there as well as here said andrews it was a day of fluffy mauvetinted clouds that moved across the sky sometimes darkening to deep blue where a small rainstorm trailed across the hills sometimes brightening to moments of clear sunlight that gave blue shadows to the poplars and shone yellow on the smoke of the engine that puffed on painfully at the head of the long train funny aint it how lil everythin is said chrisfield out indiana way we wouldnt look at a cornfield that size but it sort o reminds me the way it used to be out home in the spring o the year id like to see indiana in the springtime said andrews well youll come out when the wars over and us guys is all homewont you andy you bet i will they were going into the suburbs of a town rows and clusters of little brick and stucco houses were appearing along the roads it began to rain from a sky full of lights of amber and lilac color the slate roofs and the pinkishgrey streets of the town shone cheerfully in the rain the little patches of garden were all vivid emeraldgreen then they were looking at rows and rows of red chimney pots over wet slate roofs that reflected the bright sky in the distance rose the purplegrey spire of a church and the irregular forms of old buildings they passed through a station dijon read andrews on the platform were french soldiers in their blue coats and a good sprinkling of civilians gee those are about the first real civies ive seen since i came overseas said judkins those goddam country people down at polignac didnt look like real civilians theres folks dressed like it was new york they had left the station and were rumbling slowly past interminable freight trains at last the train came to a dead stop a whistle sounded dont nobody get out shouted the sergeant from the car ahead hell they keep you in this goddam car like you was a convict muttered chrisfield id like to get out and walk around dijon o boy i swear id make a bee line for a dairy lunch said judkins hell of a fine dairy lunch youll find among those goddam frogs no vin blank is all yould get in that goddam town ahm goin to sleep said chrisfield he stretched himself out on the pile of equipment at the end of the car andrews sat down near him and stared at his mudcaked boots running one of his long hands as brown as chrisfields now through his light shortcut hair chrisfield lay looking at the gaunt outline of andrewss face against the light through halfclosed eyes and he felt a warm sort of a smile inside him as he said to himself hes a damn good kid then he thought of the spring in the hills of southern indiana and the mockingbird singing in the moonlight among the flowering locust trees behind the house he could almost smell the heavy sweetness of the locust blooms as he used to smell them sitting on the steps after supper tired from a days heavy plowing while the clatter of his mothers housework came from the kitchen he didnt wish he was back there but it was pleasant to think of it now and then and how the yellow farmhouse looked and the red barn where his father never had been able to find time to paint the door and the tumbledown cowshed where the shingles were always coming off he wondered dully what it would be like out there at the front it couldnt be green and pleasant the way the country was here fellows always said it was hell out there well he didnt give a damn he went to sleep he woke up gradually the warm comfort of sleep giving place slowly to the stiffness of his uncomfortable position with the hobnails of a boot from the back of a pack sticking into his shoulder andrews was sitting in the same position lost in thought the rest of the men sat at the open doors or sprawled over the equipment chrisfield got up stretched himself yawned and went to the door to look out there was a heavy important step on the gravel outside a large man with black eyebrows that met over his nose and a very black stubbly beard passed the car there were a sergeants stripes on his arm say andy cried chrisfield that bastard is a sergeant whos that asked andrews getting up with a smile his blue eyes looking mildly into chrisfields black ones you know who ah mean under their heavy tan chrisfields rounded cheeks were flushed his eyes snapped under their long black lashes his fists were clutched oh i know chris i didnt know he was in this regiment god damn him muttered chrisfield in a low voice throwing himself down on his packs again hold your horses chris said andrews we may all cash in our checks before longno use letting things worry us i dont give a damn if we do nor do i now andrews sat down beside chrisfield again after a while the train got jerkily into motion the wheels rumbled and clattered over the rails and the clots of mud bounced up and down on the splintered boards of the floor chrisfield pillowed his head on his arm and went to sleep again still smarting from the flush of his anger andrews looked out through his fingers at the swaying black box car at the men sprawled about on the floor their heads nodding with each jolt and at the mauvegrey clouds and bits of sparkling blue sky that he could see behind the silhouettes of the heads and shoulders of the men who stood in the doors the wheels ground on endlessly the car stopped with a jerk that woke up all the sleepers and threw one man off his feet a whistle blew shrilly outside all right out of the cars snap it up snap it up yelled the sergeant the men piled out stiffly handing the equipment out from hand to hand till it formed a confused heap of packs and rifles outside all down the train at each door there was a confused pile of equipment and struggling men snap it up full equipment line up the sergeant yelled the men fell into line slowly with their packs and rifles lieutenants hovered about the edges of the forming lines tightly belted into their stiff trench coats scrambling up and down the coal piles of the siding the men were given at ease and stood leaning on their rifles staring at a green watertank on three wooden legs over the top of which had been thrown a huge piece of torn grey cheesecloth when the confused sound of tramping feet subsided they could hear a noise in the distance like someone lazily shaking a piece of heavy sheetiron the sky was full of little dabs of red purple and yellow and the purplish sunset light was over everything the order came to march they marched down a rutted road where the puddles were so deep they had continually to break ranks to avoid them in a little pinewood on one side were rows of heavy motor trucks and ammunition caissons supper was cooking in a field kitchen about which clustered the truck drivers in their wide visored caps beyond the wood the column turned off into a field behind a little group of stone and stucco houses that had lost their roofs in the field they halted the grass was brilliant emerald and the wood and the distant hills were shades of clear deep blue wisps of paleblue mist lay across the field in the turf here and there were small clean bites that might have been made by some strange animal the men looked at them curiously no lights remember were in sight of the enemy a match might annihilate the detachment announced the lieutenant dramatically after having given the orders for the pup tents to be set up when the tents were ready the men stood about in the chilly white mist that kept growing denser eating their cold rations everywhere were grumbling snorting voices god lets turn in chris before our bones are frozen said andrews guards had been posted and walked up and down with a businesslike stride peering now and then suspiciously into the little wood where the truckdrivers were chrisfield and andrews crawled into their little tent and rolled up together in their blankets getting as close to each other as they could at first it was very cold and hard and they squirmed about restlessly but gradually the warmth from their bodies filled their thin blankets and their muscles began to relax andrews went to sleep first and chrisfield lay listening to his deep breathing there was a frown on his face he was thinking of the man who had walked past the train at dijon the last time he had seen that man anderson was at training camp he had only been a corporal then he remembered the day the man had been made corporal it had not been long before that that chrisfield had drawn his knife on him one night in the barracks a fellow had caught his hand just in time anderson had looked a bit pale that time and had walked away but hed never spoken a word to chrisfield since as he lay with his eyes closed pressed close against andrews limp sleeping body chrisfield could see the mans face the eyebrows that joined across the nose and the jaw always blackish from the heavy beard that looked blue when he had just shaved at last the tenseness of his mind slackened he thought of women for a moment of a fairhaired girl hed seen from the tram and then suddenly crushing sleepiness closed down on him and everything went softly warmly black as he drifted off to sleep with no sense but the coldness of one side and the warmth of his bunkies body on the other in the middle of the night he awoke and crawled out of the tent andrews followed him their teeth chattered a little and they stretched their legs stiffly it was cold but the mist had vanished the stars shone brilliantly they walked out a little way into the field away from the bunch of tents to make water a faint rustling and breathing noise as of animals herded together came from the sleeping regiment somewhere a brook made a shrill gurgling they strained their ears but they could hear no guns they stood side by side looking up at the multitudes of stars thats orion said andrews what that bunch of stars there is called orion dyou see em its supposed to look like a man with a bow but he always looks to me like a fellow striding across the sky some stars tonight aint there gee whats that behind the dark hills a glow rose and fell like the glow in a forge the front must be that way said andrews shivering i guess well know tomorrow yes tomorrow night well know more about it said andrews they stood silent a moment listening to the noise the brook made god its quiet aint it this cant be the front smell that what is it smells like an apple tree in bloom somewhere hell lets git in before our blankets git cold andrews was still staring at the group of stars he had said was orion chrisfield pulled him by the arm they crawled into their tent again rolled up together and immediately were crushed under an exhausted sleep as far ahead of him as chrisfield could see were packs and heads with caps at a variety of angles all bobbing up and down with the swing of the brisk marching time a fine warm rain was falling mingling with the sweat that ran down his face the column had been marching a long time along a straight road that was worn and scarred with heavy traffic fields and hedges where clusters of yellow flowers were in bloom had given place to an avenue of poplars the light wet trunks and the stiff branches hazy with green filed by interminable as interminable as the confused tramp of feet and jingle of equipment that sounded in his ears say are we goin towards the front goddamned if i know aint no front within miles mens sentences came shortly through their heavy breathing the column shifted over to the side of the road to avoid a train of motor trucks going the other way chrisfield felt the heavy mud spurt up over him as truck after truck rumbled by with the wet back of one hand he tried to wipe it off his face but the grit when he rubbed it hurt his skin made tender by the rain he swore long and whiningly half aloud his rifle felt as heavy as an iron girder they entered a village of plasterandtimber houses through open doors they could see into comfortable kitchens where copper pots gleamed and where the floors were of clean red tiles in front of some of the houses were little gardens full of crocuses and hyacinths where boxbushes shone a very dark green in the rain they marched through the square with its pavement of little yellow rounded cobbles its grey church with a pointed arch in the door its cafes with names painted over them men and women looked out of doors and windows the column perceptibly slackened its speed but kept on and as the houses dwindled and became farther apart along the road the mens hope of stopping vanished ears were deafened by the confused tramp of feet on the macadam road mens feet seemed as lead as if all the weight of the pack hung on them shoulders worn callous began to grow tender and sore under the constant sweating heads drooped each mans eyes were on the heels of the man ahead of him that rose and fell rose and fell endlessly marching became for each man a personal struggle with his pack that seemed to have come alive that seemed something malicious and overpowering wrestling to throw him the rain stopped and the sky brightened a little taking on pale yellowish lights as if the clouds that hid the sun were growing thin the column halted at the edge of a group of farms and barns that scattered along the road the men sprawled in all directions along the roadside hiding the bright green grass with the mudcolor of their uniforms chrisfield lay in the field beside the road pressing his hot face into the wet sprouting clover the blood throbbed through his ears his arms and legs seemed to cleave to the ground as if he would never be able to move them again he closed his eyes gradually a cold chill began stealing through his body he sat up and slipped his arms out of the harness of his pack someone was handing him a cigarette and he sniffed a little acrid sweet smoke andrews was lying beside him his head propped against his pack smoking and poking a cigarette towards his friend with a muddy hand his blue eyes looked strangely from out the flaming red of his mudsplotched face chrisfield took the cigarette and fumbled in his pocket for a match that nearly did it for me said andrews chrisfield grunted he pulled greedily on the cigarette a whistle blew slowly the men dragged themselves off the ground and fell into line drooping under the weight of their equipment the companies marched off separately chrisfield overheard the lieutenant saying to a sergeant damn fool business that why the hell couldnt they have sent us here in the first place so we aint goin to the front after all said the sergeant front hell said the lieutenant the lieutenant was a small man who looked like a jockey with a coarse red face which now that he was angry was almost purple i guess theyre going to quarter us here said somebody immediately everybody began saying were going to be quartered here they stood waiting in formation a long while the packs cutting into their backs and shoulders at last the sergeant shouted out all right take yer stuff upstairs stumbling on each others heels they climbed up into a dark loft where the air was heavy with the smell of hay and with an acridity of cow manure from the stables below there was a little straw in the corners on which those who got there first spread their blankets chrisfield and andrews tucked themselves in a corner from which through a hole where the tiles had fallen off the roof they could see down into the barnyard where white and speckled chickens pecked about with jerky movements a middleaged woman stood in the doorway of the house looking suspiciously at the files of khakiclad soldiers that shuffled slowly into the barns by every door an officer went up to her a little red book in his hand a conversation about some matter proceeded painfully the officer grew very red andrews threw back his head and laughed luxuriously rolling from side to side in the straw chrisfield laughed too he hardly knew why over their heads they could hear the feet of pigeons on the roof and a constant drowsy roucoucoucou through the barnyard smells began to driftthe greasiness of food cooking in the field kitchen ah hope they give us somethin good to eat said chrisfield ahm hongry as a thrasher so am i said andrews say andy you kin talk their language a lil cant ye andrews nodded his head vaguely well maybe we kin git some aigs or somethin out of the lady down there will ye try after mess all right they both lay back in the straw and closed their eyes their cheeks still burned from the rain everything seemed very peaceful the men sprawled about talking in low drowsy voices outside another shower had come up and beat softly on the tiles of the roof chrisfield thought he had never been so comfortable in his life although his soaked shoes pinched his cold feet and his knees were wet and cold but in the drowsiness of the rain and of voices talking quietly about him he fell asleep he dreamed he was home in indiana but instead of his mother cooking at the stove in the kitchen there was the frenchwoman who had stood in the farmhouse door and near her stood a lieutenant with a little red book in his hand he was eating cornbread and syrup off a broken plate it was fine cornbread with a great deal of crust on it crisp and hot on which the butter was cold and sweet to his tongue suddenly he stopped eating and started swearing shouting at the top of his lungs you goddam he started but he couldnt seem to think of anything more to say you goddam he started again the lieutenant looked towards him wrinkling his black eyebrows that met across his nose he was sergeant anderson chris drew his knife and ran at him but it was andy his bunkie he had run his knife into he threw his arms round andys body crying hot tears he woke up mess kits were clinking all about the dark crowded loft the men had already started piling down the stairs the larks filled the winetinged air with a constant chiming of little bells chrisfield and andrews were strolling across a field of white clover that covered the brow of a hill below in the valley they could see a cluster of red roofs of farms and the white ribbon of the road where long trains of motor trucks crawled like beetles the sun had just set behind the blue hills the other side of the shallow valley the air was full of the smell of clover and of hawthorn from the hedgerows they took deep breaths as they crossed the field its great to get away from that crowd andrews was saying chrisfield walked on silently dragging his feet through the matted clover a leaden dullness weighed like some sort of warm choking coverlet on his limbs so that it seemed an effort to walk an effort to speak yet under it his muscles were taut and trembling as he had known them to be before when he was about to get into a fight or to make love to a girl why the hell dont they let us git into it he said suddenly yes anythingld be better than thiswait wait wait they walked on hearing the constant chirrup of the larks the brush of their feet through the clover the faint jingle of some coins in chrisfields pocket and in the distance the irregular snoring of an aeroplane motor as they walked andrews leaned over from time to time and picked a couple of the white clover flowers the aeroplane came suddenly nearer and swooped in a wide curve above the field drowning every sound in the roar of its exhaust they made out the figures of the pilot and the observer before the plane rose again and vanished against the ragged purple clouds of the sky the observer had waved a hand at them as he passed they stood still in the darkening field staring up at the sky where a few larks still hung chirruping ahd lahk to be one o them guys said chrisfield you would god damn it ahd do anything to git out o this hellish infantry this aint no sort o life for a man to be treated lahk he was a nigger no its no sort of life for a man if theyd let us git to the front an do some fightin an be done with it but all we do is drill and have grenade practice an drill again and then have bayonet practice an drill again nough to drive a feller crazy what the hells the use of talking about it chris we cant be any lower than we are can we andrews laughed theres that plane again where there just goin down behind the piece o woods thats where their field is ah bet them guys has a good time ah put in an application back in trainin camp for aviation aint never heard nothing from it though if ah had ah wouldnt be lower than dirt in this hawgpen its wonderful up here on the hill this evening said andrews looking dreamily at the pale orange band of light where the sun had set lets go down and get a bottle of wine now yore talkin ah wonder if that girls down there tonight antoinette umhum boy ahd lahk to have her all by maself some night their steps grew brisker as they strode along a grassgrown road that led through high hedgerows to a village under the brow of the hill it was almost dark under the shadow of the bushes on either side overhead the purple clouds were washed over by a pale yellow light that gradually faded to grey birds chirped and rustled among the young leaves andrews put his hand on chrisfields shoulder lets walk slow he said we dont want to get out of here too soon he grabbed carelessly at little cluster of hawthorn flowers as he passed them and seemed reluctant to untangle the thorny branches that caught in his coat and on his loosely wound puttees hell man said chrisfield we wont have time to get a bellyful it must be gettin late already they hastened their steps again and came in a moment to the first tightly shuttered houses of the village in the middle of the road was an mp who stood with his legs wide apart waving his billy languidly he had a red face his eyes were fixed on the shuttered upper window of a house through the chinks of which came a few streaks of yellow light his lips were puckered up as if to whistle but no sound came he swayed back and forth indecisively an officer came suddenly out of the little green door of the house in front of the mp who brought his heels together with a jump and saluted holding his hand a long while to his cap the officer flicked a hand up hastily to his hat snatching his cigar out of his mouth for an instant as the officers steps grew fainter down the road the mp gradually returned to his former position chrisfield and andrews had slipped by on the other side and gone in at the door of a small ramshackle house of which the windows were closed by heavy wooden shutters i bet there aint many of them bastards at the front said chris not many of either kind of bastards said andrews laughing as he closed the door behind them they were in a room that had once been the parlor of a farmhouse the chandelier with its bits of crystal and the orangeblossoms on a piece of dusty red velvet under a bell glass on the mantelpiece denoted that the furniture had been taken out and four square oak tables crowded in at one of the tables sat three americans and at another a very young oliveskinned french soldier who sat hunched over his table looking moodily down into his glass of wine a girl in a faded frock of some purplish material that showed the strong curves of her shoulders and breasts slouched into the room her hands in the pocket of a dark blue apron against which her rounded forearms showed golden brown her face had the same golden tan under a mass of dark blonde hair she smiled when she saw the two soldiers drawing her thin lips away from her ugly yellow teeth ca va bien antoinette asked andrews oui she said looking beyond their heads at the french soldier who sat at the other side of the little room a bottle of vin rouge vite said chrisfield ye neednt be so damn vite about it tonight chris said one of the men at the other table why aint agoin to be no roll call corporal tole me hisself sarges gone out to git stewed an the loots away sure said another man we kin stay out as lates we goddam please tonight theres a new mp in town said chrisfield ah saw him maself you did too didnt you andy andrews nodded he was looking at the frenchman who sat with his face in shadow and his black lashes covering his eyes a purplish flash had suffused the olive skin at his cheekbones oh boy said chrisfield that ole wine sure do go down fast say antoinette got any cognac im going to have some more wine said andrews go ahead andy have all ye want ah want somethin to warm ma guts antoinette brought a bottle of cognac and two small glasses and sat down in an empty chair with her red hands crossed on her apron her eyes moved from chrisfield to the frenchman and back again chrisfield turned a little round in his chair and looked at the frenchman feeling in his eyes for a moment a glance of the mans yellowishbrown eyes andrews leaned back against the wall sipping his darkcolored wine his eyes contracted dreamily fixed on the shadow of the chandelier which the cheap oillamp with its tin reflector cast on the peeling plaster of the wall opposite chrisfield punched him wake up andy are you asleep no said andy smiling have a lil mo cognac chrisfield poured out two more glasses unsteadily his eyes were on antoinette again the faded purple frock was hooked at the neck the first three hooks were undone revealing a vshape of golden brown skin and a bit of whitish underwear say andy he said putting his arm round his friends neck and talking into his ear talk up to her for me will yer andy ah wont let that goddam frog get her no i wont by gawd talk up to her for me andy andrews laughed ill try he said but theres always the queen of sheba chris antoinette jai un ami started andrews making a gesture with a long dirty hand towards chris antoinette showed her bad teeth in a smile joli garcon said andrews antoinettes face became impassive and beautiful again chrisfield leaned back in his chair with an empty glass in his hand and watched his friend admiringly antoinette mon ami vousvous admire said andrews in a courtly voice a woman put her head in the door it was the same face and hair as antoinettes ten years older only the skin instead of being golden brown was sallow and wrinkled viens said the woman in a shrill voice antoinette got up brushed heavily against chrisfields leg as she passed him and disappeared the frenchman walked across the room from his corner saluted gravely and went out chrisfield jumped to his feet the room was like a white box reeling about him that frogs gone after her he shouted no he aint chris cried someone from the next table sit tight ole boy were bettin on yer yes sit down and have a drink chris said andy ive got to have somethin more to drink i havent had a thing to drink all the evening he pulled him back into his chair chrisfield tried to get up again andrews hung on him so that the chair upset then both sprawled on the red tiles of the floor the house is pinched said a voice chrisfield saw judkins standing over him a grin on his large red face he got to his feet and sat sulkily in his chair again andrews was already sitting opposite him looking impassive as ever the tables were full now someone was singing in a droning voice o the oak and the ash and the weeping willow tree o green grows the grass in gods countree ole indiana shouted chris thats the only gods country i know he suddenly felt that he could tell andy all about his home and the wide cornfields shimmering and rustling under the july sun and the creek with red clay banks where he used to go in swimming he seemed to see it all before him to smell the winey smell of the silo to see the cattle with their chewing mouths always stained a little with green waiting to get through the gate to the water trough and the yellow dust and roar of wheatthrashing and the quiet evening breeze cooling his throat and neck when he lay out on a shack of hay that he had been tossing all day long under the tingling sun but all he managed to say was indianas gods country aint it andy oh he has so many muttered andrews ahve seen a hailstone measured nine inches around out home honest to gawd ah have must be as good as a barrage ahd like to see any goddam barrage do the damage one of our thunder an lightnin stormsll do shouted chris i guess all the barrage were going to sees grenade practice dont you worry buddy said somebody across the room youll see enough of it this wars going to last damn long ahd lak to get in some licks at those huns tonight honest to gawd ah would andy muttered chris in a low voice he felt his muscles contract with a furious irritation he looked through halfclosed eyes at the men in the room seeing them in distorted white lights and reddish shadows he thought of himself throwing a grenade among a crowd of men then he saw the face of anderson a ponderous white face with eyebrows that met across his nose and a bluish shaved chin where does he stay at andy im going to git him andrews guessed what he meant sit down and have a drink chris he said remember youre going to sleep with the queen of sheba tonight not if i cant git them goddam his voice trailed off into an inaudible muttering of oaths o the oak and the ash and the weeping willow tree o green grows the grass in gods countree somebody sang again chrisfield saw a woman standing beside the table with her back to him collecting the bottles andy was paying her antoinette he said he got to his feet and put his arms round her shoulders with a quick movement of the elbows she pushed him back into his chair she turned round he saw the sallow face and thin breasts of the older sister she looked in his eyes with surprise he was grinning drunkenly as she left the room she made a sign to him with her head to follow her he got up and staggered out the door pulling andrews after him in the inner room was a big bed with curtains where the women slept and the fireplace where they did their cooking it was dark except for the corner where he and andrews stood blinking in the glare of a candle on the table beyond they could only see ruddy shadows and the huge curtained bed with its red coverlet the frenchman somewhere in the dark of the room said something several times avions bochessst they were quiet above them they heard the snoring of aeroplane motors rising and falling like the buzzing of a fly against a window pane they all looked at each other curiously antoinette was leaning against the bed her face expressionless her heavy hair had come undone and fell in smoky gold waves about her shoulders the older woman was giggling come on lets see whats doing chris said andrews they went out into the dark village street to hell with women chris this is the war cried andrews in a loud drunken voice as they reeled arm in arm up the street you bet its the war ahm agoin to beat up chrisfield felt his friends hand clapped over his mouth he let himself go limply feeling himself pushed to the side of the road somewhere in the dark he heard an officers voice say bring those men to me yes sir came another voice slow heavy footsteps came up the road in their direction andrews kept pushing him back along the side of a house until suddenly they both fell sprawling in a manure pit lie still for gods sake muttered andrews throwing an arm over chrisfields chest a thick odor of dry manure filled their nostrils they heard the steps come nearer wander about irresolutely and then go off in the direction from which they had come meanwhile the throb of motors overhead grew louder and louder well came the officers voice couldnt find them sir mumbled the other voice nonsense those men were drunk came the officers voice yes sir came the other voice humbly chrisfield started to giggle he felt he must yell aloud with laughter the nearest motor stopped its singsong roar making the night seem deathly silent andrews jumped to his feet the air was split by a shriek followed by a racking snorting explosion they saw the wall above their pit light up with a red momentary glare chrisfield got to his feet expecting to see flaming ruins the village street was the same as ever there was a little light from the glow the moon still under the horizon gave to the sky a window in the house opposite showed yellow in it was a blue silhouette of an officers cap and uniform a little group stood in the street below what was that the form in the window was shouting in a peremptory voice german aeroplane just dropped a bomb major came a breathless voice in reply why the devil dont he close that window a voice was muttering all the while juss a target for em to aim ata target to aim at any damage done asked the major through the silence the snoring of the motors singsonged ominously overhead like giant mosquitoes i seem to hear more said the major in his drawling voice o yes sir yes sir lots answered an eager voice for gods sake tell him to close the window lieutenant muttered another voice how the hell can i tell him you tell him well all be killed thats all there is about it there are no shelters or dugouts drawled the major from the window thats headquarters fault theres the cellar cried the eager voice again oh said the major three snorting explosions in quick succession drowned everything in a red glare the street was suddenly filled with a scuttle of villagers running to shelter say andy they may have a roll call said chrisfield wed better cut for home across country said andrews they climbed cautiously out of their manure pit chrisfield was surprised to find that he was trembling his hands were cold it was with difficulty he kept his teeth from chattering god well stink for a week lets git out muttered chrisfield o this goddam village they ran out through an orchard broke through a hedge and climbed up the hill across the open fields down the main road an antiaircraft gun had started barking and the sky sparkled with exploding shrapnel the put put put of a machine gun had begun somewhere chrisfield strode up the hill in step with his friend behind them bomb followed bomb and above them the air seemed full of exploding shrapnel and droning planes the cognac still throbbed a little in their blood they stumbled against each other now and then as they walked from the top of the hill they turned and looked back chrisfield felt a tremendous elation thumping stronger than the cognac through his veins unconsciously he put his arm round his friends shoulders they seemed the only live things in a reeling world below in the valley a house was burning brightly from all directions came the yelp of antiaircraft guns and overhead unperturbed continued the leisurely singsong of the motors suddenly chrisfield burst out laughing by god ah always have fun when ahm out with you andy he said they turned and hurried down the other slope of the hill towards the farms where they were quartered ii as far as he could see in every direction were the grey trunks of beeches bright green with moss on one side the ground was thick with last years leaves that rustled maddeningly with every step in front of him his eyes followed other patches of olivedrab moving among the tree trunks overhead through the mottled light and dark green of the leaves he could see now and then a patch of heavy grey sky greyer than the silvery trunks that moved about him in every direction as he walked he strained his eyes down each alley until they were dazzled by the reiteration of mottled grey and green now and then the rustling stopped ahead of him and the olivedrab patches were still then above the clamour of the blood in his ears he could hear batteries pong pong pong in the distance and the woods ringing with a sound like hail as a heavy shell hurtled above the tree tops to end in a dull rumble miles away chrisfield was soaked with sweat but he could not feel his arms or legs every sense was concentrated in eyes and ears and in the consciousness of his gun time and again he pictured himself taking sight at something grey that moved and firing his forefinger itched to press the trigger he would take aim very carefully he told himself he pictured a dab of grey starting up from behind a grey tree trunk and the sharp detonation of his rifle and the dab of grey rolling among the last years leaves a branch carried his helmet off his head so that it rolled at his feet and bounced with a faint metallic sound against the root of a tree he was blinded by the sudden terror that seized him his heart seemed to roll from side to side in his chest he stood stiff as if paralyzed for a moment before he could stoop and pick the helmet up there was a curious taste of blood in his mouth ahll pay em fer that he muttered between clenched teeth his fingers were still trembling when he stooped to pick up the helmet which he put on again very carefully fastening it with the strap under his chin furious anger had taken hold of him the olivedrab patches ahead had moved forward again he followed looking eagerly to the right and the left praying he might see something in every direction were the silvery trunk of the beeches each with a vivid green streak on one side with every step the last years russet leaves rustled underfoot maddeningly loud almost out of sight among the moving tree trunks was a log it was not a log it was a bunch of greygreen cloth without thinking chrisfield strode towards it the silver trunks of the beeches circled about him waving jagged arms it was a german lying full length among the leaves chrisfield was furiously happy in the angry pumping of blood through his veins he could see the buttons on the back of the long coat of the german and the red band on his cap he kicked the german he could feel the ribs against his toes through the leather of his boot he kicked again and again with all his might the german rolled over heavily he had no face chrisfield felt the hatred suddenly ebb out of him where the face had been was a spongy mass of purple and yellow and red half of which stuck to the russet leaves when the body rolled over large flies with bright shiny green bodies circled about it in a brown claygrimed hand was a revolver chrisfield felt his spine go cold the german had shot himself he ran off suddenly breathlessly to join the rest of the reconnoitering squad the silent beeches whirled about him waving gnarled boughs above his head the german had shot himself that was why he had no face chrisfield fell into line behind the other men the corporal waited for him see anything he asked not a goddam thing muttered chrisfield almost inaudibly the corporal went off to the head of the line chrisfield was alone again the leaves rustled maddeningly loud underfoot iii chrisfields eyes were fixed on the leaves at the tops of the walnut trees etched like metal against the bright colorless sky edged with flicks and fringes of gold where the sunlight struck them he stood stiff and motionless at attention although there was a sharp pain in his left ankle that seemed swollen enough to burst the worn boot he could feel the presence of men on both sides of him and of men again beyond them it seemed as if the stiff line of men in olivedrab standing at attention waiting endlessly for someone to release them from their erect paralysis must stretch unbroken round the world he let his glance fall to the trampled grass of the field where the regiment was drawn up somewhere behind him he could hear the clinking of spurs at some officers heels then there was the sound of a motor on the road suddenly shut off and there were steps coming down the line of men and a group of officers passed hurriedly with a businesslike stride as if they did nothing else all their lives chrisfield made out eagles on tight khaki shoulders then a single star and a double star above which was a red ear and some grey hair the general passed too soon for him to make out his face chrisfield swore to himself a little because his ankle hurt so his eyes travelled back to the fringe of the trees against the bright sky so this was what he got for those weeks in dugouts for all the times he had thrown himself on his belly in the mud for the bullets he had shot into the unknown at grey specks that moved among the grey mud something was crawling up the middle of his back he wasnt sure if it were a louse or if he were imagining it an order had been shouted automatically he had changed his position to parade rest somewhere far away a little man was walking towards the long drab lines a wind had come up rustling the stiff leaves of the grove of walnut trees the voice squeaked above it but chrisfield could not make out what it said the wind in the trees made a vast rhythmic sound like the churning of water astern of the transport he had come over on gold flicks and olive shadows danced among the indented clusters of leaves as they swayed as if sweeping something away against the bright sky an idea came into chrisfields head suppose the leaves should sweep in broader and broader curves until they should reach the ground and sweep and sweep until all this was swept away all these pains and lice and uniforms and officers with maple leaves or eagles or single stars or double stars or triple stars on their shoulders he had a sudden picture of himself in his old comfortable overalls with his shirt open so that the wind caressed his neck like a girl blowing down it playfully lying on a shuck of hay under the hot indiana sun funny hed thought all that he said to himself before hed known andy hed never have thought of that what had come over him these days the regiment was marching away in columns of fours chrisfields ankle gave him sharp hot pain with every step his tunic was too tight and the sweat tingled on his back all about him were sweating irritated faces the woollen tunics with their high collars were like straightjackets that hot afternoon chrisfield marched with his fists clenched he wanted to fight somebody to run his bayonet into a man as he ran it into the dummy in that everlasting bayonet drill he wanted to strip himself naked to squeeze the wrists of a girl until she screamed his company was marching past another company that was lined up to be dismissed in front of a ruined barn which had a roof that sagged in the middle like an old cows back the sergeant stood in front of them with his arms crossed looking critically at the company that marched past he had a white heavy face and black eyebrows that met over his nose chrisfield stared hard at him as he passed but sergeant anderson did not seem to recognize him it gave him a dull angry feeling as if hed been cut by a friend the company melted suddenly into a group of men unbuttoning their shirts and tunics in front of the little board shanty where they were quartered which had been put up by the french at the time of the marne years before so a man had told andy what are you dreamin about indiana said judkins punching chrisfield jovially in the ribs chrisfield doubled his fists and gave him a smashing blow in the jaw that judkins warded of just in time judkinss face flamed red he swung with a long bent arm what the hell dyou think this is shouted somebody whats he want to hit me for spluttered judkins breathless men had edged in between them lemme git at him shut up you fool said andy drawing chrisfield away the company scattered sullenly some of the men lay down in the long uncut grass in the shade of the ruins of the house one of the walls of which made a wall of the shanty where they lived andrews and chrisfield strolled in silence down the road kicking their feet into the deep dust chrisfield was limping on both sides of the road were fields of ripe wheat golden under the sun in the distance were low green hills fading to blue pale yellow in patches with the ripe grain here and there a thick clump of trees or a screen of poplars broke the flatness of the long smooth hills in the hedgerows were blue cornflowers and poppies in all colors from carmine to orange that danced in the wind on their wiry stalks at the turn in the road they lost the noise of the division and could hear the bees droning in the big dull purple cloverheads and in the gold hearts of the daisies youre a wild man chris what the hell came over you to try an smash poor old judkies jaw he could lick you anyway hes twice as heavy as you are chrisfield walked on in silence god i should think yould have had enough of that sort of thing i should think yould be sick of wanting to hurt people you dont like pain yourself do you andrews spoke in spurts bitterly his eyes on the ground ah think ah sprained ma goddam ankle when ah tumbled off the back o the truck yesterday better go

down in a poppyfield wouldnt you like to do that chris an not wake up till the war was over and you could be a human being again andrews bit into the green seed capsule he held in his hand a milky juice came out its bitteri guess its the opium he said whats that a stuff that makes you go to sleep and have wonderful dreams in china dreams interrupted chrisfield ah had one of them last night dreamed ah saw a feller that had shot hisself that i saw one time reconnoitrin out in the bringy wood what was that nawthin juss a fritzie had shot hisself better than opium said andrews his voice trembling with sudden excitement ah dreamed the flies buzzin round him was aeroplanes remember the last rest village and the major who wouldnt close the window you bet i do they lay down on the grassy bank that sloped from the road to the pond the road was hidden from them by the tall reeds through which the wind lisped softly overhead huge white cumulus clouds piled tier on tier like fantastic galleons in full sail floated changing slowly in a greenish sky the reflection of clouds in the silvery glisten of the ponds surface was broken by clumps of grasses and bits of floating weeds they lay on their backs for some time before they started taking their clothes off looking up at the sky that seemed vast and free like the ocean vaster and freer than the ocean sarge says a delousin machines comin through this way soon we need it chris andrews pulled his clothes off slowly its great to feel the sun and the wind on your body isnt it chris andrews walked towards the pond and lay flat on his belly on the fine soft grass near the edge its great to have your body there isnt it he said in a dreamy voice your skins so soft and supple and nothing in the world has the feel a muscle has gee i dont know what id do without my body chrisfield laughed look how ma ole ankles raised found any cooties yet he said ill try and drown em said andrews chris come away from those stinking uniforms and youll feel like a human being with the sun on your flesh instead of like a lousy soldier hello boys came a highpitched voice unexpectedly a y man with sharp nose and chin had come up behind them hello said chrisfield sullenly limping towards the water want the soap said andrews going to take a swim boys asked the y man then he added in a tone of conviction thats great better come in too said andrews thanks thanks say if you dont mind my suggestion why dont you fellers get under the water you see theres two french girls looking at you from the road the y man giggled faintly they dont mind said andrews soaping himself vigorously ah reckon they lahk it said chrisfield i know they havent any morals but still and why should they not look at us maybe there wont be many people who get a chance what do you mean have you ever seen what a little splinter of a shell does to a fellers body asked andrews savagely he splashed into the shallow water and swam towards the middle of the pond ye might ask em to come down and help us pick the cooties off said chrisfield and followed in andrewss wake in the middle he lay on a sand bank in the warm shallow water and looked back at the y man who still stood on the bank behind him were other men undressing and soon the grassy slope was filled with naked men and yellowish grey underclothes and many dark heads and gleaming backs were bobbing up and down in the water when he came out he found andrews sitting crosslegged near his clothes he reached for his shirt and drew it on him god i cant make up my mind to put the damn thing on again said andrews in a low voice almost as if he were talking to himself i feel so clean and free its like voluntarily taking up filth and slavery again i think ill just walk off naked across the fields dyou call serving your country slavery my friend the y man who had been roaming among the bathers his neat uniform and wellpolished boots and puttees contrasting strangely with the mudclotted sweatsoaked clothing of the men about him sat down on the grass beside andrews youre goddam right i do youll get into trouble my boy if you talk that way said the y man in a cautious voice well what is your definition of slavery you must remember that you are a voluntary worker in the cause of democracy youre doing this so that your children will be able to live peaceful ever shot a man no no of course not but id have enlisted really i would only my eyes are weak i guess so said andrews under his breath remember that your women folks your sisters and sweethearts and mothers are praying for you at this instant i wish somebodyd pray me into a clean shirt said andrews starting to get into his clothes how long have you been over here just three months the mans sallow face with its pinched nose and chin lit up but boys those three months have been worth all the other years of my min he caught himself life ive heard the great heart of america beat o boys never forget that you are in a great christian undertaking come on chris lets beat it they left the y man wandering among the men along the bank of the pond to which the reflection of the greenish silvery sky and the great piled white clouds gave all the free immensity of space from the road they could still hear his high pitched voice and thats whatll survive you and me said andrews say andy you sure can talk to them guys said chris admiringly whats the use of talking god theres a bit of honeysuckle still in bloom doesnt that smell like home to you chris say how much do they pay those y men andy damned if i know they were just in time to fall into line for mess in the line everyone was talking and laughing enlivened by the smell of food and the tinkle of messkits near the field kitchen chrisfield saw sergeant anderson talking with higgins his own sergeant they were laughing together and he heard andersons big voice saying jovially weve pulled through this time higgins i guess we will again the two sergeants looked at each other and cast a paternal condescending glance over their men and laughed aloud chrisfield felt powerless as an ox under the yoke all he could do was work and strain and stand at attention while that whitefaced anderson could lounge about as if he owned the earth and laugh importantly like that he held out his plate the kp splashed the meat and gravy into it he leaned against the tarpapered wall of the shack eating his food and looking sullenly over at the two sergeants who laughed and talked with an air of leisure while the men of their two companies ate hurriedly as dogs all round them chrisfield glanced suddenly at anderson who sat in the grass at the back of the house looking out over the wheat fields while the smoke of a cigarette rose in spirals about his face and his fair hair he looked peaceful almost happy chrisfield clenched his fists and felt the hatred of that other man rising stingingly within him guess ah got a bit of the devil in me he thought the windows were so near the grass that the faint light had a greenish color in the shack where the company was quartered it gave mens faces tanned as they were the sickly look of people who work in offices when they lay on their blankets in the bunks made of chicken wire stretched across mouldy scantlings swallows had made their nests in the peak of the roof and their droppings made white dobs and blotches on the floorboards in the alley between the bunks where a few patches of yellow grass had not yet been completely crushed away by footsteps now that the shack was empty chrisfield could hear plainly the peeppeep of the little swallows in their mud nests he sat quiet on the end of one of the bunks looking out of the open door at the blue shadows that were beginning to lengthen on the grass of the meadow behind his hands that had got to be the color of terra cotta hung idly between his legs he was whistling faintly his eyes in their long black eyelashes were fixed on the distance though he was not thinking he felt a comfortable unexpressed wellbeing all over him it was pleasant to be alone in the barracks like this when the other men were out at grenade practice there was no chance of anyone shouting orders at him a warm drowsiness came over him from the field kitchen alongside came the voice of a man singing o my girls a lulu every inch a lulu is lulu that pretty lil girl o miine in their mud nests the young swallows twittered faintly overhead now and then there was a beat of wings and a big swallow skimmed into the shack chrisfields cheeks began to feel very softly flushed his head drooped over on his chest outside the cook was singing over and over again in a low voice amid a faint clatter of pans o my girls a lulu every inch a lulu is lulu that pretty lil girl o miine chrisfield fell asleep he woke up with a start the shack was almost dark a tall man stood out black against the bright oblong of the door what are you doing here said a deep snarling voice chrisfields eyes blinked automatically he got to his feet it might be an officer his eyes focussed suddenly it was andersons face that was between him and the light in the greenish obscurity the skin looked chalkwhite in contrast to the heavy eyebrows that met over the nose and the dark stubble on the chin how is it you aint out with the company ahm barracks guard muttered chrisfield he could feel the blood beating in his wrists and temples stinging his eyes like fire he was staring at the floor in front of andersons feet orders was all the companies was to go out an not leave any guard ah well see about that when sergeant higgins comes in is this place tidy you say ahm a goddamed liar do ye chrisfield felt suddenly cool and joyous he felt anger taking possession of him he seemed to be standing somewhere away from himself watching himself get angry this place has got to be cleaned up that damn general may come back to look over quarters went on anderson coolly you call me a goddam liar said chrisfield again putting as much insolence as he could summon into his voice ah guess you doan remember me yes i know youre the guy tried to run a knife into me once said anderson coolly squaring his shoulders i guess youve learned a little discipline by this time anyhow youve got to clean this place up god they havent even brushed the birds nests down must be some company said anderson with a half laugh ah aint agoin to neither fur you look here you do it or itll be the worse for you shouted the sergeant in his deep rasping voice if ever ah gits out o the army ahm goin to shoot you youve picked on me enough chrisfield spoke slowly as coolly as anderson well well see what a courtmartial has to say to that ah doan give a hoot in hell what ye do sergeant anderson turned on his heel and went out twisting the corner button of his tunic in his big fingers already the sound of tramping feet was heard and the shouted order dismissed then men crowded into the shack laughing and talking chrisfield sat still on the end of the bunk looking at the bright oblong of the door outside he saw anderson talking to sergeant higgins they shook hands and anderson disappeared chrisfield heard sergeant higgins call after him i guess the next time i see you ill have to put my heels together an salute andersens booming laugh faded as he walked away sergeant higgins came into the shack and walked straight up to chrisfield saying in a hard official voice youre under arrest small guard this man get your gun and cartridge belt ill relieve you so you can get mess he went out everyones eyes were turned curiously on chrisfield small a redfaced man with a long nose that hung down over his upper lip shuffled sheepishly over to his place beside chrisfields cot and let the butt of his rifle come down with a bang on the floor somebody laughed andrews walked up to them a look of trouble in his blue eyes and in the lines of his lean tanned cheeks whats the matter chris he asked in a low voice tol that bastard ah didnt give a hoot in hell what he did said chrisfield in a broken voice say andy i dont think i ought ter let anybody talk to him said small in an apologetic tone i dont see why sarge always gives me all his dirty work andrews walked off without replying never mind chris they wont do nothin to ye said jenkins grinning at him goodnaturedly from the door ah doan give a hoot in hell what they do said chrisfield again he lay back in his bunk and looked at the ceiling the barracks was full of a bustle of cleaning up judkins was sweeping the floor with a broom made of dry sticks another man was knocking down the swallows nests with a bayonet the mud nests crumbled and fell on the floor and the bunks filling the air with a flutter of feathers and a smell of birdlime the little naked bodies with their orange bills too big for them gave a soft plump when they hit the boards of the floor where they lay giving faint gasping squeaks meanwhile with shrill little cries the big swallows flew back and forth in the shanty now and then striking the low roof say pick em up cant yer said small judkins was sweeping the little gasping bodies out among the dust and dirt a stoutish man stooped and picked the little birds up one by one puckering his lips into an expression of tenderness he made his two hands into a nestshaped hollow out of which stretched the long necks and the gaping orange mouths andrews ran into him at the door hello dad he said what the hell i just picked these up so they couldnt let the poor little devils stay there god it looks to me as if they went out of their way to give pain to everything bird beast or man war aint no picnic said judkins well god damn it isnt that a reason for not going out of your way to raise more hell with peoples feelings than you have to a face with peaked chin and nose on which was stretched a parchmentcolored skin appeared in the door hello boys said the y man i just thought id tell you im going to open the canteen tomorrow in the last shack on the beaucourt road therell be chocolate ciggies soap and everything everybody cheered the y man beamed his eye lit on the little birds in dads hands how could you he said an american soldier being deliberately cruel i would never have believed it yeve got somethin to learn muttered dad waddling out into the twilight on his bandy legs chrisfield had been watching the scene at the door with unseeing eyes a terrified nervousness that he tried to beat off had come over him it was useless to repeat to himself again and again that he didnt give a damn the prospect of being brought up alone before all those officers of being crossquestioned by those curt voices frightened him he would rather have been lashed whatever was he to say he kept asking himself he would get mixed up or say things he didnt mean to or else he wouldnt be able to get a word out at all if only andy could go up with him andy was educated like the officers were he had more learning than the whole shootingmatch put together hed be able to defend himself and defend his friends too if only theyd let him i felt just like those little birds that time they got the bead on our trench at boticourt said jenkins laughing chrisfield listened to the talk about him as if from another world already he was cut off from his outfit hed disappear and theyd never know or care what became of him the messcall blew and the men filed out he could hear their talk outside and the sound of their messkits as they opened them he lay on his bunk staring up into the dark a faint blue light still came from outside giving a curious purple color to smalls red face and long drooping nose at the end of which hung a glistening drop of moisture chrisfield found andrews washing a shirt in the brook that flowed through the ruins of the village the other side of the road from the buildings where the division was quartered the blue sky flicked with pinkishwhite clouds gave a shimmer of blue and lavender and white to the bright water at the bottom could be seen battered helmets and bits of equipment and tin cans that had once held meat andrews turned his head he had a smudge of mud down his nose and soapsuds on his chin hello chris he said looking him in the eyes with his sparkling blue eyes hows things there was a faint anxious frown on his forehead twothirds of one months pay an confined to quarters said chrisfield cheerfully gee they were easy umhum said ah was a good shot an all that so theyd let me off this time andrews started scrubbing at his shirt again ive got this shirt so full of mud i dont think i ever will get it clean he said move ye ole hide away andy ahll wash it you aint no good for nothin hell no ill do it move ye hide out of there thanks awfully andrews got to his feet and wiped the mud off his nose with his bare forearm ahm goin to shoot that bastard said chrisfield scrubbing at the shirt dont be an ass chris ah swear to god ah am whats the use of getting all wrought up the things over youll probably never see him again ah aint all het up ahm goin to do it though he wrung the shirt out carefully and flipped andrews in the face with it there ye are he said youre a good fellow chris even if you are an ass tell me were going into the line in a day or two theres been a devil of a lot of artillery going up the road french british every old kind tell me theys raisin hell in the oregon forest they walked slowly across the road a motorcycle despatchrider whizzed past them its them guys has the fun said chrisfield i dont believe anybody has much what about the officers theyre too busy feeling important to have a real hell of a time the hard cold rain beat like a lash in his face there was no light anywhere and no sound but the hiss of the rain in the grass his eyes strained to see through the dark until red and yellow blotches danced before them he walked very slowly and carefully holding something very gently in his hand under his raincoat he felt himself full of a strange subdued fury he seemed to be walking behind himself spying on his own actions and what he saw made him feel joyously happy made him want to sing he turned so that the rain beat against his cheek under his helmet he felt his hair full of sweat that ran with the rain down his glowing face his fingers clutched very carefully the smooth stick he had in his hand he stopped and shut his eyes for a moment through the hiss of the rain he had heard a sound of men talking in one of the shanties when he shut his eyes he saw the white face of anderson before him with its unshaven chin and the eyebrows that met across the nose suddenly he felt the wall of a house in front of him he put out his hand his hand jerked back from the rough wet feel of the tar paper as if it had touched something dead he groped along the wall stepping very cautiously he felt as he had felt reconnoitering in the bringy wood phrases came to his mind as they had then without thinking what they meant the words make the world safe for democracy formed themselves in his head they were very comforting they occupied his thoughts he said them to himself again and again meanwhile his free hand was fumbling very carefully with the fastening that held the wooden shutter over a window the shutter opened a very little creaking loudly louder than the patter of rain on the roof of the shack a stream of water from the roof was pouring into his face suddenly a beam of light transformed everything cutting the darkness in two the rain glittered like a bead curtain chrisfield was looking into a little room where a lamp was burning at a table covered with printed blanks of different size sat a corporal behind him was a bunk and a pile of equipment the corporal was reading a magazine chrisfield looked at him a long time his fingers were tight about the smooth stick there was no one else in the room a sort of panic seized chrisfield he strode away noisily from the window and pushed open the door of the shack wheres sergeant anderson he asked in a breathless voice of the first man he saw corps there if its anything important said the man andersons gone to an o t c left day before yesterday chrisfield was out in the rain again it was beating straight in his face so that his eyes were full of water he was trembling he had suddenly become terrified the smooth stick he held seemed to burn him he was straining his ears for an explosion walking straight before him down the road he went faster and faster as if trying to escape from it he stumbled on a pile of stones automatically he pulled the string out of the grenade and threw it far from him there was a minutes pause red flame spurted in the middle of the wheatfield he felt the sharp crash in his eardrums he walked fast through the rain behind him at the door of the shack he could hear excited voices he walked recklessly on the rain blinding him when he finally stepped into the light he was so dazzled he could not see who was in the wine shop well ill be damned chris said andrewss voice chrisfield blinked the rain out of his lashes andrews sat writing with a pile of papers before him and a bottle of champagne it seemed to chrisfield to soothe his nerves to hear andys voice he wished he would go on talking a long time without a pause if you arent the crowning idiot of the ages andrews went on in a low voice he took chrisfield by the arm and led him into the little back room where was a high bed with a brown coverlet and a big kitchen table on which were the remnants of a meal whats the matter your arms trembling like the devil but why o pardon crimpette cest un ami you know crimpette dont you he pointed to a youngish woman who had just appeared from behind the bed she had a flabby rosy face and violet circles under her eyes dark as if theyd been made by blows and untidy hair a dirty grey muslin dress with half the hooks off held in badly her large breasts and flabby figure chrisfield looked at her greedily feeling his furious irritation flame into one desire whats the matter with you chris youre crazy to break out of quarters this way say andy git out o here ah aint your sort anyway git out o here youre a wild man ill grant you that but id just as soon be your sort as anyone elses have a drink not now andrews sat down with his bottle and his papers pushing away the broken plates full of stale food to make a place on the greasy table he took a gulp out of the bottle that made him cough then put the end of his pencil in his mouth and stared gravely at the paper no im your sort chris he said over his shoulder only theyve tamed me o god how tame i am chrisfield did not listen to what he was saying he stood in front of the woman staring in her face she looked at him in a stupid frightened way he felt in his pockets for some money as he had just been paid he had a fiftyfranc note he spread it out carefully before her her eyes glistened the pupils seemed to grow smaller as they fastened on the bit of daintily colored paper he crumpled it up suddenly in his fist and shoved it down between her breasts some time later chrisfield sat down in front of andrews he still had his wet slicker on ah guess you think ahm a swine he said in his normal voice ah guess youre about right no i dont said andrews something made him put his hand on chrisfields hand that lay on the table it had a feeling of cool health say why were you trembling so when you came in here you seem all right now oh ah dunno said chrisfield in a soft resonant voice they were silent for a long while they could hear the womans footsteps going and coming behind them lets go home said chrisfield all right bonsoir crimpette outside the rain had stopped a stormy wind had torn the clouds to rags here and there clusters of stars showed through they splashed merrily through the puddles but here and there reflected a patch of stars when the wind was not ruffling them christ ah wish ah was like you andy said chrisfield you dont want to be like me chris im no sort of a person at all im tame o you dont know how damn tame i am learnin sure do help a feller to git along in the world yes but whats the use of getting along if you havent any world to get along in chris i belong to a crowd that just fakes learning i guess the best thing that can happen to us is to get killed in this butchery were a tame generation its you that it matters to kill ah aint no good for anythin ah doan give a damn lawsee ah feel sleepy as they slipped in the door of their quarters the sergeant looked at chrisfield searchingly andrews spoke up at once theres some rumors going on at the latrine sarge the fellows from the thirtysecond say were going to march into hells halfacre about thursday a lot they know about it thats the latest edition of the latrine news the hell it is well dyou want to know something andrews itll be before thursday or im a dutchman sergeant higgins put on a great air of mystery chrisfield went to his bunk undressed quietly and climbed into his blankets he stretched his arms languidly a couple of times and while andrews was still talking to the sergeant fell asleep iv the moon lay among clouds on the horizon like a big red pumpkin among its leaves chrisfield squinted at it through the boughs of the apple trees laden with apples that gave a winey fragrance to the crisp air he was sitting on the ground his legs stretched limply before him leaning against the rough trunk of an apple tree opposite him leaning against another tree was the square form surmounted by a large longjawed face of judkins between them lay two empty cognac bottles all about them was the rustling orchard with its crooked twigs that made a crackling sound rubbing together in the gusts of the autumn wind that came heavy with a smell of damp woods and of rotting fruits and of all the ferment of the overripe fields chrisfield felt it stirring the moist hair on his forehead and through the buzzing haze of the cognac heard the plunk plunk plunk of apples dropping that followed each gust and the twanging of night insects and far in the distance the endless rumble of guns like tomtoms beaten for a dance ye heard what the colonel said didnt ye said judkins in a voice hoarse from too much drink chrisfield belched and nodded his head vaguely he remembered andrewss white fury after the men had been dismissed how he had sat down on the end of a log by the field kitchen staring at the patch of earth he beat into mud with the toe of his boot then went on judkins trying to imitate the colonels solemn efficient voice on the subject of prisoners he hiccoughed and made a limp gesture with his hand on the subject of prisoners well ill leave that to you but juss rememberjuss remember what the huns did to belgium an i might add that we have barely enough emergency rations as it is and the more prisoners you have the less you fellersll git to eat thats what he said judkie thats what he said an the more prisoners ye have the less yousell git to eat chanted judkins making a triumphal flourish with his hand chrisfield groped for the cognac bottle it was empty he waved it in the air a minute and then threw it into the tree opposite him a shower of little apples fell about judkinss head he got unsteadily to his feet i tell you fellers he said war aint no picnic chrisfield stood up and grabbed at an apple his teeth crunched into it sweet he said sweet nauthin mumbled judkins war aint no picnic i tell you buddy if you take any prisoners he hiccoughed after what the colonel said ill lick the spots out of you by god i will rip up their guts thats all like they was dummies rip up their guts his voice suddenly changed to one of childish dismay gee chris im going to be sick he whispered look out said chrisfield pushing him away judkins leaned against a tree and vomited the full moon had risen above the clouds and filled the apple orchard with chilly golden light that cast a fantastic shadow pattern of interlaced twigs and branches upon the bare ground littered with apples the sound of the guns had grown nearer there were loud eager rumbles as of bowls being rolled very hard on a bowling alley combined with a continuous roar like sheets of iron being shaken ah bet its hell out there said chrisfield i feel better said judkins lets go get some more cognac ahm hungry said chrisfield lets go an get that ole woman to cook us some aigs too damn late growled judkins how the hell late is it dunno i sold my watch they were walking at random through the orchard they came to a field full of big pumpkins that gleamed in the moonlight and cast shadows black as holes in the distance they could see wooded hills chrisfield picked up a mediumsized pumpkin and threw it as hard as he could into the air it split into three when it landed with a thud on the ground and the moist yellow seeds spilled out some strong man you are said judkins tossing up a bigger one say theres a farmhouse maybe we could get some aigs from the henroost hell of a lot of hens at that moment the crowing of a rooster came across the silent fields they ran towards the dark farm buildings look out there may be officers quartered there they walked cautiously round the square silent group of buildings there were no lights the big wooden door of the court pushed open easily without creaking on the roof of the barn the pigeoncot was etched dark against the disc of the moon a warm smell of stables blew in their faces as the two men tiptoed into the manurelittered farmyard under one of the sheds they found a table on which a great many pears were set to ripen chrisfield put his teeth into one the rich sweet juice ran down his chin he ate the pear quickly and greedily and then bit into another fill yer pockets with em whispered judkins they might ketch us ketch us hell well be goin into the offensive in a day or two ah sure would like to git some aigs chrisfield pushed open the door of one of the barns a smell of creamy milk and cheeses filled his nostrils come here he whispered want some cheese a lot of cheeses ranged on a board shone silver in the moonlight that came in through the open door hell no aint fit te eat said judkins pushing his heavy fist into one of the new soft cheeses doan do that well aint we saved em from the huns but hell war aint no picnic thats all said judkins in the next door they found chickens roosting in a small room with straw on the floor the chickens ruffled their feathers and made a muffled squeaking as they slept suddenly there was a loud squawking and all the chickens were cackling with terror beat it muttered judkins running for the gate of the farmyard there were shrill cries of women in the house a voice shrieking cest les boches cest les boches rose above the cackling of chickens and the clamor of guineahens as they ran they heard the rasping cries of a woman in hysterics rending the rustling autumn night god damn said judkins breathless they aint got no right those frogs aint to carry on like that they ducked into the orchard again above the squawking of the chicken judkins still held swinging it by its legs chrisfield could hear the womans voice shrieking judkins dexterously wrung the chickens neck crushing the apples underfoot they strode fast through the orchard the voice faded into the distance until it could not be heard above the sound of the guns gee ahm kind o cut up bout that lady said chrisfield well aint we saved her from the huns andy dont think so well if you want to know what i think about that guy andy i dont think much of him i think hes yaller thats all said judkins no he aint i heard the lootenant say so hes a goddam yeller

hell wed better leave it here judkins swung the chicken by its neck round his head and threw it as hard as he could into the bushes they were walking along the road between chestnut trees that led to their village it was dark except for irregular patches of bright moonlight in the centre that lay white as milk among the indentated shadows of the leaves all about them rose a cool scent of woods of ripe fruits and of decaying leaves of the ferment of the autumn countryside the lieutenant sat at a table in the sun in the village street outside the company office in front of him sparkled piles of money and daintily tinted banknotes beside him stood sergeant higgins with an air of solemnity and the second sergeant and the corporal the men stood in line and as each came before the table he saluted with deference received his money and walked away with a selfconscious air a few villagers looked on from the small windows with grey frames of their rambling whitewashed houses in the ruddy sunshine the line of men cast an irregular blueviolet shadow like a gigantic centipede on the yellow gravel road from the table by the window of the cafe of nos braves poilus where small and judkins and chrisfield had established themselves with their pay crisp in their pockets they could see the little front garden of the house across the road where behind a hedge of orange marigolds andrews sat on the doorstep talking to an old woman hunched on a low chair in the sun just inside the door who leant her small white head over towards his yellow one there ye are said judkins in a solemn tone he dont even go after his pay that guy thinks hes the whole show he does chrisfield flushed but said nothing he dont do nothing all day long but talk to that ole lady said small with a grin guess she reminds him of his mother or somethin he always does go round with the frogs all he can looks to me like hed rather have a drink with a frog than with an american reckon he wants to learn their language said small he wont never come to much in this army thats what im telling yer said judkins the little houses across the way had flushed red with the sunset andrews got to his feet slowly and languidly and held out his hand to the old woman she stood up a small tottering figure in a black silk shawl he leaned over towards her and she kissed both his cheeks vigorously several times he walked down the road towards the billets with his fatigue cap in his hand looking at the ground hes got a flower behind his ear like a cigarette said judkins with a disgusted snort well i guess wed better go said small we got to be in quarters at six they were silent a moment in the distance the guns kept up a continual tomtom sound guess well be in that soon said small chrisfield felt a chill go down his spine he moistened his lips with his tongue guess its hell out there said judkins war aint no picnic ah doan give a hoot in hell said chrisfield the men were lined up in the village street with their packs on waiting for the order to move thin wreaths of white mist still lingered in the trees and over the little garden plots the sun had not yet risen but ranks of clouds in the pale blue sky overhead were brilliant with crimson and gold the men stood in an irregular line bent over a little by the weight of their equipment moving back and forth stamping their feet and beating their arms together their noses and ears red from the chill of the morning the haze of their breath rose above their heads down the misty road a drabcolored limousine appeared running slowly it stopped in front of the line of men the lieutenant came hurriedly out of the house opposite drawing on a pair of gloves the men standing in line looked curiously at the limousine they could see that two of the tires were flat and that the glass was broken there were scratches on the drab paint and in the door three long jagged holes that obliterated the number a little murmur went down the line of men the door opened with difficulty and a major in a light buffcolored coat stumbled out one arm wrapped in bloody bandages was held in a sling made of a handkerchief his face was white and drawn into a stiff mask with pain the lieutenant saluted for gods sake wheres a repair station he asked in a loud shaky voice theres none in this village major where the hell is there one i dont know said the lieutenant in a humble tone why the hell dont you know this organizations rotten no good major stanleys just been killed what the hells the name of this village thiocourt where the hells that the chauffeur had leaned out he had no cap and his hair was full of dust you see lootenant we wants to get to chalons yes thats it chalons surchalonssurmarne said the major the billeting officer has a map said the lieutenant last house to the left o lets go there quick said the major he fumbled with the fastening of the door the lieutenant opened it for him as he opened the door the men nearest had a glimpse of the interior of the car on the far side was a long object huddled in blankets propped up on the seat before he got in the major leaned over and pulled a woollen rug out holding it away from him with his one good arm the car moved off slowly and all down the village street the men lined up waiting for orders stared curiously at the three jagged holes in the door the lieutenant looked at the rug that lay in the middle of the road he touched it with his foot it was soaked with blood that in places had dried into clots the lieutenant and the men of his company looked at it in silence the sun had risen and shone on the roofs of the little whitewashed houses behind them far down the road a regiment had begun to move v at the brow of the hill they rested chrisfield sat on the red clay bank and looked about him his rifle between his knees in front of him on the side of the road was a french burying ground where the little wooden crosses tilting in every direction stood up against the sky and the bead wreaths glistened in the warm sunlight all down the road as far as he could see was a long drab worm broken in places by strings of motor trucks a drab worm that wriggled down the slope through the roofless shell of the village and up into the shattered woods on the crest of the next hills chrisfield strained his eyes to see the hills beyond they lay blue and very peaceful in the moon mist the river glittered about the piers of the wrecked stone bridge and disappeared between rows of yellow poplars somewhere in the valley a big gun fired the shell shrieked into the distance towards the blue peaceful hills chrisfields regiment was moving again the men their feet slipping in the clayey mud went downhill with long strides the straps of their packs tugging at their shoulders isnt this great country said andrews who marched beside him ahd liever be at an o t c like that bastard anderson oh to hell with that said andrews he still had a big faded orange marigold in one of the buttonholes of his soiled tunic he walked with his nose in the air and his nostrils dilated enjoying the tang of the autumnal sunlight chrisfield took the cigarette that had gone out halfsmoked from his mouth and spat savagely at the heels of the man in front of him this aint no life for a white man he said id rather be this thanthan that said andrews bitterly he tossed his head in the direction of a staff car full of officers that was stalled at the side of the road they were drinking something out of a thermos bottle that they passed round with the air of sunday excursionists they waved with a conscious relaxation of discipline at the men as they passed one a little lieutenant with a black mustache with pointed ends kept crying theyre running like rabbits fellers theyre running like rabbits a wavering halfcheer would come from the column now and then where it was passing the staff car the big gun fired again chrisfield was near it this time and felt the concussion like a blow in the head some baby said the man behind him someone was singing good morning mister zip zip zip with your hair cut just as short as with your hair cut just as short as with your hair cut just as short as miine everybody took it up their steps rang in rhythm in the paved street that zigzagged among the smashed houses of the village ambulances passed them big trucks full of huddled men with grey faces from which came a smell of sweat and blood and carbolic somebody went on o ashes to ashes an dust to dust can that cried judkins it aint lucky but everybody had taken up the song chrisfield noticed that andrewss eyes were sparkling if he aint the damnedest he thought to himself but he shouted at the top of his lungs with the rest o ashes to ashes an dust to dust if the gasbombs dont get yer the eightyeights must they were climbing the hill again the road was worn into deep ruts and there were many shell holes full of muddy water into which their feet slipped the woods began a shattered skeleton of woods full of old artillery emplacements and dugouts where torn camouflage fluttered from splintered trees the ground and the road were littered with tin cans and brass shellcases along both sides of the road the trees were festooned as with creepers with strand upon strand of telephone wire when next they stopped chrisfield was on the crest of the hill beside a battery of french seventyfives he looked curiously at the frenchmen who sat about on logs in their pink and blue shirtsleeves playing cards and smoking their gestures irritated him say tell em were advancin he said to andrews are we said andrews all right ditesdonc les boches courentils comme des lapins he shouted one of the men turned his head and laughed he says theyve been running that way for four years said andrews he slipped his pack off sat down on it and fished for a cigarette chrisfield took off his helmet and rubbed a muddy hand through his hair he took a bite of chewing tobacco and sat with his hands clasped over his knees how the hell long are we going to wait this time he muttered the shadows of the tangled and splintered trees crept slowly across the road the french artillerymen were eating their supper a long train of motor trucks growled past splashing mud over the men crowded along the sides of the road the sun set and a lot of batteries down in the valley began firing making it impossible to talk the air was full of a shrieking and droning of shells overhead the frenchmen stretched and yawned and went down into their dugout chrisfield watched them enviously the stars were beginning to come out in the green sky behind the tall lacerated trees chrisfields legs ached with cold he began to get crazily anxious for something to happen for something to happen but the column waited without moving through the gathering darkness chrisfield chewed steadily trying to think of nothing but the taste of the tobacco in his mouth the column was moving again as they reached the brow of another hill chrisfield felt a curious sweetish smell that made his nostrils smart gas he thought full of panic and put his hand to the mask that hung round his neck but he did not want to be the first to put it on no order came he marched on cursing the sergeant and the lieutenant but maybe theyd been killed by it he had a vision of the whole regiment sinking down in the road suddenly overcome by the gas smell anythin andy he whispered cautiously i can smell a combination of dead horses and tube roses and banana oil and the ice cream we used to have at college and dead rats in the garret but what the hell do we care now said andrews giggling this is the damnedest fool business ever hes crazy muttered chrisfield to himself he looked at the stars in the black sky that seemed to be going along with the column on its march or was it that they and the stars were standing still while the trees moved away from them waving their skinny shattered arms he could hardly hear the tramp of feet on the road so loud was the pandemonium of the guns ahead and behind every now and then a rocket would burst in front of them and its red and green lights would mingle for a moment with the stars but it was only overhead he could see the stars everywhere else white and red glows rose and fell as if the horizon were on fire as they started down the slope the trees suddenly broke away and they saw the valley between them full of the glare of guns and the white light of star shells it was like looking into a stove full of glowing embers the hillside that sloped away from them was full of crashing detonations and yellow tongues of flame in a battery near the road that seemed to crush their skulls each time a gun fired they could see the dark forms of the artillerymen silhouetted in fantastic attitudes against the intermittent red glare stunned and blinded they kept on marching down the road it seemed to chrisfield that they were going to step any minute into the flaring muzzle of a gun at the foot of the hill beside a little grove of uninjured trees they stopped again a new train of trucks was crawling past them huge blots in the darkness there were no batteries near so they could hear the grinding roar of the gears as the trucks went along the uneven road plunging in and out of shellholes chrisfield lay down in the dry ditch full of bracken and dozed with his head on his pack all about him were stretched other men someone was resting his head on chrisfields thigh the noise had subsided a little through his doze he could hear mens voices talking in low crushed tones as if they were afraid of speaking aloud on the road the truckdrivers kept calling out to each other shrilly raspingly the motors stopped running one after another making almost a silence during which chrisfield fell asleep something woke him he was stiff with cold and terrified for a moment he thought he had been left alone that the company had gone on for there was no one touching him overhead was a droning as of gigantic mosquitoes growing fast to a loud throbbing he heard the lieutenants voice calling shrilly sergeant higgins sergeant higgins the lieutenant stood out suddenly black against a sheet of flame chrisfield could see his fatigue cap a little on one side and his trench coat drawn in tight at the waist and sticking out stiffly at the knees he was shaken by the explosion everything was black again chrisfield got to his feet his ears ringing the column was moving on he heard moaning near him in the darkness the tramp of feet and jingle of equipment drowned all other sound he could feel his shoulders becoming raw under the tugging of the pack now and then the flare from aeroplane bombs behind him showed up wrecked trucks on the side of the road somewhere a machine gun spluttered but the column tramped on weighed down by the packs by the deadening exhaustion the turbulent flaring darkness was calming to the grey of dawn when chrisfield stopped marching his eyelids stung as if his eyeballs were flaming hot he could not feel his feet and legs the guns continued incessantly like a hammer beating on his head he was walking very slowly in a single file now and then stumbling against the man ahead of him there was earth on both sides of him clay walls that dripped moisture all at once he stumbled down some steps into a dugout where it was pitchblack an unfamiliar smell struck him made him uneasy but his thoughts seemed to reach him from out of a great distance he groped to the wall his knees struck against a bunk with blankets in it in another second he was sunk fathoms deep in sleep when he woke up his mind was very clear the roof of the dugout was of logs a bright spot far away was the door he hoped desperately that he wasnt on duty he wondered where andy was then he remembered that andy was crazy a yeller dawg judkins had called him sitting up with difficulty he undid his shoes and puttees wrapped himself in his blanket all round him were snores and the deep breathing of exhausted sleep he closed his eyes he was being courtmartialled he stood with his hands at his sides before three officers at a table all three had the same white faces with heavy blue jaws and eyebrows that met above the nose they were reading things out of papers aloud but although he strained his ears he couldnt make out what they were saying all he could hear was a faint moaning something had a curious unfamiliar smell that troubled him he could not stand still at attention although the angry eyes of officers stared at him from all round anderson sergeant anderson whats that smell he kept asking in a small whining voice please tell a feller what that smell is but the three officers at the table kept reading from their papers and the moaning grew louder and louder in his ears until he shrieked aloud there was a grenade in his hand he pulled the string out and threw it and he saw the lieutenants trench coat stand out against a sheet of flame someone sprang at him he was wrestling for his life with anderson who turned into a woman with huge flabby breasts he crushed her to him and turned to defend himself against three officers who came at him their trench coats drawn in tightly at the waist until they looked like wasps everything faded he woke up his nostrils were still full of the strange troubling smell he sat on the edge of the bunk wriggling in his clothes for his body crawled with lice gee its funny to be in where the fritzies were not long ago he heard a voice say kiddo were advancin came another voice but hell this aint no kind of an advance i aint seen a german yet ah kin smell em though said chrisfield getting suddenly to his feet sergeant higgins head appeared in the door fall in he shouted then he added in his normal voice its up and at em fellers chrisfield caught his puttee on a clump of briars at the edge of the clearing and stood kicking his leg back and forth to get it free at last he broke away the torn puttee dragging behind him out in the sunlight in the middle of the clearing he saw a man in olivedrab kneeling beside something on the ground a german lay face down with a red hole in his back the man was going through his pockets he looked up into chrisfields face souvenirs he said what outfit are you in buddy rd said the man getting to his feet slowly where the hell are we damned if i know the clearing was empty except for the two americans and the german with the hole in his back in the distance they heard a sound of artillery and nearer the put put put of isolated machine guns the leaves of the trees about them all shades of brown and crimson and yellow danced in the sunlight say that damn money aint no good is it asked chrisfield german money hell no i got a watch thats a peach though the man held out a gold watch looking suspiciously at chrisfield all the while through halfclosed eyes ah saw a feller had a goldhandled sword said chrisfield wheres that back there in the wood he waved his hand vaguely ahve got to find ma outfit comin along chrisfield started towards the other edge of the clearing looks to me all right here said the other man lying down on the grass in the sun the leaves rustled underfoot as chrisfield strode through the wood he was frightened by being alone he walked ahead as fast as he could his puttee still dragging behind him he came to a barbedwire entanglement half embedded in fallen beech leaves it had been partly cut in one place but in crossing he tore his thigh on a barb taking off the torn puttee he wrapped it round the outside of his trousers and kept on walking feeling a little blood trickle down his leg later he came to a lane that cut straight through the wood where there were many ruts through the puttycoloured mud puddles down the lane in a patch of sunlight he saw a figure towards which he hurried it was a young man with red hair and a pinkandwhite face by a gold bar on the collar of his shirt chrisfield saw that he was a lieutenant he had no coat or hat and there was greenish slime all over the front of his clothes as if he had lain on his belly in a mud puddle where you going dunno sir all right come along the lieutenant started walking as fast as he could up the lane swinging his arms wildly seen any machinegun nests not a one hum he followed the lieutenant who walked so fast he had difficulty keeping up splashing recklessly through the puddles wheres the artillery thats what i want to know cried the lieutenant suddenly stopping in his tracks and running a hand through his red hair where the hells the artillery he looked at chrisfield savagely out of green eyes no use advancing without artillery he started walking faster than ever all at once they saw sunlight ahead of them and olivedrab uniforms machine guns started firing all around them in a sudden gust chrisfield found himself running forward across a field full of stubble and sprouting clover among a group of men he did not know the whiplike sound of rifles had chimed in with the stuttering of the machine guns little white clouds sailed above him in a blue sky and in front of him was a group of houses that had the same color white with lavendergrey shadows as the clouds he was in a house with a grenade like a tin pineapple in each hand the sudden loneliness frightened him again outside the house was a sound of machinegun firing broken by the occasional bursting of a shell he looked at the redtiled roof and at a chromo of a woman nursing a child that hung on the whitewashed wall opposite him he was in a small kitchen there was a fire in the hearth where something boiled in a black pot chrisfield tiptoed over and looked in at the bottom of the bubbling water he saw five potatoes at the other end of the kitchen beyond two broken chairs was a door chrisfield crept over to it the tiles seeming to sway under foot he put his finger to the latch and took it off again suddenly holding in his breath he stood a long time looking at the door then he pulled it open recklessly a young man with fair hair was sitting at a table his head resting on his hands chrisfield felt a spurt of joy when he saw that the mans uniform was green very coolly he pressed the spring held the grenade a second and then threw it throwing himself backwards into the middle of the kitchen the lighthaired man had not moved his blue eyes still stared straight before him in the street chrisfield ran into a tall man who was running the man clutched him by the arm and said the barrage is moving up what barrage our barrage weve got to run were ahead of it his voice came in wheezy pants there were red splotches on his face they ran together down the empty village street as they ran they passed the little redhaired lieutenant who leaned against a whitewashed wall his legs a mass of blood and torn cloth he was shouting in a shrill delirious voice that followed them out along the open road wheres the artillery thats what i want to know wheres the artillery the woods were grey and dripping with dawn chrisfield got stiffly to his feet from the pile of leaves where he had slept he felt numb with cold and hunger lonely and lost away from his outfit all about him were men of another division a captain with a sandy mustache was striding up and down with a blanket about him on the road just behind a clump of beech trees chrisfield had watched him passing back and forth back and forth behind the wet clustered trunks of the trees ever since it had been light stamping his feet among the damp leaves chrisfield strolled away from the group of men no one seemed to notice him the trees closed about him he could see nothing but moist trees greygreen and black and the yellow leaves of saplings that cut off the view in every direction he was wondering dully why he was walking off that way somewhere in the back of his mind there was a vague idea of finding his outfit sergeant higgins and andy and judkins and small he wondered what had become of them he thought of the company lined up for mess and the smell of greasy food that came from the fieldkitchen he was desperately hungry he stopped and leaned against the mosscovered trunk of a tree the deep scratch in his leg was throbbing as if all the blood in his body beat through it now that his rustling footsteps had ceased the woods were absolutely silent except for the dripping of dew from the leaves and branches he strained his ears to hear some other sound then he noticed that he was staring at a tree full of small red crab apples he picked a handful greedily but they were hard and sour and seemed to make him hungrier the sour flavour in his mouth made him furiously angry he kicked at the thin trunk of the tree while tears smarted in his eyes swearing aloud in a whining singsong voice he strode off through the woods with his eyes on the ground twigs snapped viciously in his face crooked branches caught at him but he plunged on all at once he stumbled against something hard that bounced among the leaves he stopped still looking about him terrified two grenades lay just under his foot a little further on a man was propped against a tree with his mouth open chrisfield thought at first he was asleep as his eyes were closed he looked at the grenades carefully the fuses had not been sprung he put one in each pocket gave a glance at the man who seemed to be asleep and strode off again striking another alley in the woods at the end of which he could see sunlight the sky overhead was full of heavy purple clouds tinged here and there with yellow as he walked towards the patch of sunlight the thought came to him that he ought to have looked in the pockets of the man he had just passed to see if he had any hard bread he stood still a moment in hesitation but started walking again doggedly towards the patch of sunlight something glittered in the irregular fringe of sun and shadow a man was sitting hunched up on the ground with his fatigue cap pulled over his eyes so that the little gold bar just caught the horizontal sunlight chrisfields first thought was that he might have food on him say lootenant he shouted dyou know where a fellow can get somethin to eat the man lifted his head slowly chrisfield turned cold all over when he saw the white heavy face of anderson an unshaven beard was very black on his square chin there was a long scratch clotted with dried blood from the heavy eyebrow across the left cheek to the corner of the mouth give me some water buddy said anderson in a weak voice chrisfield handed him his canteen roughly in silence he noticed that andersons arm was in a sling and that he drank greedily spilling the water over his chin and his wounded arm wheres colonel evans asked anderson in a thin petulant voice chrisfield did not reply but stared at him sullenly the canteen had dropped from his hand and lay on the ground in front of him the water gleamed in the sunlight as it ran out among the russet leaves a wind had come up making the woods resound a shower of yellow leaves dropped about them first you was a corporal then you was a sergeant and now youre a lootenant said chrisfield slowly yould better tell me where colonel evans is you must know hes up that road somewhere said anderson struggling to get to his feet chrisfield walked away without answering a cold hand was round the grenade in his pocket he walked away slowly looking at his feet suddenly he found he had pressed the spring of the grenade he struggled to pull it out of his pocket it stuck in the narrow pocket his arm and his cold fingers that clutched the grenade seemed paralyzed then a warm joy went through him he had thrown it anderson was standing up swaying backwards and forwards the explosion made the woods quake a thick rain of yellow leaves came down anderson was flat on the ground he was so flat he seemed to have sunk into the ground chrisfield pressed the spring of the other grenade and threw it with his eyes closed it burst among the thick newfallen leaves a few drops of rain were falling chrisfield kept on along the lane walking fast feeling full of warmth and strength the rain beat hard and cold against his back he walked with his eyes to the ground a voice in a strange language stopped him a ragged man in green with a beard that was clotted with mud stood in front of him with his hands up chrisfield burst out laughing come along he said quick the man shambled in front of him he was trembling so hard he nearly fell with each step chrisfield kicked him the man shambled on without turning round chrisfield kicked him again feeling the point of the mans spine and the soft flesh of his rump against his toes with each kick laughing so hard all the while that he could hardly see where he was going halt came a voice ahve got a prisoner shouted chrisfield still laughing he aint much of a prisoner said the man pointing his bayonet at the german hes gone crazy i guess ill take keer o himaint no use sendin him back all right said chrisfield still laughing say buddy where can ah git something to eat ah aint had nothin fur a day an a half theres a reconnoitrin squad up the line theyll give you somethin hows things goin up that way the man pointed up the road gawd ah doan know ah aint had nothin to eat fur a day and a half the warm smell of a stew rose to his nostrils from the messkit chrisfield stood feeling warm and important filling his mouth with soft greasy potatoes and gravy while men about him asked him questions gradually he began to feel full and content and a desire to sleep came over him but he was given a gun and had to start advancing again with the reconnoitering squad the squad went cautiously up the same lane through the woods heres an officer done for said the captain who walked ahead he made a little clucking noise of distress with his tongue two of you fellows go back and git a blanket and take him back to the crossroads poor fellow the captain walked on again still making little clucking noises with his tongue chrisfield looked straight ahead of him he did not feel lonely any more now that he was marching in ranks again his feet beat the ground in time with the other feet he would not have to think whether to go to the right or to the left he would do as the others did part four rust i there were tiny green frogs in one of the puttycolored puddles by the roadside john andrews fell out of the slowly advancing column a moment to look at them the frogs triangular heads stuck out of the water in the middle of the puddle he leaned over his hands on his knees easing the weight of the equipment on his back that way he could see their tiny jewelled eyes topazcolored his eyes felt as if tears were coming to them with tenderness towards the minute lithe bodies of the frogs something was telling him that he must run forward and fall into line again that he must shamble on through the mud but he remained staring at the puddle watching the frogs then he noticed his reflection in the puddle he looked at it curiously he could barely see the outlines of a stained grimacing mask and the silhouette of the gun barrel slanting behind it so this was what they had made of him he fixed his eyes again on the frogs that swam with elastic leisurely leg strokes in the puttycolored water absently as if he had no connection with all that went on about him he heard the twang of bursting shrapnel down the road he had straightened himself wearily and taken a step forward when he found himself sinking into the puddle a feeling of relief came over him his legs sunk in the puddle he lay without moving against the muddy bank the frogs had gone but from somewhere a little stream of red was creeping out slowly into the puttycolored water he watched the irregular files of men in olivedrab shambling by their footsteps drummed in his ears he felt triumphantly separated from them as if he were in a window somewhere watching soldiers pass or in a box of a theater watching some dreary monotonous play he drew farther and farther away from them until they had become very small like toy soldiers forgotten among the dust in a garret the light was so dim he couldnt see he could only hear their feet tramping interminably through the mud john andrews was on a ladder that shook horribly a gritty sponge in his hand he was washing the windows of a barracks he began in the left hand corner and soaped the small oblong panes one after the other his arms were like lead and he felt that he would fall from the shaking ladder but each time he turned to look towards the ground before climbing down he saw the top of the generals cap and the generals chin protruding from under the visor and a voice snarled attention terrifying him so that the ladder shook more than ever and he went on smearing soap over the oblong panes with the gritty sponge through interminable hours though every joint in his body was racked by the shaking of the ladder bright light flared from inside the windows which he soaped pane after pane methodically the windows were mirrors in each pane he saw his thin face in shadow with the shadow of a gun barrel slanting beside it the jolting stopped suddenly he sank into a deep pit of blackness a shrill broken voice was singing in his ear theres a girl in the heart of maryland with a heart that belongs to mee john andrews opened his eyes it was pitch black except for a series of bright yellow oblongs that seemed to go up into the sky where he could see the stars his mind became suddenly acutely conscious he began taking account of himself in a hurried frightened way he craned his neck a little in the darkness he could make out the form of a man stretched out flat beside him who kept moving his head strangely from side to side singing at the top of his lungs in a shrill broken voice at that moment andrews noticed that the smell of carbolic was overpoweringly strong that it dominated all the familiar smells of blood and sweaty clothes he wriggled his shoulders so that he could feel the two poles of the stretcher then he fixed his eyes again in the three bright yellow oblongs one above the other that rose into the darkness of course they were windows he was near a house he moved his arms a little they felt like lead but unhurt then he realized that his legs were on fire he tried to move them everything went black again in a sudden agony of pain the voice was still shrieking in his ears theres a girl in the heart of maryland with a heart that belongs to mee but another voice could be heard softer talking endlessly in tender clear tones an he said they were goin to take me way down south where there was a little house on the beach all so warm an quiet the song of the man beside him rose to a tuneless shriek like a phonograph running down an maryland was fairyland when she said that mine shed be another voice broke in suddenly in short spurts of whining groans that formed themselves into fragments of drawnout intricate swearing and all the while the soft voice went on andrews strained his ears to hear it it soothed his pain as if some cool fragrant oil were being poured over his body an therell be a garden full of flowers roses an hollyhocks way down there in the south an itll be so warm an quiet an the sunll shine all day and the skyll be so blue andrews felt his lips repeating the words like lips following a prayer an itll be so warm an quiet without any noise at all an the gardenll be full of roses an but the other voices kept breaking in drowning out the soft voice with groans and strings of whining oaths an he said i could sit on the porch an the sunll be so warm an quiet an the gardenll smell so good an the beachll be all white an the sea andrews felt his head suddenly rise in the air and then his feet he swung out of the darkness into a brilliant white corridor his legs throbbed with flaming agony the face of a man with a cigarette in his mouth peered close to his a hand fumbled at his throat where the tag was and someone read andrews but he was listening to the voice out in the dark behind him that shrieked in rasping tones of delirium theres a girl in the heart of maryland with a heart that belongs to mee then he discovered that he was groaning his mind became entirely taken up in the curious rhythm of his groans the only parts of his body that existed were his legs and something in his throat that groaned and groaned it was absorbing white figures hovered about him he saw the hairy forearms of a man in shirt sleeves lights glared and went out strange smells entered at his nose and circulated through his whole body but nothing could distract his attention from the singsong of his groans rain fell in his face he moved his head from side to side suddenly feeling conscious of himself his mouth was dry like leather he put out his tongue to try to catch raindrops in it he was swung roughly about in the stretcher he lifted his head cautiously feeling a great throb of delight that he still could lift his head keep yer head down cant yer snarled a voice beside him he had seen the back of a man in a gleaming wet slicker at the end of the stretcher be careful of my leg cant yer he found himself whining over and over again then suddenly there was a lurch that rapped his head against the crosspiece of the stretcher and he found himself looking up at a wooden ceiling from which the white paint had peeled in places he smelt gasoline and could hear the throb of an engine he began to think back how long was it since he had looked at the little frogs in the puddle a vivid picture came to his mind of the puddle with its puttycolored water and the little triangular heads of the frogs but it seemed as long ago as a memory of childhood all of his life before that was not so long as the time that had gone by since the car had started and he was jolting and swinging about in the stretcher clutching hard with his hands at the poles of the stretcher the pain in his legs grew worse the rest of his body seemed to shrivel under it from below him came a rasping voice that cried out at every lurch of the ambulance he fought against the desire to groan but at last he gave in and lay lost in the monotonous singsong of his groans the rain was in his face again for a moment then his body was tilted a row of houses and russet trees and chimney pots against a leaden sky swung suddenly up into sight and were instantly replaced by a ceiling and the coffred vault of a staircase andrews was still groaning softly but his eyes fastened with sudden interest on the sculptured rosettes of the coffres and the coats of arms that made the center of each section of ceiling then he found himself staring in the face of the man who was carrying the lower end of the stretcher it was a white face with pimples round the mouth and goodnatured watery blue eyes andrews looked at the eyes and tried to smile but the man carrying the stretcher was not looking at him then after more endless hours of tossing about on the stretcher lost in a groaning agony of pain hands laid hold of him roughly and pulled his clothes off and lifted him on a cot where he lay gasping breathing in the cool smell of disinfectant that hung about the bedclothes he heard voices over his head isnt bad at allthis leg wound i thought you said wed have to amputate well whats the matter with him then maybe shellshock a cold sweat of terror took hold of andrews he lay perfectly still with his eyes closed spasm after spasm of revolt went through him no they hadnt broken him yet he still had hold of his nerves he kept saying to himself still he felt that his hands clasped across his belly were trembling the pain in his legs disappeared in the fright in which he lay trying desperately to concentrate his mind on something outside himself he tried to think of a tune to hum to himself but he only heard again shrieking in his ears the voice which it seemed to him months and years ago had sung theres a girl in the heart of maryland with a heart that beloongs to mee the voice shrieking the blurred tune and the pain in his legs mingled themselves strangely until they seemed one and the pain seemed merely a throbbing of the maddening tune he opened his eyes darkness fading into a faint yellow glow hastily he took stock of himself moved his head and his arms he felt cool and very weak and quiet he must have slept a long time he passed his rough dirty hand over his face the skin felt soft and cool he pressed his cheek on the pillow and felt himself smiling contentedly he did not know why the queen of sheba carried a parasol with little vermilion bells all round it that gave out a cool tinkle as she walked towards him she wore her hair in a high headdress thickly powdered with blue iris powder and on her long train that a monkey held up at the end were embroidered in gaudy colors the signs of the zodiac she was not the queen of sheba she was a nurse whose face he could not see in the obscurity and sticking an arm behind his head in a deft professional manner she gave him something to drink from a glass without looking at him he said thank you in his natural voice which surprised him in the silence but she went off without replying and he saw that it was a trayful of glasses that had tinkled as she had come towards him dark as it was he noticed the selfconscious tilt of the nurses body as she walked silently to the next cot holding the tray of glasses in front of her he twisted his head round on the pillow to watch how gingerly she put her arm under the next mans head to give him a drink a virgin he said to himself very much a virgin and he found himself giggling softly notwithstanding the twinges of pain from his legs he felt suddenly as if his spirit had awakened from a long torpor the spell of dejection that had deadened him for months had slipped off he was free the thought came to him gleefully that as long as he stayed in that cot in the hospital no one would shout orders at him no one would tell him to clean his rifle there would be no one to salute he would not have to worry about making himself pleasant to the sergeant he would lie there all day long thinking his own thoughts perhaps he was badly enough wounded to be discharged from the army the thought set his heart beating like mad that meant that he who had given himself up for lost who had let himself be trampled down unresistingly into the mud of slavery who had looked for no escape from the treadmill but death would live he john andrews would live and it seemed inconceivable that he had ever given himself up that he had ever let the grinding discipline have its way with him he saw himself vividly once more as he had seen himself before his life had suddenly blotted itself out before he had become a slave among slaves he renumbered the garden where in his boyhood he had sat dreaming through the droning summer afternoons under the crepe myrtle bushes while the cornfields beyond rustled and shimmered in the heat he remembered the day he had stood naked in the middle of a base room while the recruiting sergeant prodded him and measured him he wondered suddenly what the date was could it be that it was only a year ago yet in that year all the other years of his life had been blotted out but now he would begin living again he would give up this cowardly cringing before external things he would be recklessly himself the pain in his legs was gradually localizing itself into the wounds for a while he struggled against it to go on thinking but its constant throb kept impinging in his mind until although he wanted desperately to comb through his pale memories to remember if ever so faintly all that had been vivid and lusty in his life to build himself a new foundation of resistance against the world from which he could start afresh to live he became again the querulous piece of hurt flesh the slave broken on the treadmill he began to groan cold steelgray light filtered into the ward drowning the yellow glow which first turned ruddy and then disappeared andrews began to make out the row of cots opposite him and the dark beams of the ceiling above his head this house must be very old he said to himself and the thought vaguely excited him funny that the queen of sheba had come to his head it was ages since hed thought of all that from the girl at the crossroads singing under her streetlamp to the patrician pulling roses to pieces from the height of her litter all the aspects halfguessed all the imaginings of your desire that was the queen of sheba he whispered the words aloud la reine de saba la reine de saba and with a tremor of anticipation of the sort he used to feel when he was a small boy the night before christmas with a sense of new things in store for him he pillowed his head on his arm and went quietly to sleep aint it juss like them frawgs te make a place like this into a hauspital said the orderly standing with his feet wide apart and his hands on his hips facing a row of cots and talking to anyone who felt well enough to listen honest i doan see why you fellers doan all cash in yer checks in this hole there warnt even electric light till we put it in what dyou think o that that shows how much the goddam frawgs care the orderly was a short man with a sallow lined face and large yellow teeth when he smiled the horizontal lines in his forehead and the lines that ran from the sides of his nose to the ends of his mouth deepened so that his face looked as if it were made up to play a comic part in the movies its kind of artistic though aint it said applebaum whose cot was next andrewss a skinny man with large frightened eyes and an inordinately red face that looked as if the skin had been peeled off look at the work there is on that ceiling must have cost some dough when it was noo wouldnt be bad as a dance hall with a little fixin up but a hauspital hell andrews lay comfortable in his cot looking into the ward out of another world he felt no connection with the talk about him with the men who lay silent or tossed about groaning in the rows of narrow cots that filled the renaissance hall in the yellow glow of the electric lights looking beyond the orderlys twisted face and narrow head he could see very faintly where the beams of the ceiling sprung from the wall a row of halfobliterated shields supported by figures carved out of the grey stone of the wall handed satyrs with horns and goats beards and deepset eyes little squat figures of warriors and townsmen in square hats with swords between their bent knees naked limbs twined in scrolls of spiked acanthus leaves all seen very faintly so that when the electric lights swung back and forth in the wind made by the orderlys hurried passing they all seemed to wink and wriggle in shadowy mockery of the rows of prostrate bodies in the room beneath them yet they were familiar friendly to andrews he kept feeling a halfformulated desire to be up there too crowded under a beam grimacing through heavy wreaths of pomegranates and acanthus leaves the incarnation of old rich lusts of clear fires that had sunk to dust ages since he felt at home in that spacious hall built for wide gestures and stately steps in which all the little routine of the army seemed unreal and the wounded men discarded automatons broken toys laid away in rows andrews was snatched out of his thoughts applebaum was speaking to him he turned his head how dyou loike it bein wounded buddy fine foine i should think it was better than doin squads right all day where did you get yours aint got only one arm now i dont give a damn ive driven my last fare thats all how dyou mean i used to drive a taxi thats a pretty good job isnt it you bet

applebaum one feller did break out o here a month ago couldnt stand it any longer i guess well his wound opened an he had a hemorrhage an now hes planted out in the back lot but im goin goodnight the orderly bustled to the end of the ward and disappeared the lights went out except for the bulb over the nurses desk at the end beside the ornate doorway with its wreathed pinnacles carved out of the grey stone which could be seen above the white canvas screen that hid the door whats that book about buddy asked applebaum twisting his head at the end of his lean neck so as to look andrews full in the face oh its about a man who wants everything so badly that he decides theres nothing worth wanting i guess youse had a college edication said applebaum sarcastically andrews laughed well i was goin to tell youse about when i used to drive a taxi i was makin big money when i enlisted was you drafted yes well so was i i doan think nauthin o them guys that are so stuck up cause they enlisted dyou not a hell of a lot dont yer came a voice from the other side of andrews a thin voice that stuttered wwwell all i can say is itld have sssspoiled my business if i hadnt enlisted no sir nobody can say i didnt enlist well thats your lookout said applebaum youre goddam right it was well aint your business spoiled anyway no sir i can pick it right up where i left off ive got an established reputation what at im an undertaker by profession my dad was before me gee you were right at home said andrews you havent any right to say that young feller said the undertaker angrily im a humane man i wont never be at home in this dirty butchery the nurse was walking by their cots how can you say such dreadful things she said but lights are out you boys have got to keep quiet and you she plucked at the undertakers bedclothes just remember what the huns did in belgium poor miss cavell a nurse just like i am andrews closed his eyes the ward was quiet except for the rasping sound of the snores and heavy breathing of the shattered men all about him and i thought she was the queen of sheba he said to himself making a grimace in the dark then he began to think of the music he had intended to write about the queen of sheba before he had stripped his life off in the bare room where they had measured him and made a soldier of him standing in the dark in the desert of his despair he would hear the sound of a caravan in the distance tinkle of bridles rasping of horns braying of donkeys and the throaty voices of men singing the songs of desolate roads he would look up and before him he would see astride their foaming wild asses the three green horsemen motionless pointing at him with their long forefingers then the music would burst in a sudden hot whirlwind about him full of flutes and kettledrums and braying horns and whining bagpipes and torches would flare red and yellow making a tent of light about him on the edges of which would crowd the sumpter mules and the brown mule drivers and the gaudily caparisoned camels and the elephants glistening with jewelled harness naked slaves would bend their gleaming backs before him as they laid out a carpet at his feet and through the flare of torchlight the queen of sheba would advance towards him covered with emeralds and dullgold ornaments with a monkey hopping behind holding up the end of her long train she would put her hand with its slim fantastic nails on his shoulder and looking into her eyes he would suddenly feel within reach all the fiery imaginings of his desire oh if he could only be free to work all the months he had wasted in his life seemed to be marching like a procession of ghosts before his eyes and he lay in his cot staring with wide open eyes at the ceiling hoping desperately that his wounds would be long in healing applebaum sat on the edge of his cot dressed in a clean new uniform of which the left sleeve hung empty still showing the creases in which it had been folded so you really are going said andrews rolling his head over on his pillow to look at him you bet your pants i am andy an so could you poifectly well if yould talk it up to em a little oh i wish to god i could not that i want to go home now but if i could get out of uniform i dont blame ye a bit kid well next time well know better local board chairmans going to be my job andrews laughed if i wasnt a sucker you werent

was goin to be a picnic hell i doan care about that or gettin gassed and smashed up or anythin but i thought we was goin to put things to rights by comin over here look here i had a lively business in the undertaking way like my father had had before me we did all the swellest work in tilletsville where interrupted applebaum laughing tilletsville dont you know any geography go ahead tell us about tilletsville said andrews soothingly why when senator wallace dddeceased there who dyou think had charge of embalming the body and taking it to the station an seeing everything was done fitting we did and i was going to be married to a dandy girl and i knowed i had enough pull to get fixed up somehow or to get a commission even but there i went like a sucker an enlisted in the infantry too but hell everybody was saying that we was going to fight to make the world safe for democracy and that if a feller didnt go no oneld trade with him any more he started coughing suddenly and seemed unable to stop at last he said weakly in a thin little voice between coughs well here i am there aint nothing to do about it democracy thats democracy aint it we eat stinkin goolash an that there fat y woman goes out with colonels eatin chawklate soufflay poifect democracy but i tell you what it dont do to be the goat but theres so damn many more goats than anything else said andrews theres a sucker born

sucker i ever met what did you want to tell the loot your legs didnt hurt bad for theyll have you out o here before you know it well im goin out to see what the mamzelles look like applebaum the uniform hanging in folds about his skinny body swaggered to the door followed by the envious glances of the whole ward gee guess he thinks hes goin to get to be president said the undertaker bitterly he probably will said andrews he settled himself in his bed again sinking back into the dull contemplation of the teasing smarting pain where the torn ligaments of his thighs were slowly knitting themselves together he tried desperately to forget the pain there was so much he wanted to think out if he could only lie perfectly quiet and piece together the frayed ends of thoughts that kept flickering to the surface of his mind he counted up the days he had been in the hospital fifteen could it be that long and he had not thought of anything yet soon as applebaum said theyd be putting him in class a and sending him back to the treadmill and he would not have reconquered his courage his dominion over himself what a coward he had been anyway to submit the man beside him kept coughing andrews stared for a moment at the silhouette of the yellow face on the pillow with its pointed nose and small greedy eyes he thought of the swell undertaking establishment of the black gloves and long faces and soft tactful voices that man and his father before him lived by pretending things they didnt feel by swathing reality with all manner of crepe and trumpery for those people no one ever died they passed away they deceased still there had to be undertakers there was no more stain about that than about any other trade and it was so as not to spoil his trade that the undertaker had enlisted and to make the world safe for democracy too the phrase came to andrewss mind amid an avalanche of popular tunes of visions of patriotic numbers on the vaudeville stage he remembered the great flags waving triumphantly over fifth avenue and the crowds dutifully cheering but those were valid reasons for the undertaker but for him john andrews were they valid reasons no he had no trade he had not been driven into the army by the force of public opinion he had not been carried away by any wave of blind confidence in the phrases of bought propagandists he had not had the strength to live the thought came to him of all those who down the long tragedy of history had given themselves smilingly for the integrity of their thoughts he had not had the courage to move a muscle for his freedom but he had been fairly cheerful about risking his life as a soldier in a cause he believed useless what right had a man to exist who was too cowardly to stand up for what he thought and felt for his whole makeup for everything that made him an individual apart from his fellows and not a slave to stand cap in hand waiting for someone of stronger will to tell him to act like a sudden nausea disgust surged up in him his mind ceased formulating phrases and thoughts he gave himself over to disgust as a man who has drunk a great deal holding on tight to the reins of his will suddenly gives himself over pellmell to drunkenness he lay very still with his eyes closed listening to the stir of the ward the voices of men talking and the fits of coughing that shook the man next him the smarting pain throbbed monotonously he felt hungry and wondered vaguely if it were supper time how little they gave you to eat in the hospital he called over to the man in the opposite cot hay stalky what time is it its after messtime now got a good appetite for the steak and onions and french fried potatoes shut up a rattling of tin dishes at the other end of the ward made andrews wriggle up further on his pillow verses from the shropshire lad jingled mockingly through his head the world it was the old world yet i was i my things were wet and nothing now remained to do but begin the game anew after he had eaten he picked up the tentation de saint antoine that lay on the cot beside his immovable legs and buried himself in it reading the gorgeously modulated sentences voraciously as if the book were a drug in which he could drink deep forgetfulness of himself he put the book down and closed his eyes his mind was full of intangible floating glow like the ocean on a warm night when every wave breaks into pale flame and mysterious milky lights keep rising to the surface out of the dark waters and gleaming and vanishing he became absorbed in the strange fluid harmonies that permeated his whole body as a grey sky at nightfall suddenly becomes filled with endlessly changing patterns of light and color and shadow when he tried to seize hold of his thoughts to give them definite musical expression in his mind he found himself suddenly empty the way a sandy inlet on the beach that has been full of shoals of silver fishes becomes suddenly empty when a shadow crosses the water and the man who is watching sees wanly his own reflection instead of the flickering of thousands of tiny silver bodies john andrews awoke to feel a cold hand on his head feeling all right said a voice in his ear he found himself looking in a puffy middleaged face with a lean nose and grey eyes with dark rings under them andrews felt the eyes looking him over inquisitively he saw the red triangle on the mans khaki sleeve yes he said if you dont mind id like to talk to you a little while buddy not a bit have you got a chair said andrews smiling i dont suppose it was just right of me to wake you up but you see it was this way you were the next in line an i was afraid id forget you if i skipped you i understand said andrews with a sudden determination to take the initiative away from the y man how long have you been in france dyou like the war he asked hurriedly the y man smiled sadly you seem pretty spry he said i guess youre in a hurry to get back at the front and get some more huns he smiled again with an air of indulgence andrews did not answer no sonny i dont like it here the y man said after a pause i wish i was home but its great to feel youre doing your duty it must be said andrews have you heard about the great air raids our boys have pulled off theyve bombarded frankfort now if they could only wipe berlin off the map say dyou hate em awful hard said andrews in a low voice because if you do i can tell you something will tickle you most to death lean over the y man leant over curiously some german prisoners come to this hospital at six every night to get the garbage now all you need to do if you really hate em so bad is borrow a revolver from one of your officer friends and just shoot up the convoy saywhere were you raised boy the y man sat up suddenly with a look of alarm on his face dont you know that prisoners are sacred dyou know what our colonel told us before going into the argonne offensive the more prisoners we took the less grub thereld be and do you know what happened to the prisoners that were taken why do you hate the huns because they are barbarians enemies of civilization you must have enough education to know that said the y man raising his voice angrily what church do you belong to none but you must have been connected with some church boy you cant have been raised a heathen in america every christian belongs or has belonged to some church or other from baptism i make no pretensions to christianity andrews closed his eyes and turned his head away he could feel the y man hovering over him irresolutely after a while he opened his eyes the y man was leaning over the next bed through the window at the opposite side of the ward he could see a bit of blue sky among white scrolllike clouds with mauve shadows he stared at it until the clouds beginning to grow golden into evening covered it furious hopeless irritation consumed him how these people enjoyed hating at that rate it was better to be at the front men were more humane when they were killing each other than when they were talking about it so was civilization nothing but a vast edifice of sham and the war instead of its crumbling was its fullest and most ultimate expression oh but there must be something more in the world than greed and hatred and cruelty were they all shams too these gigantic phrases that floated like gaudy kites high above mankind kites that was it contraptions of tissue paper held at the end of a string ornaments not to be taken seriously he thought of all the long procession of men who had been touched by the unutterable futility of the lives of men who had tried by phrases to make things otherwise who had taught unworldliness dim enigmatic figures they were democritus socrates epicurus christ so many of them and so vague in the silvery mist of history that he hardly knew that they were not his own imagining lucretius st francis voltaire rousseau and how many others known and unknown through the tragic centuries they had wept some of them and some of them had laughed and their phrases had risen glittering soap bubbles to dazzle men for a moment and had shattered and he felt a crazy desire to join the forlorn ones to throw himself into inevitable defeat to live his life as he saw it in spite of everything to proclaim once more the falseness of the gospels under the cover of which greed and fear filled with more and yet more pain the already unbearable agony of human life as soon as he got out of the hospital he would desert the determination formed suddenly in his mind making the excited blood surge gloriously through his body there was nothing else to do he would desert he pictured himself hobbling away in the dark on his lame legs stripping his uniform off losing himself in some out of the way corner of france or slipping by the sentries to spain and freedom he was ready to endure anything to face any sort of death for the sake of a few months of liberty in which to forget the degradation of this last year this was his last run with the pack an enormous exhilaration took hold of him it seemed the first time in his life he had ever determined to act all the rest had been aimless drifting the blood sang m his ears he fixed his eyes on the halfobliterated figures that supported the shields under the beams in the wall opposite they seemed to be wriggling out of their contorted positions and smiling encouragement to him he imagined them warriors out of old tales on their way to clay dragons in enchanted woods cleverfingered guildsmen and artisans cupids and satyrs and fauns jumping from their niches and carrying him off with them in a headlong rout to a sound of flutes on a last forlorn assault on the citadels of pain the lights went out and an orderly came round with chocolate that poured with a pleasant soothing sound into the tin cups with a greasiness of chocolate in his mouth and the warmth of it in his stomach john andrews went to sleep there was a stir in the ward when he woke up reddish sunlight filtered in through the window opposite and from outside came a confused noise a sound of bells ringing and whistles blowing andrews looked past his feet towards stalkys cot opposite stalky was sitting bolt upright in bed with his eyes round as quarters fellers the wars over put him out cut that pull the chain tie that bull outside came from every side of the ward fellers shouted stalky louder than ever its straight dope the wars over i just dreamt the kaiser came up to me on fourteenth street and bummed a nickel for a glass of beer the wars over dont you hear the whistles all right lets go home shut up cant you let a feller sleep the ward quieted down again but all eyes were wide open men lay strangely still in their cots waiting wondering all i can say shouted stalky again is that she was some war while she lasted what did i tell yer as he spoke the canvas screen in front of the door collapsed and the major appeared with his cap askew over his red face and a brass bell in his hand which he rang frantically as he advanced into the ward men he shouted in the deep roar of one announcing baseball scores the war ended at am this morning the armistice is signed to hell with the kaiser then he rang the dinner bell madly and danced along the aisle between the rows of cots holding the head nurse by one hand who held a little yellowheaded lieutenant by the other hand who in turn held another nurse and so on the line advanced jerkily into the ward the front part was singing the star spangled banner and the rear the yanks are coming and through it all the major rang his brass bell the men who were well enough sat up in bed and yelled the others rolled restlessly about sickened by the din they made the circuit of the ward and filed out leaving confusion behind them the dinner bell could be heard faintly in the other parts of the building well what dyou think of it undertaker said andrews nothing why the undertaker turned his small black eyes on andrews and looked him straight in the face you know whats the matter with me dont yer outside o this wound no coughing like i am id think youd be more observant i got tb young feller how do you know that theyre going to move me out o here to a tb ward tomorrow the hell they are andrewss words were lost in the paroxysm of coughing that seized the man next to him home boys home its home we want to be those well enough were singing stalky conducting standing on the end of his cot in his pink red cross pajamas that were too short and showed a long expanse of skinny leg fuzzy with red hairs he banged together two bed pans to beat time home i wont never go home said the undertaker when the noise had subsided a little dyou know what i wish i wish the ward gone on and on until everyone of them bastards had been killed in it which bastards the men who got us fellers over here he began coughing again weakly but theyll be safe if every other human being began andrews he was interrupted by a thundering voice from the end of the ward attention home boys home its home we want to be went on the song stalky glanced towards the end of the ward and seeing it was the major dropped the bed pans that smashed at the foot of his cot and got as far as possible under his blankets attention thundered the major again a sudden uncomfortable silence fell upon the ward broken only by the coughing of the man next to andrews if i hear any more noise from this ward ill chuck everyone of you men out of this hospital if you cant walk youll have to crawl the war may be over but you men are in the army and dont you forget it the major glared up and down the lines of cots he turned on his heel and went out of the door glancing angrily as he went at the overturned screen the ward was still outside whistles blew and churchbells rang madly and now and then there was a sound of singing ii the snow beat against the windows and pattered on the tin roof of the leanto built against the side of the hospital that went by the name of sun parlor it was a dingy place decorated by strings of dusty little paper flags that one of the y men had festooned about the slanting beams of the ceiling to celebrate christmas there were tables with torn magazines piled on them and a counter where cracked white cups were ranged waiting for one of the rare occasions when cocoa could be bought in the middle of the room against the wall of the main building a stove was burning about which sat several men in hospital denims talking in drowsy voices andrews watched them from his seat by the window looking at their broad backs bent over towards the stove and at the hands that hung over their knees limp from boredom the air was heavy with a smell of coal gas mixed with carbolic from mens clothes and stale cigarette smoke behind the cups at the counter a y man a short redhaired man with freckles read the paris edition of the new york herald andrews in his seat by the window felt permeated by the stagnation about him he had a sheaf of pencilled musicpapers on his knees that he rolled and unrolled nervously staring at the stove and the motionless backs of the men about it the stove roared a little the y mans paper rustled mens voices came now and then in a drowsy whisper and outside the snow beat evenly and monotonously against the window panes andrews pictured himself vaguely walking fast through the streets with the snow stinging his face and the life of a city swirling about him faces flushed by the cold bright eyes under hatbrims looking for a second into his and passing on slim forms of women bundled in shawls that showed vaguely the outline of their breasts and hips he wondered if he would ever be free again to walk at random through city streets he stretched his legs out across the floor in front of him strange stiff tremulous legs they were but it was not the wounds that gave them their leaden weight it was the stagnation of the life about him that he felt sinking into every crevice of his spirit so that he could never shake it off the stagnation of dusty ruined automatons that had lost all life of their own whose limbs had practised the drill manual so long that they had no movements of their own left who sat limply sunk in boredom waiting for orders andrews was roused suddenly from his thoughts he had been watching the snowflakes in their glittering dance just outside the window pane when the sound of someone rubbing his hands very close to him made him look up a little man with chubby cheeks and steelgrey hair very neatly flattened against his skull stood at the window rubbing his fat little white hands together and making a faint unctuous puffing with each breath andrews noticed that a white clerical collar enclosed the little mans pink neck that starched cuffs peeped from under the welltailored sleeves of his officers uniform sam brown belt and puttees too were highly polished on his shoulder was a demure little silver cross andrews glance had reached the pink cheeks again when he suddenly found a pair of steely eyes looking sharply into his you look quite restored my friend said a chanting clerical voice i suppose i am splendid splendid but do you mind moving into the end of the room thats it he followed andrews saying in a deprecatory tone were going to have just a little bit of a prayer and then i have some interesting things to tell you boys the redheaded y man had left his seat and stood in the center of the room his paper still dangling from his hand saying in a bored voice please fellows move down to the end quiet please quiet please the soldiers shambled meekly to the folding chairs at the end of the room and after some chattering were quiet a couple of men left and several tiptoed in and sat in the front row andrews sank into a chair with a despairing sort of resignation and burying his face in his hands stared at the floor between his feet fellers went on the bored voice of the y man let me introduce the reverend dr skinner who the y mans voice suddenly took on deep patriotic emotion who has just come back from the army of occupation in germany at the words army of occupation as if a spring had been touched everybody clapped and cheered the reverend dr skinner looked about his audience with smiling confidence and raised his hands for silence so that the men could see the chubby pink palms first boys my dear friends let us indulge in a few moments of silent prayer to our great creator his voice rose and fell in the suave chant of one accustomed to going through the episcopal liturgy for the edification of welldressed and wellfed congregations inasmuch as he has vouchsafed us safety and a mitigation of our afflictions and let us pray that in his good time he may see fit to return us whole in limb and pure in heart to our families to the wives mothers and to those whom we will some day honor with the name of wife who eagerly await our return and that we may spend the remainder of our lives in useful service of the great country for whose safety and glory we have offered up our youth a willing sacrifice let us pray silence fell dully on the room andrews could hear the selfconscious breathing of the men about him and the rustling of the snow against the tin roof a few feet scraped the voice began again after a long pause chanting our father which art in heaven at the amen everyone lifted his head cheerfully throats were cleared chairs scraped men settled themselves to listen now my friends i am going to give you in a few brief words a little glimpse into germany so that you may be able to picture to yourselves the way your comrades of the army of occupation manage to make themselves comfortable among the huns i ate my christmas dinner in coblenz what do you think of that never had i thought that a christmas would find me away from my home and loved ones but what unexpected things happen to us in this world christmas in coblenz under the american flag he paused a moment to allow a little scattered clapping to subside the turkey was fine too i can tell you yes our boys in germany are very very comfortable and just waiting for the word if necessary to continue their glorious advance to berlin for i am sorry to say boys that the germans have not undergone the change of heart for which we had hoped they have indeed changed the name of their institutions but their spirit they have not changed how grave a disappointment it must be to our great president who has exerted himself so to bring the german people to reason to make them understand the horror that they alone have brought deliberately upon the world alas far from it indeed they have attempted with insidious propaganda to undermine the morale of our troops a little storm of muttered epithets went through the room the reverend dr skinner elevated his chubby pink palms and smiled benignantlyto undermine the morale of our troops so that the most stringent regulations have had to be made by the commanding general to prevent it indeed my friends i very much fear that we stopped too soon in our victorious advance that germany should have been utterly crushed but all we can do is watch and wait and abide by the decision of those great men who in a short time will be gathered together at the conference at paris let me boys my dear friends express the hope that you may speedily be cured of your wounds ready again to do willing service in the ranks of the glorious army that must be vigilant for some time yet i fear to defend as americans and christians the civilization you have so nobly saved from a ruthless foe let us all join together in singing the hymn stand up stand up for jesus which i am sure you all know the men got to their feet except for a few who had lost their legs and sang the first verse of the hymn unsteadily the second verse petered out altogether leaving only the y man and the reverend dr skinner singing away at the top of their lungs the reverend dr skinner pulled out his gold watch and looked at it frowning oh my i shall miss the train he muttered the y man helped him into his voluminous trench coat and they both hurried out of the door those are some puttees he had on ill tell you said the legless man who was propped in a chair near the stove andrews sat down beside him laughing he was a man with high cheekbones and powerful jaws to whose face the pale brown eyes and delicately pencilled lips gave a look of great gentleness andrews did not look at his body somebody said he was a red cross man giving out cigarettes fooled us that time said andrews have a butt ive got one said the legless man with a large shrunken hand that was the transparent color of alabaster he held out a box of cigarettes thanks when andrews struck a match he had to lean over the legless man to light his cigarette for him he could not help glancing down the mans tunic at the drab trousers that hung limply from the chair a cold shudder went through him he was thinking of the zigzag scars on his own thighs did you get it in the legs too buddy asked the legless man quietly yes but i had luck how long have you been here since christ was a corporal oh i doan know ive been here since two weeks after my outfit first went into the lines that was on november th didnt see much of the war did i still i guess i didnt miss much no but youve seen enough of the army thats true i guess i wouldnt mind the war if it wasnt for the army theyll be sending you home soon wont they guess so where are you from new york said andrews im from cranston wisconsin dyou know that country its a great country for lakes you can canoe for days an days without a portage we have a camp on big loon

make you feel fit first thing you do when you shake out of your blankets is jump in an have a swim gee its great to swim when the morning mist is still on the water an the sun just strikes the tops of the birch trees ever smelt bacon cooking i mean out in the woods in a frying pan over some sticks of pine and beech wood some great old smell isnt it and after youve paddled all day an feel tired and sunburned right to the palms of your feet to sit around the fire with some trout roastin in the ashes and hear the sizzlin the bacon makes in the pan o boy he stretched his arms wide god id like to have wrung that damn little parsons neck said andrews suddenly would you the legless man turned brown eyes on andrews with a smile i guess hes about as much to blame as anybody isguys like him i guess they have that kind in germany too you dont think weve made the world quite as safe for democracy as it might be said andrews in a low voice hell how should i know i bet you never drove an ice wagon i did all one summer down home it was some life get up at three oclock in the morning an carry a hundred or two hundred pounds of ice into everybodys ice box that was the life to make a feller feel fit i was goin around with a big norwegian named olaf who was the strongest man i ever knew an drink he was the boy could drink i once saw him put away twentyfive dry martini cocktails an swim across the lake on top of it i used to weigh a hundred and eighty pounds and he could pick me up with one hand and put me across his shoulder that was the life to make a feller feel fit why after bein out late the night before wed jump up out of bed at three oclock feeling springy as a cat whats he doing now asked andrews he died on the transport coming cross here died of the flu i met a feller came over in his regiment they dropped him overboard when they were in sight of the azores well i didnt die of the flu have another butt no thanks said andrews they were silent the fire roared in the stove no one was talking the men lolled in chairs somnolently now and then someone spat outside of the window andrews could see the soft white dancing of the snowflakes his limbs felt very heavy his mind was permeated with dusty stagnation like the stagnation of old garrets and lumber rooms where among superannuated bits of machinery and cracked grimy crockery lie heaps of broken toys john andrews sat on a bench in a square full of linden trees with the pale winter sunshine full on his face and hands he had been looking up through his eyelashes at the sun that was the color of honey and he let his dazzled glance sink slowly through the black lacework of twigs down the green trunks of the trees to the bench opposite where sat two nursemaids and between them a tiny girl with a face daintily colored and lifeless like a dolls face and a frilled dress under which showed small ivory knees and legs encased in white socks and yellow sandals above the yellow halo of her hair floated with the sun shining through it as through a glass of claret a bright carmine balloon which the child held by a string andrews looked at her for a long time enraptured by the absurd daintiness of the figure between the big bundles of flesh of the nursemaids the thought came to him suddenly that months had gone by was it only months since his hands had touched anything soft since he had seen any flowers the last was a flower an old woman had given him in a village in the argonne an orange marigold and he remembered how soft the old womans withered lips had been against his cheek when she had leaned over and kissed him his mind suddenly lit up as with a strain of music with a sense of the sweetness of quiet lives worn away monotonously in the fields in the grey little provincial towns in old kitchens full of fragrance of herbs and tang of smoke from the hearth where there are pots on the windowsill full of basil in flower something made him go up to the little girl and take her hand the child looking up suddenly and seeing a lanky soldier with pale lean face and light strawcolored hair escaping from under a cap too small for him shrieked and let go the string of the balloon which soared slowly into the air trembling a little in the faint cool wind that blew the child wailed dismally and andrews quailing under the furious glances of the nursemaids stood before her flushed crimson stammering apologies not knowing what to do the white caps of the nursemaids bent over and ribbons fluttered about the childs head as they tried to console her andrews walked away dejectedly now and then looking up at the balloon which soared a black speck against the grey and topazcolored clouds sale americain he heard one nursemaid exclaim to the other but this was the first hour in months he had had free the first moment of solitude he must live soon he would be sent back to his division a wave of desire for furious fleshly enjoyments went through him making him want steaming dishes of food drenched in rich spiceflavored sauces making him want to get drunk on strong wine to roll on thick carpets in the arms of naked libidinous women he was walking down the quiet grey street of the provincial town with its low houses with red chimney pots and blue slate roofs and its irregular yellowish cobbles a clock somewhere was striking four with deep booming strokes andrews laughed he had to be in hospital at six already he was tired his legs ached the window of a pastry shop appeared invitingly before him denuded as it was by wartime a sign in english said tea walking in he sat down in a fussy little parlor where the tables had red cloths and a print in pinkish and greenish colors hung in the middle of the imitation brocade paper of each wall under a print of a poster bed with curtains in front of which eighteen to twenty people bowed with the title of secret damour sat three young officers who cast cold irritated glances at this private with a hospital badge on who invaded their tea shop andrews stared back at them flaming with dull anger sipping the hot fragrant tea he sat with a blank sheet of music paper before him listening in spite of himself to what the officers were saying they were talking about ronsard it was with irritated surprise that andrews heard the name what right had they to be talking about ronsard he knew more about ronsard than they did furious conceited phrases kept surging up in his mind he was as sensitive as humane as intelligent as wellread as they were what right had they to the cold suspicious glance with which they had put him in his place when he had come into the room yet that had probably been as unconscious as unavoidable as was his own biting envy the thought that if one of those men should come over to him he would have to stand up and salute and answer humbly not from civility but from the fear of being punished was bitter as wormwood filled him with a childish desire to prove his worth to them as when older boys had illtreated him at school and he had prayed to have the house burn down so that he might heroically save them all there was a piano in an inner room where in the dark the chairs upside down perched dismally on the table tops he almost obeyed an impulse to go in there and start playing by the brilliance of his playing to force these men who thought of him as a coarse automaton something between a man and a dog to recognize him as an equal a superior but the wars over i want to start living red wine streets of the nightingale cries to the rose said one of the officers what do you say we go awol to paris dangerous well what can they do we are not enlisted men they can only send us home thats just what i want ill tell you what well go to the cochon bleu and have a cocktail and think about it the lion and the lizard keep their courts wherewhat the devil was his name anyway well glory and drink deep while major peabody keeps his court in dijon to his hearts content spurs jingled as the three officers went out a fierce disgust took possession of john andrews he was ashamed of his spiteful irritation if when he had been playing the piano to a roomful of friends in new york a man dressed as a laborer had shambled in wouldnt he have felt a moment of involuntary scorn it was inevitable that the fortunate should hate the unfortunate because they feared them but he was so tired of all those thoughts drinking down the last of his tea at a gulp he went into the shop to ask the old woman with little black whiskers over her bloodless lips who sat behind the white desk at the end of the counter if she minded his playing the piano in the deserted tea room among the dismal upturned chairs his crassened fingers moved stiffly over the keys he forgot everything else locked doors in his mind were swinging wide revealing forgotten sumptuous halls of his imagination the queen of sheba grotesque as a satyr white and flaming with worlds of desire as the great implacable aphrodite stood with her hand on his shoulder sending shivers of warm sweetness rippling through his body while her voice intoned in his ears all the inexhaustible voluptuousness of life an asthmatic clock struck somewhere in the obscurity of the room seven john andrews paid said goodbye to the old woman with the mustache and hurried out into the street like cinderella at the ball he thought as he went towards the hospital down faintly lighted streets his steps got slower and slower why go back a voice kept saying inside him anything is better than that better throw himself in the river even than go back he could see the olivedrab clothes in a heap among the dry bullrushes on the river bank he thought of himself crashing naked through the film of ice into water black as chinese lacquer and when he climbed out numb and panting on the other side wouldnt he be able to take up life again as if he had just been born how strong he would be if he could begin life a second time how madly how joyously he would live now that there was no more war he had reached the door of the hospital furious shudders of disgust went through him he was standing dumbly humble while a sergeant bawled him out for being late andrews stared for a long while at the line of shields that supported the dark ceiling beams on the wall opposite his cot the emblems had been erased and the grey stone figures that crowded under the shields the satyr with his shaggy goats legs the townsman with his square hat the warrior with the sword between his legs had been clipped and scratched long ago in other wars in the strong afternoon light they were so dilapidated he could hardly make them out he wondered how they had seemed so vivid to him when he had lain in his cot comforted by their comradeship while his healing wounds itched and tingled still he glanced tenderly at the grey stone figures as he left the ward downstairs in the office where the atmosphere was stuffy with a smell of varnish and dusty papers and cigarette smoke he waited a long time shifting his weight restlessly from one foot to the other what do you want said a redhaired sergeant without looking up from the pile of papers on his desk waiting for travel orders arent you the guy i told to come back at three it is three hm the sergeant kept his eyes fixed on the papers which rustled as he moved them from one pile to another in the end of the room a typewriter clicked slowly and jerkily andrews could see the dark back of a head between bored shoulders in a woolen shirt leaning over the machine beside the cylindrical black stove against the wall a man with large mustaches and the complicated stripes of a hospital sergeant was reading a novel in a red cover after a long silence the redheaded sergeant looked up from his papers and said suddenly ted the man at the typewriter turned slowly round showing a large red face and blue eyes weell he drawled go in an see if the loot has signed them papers yet the man got up stretched himself deliberately and slouched out through a door beside the stove the redhaired sergeant leaned back in his swivel chair and lit a cigarette hell he said yawning the man with the mustache beside the stove let the book slip from his knees to the floor and yawned too this goddam armistice sure does take the ambition out of a feller he said hell of a note said the redhaired sergeant dyou know that they had my name in for an otc hell of a note goin home without a sam browne the other man came back and sank down into his chair in front of the typewriter again the slow jerky clicking recommenced andrews made a scraping noise with his foot on the ground well what about that travel order said the redhaired sergeant loots out said the other man still typewriting well didnt he leave it on his desk shouted the redhaired sergeant angrily couldnt find it i suppose ive got to go look for it god the redhaired sergeant stamped out of the room a moment later he came back with a bunch of papers in his hand your name jones he snapped to andrews no snivisky no andrews john why the hell couldnt you say so the man with the mustaches beside the stove got to his feet suddenly an alert smiling expression came over his face good afternoon captain higginsworth he said cheerfully an oval man with a cigar slanting out of his broad mouth came into the room when he talked the cigar wobbled in his mouth he wore greenish kid gloves very tight for his large hands and his puttees shone with a dark lustre like mahogany the redhaired sergeant turned round and halfsaluted goin to another swell party captain he asked the captain grinned say have you boys got any red cross cigarettes i aint only got cigars an you cant hand a cigar to a lady can you the captain grinned again an appreciative giggle went round will a couple of packages do you because ive got some here said the redhaired sergeant reaching in the drawer of his desk fine the captain slipped them into his pocket and swaggered out doing up the buttons of his buffcolored coat the sergeant settled himself at his desk again with an important smile did you find the travel order asked andrews timidly im supposed to take the train at fourtwo cant make it did you say your name was anderson andrews john andrews here it is why didnt you come earlier the sharp air of the ruddy winter evening sparkling in john andrewss nostrils vastly refreshing after the stale odors of the hospital gave him a sense of liberation walking with rapid steps through the grey streets of the town where in windows lamps already glowed orange he kept telling himself that another epoch was closed it was with relief that he felt that he would never see the hospital again or any of the people in it he thought of chrisfield it was weeks and weeks since chrisfield had come to his mind at all now it was with a sudden clench of affection that the indiana boys face rose up before him an oval heavilytanned face with a little of childish roundness about it yet with black eyebrows and long black eyelashes but he did not even know if chrisfield were still alive furious joy took possession of him he john andrews was alive what did it matter if everyone he knew died there were jollier companions than ever he had known to be found in the world cleverer people to talk to more vigorous people to learn from the cold air circulated through his nose and lungs his arms felt strong and supple he could feel the muscles of his legs stretch and contract as he walked while his feet beat jauntily on the irregular cobblestones of the street the waiting room at the station was cold and stuffy full of a smell of breathed air and unclean uniforms french soldiers wrapped in their long blue coats slept on the benches or stood about in groups eating bread and drinking from their canteens a gas lamp in the center gave dingy light andrews settled himself in a corner with despairing resignation he had five hours to wait for a train and already his legs ached and he had a side feeling of exhaustion the exhilaration of leaving the hospital and walking free through winetinted streets in the sparkling evening air gave way gradually to despair his life would continue to be this slavery of unclean bodies packed together in places where the air had been breathed over and over cogs in the great slowmoving juggernaut of armies what did it matter if the fighting had stopped the armies would go on grinding out lives with lives crushing flesh with flesh would he ever again stand free and solitary to live out joyous hours which would make up for all the boredom of the treadmill he had no hope his life would continue like this dingy illsmelling waiting room where men in uniform slept in the fetid air until they should be orderedout to march or to stand in motionless rows endlessly futilely like toy soldiers a child has forgotten in an attic andrews got up suddenly and went out on the empty platform a cold wind blew somewhere out in the freight yards an engine puffed loudly and clouds of white steam drifted through the faintly lighted station he was walking up and down with his chin sunk into his coat and his hands in his pockets when somebody ran into him damn said a voice and the figure darted through a grimy glass door that bore the sign buvette andrews followed absentmindedly im sorry i ran into you i thought you were an mp thats why i beat it when he spoke the man an american private turned and looked searchingly in andrewss face he had very red cheeks and an impudent little brown mustache he spoke slowly with a faint bostonian drawl thats nothing said andrews lets have a drink said the other man im awol where are you going to some place near barleduc back to my division been in hospital long since october gee have some curacoa itll do you good you look pale my names henslowe ambulance with the french army they sat down at an unwashed marble table where the soot from the trains made a pattern sticking to the rings left by wine and liqueur glasses im going to paris said henslowe my leave expired three days ago im going to paris and get taken ill with peritonitis or double pneumonia or maybe ill have a cardiac lesion the armys a bore hospital isnt any better said andrews with a sigh though i shall never forget the night with which i realized i was wounded and out of it i thought i was bad enough to be sent home why i wouldnt have missed a minute of the war but now that its overhell travel is the password now ive just had two weeks in the pyrenees nimes arles les baux carcassonne perpignan lourdes gavarnie toulouse what do you think of that for a trip what were you in infantry must have been hell been it is why dont you come to paris

a diner on the marseilles express but i cant go to paris sure look how do you call yourself john andrews well john andrews all i can say is that youve let em get your goat dont give in have a good time in spite of em to hell with em he brought the bottle down so hard on the table that it broke and the purple wine flowed over the dirty marble and dripped gleaming on the floor some french soldiers who stood in a group round the bar turned round vla un gars qui gaspille le bon vin said a tall redfaced man with long sloping whiskers pour vingt sous jmangerai la bouteille cried a little man lurching forward and leaning drunkenly over the table done said henslowe say andrews he says hell eat the bottle for a franc he placed a shining silver franc on the table beside the remnants of the broken bottle the man seized the neck of the bottle in a black clawlike hand and gave it a preparatory flourish he was a cadaverous little man incredibly dirty with mustaches and beard of a motheaten towcolor and a purple flush on his cheeks his uniform was clotted with mud when the others crowded round him and tried to dissuade him he said men fous cest mon metier and rolled his eyes so that the whites flashed in the dim light like the eyes of dead codfish why hes really going to do it cried henslowe the mans teeth flashed and crunched down on the jagged edge of the glass there was a terrific crackling noise he flourished the bottleend again my god hes eating it cried henslowe roaring with laughter and youre afraid to go to paris an engine rumbled into the station with a great hiss of escaping steam gee thats the paris train tiens he pressed the franc into the mans dirtcrusted hand come along andrews as they left the buvette they heard again the crunching crackling noise as the man bit another piece off the bottle andrews followed henslowe across the steamfilled platform to the door of a firstclass carriage they climbed in henslowe immediately pulled down the black cloth over the half globe of the light the compartment was empty he threw himself down with a sigh of comfort on the soft buffcolored cushions of the seat but what on earth stammered andrews men fous cest mon metier interrupted henslowe the train pulled out of the station iii henslowe poured wine from a brown earthen crock into the glasses where it shimmered a bright thin red the color of currants andrews leaned back in his chair and looked through halfclosed eyes at the table with its white cloth and little burnt umber loaves of bread and out of the window at the square dimly lit by lemonyellow gas lamps and at the dark gables of the little houses that huddled round it at a table against the wall opposite a lame boy with white beardless face and gentle violetcolored eyes sat very close to the bareheaded girl who was with him and who never took her eyes off his face leaning on his crutch all the while a stove hummed faintly in the middle of the room and from the halfopen kitchen door came ruddy light and the sound of something frying on the wall in brownish colors that seemed to have taken warmth from all the rich scents of food they had absorbed since the day of their painting were scenes of the butte as it was fancied to have once been with windmills and wide fields i want to travel henslowe was saying dragging out his words drowsily abyssinia patagonia turkestan the caucasus anywhere and everywhere what do you say you and i go out to new zealand and raise sheep but why not stay here there cant be anywhere as wonderful as this then ill put off starting for new guinea for a week but hell id go crazy staying anywhere after this its got into my bloodall this murder its made a wanderer of me thats what its done im an adventurer god i wish it had made me into anything so interesting tie a rock on to your scruples and throw em off the pont neuf and set out o boy this is the golden age for living by your wits youre not out of the army yet i should worry ill join the red cross how ive got a tip about it a girl with oval face and faint black down on her upper lip brought them soup a thick greenish colored soup that steamed richly into their faces if you tell me how i can get out of the army youll probably save my life said andrews seriously there are two waysoh but let me tell you later lets talk about something worth whileso you write music do you andrews nodded an omelet lay between them pale goldenyellow with flecks of green a few amber bubbles of burnt butter still clustered round the edges talk about tonepoems said henslowe but if you are an adventurer and have no scruples how is it you are still a private henslowe took a gulp of wine and laughed uproariously thats the joke they ate in silence for a little while they could hear the couple opposite them talking in low soft voices the stove purred and from the kitchen came a sound of something being beaten in a bowl andrews leaned back in his chair this is so wonderfully quiet and mellow he said it is so easy to forget that theres any joy at all in life rotits a circus parade have you ever seen anything drearier than a circus parade one of those jokes that arent funny justine encore du vin called henslowe so you know her name i live here the butte is the boss on the middle of the shield its the axle of the wheel thats why its so quiet like the centre of a cyclone of a vast whirling rotary circus parade justine with her red hands that had washed so many dishes off which other people had dined well put down between them a scarlet langouste of which claws and feelers sprawled over the tablecloth that already had a few purplish stains of wine the sauce was yellow and fluffy like the breast of a canary bird dyou know said andrews suddenly talking fast and excitedly while he brushed the straggling yellow hair off his forehead id almost be willing to be shot at the end of a year if i could live up here all that time with a piano and a million sheets of music paperit would be worth it but this is a place to come back to imagine coming back here after the highlands of thibet where youd nearly got drowned and scalped and had made love to the daughter of an afghan chief who had red lips smeared with loukoumi so that the sweet taste stayed in your mouth henslowe stroked softly his little brown mustache but whats the use of just seeing and feeling things if you cant express them whats the use of living at all for the fun of it man damn ends but the only profound fun i ever have is that andrewss voice broke o god i would give up every joy in the world if i could turn out one page that i felt was adequate dyou know its years since ive talked to anybody they both stared silently out of the window at the fog that was packed tightly against it like cotton wool only softer and a greenishgold color the mps sure wont get us tonight said henslowe banging his fist jauntily on the table ive a great mind to go to rue st anne and leave my card on the provost marshal god damn dyou remember that man who took the bite out of our winebottle he didnt give a hoot in hell did he talk about expression why dont you express that i think thats the turning point of your career thats what made you come to paris you cant deny it they both laughed loudly rolling about on their chairs andrews caught glints of contagion in the pale violet eyes of the lame boy and in the dark eyes of the girl lets tell them about it he said still laughing with his face bloodless after the months in hospital suddenly flushed salut said henslowe turning round and elevating his glass nous rions parceque nous sommes gris de vin gris then he told them about the man who ate glass he got to his feet and recounted slowly in his drawling voice with gestures justine stood by with a dish full of stuffed tomatoes of which the red skins showed vaguely through a mantle of dark brown sauce when she smiled her cheeks puffed out and gave her face a little of the look of a white cats and you live here asked andrews after they had all laughed always it is not often that i go down to town its so difficult i have a withered leg he smiled brilliantly like a child telling about a new toy and you how could i be anywhere else answered the girl its a misfortune but there it is she tapped with the crutch on the floor making a sound like someone walking with it the boy laughed and tightened his arm round her shoulder i should like to live here said andrews simply why dont you but dont you see hes a soldier whispered the girl hurriedly a frown wrinkled the boys forehead well it wasnt by choice i suppose he said andrews was silent unaccountable shame took possession of him before these people who had never been soldiers who would never be soldiers the greeks used to say he said bitterly using as phrase that had been a long time on his mind that when a man became a slave on the first day he lost onehalf of his virtue when a man becomes a slave repeated the lame boy softly on the first day he loses onehalf of his virtue whats the use of virtue it is love you need said the girl ive eaten your tomato friend andrews said henslowe justine will get us some more he poured out the last of the wine that half filled each of the glasses with its thin sparkle the color of red currants outside the fog had blotted everything out in even darkness which grew vaguely yellow and red near the sparsely scattered street lamps andrews and henslowe felt their way blindly down the long gleaming flights of steps that led from the quiet darkness of the butte towards the confused lights and noises of more crowded streets the fog caught in their throats and tingled in their noses and brushed against their cheeks like moist hands why did we go away from that restaurant id like to have talked to those people some more said andrews we havent had any coffee either but man were in paris were not going to be here long we cant afford to stay all the time in one place its nearly closing time already the boy was a painter he said he lived by making toys he whittles out wooden elephants and camels for noahs arks did you hear that they were walking fast down a straight sloping street below them already appeared the golden glare of a boulevard andrews went on talking almost to himself what a wonderful life that would be to live up here in a small room that would overlook the great rosy grey expanse of the city to have some absurd work like that to live on and to spend all your spare time working and going to concerts a quiet mellow existence think of my life beside it slaving in that iron metallic brazen new york to write ineptitudes about music in the sunday paper god and this they were sitting down at a table in a noisy cafe full of yellow light flashing in eyes and on glasses and bottles of red lips crushed against the thin hard rims of glasses wouldnt you like to just rip it off andrews jerked at his tunic with both hands where it bulged out over his chest oh id like to make the buttons fly all over the cafe smashing the liqueur glasses snapping in the faces of all those dandified french officers who look so proud of themselves that they survived long enough to be victorious the coffees famous here said henslowe the only place i ever had it better was at a bistro in nice on this last permission somewhere else again thats it for ever and ever somewhere else lets have some prunelle before the war prunelle the waiter was a solemn man with a beard cut like a prime ministers he came with the bottle held out before him religiously lifted his lips pursed with an air of intense application while he poured the white glinting liquid into the glasses when he had finished he held the bottle upside down with a tragic gesture not a drop came out it is the end of the good old times he said damnation to the good old times said henslowe heres to the good old new roughhousy circus parades i wonder how many people they are good for those circus parades of yours said andrews where are you going to spend the night said henslowe i dont know i suppose i can find a hotel or something why dont you come with me and see berthe she probably has friends i want to wander about alone not that i scorn berthes friends said andrewsbut i am so greedy for solitude john andrews was walking alone down streets full of drifting fog now and then a taxi dashed past him and clattered off into the obscurity scattered groups of people their footsteps hollow in the muffling fog floated about him he did not care which way he walked but went on and on crossing large crowded avenues where the lights embroidered patterns of gold and orange on the fog rolling in wide deserted squares diving into narrow streets where other steps sounded sharply for a second now and then and faded leaving nothing in his ears when he stopped still to listen but the citys distant muffled breathing at last he came out along the river where the fog was densest and coldest and where he could hear faintly the sound of water gurgling past the piers of bridges the glow of the lights glared and dimmed glared and dimmed as he walked along and sometimes he could make out the bare branches of trees blurred across the halos of the lamps the fog caressed him soothingly and shadows kept flicking past him giving him glimpses of smooth curves of cheeks and glints of eyes bright from the mist and darkness friendly familiar people seemed to fill the fog just out of his sight the muffled murmur of the city stirred him like the sound of the voices of friends from the girl at the crossroads singing under her streetlamp to the patrician pulling roses to pieces from the height of her litter all the imagining of your desire the murmur of life about him kept forming itself into long modulated sentences in his ears sentences that gave him by their form a sense of quiet wellbeing as if he were looking at a low relief of people dancing carved out of parian in some workshop in attica once he stopped and leaned for a long while against the moisturebeaded stern of a streetlamp two shadows defined as they strolled towards him into the forms of a pale boy and a bareheaded girl walking tightly laced in each others arms the boy limped a little and his violet eyes were contracted to wistfulness john andrews was suddenly filled with throbbing expectation as if those two would come up to him and put their hands on his arms and make some revelation of vast import to his life but when they reached the full glow of the lamp andrews saw that he was mistaken they were not the boy and girl he had talked to on the butte he walked off hurriedly and plunged again into tortuous streets where he strode over the cobblestone pavements stopping now and then to peer through the window of a shop at the light in the rear where a group of people sat quietly about a table under a light or into a bar where a tired little boy with heavy eyelids and sleeves rolled up from thin grey arms was washing glasses or an old woman a shapeless bundle of black clothes was swabbing the floor from doorways he heard talking and soft laughs upper windows sent yellow rays of light across the fog in one doorway the vague light from a lamp bracketed in the wall showed two figures pressed into one by their close embrace as andrews walked past his heavy army boots clattering loud on the wet pavement they lifted their heads slowly the boy had violet eyes and pale beardless cheeks the girl was bareheaded and kept her brown eyes fixed on the boys face andrewss heart thumped within him at last he had found them he made a step towards them and then strode on losing himself fast in the cool effacing fog again he had been mistaken the fog swirled about him hiding wistful friendly faces hands ready to meet his hands eyes ready to take fire with his glance lips cold with the mist to be crushed under his lips from the girl at the singing under her streetlamp and he walked on alone through the drifting fog iv andrews left the station reluctantly shivering in the raw grey mist under which the houses of the village street and the rows of motor trucks and the few figures of french soldiers swathed in long formless coats showed as vague dark blurs in the confused dawnlight his body felt flushed and sticky from a night spent huddled in the warm fetid air of an overcrowded compartment he yawned and stretched himself and stood irresolutely in the middle of the street with his pack biting into his shoulders out of sight behind the dark mass in which a few ruddy lights glowed of the station buildings the engine whistled and the train clanked off into the distance andrews listened to its faint reverberation through the mist with a sick feeling of despair it was the train that had brought him from paris back to his division as he stood shivering in the grey mist he remembered the curious despairing reluctance he used to suffer when he went back to boarding school after a holiday how he used to go from the station to the school by the longest road possible taking frantic account of every moment of liberty left him today his feet had the same leaden reluctance as when they used to all but refuse to take him up the long sandy hill to the school he wandered aimlessly for a while about the silent village hoping to find a cafe where he could sit for a few minutes to take a last look at himself before plunging again into the grovelling promiscuity of the army not a light showed all the shutters of the shabby little brick and plaster houses were closed with dull springless steps he walked down the road they had pointed out to him from the r t o overhead the sky was brightening giving the mist that clung to the earth in every direction ruddy billowing outlines the frozen road gave out a faint hard resonance under his footsteps occasionally the silhouette of a tree by the roadside loomed up in the mist ahead its uppermost branches clear and ruddy with sunlight andrews was telling himself that the war was over and that in a few months he would be free in any case what did a few months more or less matter but the same thoughts were swept recklessly away in the blind panic that was like a stampede of wild steers within him there was no arguing his spirit was contorted with revolt so that his flesh twitched and dark splotches danced before his eyes he wondered vaguely whether he had gone mad enormous plans kept rising up out of the tumult of his mind and dissolving suddenly like smoke in a high wind he would run away and if they caught him kill himself he would start a mutiny in his company he would lash all these men to frenzy by his words so that they too should refuse to form into guns so that they should laugh when the officers got red in the face shouting orders at them so that the whole division should march off over the frosty hills without arms without flags calling all the men of all the armies to join them to march on singing to laugh the nightmare out of their blood would not some lightning flash of vision sear peoples consciousness into life again what was the good of stopping the war if the armies continued but that was just rhetoric his mind was flooding itself with rhetoric that it might keep its sanity his mind was squeezing out rhetoric like a sponge that he might not see dry madness face to face and all the while his hard footsteps along the frozen road beat in his ears bringing him nearer to the village where the division was quartered he was climbing a long hill the mist thinned about him and became brilliant with sunlight then he was walking in the full sun over the crest of a hill with pale blue sky above his head behind him and before him were mistfilled valleys and beyond other ranges of long hills with reddishviolet patches of woodland glowing faintly in the sunlight in the valley at his feet he could see in the shadow of the hill he stood on a church tower and a few roofs rising out of the mist as out of water among the houses bugles were blowing messcall the jauntiness of the brassy notes ringing up through the silence was agony to him how long the day would be he looked at his watch it was seven thirty how did they come to be having mess so late the mist seemed doubly cold and dark when he was buried in it again after his moment of sunlight the sweat was chilled on his face and streaks of cold went through his clothes soaked from the effort of carrying the pack in the village street andrews met a man he did not know and asked him where the office was the man who was chewing something pointed silently to a house with green shutters on the opposite side of the street at a desk sat chrisfield smoking a cigarette when he jumped up andrews noticed that he had a corporals two stripes on his arm hello andy they shook hands warmly a you all right now ole boy sure im fine said andrews a sudden constraint fell upon them thats good said chrisfield youre a corporal now congratulations um hum made me moren a month ago they were silent chrisfield sat down in his chair again what sort of a town is this its a hellhole this dump is a hellhole thats nice goin to move soon tell me army o occupation but ah hadnt ought to have told you that dont tell any of the fellers wheres the outfit quartered ye wont know it weve got fifteen new men no account all of em second draft men civilians in the town you bet come with me andy an ahll tell em to give you some grub at the cookshack nowait a minute an youll miss the hike hikes every day since the goddam armistice they sent out a general order telling em to double up on the drill they heard a voice shouting orders outside and the narrow street filled up suddenly with a sound of boots beating the ground in unison andrews kept his back to the window something in his legs seemed to be tramping in time with the other legs there they go said chrisfield loots with em today want some grub if it aint been punk since the armistice the y hut was empty and dark through the grimy windowpanes could be seen fields and a leaden sky full of heavy ocherous light in which the leafless trees and the fields full of stubble were different shades of dead greyish brown andrews sat at the piano without playing he was thinking how once he had thought to express all the cramped boredom of this life the thwarted limbs regimented together lashed into straight lines the monotony of servitude unconsciously as he thought of it the fingers of one hand sought a chord which jangled in the badlytuned piano god how silly he muttered aloud pulling his hands away suddenly he began to play snatches of things he knew distorting them willfully mutilating the rhythm mixing into them snatches of ragtime the piano jangled under his hands filling the empty hut with clamor he stopped suddenly letting his fingers slide from bass to treble and began to play in earnest there was a cough behind him that had an artificial discreet ring to it he went on playing without turning round then a voice said beautiful beautiful andrews turned to find himself staring into a face of vaguely triangular shape with a wide forehead and prominent eyelids over protruding brown eyes the man wore a y m c a uniform which was very tight for him so that there were creases running from each button across the front of his tunic oh do go on playing its years since i heard any debussy it wasnt debussy oh wasnt it anyway it was just lovely do go on ill just stand here and listen andrews went on playing for a moment made a mistake started over made the same mistake banged on the keys with his fist and turned round again i cant play he said peevishly oh you can my boy you can where did you learn i would give a million dollars to play like that if i had it andrews glared at him silently you are one of the men just back from hospital i presume yes worse luck oh i dont blame you these french towns are the dullest places though i just love france dont you the y man had a faintly whining voice anywheres dull in the army look we must get to know each other real well my names spencer sheffieldspencer b sheffield and between you and me theres not a soul in the division you can talk to its dreadful not to have intellectual people about one i suppose youre from new york andrews nodded um hum so am i youre probably read some of my things in vain endeavor what youve never read vain endeavor i guess you didnt go round with the intellectual set musical people often dont of course i dont mean the village all anarchists and society women there ive never gone round with any set and i never never mind well fix that when we all get back to new york and now you just sit down

penneltons i may be related to the kaiser for all i know the penneltonsthats it you see my mother was a miss spencer from spencer falls virginia and her mother was a miss pennelton so you and i are cousins now isnt that a coincidence distant cousins but i must go back to the barracks come in and see me any time spencer b sheffield shouted after him you know where back of the shack and knock twice so ill know its you outside the house where he was quartered andrews met the new top sergeant a lean man with spectacles and a little mustache of the color and texture of a scrubbing brush heres a letter for you the top sergeant said better look at the new k p list ive just posted the letter was from henslowe andrews read it with a smile of pleasure in the faint afternoon light remembering henslowes constant drawling talk about distant places he had never been to and the man who had eaten glass and the day and a half in paris andy the letter began ive got the dope at last courses begin in paris february fifteenth apply at once to your c o to study somethin at university of paris any amount of lies will go apply all pull possible via sergeants lieutenants and their mistresses and laundresses yours henslowe his heart thumping andrews ran after the sergeant passing in his excitement a lieutenant without saluting him look here snarled the lieutenant andrews saluted and stood stiffly at attention why didnt you salute me i was in a hurry sir and didnt see you i was going on very urgent company business sir remember that just because the armistice is signed you neednt think youre out of the army at ease andrews saluted the lieutenant saluted turned swiftly on his heel and walked away andrews caught up to the sergeant sergeant coffin can i speak to you a minute im in a hell of a hurry have you heard anything about this army students corps to send men to universities here in france something the y m c as getting up cant be for enlisted men no i aint heard a word about it dyou want to go to school again if i get a chance to finish my course college man are ye so am i well ill let you know if i get any general order about it cant do anything without getting a general order about it looks to me like its all bushwa i guess youre right the street was grey dark stung by a sense of impotence surging with despairing rebelliousness andrews hurried back towards the buildings where the company was quartered he would be late for mess the grey street was deserted from a window here and there ruddy light streamed out to make a glowing oblong on the wall of a house opposite goddam it if ye dont believe me you go ask the lootenant look here toby didnt our outfit see hotter work than any goddam engineers toby had just stepped into the cafe a tall man with a brown bulldog face and a scar on his left cheek he spoke rarely and solemnly with a maine coast yankee twang i reckon so was all he said he sat down on the bench beside the other man who went on bitterly i guess you would reckon so hell man you ditch diggers aint in it ditch diggers the engineer banged his fist down on the table his lean pickled face was a furious red i guess we dont dig half so many ditches as the infantry doesan when weve dug em we dont crawl into em an stay there like goddam cottontailed jackrabbits you guys dont git near enough to the front like goddam cottontailed jackrabbits shouted the picklefaced engineer again roaring with laughter aint that so he looked round the room for approval the benches at the two long tables were filled with infantry men who looked at him angrily noticing suddenly that he had no support he moderated his voice the infantrys damn necessary ill admit that but whered you fellers be without us guys to string the barbed wire for you there warnt no barbed wire strung in the oregon forest where we was boy what dye want barbed wire when youre advancin for look hereill bet you a bottle of cognac my company had more losses than yourn

that to you hand over the cognac like hell we had fifteen killed and twenty wounded too didnt we toby i reckon youre right said toby aint i right asked the other man addressing the company generally sure goddam right muttered voices well i guess its all off then said the engineer no it aint said toby reckon up yer wounded the feller whos got the worst wounded gets the cognac aint that fair sure weve had seven fellers sent home already said the engineer weve had eight aint we sure growled everybody in the room how bad was they two of em was blind said toby hell said the engineer jumping to his feet as if taking a trick at poker we had a guy who was sent home without arms nor legs and three fellers got tb from bein gassed john andrews had been sitting in a corner of the room he got up something had made him think of the man he had known in the hospital who had said that was the life to make a feller feel fit getting up at three oclock in the morning you jumped out of bed just like a cat he remembered how the olivedrab trousers had dangled empty from the mans chair thats nothing one of our sergeants had to have a new nose grafted on the village street was dark and deeply rutted with mud andrews wandered up and down aimlessly there was only one other cafe that would be just like this one he couldnt go back to the desolate barn where he slept it would be too early to go to sleep a cold wind blew down the street and the sky was full of vague movement of dark clouds the partlyfrozen mud clotted about his feet as he walked along he could feel the water penetrating his shoes opposite the y m c a hut at the end of the street he stopped after a moments indecision he gave a little laugh and walked round to the back where the door of the y mans room was he knocked twice half hoping there would be no reply sheffields whining highpitched voice said who is it andrews come right in youre just the man i wanted to see andrews stood with his hand on the knob do sit down and make yourself right at home spencer sheffield was sitting at a little desk in a room with walls of unplaned boards and one small window behind the desk were piles of cracker boxes and cardboard cases of cigarettes and in the midst of them a little opening like that of a railway ticket office in the wall through which the y man sold his commodities to the long lines of men who would stand for hours waiting meekly in the room beyond andrews was looking round for a chair oh i just forgot im sitting in the only chair said spencer sheffield laughing twisting his small mouth into a shape like a camels mouth and rolling about his large protruding eyes oh thats all right what i wanted to ask you was do you know anything about look do come with me to my room interrupted sheffield ive got such a nice sittingroom with an open fire just next to lieutenant bleezer an there well talkabout everything im just dying to talk to somebody about the things of the spirit do you know anything about a scheme for sending enlisted men to french universities men who have not finished their courses oh wouldnt that be just fine i tell you boy theres nothing like the u s government to think of things like that but have you heard anything about it no but i surely shall dyou mind switching the light off thats it now just follow me oh i do need a rest ive been working dreadfully hard since that knights of columbus man came down here isnt it hateful the way they try to run down the y now we can have a nice long talk you must tell me all about yourself but dont you really know anything about that university scheme they say it begins february fifteenth andrews said in a low voice ill ask lieutenant bleezer if he knows anything about it said sheffield soothingly throwing an arm around andrewss shoulder and pushing him in the door ahead of him they went through a dark hall to a little room where a fire burned brilliantly in the hearth lighting up with tongues of red and yellow a square black walnut table and two heavy armchairs with leather backs and bottoms that shone like lacquer this is wonderful said andrews involuntarily romantic i call it makes you think of dickens doesnt it and locksley hall yes said andrews vaguely have you been in france long asked andrews settling himself in one of the chairs and looking into the dancing flames of the log fire will you smoke he handed sheffield a crumpled cigarette no thanks i only smoke special kinds i have a weak heart thats why i was rejected from the army oh but i think it was superb of you to join as a private it was my dream to do that to be one of the nameless marching throng i think it was damn foolish not to say criminal said andrews sullenly still staring into the fire you cant mean that or do you mean that you think you had abilities which would have been worth more to your country in another position i have many friends who felt that no i dont think its right of a man to go back on himself i dont think butchering people ever does any good i have acted as if i did think it did goodout of carelessness or cowardice one or the other that i think bad you mustnt talk that way said sheffield hurriedly so you are a musician are you he asked the question with a jaunty confidential air i used to play the piano a little if thats what you mean said andrews music has never been the art i had most interest in but many things have moved me intensely debussy and those beautiful little things of nevins you must know them poetry has been more my field when i was young younger than you are quite a ladoh if we could only stay young i am thirtytwo i dont see that youth by itself is worth much its the most superb medium there is though for other things said andrews well i must go he said if you do hear anything about that university scheme you will let me know wont you indeed i shall dear boy indeed i shall they shook hands in jerky dramatic fashion and andrews stumbled down the dark hall to the door when he stood out in the raw night air again he drew a deep breath by the light that streamed out from a window he looked at his watch there was time to go to the regimental sergeantmajors office before tattoo at the opposite end of the village street from the y m c a hut was a cubeshaped house set a little apart from the rest in the middle of a broad lawn which the constant crossing and recrossing of a staff of cars and trains of motor trucks had turned into a muddy morass in which the wheel tracks crisscrossed in every direction a narrow board walk led from the main road to the door in the middle of this walk andrews met a captain and automatically got off into the mud and saluted the regimental office was a large room that had once been decorated by wan and illdrawn mural paintings in the manner of puvis de chavannes but the walls had been so chipped and soiled by five years of military occupation that they were barely recognisable only a few bits of bare flesh and floating drapery showed here and there above the maps and notices that were tacked on the walls at the end of the room a group of nymphs in nile green and pastel blue could be seen emerging from under a french war loan poster the ceiling was adorned with an oval of flowers and little plaster cupids in low relief which had also suffered and in places showed the laths the office was nearly empty the littered desks and silent typewriters gave a strange air of desolation to the gutted drawingroom andrews walked boldly to the furthest desk where a little red card leaning against the typewriter said regimental sergeantmajor behind the desk crouched over a heap of typewritten reports sat a little man with scanty sandy hair who screwed up his eyes and smiled when andrews approached the desk well did you fix it up for me he asked fix what said andrews oh i thought you were someone else the smile left the regimental sergeantmajors thin lips what do you want why regimental sergeantmajor can you tell me anything about a scheme to send enlisted men to colleges over here can you tell me who to apply to according to what general orders and who told you to come and see me about it anyway have you heard anything about it no nothing definite im busy now anyway ask one of your own noncoms to find out about it he crouched once more over the papers andrews was walking towards the door flushing with annoyance when he saw that the man at the desk by the window was jerking his head in a peculiar manner just in the direction of the regimental sergeantmajor and then towards the door andrews smiled at him and nodded outside the door where an orderly sat on a short bench reading a torn saturday evening post andrews waited the hall was part of what must have been a ballroom for it had a muchscarred hardwood floor and big spaces of bare plaster framed by giltand lavendercolored mouldings which had probably held tapestries the partition of unplaned boards that formed other offices cut off the major part of a highly decorated ceiling where cupids with crimsondaubed bottoms swam in all attitudes in a sea of pinkand blueand lavendercolored clouds wreathing themselves coyly in heavy garlands of waxy hothouse flowers while cornucopias spilling out squashy fruits gave andrews a feeling of distinct insecurity as he looked up from below say are you a kappa mu andrews looked down suddenly and saw in front of him the man who had signalled to him in the regimental sergeantmajors office are you a kappa mu he asked again no not that i know of stammered andrews puzzled what school did you go to harvard harvard guess we havent got a chapter there im from north western anyway you want to go to school in france here if you can so do i dont you want to come and have a drink the man frowned pulled his overseas cap down over his forehead where the hair grew very low and looked about him mysteriously yes he said they splashed together down the muddy village street weve got thirteen minutes before tattoo my names walters whats yours he spoke in a low voice in short staccato phrases andrews andrews youve got to keep this dark if everybody finds out about it were through its a shame youre not a kappa mu but college men have got to stick together thats the way i look at it oh ill keep it dark enough said andrews its too good to be true the general order isnt out yet but ive seen a preliminary circular what school dyou want to go to sorbonne paris thats the stuff dyou know the back room at baboons walters turned suddenly to the left up an alley and broke through a hole in a hawthorn hedge a guys got to keep his eyes and ears open if he wants to get anywhere in this army he said as they ducked in the back door of a cottage andrews caught a glimpse of the billowy line of a tile roof against the lighter darkness of the sky they sat down on a bench built into a chimney where a few sticks made a splutter of flames monsieur desire a redfaced girl with a baby in her arms came up to them thats babette baboon i call her said walters with a laugh chocolat said walters thatll suit me all right its my treat remember im not forgetting it now lets get to business what you do is this you write an application ill make that out for you on the typewriter tomorrow and you meet me here at eight tomorrow night and ill give it to you you sign it at once and hand it in to your sergeant see thisll just be a preliminary application when the orders out youll have to make another the woman this time without the baby appeared out of the darkness of the room with a candle and two cracked bowls from which steam rose faint primrosecolor in the candle light walters drank his bowl down at a gulp grunted and went on talking give me a cigarette will you youll have to make it out darn soon too because once the orders out every son of a gun in the divisionll be making out to be a college man how did you get your tip from a fellow in paris youve been to paris have you said walters admiringly is it the way they say it is gee these french are immoral look at this woman here shell sleep with a feller soon as not got a baby too but who do the applications go in to to the colonel or whoever he appoints to handle it you a catholic no neither am i thats the hell of it the regimental sergeantmajor is well i guess you havent noticed the way things run up at divisional headquarters its a regular cathedral isnt a mason in it but i must beat it better pretend you dont know me if you meet me on the street see all right walters hurried out of the door andrews sat alone looking at the flutter of little flames about the pile of sticks on the hearth while he sipped chocolate from the warm bowl held between the palms of both hands he remembered a speech out of some very bad romantic play he had heard when he was very small about your head i flingthe curse of rome he started to laugh sliding back and forth on the smooth bench which had been polished by the breeches of generations warming their feet at the fire the redfaced woman stood with her hands on her hips looking at him in astonishment while he laughed and laughed mais quelle gaite quelle gaite she kept saying the straw under him rustled faintly with every sleepy movement andrews made in his blankets in a minute the bugle was going to blow and he was going to jump out of his blankets throw on his clothes and fall into line for roll call in the black mud of the village street it couldnt be that only a month had gone by since he had got back from hospital no he had spent a lifetime in this village being dragged out of his warm blankets every morning by the bugle shivering as he stood in line for roll call shuffling in a line that moved slowly past the cookshack shuffling along in another line to throw what was left of his food into garbage cans to wash his mess kit in the greasy water a hundred other men had washed their mess kits in lining up to drill to march on along muddy roads splattered by the endless trains of motor trucks lining up twice more for mess and at last being forced by another bugle into his blankets again to sleep heavily while a smell hung in his nostrils of sweating woolen clothing and breathedout air and dusty blankets in a minute the bugle was going to blow to snatch him out of even these miserable thoughts and throw him into an automaton under other mens orders childish spiteful desires surged into his mind if the bugler would only die he could picture him a little man with a broad face and puttycolored cheeks a small rusty mustache and bowlegs lying like a calf on a marble slab in a butchers shop on top of his blankets what nonsense there were other buglers he wondered how many buglers there were in the army he could picture them all in dirty little villages in stone barracks in towns in great camps that served the country for miles with rows of black warehouses and narrow barrack buildings standing with their feet a little apart giving their little brass bugles a preliminary tap before putting out their cheeks and blowing in them and stealing a million and a half or was it two million or three million lives and throwing the warm sentient bodies into coarse automatons who must be kept busy lest they grow restive till killing time began again the bugle blew with the last jaunty notes a stir went through the barn corporal chrisfield stood on the ladder that led up from the yard his head on a level with the floor shouting shake it up fellers if a guys late to roll call its k p for a week as andrews while buttoning his tunic passed him on the ladder he whispered tell me were going to see service again andy army o occupation while he stood stiffly at attention waiting to answer when the sergeant called his name andrewss mind was whirling in crazy circles of anxiety what if they should leave before the general order came on the university plan the application would certainly be lost in the confusion of moving the division and he would be condemned to keep up this life for more dreary weeks and months would any years of work and happiness in some future existence make up for the humiliating agony of this servitude dismissed he ran up the ladder to fetch his mess kit and in a few minutes was in line again in the rutted village street where the grey houses were just forming outlines as light crept slowly into the leaden sky while a faint odor of bacon and coffee came to him making him eager for food eager to drown his thoughts in the heaviness of swiftlyeaten greasy food and in the warmth of watery coffee gulped down out of a tincurved cup he was telling himself desperately that he must do something that he must make an effort to save himself that he must fight against the deadening routine that numbed him later while he was sweeping the rough board floor of the companys quarters the theme came to him which had come to him long ago in a former incarnation it seemed when he was smearing windows with soap from a gritty sponge along the endless side of the barracks in the training camp time and time again in the past year he had thought of it and dreamed of weaving it into a fabric of sound which would express the trudging monotony of days bowed under the yoke under the yoke that would be a title for it he imagined the sharp tap of the conductors baton the silence of a crowded hall the first notes rasping bitterly upon the tense ears of men and women but as he tried to concentrate his mind on the music other things intruded upon it blurred it he kept feeling the rhythm of the queen of sheba slipping from the shoulders of her gaudily caparisoned elephant advancing towards him through the torchlight putting her hand fantastic with rings and long gilded fingernails upon his shoulders so that ripples of delight at all the voluptuous images of his desire went through his whole body making it quiver like a flame with yearning for unimaginable things it all muddled into fantastic gibberish into sounds of horns and trombones and double basses blown off key while a piccolo shrilled the first bars of the star spangled banner he had stopped sweeping and looked about him dazedly he was alone outside he heard a sharp voice call attenshun he ran down the ladder and fell in at the end of the line under the angry glare of the lieutenants small eyes which were placed very close together on either side of a lean nose black and hard like the eyes of a crab the company marched off through the mud to the drill field after retreat andrews knocked at the door at the back of the y m c a but as there was no reply he strode off with a long determined stride to sheffields room in the moment that elapsed between his knock and an answer he could feel his heart thumping a little sweat broke out on his temples why whats the matter boy you look all wrought up said sheffield holding the door half open and blocking with his lean form entrance to the room may i come in i want to talk to you said andrews oh i suppose itll be all right you see i have an officer with me then there was a flutter in sheffields voice oh do come in he went on with sudden enthusiasm lieutenant bleezer is fond of music too lieutenant this is the boy i was telling you about we must get him to play for us if he had the opportunities i am sure hed be a famous musician lieutenant bleezer was a dark youth with a hooked nose and pincenez his tunic was unbuttoned and he held a cigar in his hand he smiled in an evident attempt to put this enlisted man at his ease yes i am very fond of music modern music he said leaning against the mantelpiece are you a musician by profession not exactlynearly andrews thrust his hands into the bottoms of his trouser pockets and looked from one to the other with a certain defiance i suppose youve played in some orchestra how is it you are not in the regimental band no except the pierian the pierian were you at harvard andrews nodded so was i isnt that a coincidence said sheffield im so glad i just insisted on your coming in what year were you asked lieutenant bleezer with a faint change of tone drawing a finger along his scant black moustache fifteen i havent graduated yet said the lieutenant with a laugh what i wanted to ask you mr sheffield oh my boy my boy you know youve known me long enough to call me spence broke in sheffield i want to know went on andrews speaking slowly can you help me to get put on the list to be sent to the university of paris i know that a list has been made out although the general order has not come yet i am disliked by most of the noncoms and i dont see how i can get on without somebodys helpi simply cant go this life any longer andrews closed his lips firmly and looked at the ground his face flushing well a man of your attainments certainly ought to go said lieutenant bleezer with a faint tremor of hesitation in his voice im going to oxford myself trust me my boy said sheffield ill fix it up for you i promise lets shake hands on it he seized andrewss hand and pressed it warmly in a moist palm if its within human power within human power he added well i must go said lieutenant bleezer suddenly striding to the door i promised the marquise id drop in goodbye take a cigar wont you he held out three cigars in the direction of andrews no thank you oh dont you think the old aristocracy of france is just too wonderful lieutenant bleezer goes almost every evening to call on the marquise de rompemouville he says she is just too spirituelle for words he often meets the commanding officer there andrews had dropped into a chair and sat with his face buried in his hands looking through his fingers at the fire where a few white fingers of flame were clutching intermittently at a grey beech log his mind was searching desperately for expedients he got to his feet and shouted shrilly i cant go this life any more do you hear that no possible future is worth all this if i can get to paris all right if not ill desert and damn the consequences but ive already promised ill do all i can well do it now interrupted andrews brutally all right ill go and see the colonel and tell him what a great musician you are lets go together now but thatll look queer dear boy i dont give a damn come along you can talk to him you seem to be thick with all the officers you must wait till i tidy up said sheffield all right andrews strode up and down in the mud in front of the house snapping his fingers with impatience until sheffield came out then they walked off in silence now wait outside a minute whispered sheffield when they came to the white house with bare grapevines over the front where the colonel lived after a wait andrews found himself at the door of a brilliantlylighted drawing room there was a dense smell of cigar smoke the colonel an elderly man with a benevolent beard stood before him with a coffee cup in his hand andrews saluted punctiliously they tell me you are quite a pianist sorry i didnt know it before said the colonel in a kindly tone you want to go to paris to study under this new scheme yes sir what a shame i didnt know before the list of the men going is all made out of course perhaps at the last minuteif somebody else doesnt goyour name can go in the colonel smiled graciously and turned back into the room thank you colonel said andrews saluting without a word to sheffield he strode off down the dark village street towards his quarters andrews stood on the broad village street where the mud was nearly dry and a wind streaked with warmth ruffled the few puddles he was looking into the window of the cafe to see if there was anyone he knew inside from whom he could borrow money for a drink it was two months since he had had any pay and his pockets were empty the sun had just set on a premature spring afternoon flooding the sky and the grey houses and the tumultuous tiled roofs with warm violet light the faint premonition of the stirring of life in the cold earth that came to andrews with every breath he drew of the sparkling wind stung his dull boredom to fury it was the first of march he was telling himself over and over again the fifteenth of february he had expected to be in paris free or halffree at least able to work it was the first of march and here he was still helpless still tied to the monotonous wheel of routine incapable of any real effort spending his spare time wandering like a lost dog up and down this muddy street from the y m c a hut at one end of the village to the church and the fountain in the middle and to the divisional headquarters at the other end then back again looking listlessly into windows staring in peoples faces without seeing them he had given up all hope of being sent to paris he had given up thinking about it or about anything the same dull irritation of despair droned constantly in his head grinding round and round like a broken phonograph record after looking a long while in the window of the cafe of the braves allies he walked a little down the street and stood in the same position staring into the repos du poilu where a large sign american spoken blocked up half the window two officers passed his hand snapped up to the salute automatically like a mechanical signal it was nearly dark after a while he began to feel serious coolness in the wind shivered and started to wander aimlessly down the street he recognised walters coming towards him and was going to pass him without speaking when walters bumped into him muttered in his ear come to baboons and hurried off with his swift businesslike stride andrews stood irresolutely for a while with his head bent then went with unresilient steps up the alley through the hole in the hedge and into babettes kitchen there was no fire he stared morosely at the grey ashes until he heard walterss voice beside him ive got you all fixed up what do you mean meanare you asleep andrews theyve cut a name off the school list thats all now if you shake a leg and somebody doesnt get in ahead of you youll be in paris before you know it thats damn decent of you to come and tell me heres your application said walters drawing a paper out of his pocket take it to the colonel get him to o k it and then rush it up to the sergeantmajors office yourself they are making out travel orders now so long walters had vanished andrews was alone again staring at the grey ashes suddenly he jumped to his feet and hurried off towards headquarters in the anteroom to the colonels office he waited a long while looking at his boots that were thickly coated with mud those boots will make a bad impression those boots will make a bad impression a voice was saying over and over again inside of him a lieutenant was also waiting to see the colonel a young man with pink cheeks and a milkywhite forehead who held his hat in one hand with a pair of khakicolored kid gloves and kept passing a hand over his light wellbrushed hair andrews felt dirty and illsmelling in his badlyfitting uniform the sight of this perfect young man in his whipcord breeches with his manicured nails and immaculately polished puttees exasperated him he would have liked to fight him to prove that he was the better man to outwit him to make him forget his rank and his important air the lieutenant had gone in to see the colonel andrews found himself reading a chart of some sort tacked up on the wall there were names and dates and figures but he could not make out what it was about all right go ahead whispered the orderly to him and he was standing with his cap in his hand before the colonel who was looking at him severely fingering the papers he had on the desk with a heavily veined hand andrews saluted the colonel made an impatient gesture may i speak to you colonel about the school scheme i suppose youve got permission from somebody to come to me no sir andrewss mind was struggling to find something to say well youd better go and get it but colonel there isnt time the travel orders are being made out at this minute ive heard that theres been a name crossed out on the list too late but colonel you dont know how important it is i am a musician by trade if i cant get into practice again before being demobilized i shant be able to get a job i have a mother and an old aunt dependent on me my family has seen better days you see sir its only by being high up in my profession that i can earn enough to give them what they are accustomed to and a man in your position in the world colonel must know what even a few months of study in paris mean to a pianist the colonel smiled lets see your application he said andrews handed it to him with a trembling hand the colonel made a few marks on one corner with a pencil now if you can get that to the sergeantmajor in time to have your name included in the orders well and good andrews saluted and hurried out a sudden feeling of nausea had come over him he was hardly able to control a mad desire to tear the paper up the sons of bitchesthe sons of bitches he muttered to himself still he ran all the way to the square isolated building where the regimental office was he stopped panting in front of the desk that bore the little red card regimental sergeantmajor the regimental sergeantmajor looked up at him enquiringly heres an application for school at the sorbonne sergeant colonel wilkins told me to run up to you with it said he was very anxious to have it go in at once too late said the regimental sergeantmajor but the colonel said it had to go in cant help it too late said the regimental sergeantmajor andrews felt the room and the men in their olivedrab shirt sleeves at the typewriters and the three nymphs creeping from behind the french war loan poster whirl round his head suddenly he heard a voice behind him is the name andrews john sarge how the hell should i know said the regimental sergeantmajor because ive got it in the orders already i dont know how it got in the voice was walterss voice staccatto and businesslike well then why dyou want to bother me about it give me that paper the regimental sergeantmajor jerked the paper out of andrewss hand and looked at it savagely all right you leave tomorrow a copy of the ordersll go to your company in the morning growled the regimental sergeantmajor andrews looked hard at walters as he went out but got no glance in return when he stood in the air again disgust surged up within him bitterer than before the fury of his humiliation made tears start in his eyes he walked away from the village down the main road splashing carelessly through the puddles slipping in the wet clay of the ditches something within him like the voice of a wounded man swearing was whining in his head long strings of filthy names after walking a long while he stopped suddenly with his fists clenched it was completely dark the sky was faintly marbled by a moon behind the clouds on both sides of the road rose the tall grey skeletons of poplars when the sound of his footsteps stopped he heard a faint lisp of running water standing still in the middle of the road he felt his feelings gradually relax he said aloud in a low voice several times you are a damn fool john andrews and started walking slowly and thoughtfully back to the village v andrews felt an arm put round his shoulder ahve been to hell an gone lookin for you andy said chrisfields voice in his ear jerking him out of the reverie he walked in he could feel in his face chrisfields breath heavy with cognac im going to paris tomorrow chris said andrews ah know it boy ah know it thats why i was that right smart to talk to you you doan want to go to paris why doan ye come up to germany with us tell me they live like kings up there all right said andrews lets go to the back room at babettes chrisfield hung on his shoulder walking unsteadily beside him at the hole in the hedge chrisfield stumbled and nearly pulled them both down they laughed and still laughing staggered into the dark kitchen where they found the redfaced woman with her baby sitting beside the fire with no other light than the flicker of the rare flames that shot up from a little mass of wood embers the baby started crying shrilly when the two soldiers stamped in the woman got up and talking automatically to the baby all the while went off to get a light and wine andrews looked at chrisfields face by the firelight his cheeks had lost the faint childish roundness they had had when andrews had first talked to him sweeping up cigarette butts off the walk in front of the barracks at the training camp ah tell you boy you ought to come with us to germany nauthin but whores in paris the trouble is chris that i dont want to live like a king or a sergeant or a majorgeneral i want to live like john andrews what yer goin to do in paris andy study music ah guess some day ahll go into a movie show an when they turn on

funny aint it you an me was right smart friends onct guess its bein a noncom andrews did not answer chrisfield sat silent with his eyes on the fire well ah got him gawd it was easy he said suddenly what do you mean ah got him thats all you mean chrisfield nodded umhum in the oregon forest he said andrews said nothing he felt suddenly very tired he thought of men he had seen in attitudes of death ah wouldnt ha thought it had been so easy said chrisfield the woman came through the door at the end of the kitchen with a candle in her hand chrisfield stopped speaking suddenly tomorrow im going to paris cried andrews boisterously its the end of soldiering for me ah bet itll be some sport in germany andy sarge says well be goin up to coabwhats its name coblenz chrisfield poured a glass of wine out and drank it off smacking his lips after it and wiping his mouth on the back of his hand dye remember andy we was both of us brushin cigarette butts at that bloody trainin camp when we first met up with each other considerable water has run under the bridge since then ah reckon we wont meet up again mos likely hell why not they were silent again staring at the fading embers of the fire in the dim edge of the candlelight the woman stood with her hands on her hips looking at them fixedly reckon a feller wouldnt know what to do with himself if he did get out of the armynow would he andy so long chris im beating it said andrews in a harsh voice jumping to his feet so long andy ole man ahll pay for the drinks chrisfield was beckoning with his hand to the redfaced woman who advanced slowly through the candlelight thanks chris andrews strode away from the door a cold needlelike rain was falling he pulled up his coat collar and ran down the muddy village street towards his quarters vi in the opposite corner of the compartment andrews could see walters hunched up in an attitude of sleep with his cap pulled down far over his eyes his mouth was open and his head wagged with the jolting of the train the shade over the light plunged the compartment in darkblue obscurity which made the night sky outside the window and the shapes of trees and houses evolving and pirouetting as they glided by seem very near andrews felt no desire to sleep he had sat a long time leaning his head against the frame of the window looking out at the fleeing shadows and the occasional little redgreen lights that darted by and the glow of the stations that flared for a moment and were lost in dark silhouettes of unlighted houses and skeleton trees and black hillsides he was thinking how all the epochs in his life seemed to have been marked out by railway rides at night the jolting rumble of the wheels made the blood go faster through his veins made him feel acutely the clattering of the train along the gleaming rails spurning fields and trees and houses piling up miles and miles between the past and future the gusts of cold night air when he opened the window and the faint whiffs of steam and coal gas that tingled in his nostrils excited him like a smile on a strange face seen for a moment in a crowded street he did not think of what he had left behind he was straining his eyes eagerly through the darkness towards the vivid life he was going to live boredom and abasement were over he was free to work and hear music and make friends he drew deep breaths warm waves of vigor seemed flowing constantly from his lungs and throat to his finger tips and down through his body and the muscles of his legs he looked at his watch one in six hours he would be in paris for six hours he would sit there looking out at the fleeting shadows of the countryside feeling in his blood the eager throb of the train rejoicing in every mile the train carried him away from things past walters still slept half slipping off the seat with his mouth open and his overcoat bundled round his head andrews looked out of the window feeling in his nostrils the tingle of steam and coal gas a phrase out of some translation of the iliad came to his head ambrosial night night ambrosial unending but better than sitting round a camp fire drinking wine and water and listening to the boastful yarns of longhaired achaeans was this hustling through the countryside away from the monotonous whine of past unhappiness towards joyousness and life andrews began to think of the men he had left behind they were asleep at this time of night in barns and barracks or else standing on guard with cold damp feet and cold hands which the icy rifle barrel burned when they tended it he might go far away out of sound of the tramp of marching away from the smell of overcrowded barracks where men slept in rows like cattle but he would still be one of them he would not see an officer pass him without an unconscious movement of servility he would not hear a bugle without feeling sick with hatred if he could only express these thwarted lives the miserable dullness of industrialized slaughter it might have been almost worth while for him for the others it would never be worth while but youre talking as if you were out of the woods youre a soldier still john andrews the words formed themselves in his mind as vividly as if he had spoken them he smiled bitterly and settled himself again to watch silhouettes of trees and hedges and houses and hillsides fleeing against the dark sky when he awoke the sky was grey the train was moving slowly clattering loudly over switches through a town of wet slate roofs that rose in fantastic patterns of shadow above the blue mist walters was smoking a cigarette god these french trains are rotten he said when he noticed that andrews was awake the most inefficient country i ever was in anyway inefficiency be damned broke in andrews jumping up and stretching himself he opened the window the heatings too damned efficient i think were near paris the cold air with a flavor of mist in it poured into the stuffy compartment every breath was joy andrews felt a crazy buoyancy bubbling up in him the rumbling clatter of the train wheels sang in his ears he threw himself on his back on the dusty blue seat and kicked his heels in the air like a colt liven up for gods sake man he shouted were getting near paris we are lucky bastards said walters grinning with the cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth im going to see if i can find the rest of the gang andrews alone in the compartment found himself singing at the top of his lungs as the day brightened the mist lifted off the flat lindengreen fields intersected by rows of leafless poplars salmoncolored houses with blue roofs wore already a faintly citified air they passed brickkilns and clayquarries with reddish puddles of water in the bottom of them crossed a jadegreen river where a long file of canal boats with bright paint on their prows moved slowly the engine whistled shrilly they clattered through a small freight yard and rows of suburban houses began to form at first chaotically in broad patches of gardenland and then in orderly ranks with streets between and shops at the corners a darkgrey dripping wall rose up suddenly and blotted out the view the train slowed down and went through several stations crowded with people on their way to work ordinary people in varied clothes with only here and there a blue or khaki uniform then there was more darkgrey wall and the obscurity of wide bridges under which dusty oil lamps burned orange and red making a gleam on the wet wall above them and where the wheels clanged loudly more freight yards and the train pulled slowly past other trains full of faces and silhouettes of people to stop with a jerk in a station and andrews was standing on the grey cement platform sniffing smells of lumber and merchandise and steam his ungainly pack and blanketroll he carried on his shoulder like a cross he had left his rifle and cartridge belt carefully tucked out of sight under the seat walters and five other men straggled along the platform towards him carrying or dragging their packs there was a look of apprehension on walterss face well what do we do now he said do cried andrews and he burst out laughing prostrate bodies in olive drab hid the patch of tender green grass by the roadside the company was resting chrisfield sat on a stump morosely whittling at a stick with a pocket knife judkins was stretched out beside him what the hell do they make us do this damn hikin for corp guess theyre askeered well forgit how to walk well aint it better than loafin around yer billets all day thinkin

the whistle blew the patch of grass became unbroken green again as the men lined up along the side of the road fall in called the sergeant attenshun right dress front god you guys havent got no snap in yer stick yer belly in you you know better than to stand like that squads right march hep hep hep the company tramped off along the muddy road their steps were all the same length their arms swung in the same rhythm their faces were cowed into the same expression their thoughts were the same the tramp tramp of their steps died away along the road birds were singing among the budding trees the young grass by the roadside kept the marks of the soldiers bodies part five the world outside i andrews and six other men from his division sat at a table outside the cafe opposite the gare de lest he leaned back in his chair with a cup of coffee lifted looking across it at the stone houses with many balconies steam scented of milk and coffee rose from the cup as he sipped from it his ears were full of a rumble of traffic and a clacking of heels as people walked briskly by along the damp pavements for a while he did not hear what the men he was sitting with were saying they talked and laughed but he looked beyond their khaki uniforms and their boatshaped caps unconsciously he was taken up with the smell of the coffee and of the mist a little rusty sunshine shone on the table of the cafe and on the thin varnish of wet mud that covered the asphalt pavement looking down the avenue away from the station the houses dark grey tending to greenish in the shadow and to violet in the sun faded into a soft haze of distance dull gilt lettering glittered along black balconies in the foreground were men and women walking briskly their cheeks whipped a little into color by the rawness of the morning the sky was a faintly roseate grey walters was speaking the first thing i want to see is the eiffel tower why dyou want to see that said the small sergeant with a black mustache and rings round his eyes like a monkey why man dont you know that everything begins from the eiffel tower if it werent for the eiffel tower there wouldnt be any skyscrapers how about the flatiron building and brooklyn bridge they were built before the eiffel tower werent they interrupted the man from new york the eiffel towers the first piece of complete girder construction in the whole world reiterated walters dogmatically first thing im going to dos go to the folies berdjairs me for the wws better lay off the wild women bill said walters i aint goin to look at a woman said the sergeant with the black mustache i guess i seen enough women in my time anyway the wars over anyway you just wait kid till you fasten your lamps on a real parizianne said a burly unshaven man with a corporals stripes on his arm roaring with laughter andrews lost track of the talk again staring dreamily through halfclosed eyes down the long straight street where greens and violets and browns merged into a bluish grey monochrome at a little distance he wanted to be alone to wander at random through the city to stare dreamily at people and things to talk by chance to men and women to sink his life into the misty sparkling life of the streets the smell of the mist brought a memory to his mind for a long while he groped for it until suddenly he remembered his dinner with henslowe and the faces of the boy and girl he had talked to on the butte he must find henslowe at once a seconds fierce resentment went through him against all these people about him christ he must get away from them all his freedom had been hard enough won he must enjoy it to the uttermost say im going to stick to you andy walterss voice broke into his reverie im going to appoint you the corps of interpreters andrews laughed dyou know the way to the school headquarters the r t o said take the subway im going to walk said andrews youll get lost wont you no danger worse luck said andrews getting to his feet ill see you fellows at the school headquarters whatever those are so long say andy ill wait for you there walters called after him andrews darted down a side street he could hardly keep from shouting aloud when he found himself alone free with days and days ahead of him to work and think gradually to rid his limbs of the stiff attitudes of the automaton the smell of the streets and the mist indefinably poignant rose like incense smoke in fantastic spirals through his brain making him hungry and dazzled making his arms and legs feel lithe and as ready for delight as a crouching cat for a spring his heavy shoes beat out a dance as they clattered on the wet pavements under his springy steps he was walking very fast stopping suddenly now and then to look at the greens and oranges and crimsons of vegetables in a push cart to catch a vista down intricate streets to look into the rich brown obscurity of a small wine shop where workmen stood at the counter sipping white wine oval delicate faces bearded faces of men slightly gaunt faces of young women red cheeks of boys wrinkled faces of old women whose ugliness seemed to have hidden in it stirringly all the beauty of youth and the tragedy of lives that had been lived the faces of the people he passed moved him like rhythms of an orchestra after much walking turning always down the street which looked pleasantest he came to an oval with a statue of a pompous personage on a ramping horse place des victoires he read the name which gave him a faint tinge of amusement he looked quizzically at the heroic features of the sun king and walked off laughing i suppose they did it better in those days the grand manner he muttered and his delight redoubled in rubbing shoulders with the people whose effigies would never appear astride rampingeared horses in squares built to commemorate victories he came out on a broad straight avenue where there were many american officers he had to salute and m ps and shops with wide plateglass windows full of objects that had a shiny expensive look another case of victories he thought as he went off into a side street taking with him a glimpse of the bluishgrey pile of the opera with its pompous windows and its naked bronze ladies holding lamps he was in a narrow street full of hotels and fashionable barber shops from which came an odor of cosmopolitan perfumery of casinos and ballrooms and diplomatic receptions when he noticed an american officer coming towards him reeling a little a tall elderly man with a red face and a bottle nose he saluted the officer stopped still swaying from side to side and said in a whining voice shonny dyou know where henrysh bar is no i dont major said andrews who felt himself enveloped in an odor of cocktails youll help me to find it shonny wont you its dreadful not to be able to find it ive got to meet lootenant trevors in henrysh bar the major steadied himself by putting a hand on andrews shoulder a civilian passed them deedonc shouted the major after him deedonc monshier ou ay henrysh bar the man walked on without answering now isnt that like a frog not to understand his own language said the major but theres henrys bar right across the street said andrews suddenly bon bon said the major they crossed the street and went in at the bar the major still clinging to andrews shoulder whispered in his ear im a w o l shee shee whole damn air service is a w o l have a drink with me you enlisted man nobody cares here warsh over sonny democracy is shafe for the world andrews was just raising a champagne cocktail to his lips looking with amusement at the crowd of american officers and civilians who crowded into the small mahogany barroom when a voice behind him drawled out ill be damned andrews turned and saw henslowes brown face and small silky mustache he abandoned his major to his fate god im glad to see you i was afraid you hadnt been able to work itsaid henslowe slowly stuttering a little im about crazy henny with delight i just got in a couple of hours ago laughing interrupting each other they chattered in broken sentences but how in the name of everything did you get here with the major said andrews laughing what the devil yes that major whispered andrews in his friends ear rather the worse for wear asked me to lead him to henrys bar and just fed me a cocktail in the memory of democracy late defunct but what are you doing here its not exactlyexotic i came to see a man who was going to tell me how i could get to rumania with the red cross but that can wait lets get out of here god i was afraid you hadnt made it i had to crawl on my belly and lick peoples boots to do it god it was low but here i am they were out in the street again walking and gesticulating but libertad libertad allons ma femme as walt whitman would have said shouted andrews its one grand and glorious feeling ive been here three days my sections gone home god bless them but what do you have to do do nothing cried henslowe not a blooming bloody goddam thing in fact its no use tryingthe whole thing is such a mess you couldnt do anything if you wanted to i want to go and talk to people at the schola cantorum therell be time for that youll never make anything out of music if you get seriousminded about it then last but not least ive got to get some money from somewhere now youre talking henslowe pulled a burnt leather pocket book out of the inside of his tunic monaco he said tapping the pocket book which was engraved with a pattern of dull red flowers he pursed up his lips and pulled out some hundred franc notes which he pushed into andrewss hand give me one of them said andrews all or none they last about five minutes each but its so damn much to pay back pay it back heavens here take it and stop your talking i probably wont have it again so youd better make hay this time i warn you itll be spent by the end of the week all right im dead with hunger lets sit down on the boulevard and think about where well have lunch to celebrate miss libertad but lets not call her that sounds like liverpool andy a horrid place how about freiheit said andrews as they sat down in basket chairs in the reddish yellow sunlight treasonableoff with your head but think of it man said andrews the butcherys over and you and i and everybody else will soon be human beings again human all too human no more than eighteen wars going muttered henslowe i havent seen any papers for an age how do you mean people are fighting to beat the cats everywhere except on the western front said henslowe but thats

funny mannever been sober in his life you must meet him oh i want to its a dogs age since i met anyone new except you i cant live without having a variegated crowd about can you youve got that right

take advantage of it just look at their puttees i guess theyll know how to make a good thing of the peace too oh thats going to be the best yet come along lets be little devils and take a taxi this certainly is the main street of cosmopolis they threaded their way through the crowd full of uniforms and glitter and bright colors that moved in two streams up and down the wide sidewalk between the cafes and the boles of the bare trees they climbed into a taxi and lurched fast through streets where in the misty sunlight greygreen and greyviolet mingled with blues and pale lights as the colors mingle in a pigeons breast feathers they passed the leafless gardens of the tuileries on one side and the great inner courts of the louvre with their purple mansard roofs and their high chimneys on the other and saw for a second the river dull jade green and the plane trees splotched with brown and cream color along the quais before they were lost in the narrow brownishgrey streets of the old quarters this is paris that was cosmopolis said henslowe im not particular just at present cried andrews gaily the square in front of the odeon was a splash of white and the collonade a blur of darkness as the cab swerved round the corner and along the edge of the luxembourg where through the black iron fence many brown and reddish colors in the intricate patterns of leafless twigs opened here and there on statues and balustrades and vistas of misty distances the cab stopped with a jerk this is the place des medicis said henslowe at the end of a slanting street looking very flat through the haze was the dome of the pantheon in the middle of the square between the yellow trams and the green low busses was a quiet pool where the shadow of horizontals of the house fronts was reflected they sat beside the window looking out at the square henslowe ordered remember how sentimental history books used to talk about prisoners who were let out after years in dungeons not being able to stand it and going back to their cells dyou like sole meuniere anything or rather everything but take it from me thats all rubbish honestly i dont think ive ever been happier in my life dyou know henslowe theres something in you that is afraid to be happy dont be morbid theres only one real evil in the world being somewhere without being able to get away i ordered beer this is the only place in paris where its fit to drink and im going to every blooming concertcolonnelamoureux on sunday i know that the only evil in the world is not to be able to hear music or to make it these oysters are fit for lucullus why not say fit for john andrews and bob henslowe damn it why the ghosts of poor old dead romans should be dragged in every time a man eats an oyster i dont see were as fine specimens as they were i swear i shant let any old turnedtoclay lucullus outlive me even if ive never eaten a lamprey and why should you eat a lamp chimney bob came a hoarse voice beside them andrews looked up into a round white face with large grey eyes hidden behind thick steelrimmed spectacles except for the eyes the face had a vaguely chinese air hello heinz mr andrews mr heineman said henslowe glad to meet you said heineman in a jovially hoarse voice you guys seem to be overeating to reckon by the way things are piled up on the table through the hoarseness andrews could detect a faint yankee tang in heinemans voice youd better sit down and help us said henslowe suredyou know my name for this guy he turned to andrews sinbad sinbad was in bad in tokio and rome in bad in trinidad and twice as bad at home he sang the words loudly waving a bread stick to keep time shut up heinz or youll get us run out of here the way you got us run out of the olympia that night they both laughed an dyou remember monsieur le guy with his coat do i god they laughed till the tears ran down their cheeks heineman took off his glasses and wiped them he turned to andrews oh paris is the best yet first absurdity the peace conference and its nine hundred and ninetynine branches second absurdity spies third american officers awol fourth the seven sisters sworn to slay he broke out laughing again his chunky body rolling about on the chair what are they three of them have sworn to slay sinbad and four of them have sworn to slay me but thats too complicated to tell at lunch time eighth there are the lady relievers sinbads specialty ninth theres sinbad shut up heinz youre getting me maudlin spluttered henslowe o sinbad was in bad all around chanted heineman but no ones given me anything to drink he said suddenly in a petulant voice garcon une bouteille de macon pour un cadet de gascogne whats the next it ends with vergogne youve seen the play havent you greatest play going seen it twice sober and seven other times cyrano de bergerac thats it nous sommes les cadets de gasgogne rhymes with ivrogne and sans vergogne you see i work in the red cross you know sinbad old

man so i have nothing to do for three months and five hundred francs travelling expenses oh children my only prayer is give us this day our red workers permit and the red cross does the rest heineman laughed till the glasses rang on the table he took off his glasses and wiped them with a rueful air so now i call the red cross the cadets cried heineman his voice a thin shriek from laughter andrews was drinking his coffee in little sips looking out of the window at the people that passed an old woman with a stand of flowers sat on a small cane chair at the corner the pink and yellow and blueviolet shades of the flowers seemed to intensify the misty straw color and azured grey of the wintry sun and shadow of the streets a girl in a tightfitting black dress and black hat stopped at the stand to buy a bunch of pale yellow daisies and then walked slowly past the window of the restaurant in the direction of the gardens her ivory face and slender body and her very dark eyes sent a sudden flush through andrewss whole frame as he looked at her the black erect figure disappeared in the gate of the gardens andrews got to his feet suddenly ive got to go he said in a strange voice i just remember a man was waiting for me at the school headquarters let him wait why you havent had a liqueur yet cried heineman nobut where can i meet you people later cafe de rohan at fiveopposite the palais royal youll never find it yes i will said andrews palais royal metro station they shouted after him as he dashed out of the door he hurried into the gardens many people sat on benches in the frail sunlight children in brightcolored clothes ran about chasing hoops a woman paraded a bunch of toy balloons in carmine and green and purple like a huge bunch of particolored grapes inverted above her head andrews walked up and down the alleys scanning faces the girl had disappeared he leaned against a grey balustrade and looked down into the empty pond where traces of the explosion of a bertha still subsisted he was telling himself that he was a fool that even if he had found her he could not have spoken to her just because he was free for a day or two from the army he neednt think the age of gold had come back to earth smiling at the thought he walked across the gardens wandered through some streets of old houses in grey and white stucco with slate mansard roofs and fantastic complications of chimneypots till he came out in front of a church with a new classic facade of huge columns that seemed toppling by their own weight he asked a woman selling newspapers what the churchs name was mais monsieur cest saint sulpice said the woman in a surprised tone saint sulpice manons songs came to his head and the sentimental melancholy of eighteenth century paris with its gambling houses in the palais royal where people dishonored themselves in the presence of their stern catonian fathers and its billets doux written at little gilt tables and its coaches lumbering in covered with mud from the provinces through the porte dorleans and the porte de versailles the paris of diderot and voltaire and jeanjacques with its muddy streets and its ordinaries where one ate bisques and larded pullets and souffles a paris full of mouldy gilt magnificence full of pompous ennui of the past and insane hope of the future he walked down a narrow smoky street full of antique shops and old bookshops and came out unexpectedly on the river opposite the statue of voltaire the name on the corner was quai malaquais andrews crossed and looked down for a long time at the river opposite behind a lacework of leafless trees were the purplish roofs of the louvre with their high peaks and their ranks and ranks of chimneys behind him the old houses of the quai and the wing topped by a balustrade with great grey stone urns of a domed building of which he did not know the name barges were coming upstream the dense green water spuming under their blunt bows towed by a little black tugboat with its chimney bent back to pass under the bridges the tug gave a thin shrill whistle andrews started walking downstream he crossed by the bridge at the corner of the louvre turned his back on the arch napoleon built to receive the famous horses from st marcs a pinkish pastrylike affair and walked through the tuileries which were full of people strolling about or sitting in the sun of dolllike children and nursemaids with elaborate white caps of fluffy little dogs straining at the ends of leashes suddenly a peaceful sleepiness came over him he sat down in the sun on a bench watching hardly seeing them the people who passed to and fro casting long shadows voices and laughter came very softly to his ears above the distant stridency of traffic from far away he heard for a few moments notes of a military band playing a march the shadows of the trees were faint bluegrey in the ruddy yellow gravel shadows of people kept passing and repassing across them he felt very languid and happy suddenly he started up he had been dozing he asked an old man with a beautifully pointed white beard the way to rue du faubourg st honore after losing his way a couple of times he walked listlessly up some marble steps where a great many men in khaki were talking leaning against the doorpost was walters as he drew near andrews heard him saying to the man next to him why the eiffel tower was the first piece of complete girder construction ever built thats the first thing a feller whos wide awake ought to see tell me the operys the grandest thing to look at said the man next it if theres wine an women there me for it an dont forget the song but that isnt interesting like the eiffel tower is persisted walters say walters i hope you havent been waiting for me stammered

today im going to the y tonight anyway ill get a fellow i know to put me up then tomorrow well see well so long said andrews moving away wait im coming with you well walk around town together all right said andrews the rabbit was rather formless very fluffy and had a glance of madness in its pink eye with a black center it hopped like a sparrow along the pavement emitting a rubber tube from its back which went up to a bulb in a mans hand which the man pressed to make the rabbit hop yet the rabbit had an air of organic completeness andrews laughed inordinately when he first saw it the vendor who had a basket full of other such rabbits on his arm saw andrews laughing and drew timidly near to the table he had a pink face with little sensitive lips rather like a real rabbits and large frightened eyes of a wan brown do you make them yourself asked andrews smiling the man dropped his rabbit on the table with a negligent air oh oui monsieur dapres la nature he made the rabbit turn a somersault by suddenly pressing the bulb hard andrews laughed and the rabbit man laughed think of a big strong man making his living that way said walters disgusted i do it allde matiere premiere au profit de laccapareur said the rabbit man hello andylate as hell im sorry said henslowe dropping down into a chair beside them andrews introduced walters the rabbit man took off his hat bowed to the company and went off making the rabbit hop before him along the edge of the curbstone whats happened to heineman here he comes now said henslowe an open cab had driven up to the curb in front of the cafe in it sat heineman with a broad grin on his face and beside him a woman in a salmoncolored dress ermine furs and an emeraldgreen hat the cab drove off and heineman still grinning walked up to the table wheres the lion cub asked henslowe they say its got pneumonia mr heineman mr walters the grin left heinemans face he said how do you do curtly cast a furious glance at andrews and settled himself in a chair the sun had set the sky was full of lilac and bright purple and carmine among the deep blue shadows lights were coming on primrosecolored street lamps violet arc lights ruddy sheets of light poured out of shop windows lets go inside im cold as hell said heineman crossly and they filed in through the revolving door followed by a waiter with their drinks ive been in the red cross all afternoon andy i think i am going to work that roumania business want to come said henslowe in andrews ear if i can get hold of a piano and some lessons and the concerts keep up you wont be able to get me away from paris with wild horses no sir i want to see what paris is like its going to my head so itll be weeks before i know what i think about it dont think about it drink growled heineman scowling savagely thats two things im going to keep away from in paris drink and women and you cant have one without the other said walters true enough you sure do need them both said heineman andrews was not listening to their talk twirling the stem of his glass of vermouth in his fingers he was thinking of the queen of sheba slipping down from off the shoulders of her elephant glistening fantastically with jewels in the light of crackling resinous torches music was seeping up through his mind as the water seeps into a hole dug in the sand of the seashore he could feel all through his body the tension of rhythms and phrases taking form not quite to be seized as yet still hovering on the borderland of consciousness from the girl at the crossroads singing under her streetlamp to the patrician pulling roses to pieces from the height of her litterall the imaginings of your desire he thought of the girl with skin like old ivory he had seen in the place de medicis the queen of shebas face was like that now in his imaginings quiet and inscrutable a sudden cymbalclanging of joy made his heart thump hard he was free now of the imaginings of his desire to loll all day at cafe tables watching the tables move in changing patterns before him to fill his mind and body with a reverberation of all the rhythms of men and women moving in the frieze of life before his eyes no more like wooden automatons knowing only the motions of the drill manual but supple and varied full of force and tragedy for heavens sake lets beat it from here gives me a pain this place does heineman beat his fist on the table all right said andrews getting up with a yawn henslowe and andrews walked off leaving walters to follow them with heineman were going to dine at le rat qui danse said henslowe an awfully funny place we just have time to walk there comfortably with an appetite they followed the long dimlylighted rue de richelieu to the boulevards where they drifted a little while with the crowd the glaring lights seemed to powder the air with gold cafes and the tables outside were crowded there was an odor of vermouth and coffee and perfume and cigarette smoke mixed with the fumes of burnt gasoline from taxicabs isnt this mad said andrews its always carnival at seven on the grands boulevards they started climbing the steep streets to montmartre at a corner they passed a hardfaced girl with rougesmeared lips and overpowdered cheeks laughing on the arm of an american soldier who had a sallow face and dullgreen eyes that glittered in the slanting light of a streetlamp hello stein said andrews whos that a fellow from our division got here with me this morning hes got curious lips for a jew said henslowe at the fork of two slanting streets they went into a restaurant that had small windows pasted over with red paper through which the light came dimly inside were crowded oak tables and oak wainscoting with a shelf round the top on which were shellcans a couple of skulls several cracked majolica plates and a number of stuffed rats the only people there were a fat woman and a man with long grey hair and beard who sat talking earnestly over two small glasses in the center of the room a huskylooking waitress with a dutch cap and apron hovered near the inner door from which came a great smell of fish frying in olive oil the cook heres from marseilles said henslowe as they settled themselves at a table for four i wonder if the rest of them lost the way said andrews more likely old heinz stopped to have a drink said henslowe lets have some hors doeuvre while we are waiting the waitress brought a collection of boatshaped plates of red salads and yellow salads and green salads and two little wooden tubs with herrings and anchovies henslowe stopped her as she was going saying rien de plus the waitress contemplated the array with a tragic air her arms folded over her ample bosom que voulezvous monsieur cest larmistice the greatest fake about all this war business is the peace i tell you not till the hors doeuvre has been restored to its proper abundance and variety will i admit that the wars over the waitress tittered things arent what they used to be she said going back to the kitchen heineman burst into the restaurant at that moment slamming the door behind him so that the glass rang and the fat woman and the hairy man started violently in their chairs he tumbled into a place grinning broadly and what have you done to walters heineman wiped his glasses meticulously oh he died of drinking raspberry shrub he said deedong peteet du ving de bourgogne he shouted towards the waitress in his nasal french then he added le guy is coming in a minute i just met him the restaurant was gradually filling up with men and women of very various costumes with a good sprinkling of americans in uniform and out god i hate people who dont drink cried heineman pouring out wine a man who dont drink just cumbers the earth how are you going to take it in america when they have prohibition dont talk about it heres le guy i wouldnt have him know i belong to a nation that prohibits good liquor monsieur le guy monsieur henslowe et monsieur andrews he continued getting up ceremoniously a little man with twirled mustaches and a small vandyke beard sat down at the fourth place he had a faintly red nose and little twinkling eyes how glad i am he said exposing his starched cuffs with a curious gesture to have some one to dine with when one begins to get old loneliness is impossible it is only youth that dares think afterwards one has only one thing to think about old age theres always work said andrews slavery any work is slavery what is the use of freeing your intellect if you sell yourself again to the first bidder rot said heineman pouring out from a new bottle andrews had begun to notice the girl who sat at the next table in front of a pale young soldier in frenchblue who resembled her extraordinarily she had high cheek bones and a forehead in which the modelling of the skull showed through the transparent faintlyolive skin her heavy chestnut hair was coiled carelessly at the back of her head she spoke very quietly and pressed her lips together when she smiled she ate quickly and neatly like a cat the restaurant had gradually filled up with people the waitress and the patron a fat man with a wide red sash coiled tightly round his waist moved with difficulty among the crowded tables a woman at a table in the corner with dead white skin and drugged staring eyes kept laughing hoarsely leaning her head in a hat with bedraggled white plumes against the wall there was a constant jingle of plates and glasses and an oily fume of food and womens clothes and wine dyou want to know what i really did with your friend said heineman leaning towards andrews i hope you didnt push him into the seine it was damn impolite but hell it was damn impolite of him not to drink no use wasting time with a man who dont drink i took him into a cafe and asked him to wait while i telephoned i guess hes still waiting one of the whoreiest cafes on the whole boulevard clichy heineman laughed uproariously and started explaining it in nasal french to m le guy andrews flushed with annoyance for a moment but soon started laughing heineman had started singing again o sinbad was in bad in tokio and rome in bad in trinidad and twice as bad at home o sinbad was in bad all around everybody clapped the whitefaced woman in the corner cried bravo bravo in a shrill nightmare voice heineman bowed his big grinning face bobbing up and down like the face of a chinese figure in porcelain lui est sinbad he cried pointing with a wide gesture towards henslowe give em some more heinz give them some more said henslowe laughing big brunettes with long stelets on the shores of italee dutch girls with golden curls beside the zuyder zee everybody cheered again andrews kept looking at the girl at the next table whose face was red from laughter she had a handkerchief pressed to her mouth and kept saying in a low voice o quil est drole celuila o quil est drole heineman picked up a glass and waved it in the air before drinking it off several people got up and filled it up from their bottles with white wine and red the french soldier at the next table pulled an army canteen from under his chair and hung it round heinemans neck heineman his face crimson bowed to all sides more like a chinese porcelain figure than ever and started singing in all solemnity this time hulas and hulas would pucker up their lips he fell for their ballbearing hips for they were pips his chunky body swayed to the ragtime the woman in the corner kept time with long white arms raised above her head bet shes a snake charmer said henslowe o wild woman loved that child he would drive ten women wild o sinbad was in bad all around heineman waved his arms pointed again to henslowe and sank into his chair saying in the tones of a shakespearean actor cest lui sinbad the girl hid her face on the tablecloth shaken with laughter andrews could hear a convulsed little voice saying o quil est rigolo heineman took off the canteen and handed it back to the french soldier merci camarade he said solemnly eh bien jeanne cest temps de ficher le camp said the french soldier to the girl they got up he shook hands with the americans andrews caught the girls eye and they both started laughing convulsively again andrews noticed how erect and supple she walked as his eyes followed her to the door andrewss party followed soon after weve got to hurry if we want to get to the lapin agile before closingand ive got to have a drink said heineman still talking in his stagey shakespearean voice have you ever been on the stage asked andrews what stage sir im in the last stages now sir i am an artistic photographer and none other moki and i are going into the movies together when they decide to have peace whos moki moki hadj is the lady in the salmoncolored dress said henslowe in a loud stage whisper in andrewss ear they have a lion cub named bubu our first born said heineman with a wave of the hand the streets were deserted a thin ray of moonlight bursting now and then through the heavy clouds lit up low houses and roughlycobbled streets and the flights of steps with rare dim lamps bracketed in house walls that led up to the butte there was a gendarme in front of the door of the lapin agile the street was still full of groups that had just come out american officers and ymca women with a sprinkling of the inhabitants of the region now look were late groaned heineman in a tearful voice never mind heinz said henslowe le guyll take us to see de clocheville like he did last time nest pas le guy then andrews heard him add talking to a man he had not seen before come along aubrey ill introduce you later they climbed further up the hill there was a scent of wet gardens in the air entirely silent except for the clatter of their feet on the cobbles heineman was dancing a sort of a jig at the head of the procession they stopped before a tall cadaverous house and started climbing a rickety wooden stairway talk about inside dope i got this from a man whos actually in the room when the peace conference meets andrews heard aubreys voice with a chicago burr in the rs behind him in the stairs fine lets hear it said henslowe did you say the peace conference took dope shouted heineman whose puffing could be heard as he climbed the dark stairs ahead of them shut up heinz they stumbled over a raised doorstep into a large garret room with a tile floor where a tall lean man in a monasticlooking dressing gown of some brown material received them the only candle made all their shadows dance fantastically on the slanting white walls as they moved about one side of the room had three big windows with an occasional cracked pane mended with newspaper stretching from floor to ceiling in front of them were two couches with rugs piled on them on the opposite wall was a confused mass of canvases piled one against the other leaning helter skelter against the slanting wall of the room cest le bon vin le bon vin cest la chanson du vin chanted heineman everybody settled themselves on couches the lanky man in the brown dressing gown brought a table out of the shadow put some black bottles and heavy glasses on it and drew up a camp stool for himself he lives that way they say he never goes out stays here and paints and when friends come in he feeds them wine and charges them double said henslowe thats how he lives the lanky man began taking bits of candle out of a drawer of the table and lighting them andrews saw that his feet and legs were bare below the frayed edge of the dressing gown the candle light lit up the mens flushed faces and the crude banana yellows and arsenic greens of the canvases along the walls against which jars full of paint brushes cast blurred shadows i was going to tell you henny said aubrey the dope is that the presidents going to leave the conference going to call them all damn blackguards to their faces and walk out with the band playing the internationale god thats news cried andrews if he does that hell recognize the soviets said henslowe me for the first red cross mission that goes to save starving russia gee thats great ill write you a postal from moscow andy if they havent been abolished as delusions of the bourgeoisie hell no ive got five hundred dollars worth of russian bonds that girl vera gave me but worth five million ten million fifty million if the czar gets back im backing the little white father cried heineman anyway moki says hes alive that savaroffs got him locked up in a suite in the ritz and moki knows moki knows a damn lot ill admit that said henslowe but just think of it said aubrey that means world revolution with the united states at the head of it what do you think of that moki doesnt think so said heineman and moki knows she just knows what a lot of reactionary warlords tell her said aubrey this man i was talking with at the crillon i wish i could tell you his name heard it directly fromwell you know who he turned to henslowe who smiled knowingly theres a mission in russia at this minute making peace with lenin a goddam outrage cried heineman knocking a bottle off the table the lanky man picked up the pieces patiently without comment the new era is opening men i swear it is began aubrey the old order is dissolving it is going down under a weight of misery and crime this will be the first great gesture towards a newer and better world there is no alternative the chance will never come back it is either for us to step courageously forward or sink into unbelievable horrors of anarchy and civil war peace or the dark ages again andrews had felt for some time an uncontrollable sleepiness coming over him he rolled himself on a rug and stretched out on the empty couch the voices arguing wrangling enunciating emphatic phrases dinned for a minute in his ears he went to sleep when andrews woke up he found himself staring at the cracked plaster of an unfamiliar ceiling for some moments he could not guess where he was henslowe was sleeping wrapped in another rug on the couch beside him except for henslowes breathing there was complete silence floods of silverygrey light poured in through the wide windows behind which andrews could see a sky full of bright dovecolored clouds he sat up carefully some time in the night he must have taken off his tunic and boots and puttees which were on the floor beside the couch the tables with the bottles had gone and the lanky man was nowhere to be seen andrews went to the window in his stockinged feet paris way a slategrey and dovecolor lay spread out like a turkish carpet with a silvery band of mist where the river was out of which the eiffel tower stood up like a man wading here and there blue smoke and brown spiralled up to lose itself in the faint canopy of brown fog that hung high above the houses andrews stood a long while leaning against the window frame until he heard henslowes voice behind him depuis le jour ou je me suis donnee you look like louise andrews turned round henslowe was sitting on the edge of the bed with his hair in disorder combing his little silky mustache with a pocket comb gee i have a head he said my tongue feels like a nutmeg grater doesnt yours no i feel like a fighting cock what do you say we go down to the seine and have a bath in benny franklins bathtub wheres that it sounds grand then well have the biggest breakfast ever thats the right spirit wheres everybody gone to old heinz has gone to his moki i guess and aubreys gone to collect more dope at the crillon he says four in the morning when the drunks come home is the prime time for a newspaper man and the monkish man search me the streets were full of men and girls hurrying to work everything sparkled had an air of being just scrubbed they passed bakeries from which came a rich smell of freshbaked bread from cafes came whiffs of roasting coffee they crossed through the markets that were full of heavy carts lumbering to and fro and women with net bags full of vegetables there was a pungent scent of crushed cabbage leaves and carrots and wet clay the mist was raw and biting along the quais and made the blood come into their cheeks and their hands stiff with cold the bathhouse was a huge barge with a house built on it in a lozenge shape they crossed to it by a little gangplank on which were a few geraniums in pots the attendant gave them two rooms side by side on the lower deck painted grey with steamed over windows through which andrews caught glimpses of hurrying green water he stripped his clothes off quickly the tub was of copper varnished with some white metal inside the water flowed in through two copper swans necks when andrews stepped into the hot green water a little window in the partition flew open and henslowe shouted in to him talk about modern conveniences you can converse while you bathe andrews scrubbed himself jauntily with a square piece of pink soap splashing the water about like a small boy he stood up and lathered himself all over and then let himself slide into the water which splashed out over the floor do you think youre a performing seal shouted henslowe its all so preposterous cried andrews going off into convulsions of laughter she has a lion cub named bubu and nicolas romanoff lives in the ritz and the revolution is scheduled for day after tomorrow at twelve noon id put it about the first of may answered henslowe amid a sound of splashing gee itd be great to be a peoples commissary you could go and revolute the grand llama of thibet o its too deliciously preposterous cried andrews letting himself slide a second time into the bathtub ii two mps passed outside the window andrews watched the yellow pigskin revolver cases until they were out of sight he felt joyfully secure from them the waiter standing by the door with a napkin on his arm gave him a sense of security so intense it made him laugh on the marble table before him were a small glass of beer a notebook full of ruled sheets of paper and a couple of yellow pencils the beer the color of topaz in the clear grey light that streamed in through the window threw a pale yellow glow with a bright center on the table outside was the boulevard with a few people walking hurriedly an empty market wagon passed now and then rumbling loud on a bench a woman in a black knitted shawl with a bundle of newspapers in her knees was counting sous with loving concentration andrews looked at his watch he had an hour before going to the schola cantorum he got to his feet paid the waiter and strolled down the center of the boulevard thinking smilingly of pages he had written of pages he was going to write filled with a sense of leisurely wellbeing it was a grey morning with a little yellowish fog in the air the pavements were damp reflected womens dresses and mens legs and the angular outlines of taxicabs from a flower stand with violets and red and pink carnations irregular blotches of color ran down into the brownish grey of the pavement andrews caught a faint smell of violets in the smell of the fog as he passed the flower stand and remembered suddenly that spring was coming he would not miss a moment of this spring he told himself he would follow it step by step from the first violets oh how fully he must live now to make up for all the years he had wasted in his life he kept on walking along the boulevard he was remembering how he and the girl the soldier had called jeanne had both kindled with uncontrollable laughter when their eyes had met that night in the restaurant he wished he could go down the boulevard with a girl like that laughing through the foggy morning he wondered vaguely what part of paris he was getting to but was too happy to care how beautifully long the hours were in the early morning at a concert at the salle gaveau the day before he had heard debussys nocturnes and les sirenes rhythms from them were the warp of all his thoughts against the background of the grey street and the brownish fog that hung a veil at the end of every vista he began to imagine rhythms of his own modulations and phrases that grew brilliant and faded that flapped for a while like gaudy banners above his head through the clatter of the street he noticed that he was passing a long building with blank rows of windows at the central door of which stood groups of american soldiers smoking unconsciously he hastened his steps for fear of meeting an officer he would have to salute he passed the men without looking at them a voice detained him say andrews when he turned he saw that a short man with curly hair whose face though familiar he could not place had left the group at the door and was coming towards him hello andrews your names andrews aint it yes andrews shook his hand trying to remember im fuselli remember last time i saw you you was goin up to the lines on a train with chrisfield chris we used to call him at cosne dont you remember of course i do well whats happened to chris hes a corporal now said andrews gee he is ill be goddamned they was goin to make me a corporal once fuselli wore stained olivedrab breeches and badly rolled puttees his shirt was open at the neck from his blue denim jacket came a smell of stale grease that andrews recognised the smell of army kitchens he had a momentary recollection of standing in line cold dark mornings and of the sound the food made slopping into mess kits why didnt they make you a corporal fuselli andrcws said after a pause in a constrained voice hell i got in wrong i suppose they were leaning against the dusty house wall andrews looked at his feet the mud of the pavement splashing up on the wall made an even dado along the bottom on which andrews scraped the toe of his shoe up and down well hows everything andrews asked looking up suddenly ive been in a labor battalion thats how everything is god thats tough luck andrews wanted to go on he had a sudden fear that he would be late but he did not know how to break away i got sick said fuselli grinning i guess i am yet g o its a hell of a note the way they treat a fellerlike he was lower than the dirt were you at cosne all the time thats damned rough luck fuselli cosne sure is a hell of a hole i guess you saw a lot of fighting god you must have been glad not to be in the goddam medics i dont know that im glad i saw fighting oh yes i suppose i am you see i had it a hell of a time before they found out courtmartial was damn stiffafter the armistice too oh god why cant they let a feller go home a woman in a bright blue hat passed them andrews caught a glimpse of a white overpowdered face her hips trembled like jelly under the blue skirt with each hard clack of her high heels on the pavement gee that looks like jenny im glad she didnt see me fuselli laughed ought to a seen her one night last week we were so dead drunk we just couldnt move isnt that bad for whats the matter with you i dont give a damn now whats the use but god man andrews stopped himself suddenly then he said in a different voice what outfit are you in now im on the permanent kp here fuselli jerked his thumb towards the door of the building not a bad job off two days a week no drill good eats at least you get all you want but it surely has been hell emptying ash cans and shovelling coal an now all theyve

worse than anything else what are you doin in paris school detachment whats that men who wanted to study in the university who managed to work it gee im glad i aint goin to school again well so long fuselli so long andrews fuselli turned and slouched back to the group of men at the door andrews hurried away as he turned the corner he had a glimpse of fuselli with his hands in his pockets and his legs crossed leaning against the wall behind the door of the barracks iii the darkness where the rain fell through the vague halos of light round the street lamps glittered with streaks of pale gold andrewss ears were full of the sound of racing gutters and spattering waterspouts and of the hard unceasing beat of the rain on the pavements it was after closing time the corrugated shutters were drawn down in front of cafe windows andrewss cap was wet water trickled down his forehead and the sides of his nose running into his eyes his feet were soaked and he could feel the wet patches growing on his knees where they received the water running off his overcoat the street stretched wide and dark ahead of him with an occasional glimmer of greenish reflection from a lamp as he walked splashing with long strides through the rain he noticed that he was keeping pace with a woman under an umbrella a slender person who was hurrying with small resolute steps up the boulevard when he saw her a mad hope flamed suddenly through him he remembered a vulgar little theatre and the crude light of a spot light through the paint and powder a girls goldenbrown skin had shone with a firm brilliance that made him think of wide sunscorched uplands and dancing figures on greek vases since he had seen her two nights ago he had thought of nothing else he had feverishly found out her name naya selikoff a mad hope flared through him that this girl he was walking beside was the girl whose slender limbs moved in an endless frieze through his thoughts he peered at her with eyes blurred with rain what an ass he was of course it couldnt be it was too early she was on the stage at this minute other hungry eyes were staring at her slenderness other hands were twitching to stroke her goldenbrown skin walking under the steady downpour that stung his face and ears and sent a tiny cold trickle down his back he felt a sudden dizziness of desire come over him his hands thrust to the bottom of his coat pockets clutched convulsively he felt that he would die that his pounding blood vessels would burst the bead curtains of rain rustled and tinkled about him awakening his nerves making his skin flash and tingle in the gurgle of water in gutters and water spouts he could imagine he heard orchestras droning libidinous music the feverish excitement of his senses began to create frenzied rhythms in his ears o ce pauvre poilu quil doit etre mouille said a small tremulous voice beside him he turned the girl was offering him part of her umbrella o cest un americain she said again still speaking as if to herself mais ca ne vaut pas la peine mais oui mais oui he stepped under the umbrella beside her but you must let me hold it bien as he took the umbrella he caught her eye he stopped still in his tracks but youre the girl at the rat qui danse and you were at the next table with the man who sang how amusing et celuila o il etait rigolo she burst out laughing her head encased in a little round black hat bobbed up and down under the umbrella andrews laughed too crossing the boulevard st germain a taxi nearly ran them down and splashed a great wave of mud over them she clutched his arm and then stood roaring with laughter o quelle horreur quelle horreur she kept exclaiming andrews laughed and laughed but hold the umbrella over us youre letting the rain in on my best hat she said again your name is jeanne said andrews impertinent you heard my brother call me that he went back to the front that night poor little chap hes only nineteen hes very clever o how happy i am now that the wars over you are older than he two years i am the head of the family it is a dignified position have you always lived in paris no we are from laon its the war refugees dont call us that we work

tell you i work at a dressmakers like louise youve heard louise oh how i cried why did it make you sad oh i dont know but im learning stenography but here we are the great bulk of the pantheon stood up dimly through the rain beside them in front the tower of st etiennedumont was just visible the rain roared about them oh how wet i am said jeanne look they are giving louise day after tomorrow at

at a quarter past seven but you probably wont come i swear i will cried andrews eagerly well see she darted away down the street beside st etiennedumont andrews was left alone amid the seethe of the rain and the tumultuous gurgle of waterspouts he felt calm and tired when he got to his room he found he had no matches in his pocket no light came from the window through which he could hear the hissing clamor of the rain in the court he stumbled over a chair are you drunk came walterss voice swathed in bedclothes there are matches on the table but where the hells the table at last his hand groping over the table closed on the matchbox the matchs red and white flicker dazzled him he blinked his eyes the lashes were still full of raindrops when he had lit a candle and set it amongst the music papers upon the table he tore off his dripping clothes i just met the most charming girl walters andrews stood naked beside the pile of his clothes rubbing himself with a towel gee i was wet but she was the most charming person ive met since ive been in paris i thought you said you let the girls alone whores i must have said well any girl you could pick up on the street nonsense i guess they

sulkily john andrews sat at a table outside the cafe de rohan the sun had just set on a ruddy afternoon flooding everything with violetblue light and cold greenish shadow the sky was bright lilac color streaked with a few amber clouds the lights were on in all the windows of the magazin du louvre opposite so that the windows seemed bits of polished glass in the afterglow in the colonnade of the palais royal the shadows were deepening and growing colder a steady stream of people poured in and out of the metro green buses stuffed with people kept passing the roar of the traffic and the clatter of footsteps and the grumble of voices swirled like dance music about andrewss head he noticed all at once that the rabbit man stood in front of him a rabbit dangling forgotten at the end of its rubber tube et ca va bien le commerce said andrews quietly quietly said the rabbit man distractedly making the rabbit turn a somersault at his feet andrews watched the people going into the metro the gentleman amuses himself in paris asked the rabbit man timidly oh yes and you quietly the rabbit man smiled women are very beautiful at this hour of the evening he said again in his very timid tone there is nothing more beautiful than this moment of the eveningin paris or parisian women the eyes of the rabbit man glittered excuse me sir he went on i must try and sell some rabbits au revoir said andrews holding out his hand the rabbit man shook it with sudden vigor and went off making a rabbit hop before him along the curbstone he was hidden by the swiftly moving crowds in the square flaring violet arclights were flickering on lighting up their netcovered globes that hung like harsh moons above the pavement henslowe sat down on a chair beside andrews hows sinbad sinbad old boy is functioning arent yon frozen how do you mean henslowe overheated you chump sitting out here in polar weather no but i mean how are you functioning said andrews laughing im going to poland tomorrow how

if i know but aubrey said youd got to come she is an intellectual so aubrey says thats the last thing i want to meet well you cant help yourself so long andrews sat a while more at the table outside the cafe a cold wind was blowing the sky was blueblack and the ashen white arc lamps cast a mortuary light over everything in the colonnade of the palais royal the shadows were harsh and inky in the square the people were gradually thinning the lights in the magazin du louvre had gone out from the cafe behind him a faint smell of freshcooked food began to saturate the cold air of the street then he saw jeanne advancing across the ashgrey pavement of the square slim and black under the arc lights he ran to meet her the cylindrical stove in the middle of the floor roared softly in front of it the white cat was rolled into a fluffy ball in which ears and nose made tiny splashes of pink like those at the tips of the petals of certain white roses one side of the stove at the table against the window sat an old brown man with a bright red stain on each cheek bone who wore formless corduroy clothes the color of his skin holding the small spoon in a knotted hand he was stirring slowly and continuously a liquid that was yellow and steamed in a glass behind him was the window with sleet beating against it in the leaden light of a wintry afternoon the other side of the stove was a zinc bar with yellow bottles and green bottles and a water spigot with a neck like a giraffes that rose out of the bar beside a varnished wood pillar that made the decoration of the corner with a terra cotta pot of ferns on top of it from where andrews sat on the padded bench at the back of the room the fern fronds made a black lacework against the lefthand side of the window while against the other was the brown silhouette of the old mans head and the slant of his cap the stove hid the door and the white cat round and symmetrical formed the center of the visible universe on the marble table beside andrews were some pieces of crisp bread with butter on them a saucer of damson jam and a bowl with coffee and hot milk from which the steam rose in a faint spiral his tunic was unbuttoned and he rested his head on his two hands staring through his fingers at a thick pile of ruled paper full of hastily drawn signs some in ink and some in pencil where now and then he made a mark with a pencil at the other edge of the pile of papers were two books one yellow and one white with coffee stains on it the fire roared and the cat slept and the old brown man stirred and stirred rarely stopping for a moment to lift the glass to his lips occasionally the scratching of sleet upon the windows became audible or there was a distant sound of dish pans through the door in the back the sallowfaced clock that hung above the mirror that backed the bar jerked out one jingly strike a half hour andrews did not look up the cat still slept in front of the stove which roared with a gentle singsong the old brown man still stirred the yellow liquid in his glass the clock was ticking uphill towards the hour andrewss hands were cold there was a nervous flutter in his wrists and in his chest inside of him was a great rift of light infinitely vast and infinitely distant through it sounds poured from somewhere so that he trembled with them to his finger tips sounds modulated into rhythms that washed back and forth and crossed each other like sea waves in a cove sounds clotted into harmonies behind everything the queen of sheba out of flaubert held her fantastic hand with its long gilded finger nails on his shoulder and he was leaning forward over the brink of life but the image was vague like a shadow cast on the brilliance of his mind the clock struck four the white fluffy ball of the cat unrolled very slowly its eyes were very round and yellow it put first one leg and then the other out before it on the tiled floor spreading wide the pinkeygrey claws its tail rose up behind it straight as the mast of a ship with slow processional steps the cat walked towards the door the old brown man drank down the yellow liquid and smacked his lips twice loudly meditatively andrews raised his head his blue eyes looking straight before him without seeing anything dropping the pencil he leaned back against the wall and stretched his arms out taking the coffee bowl between his two hands he drank s little it was cold he piled some jam on a piece of bread and ate it licking a little off his fingers afterwards then he looked towards the old brown man and said on est bien ici nest ce pas monsieur morue oui on est bien ici said the old brown man in a voice so gruff it seemed to rattle very slowly he got to his feet good i am going to the barge he said then he called chipette oui msieu a little girl in a black apron with her hair in two tight pigtails that stood out behind her tiny bullet head as she ran came through the door from the back part of the house there give that to your mother said the old brown man putting some coppers in her hand oui msieu youd better stay here where its warm said andrews yawning i have to work its only soldiers dont have to work rattled the old brown man when the door opened a gust of raw air circled about the wine shop and a roar of wind and hiss of sleet came from the slushcovered quai outside the cat took refuge beside the stove with its back up and its tail waving the door closed and the old brown mans silhouette slanted against the wind crossed the grey oblong of the window andrews settled down to work again but you work a lot a lot dont you msieu jean said chipette putting her chin on the table beside the books and looking up into his eyes with little eyes like black beads i wonder if i do when im grown up i shant work a bit ill drive round in a carriage andrews laughed chipette looked at him for a minute and then went into the other room carrying away the empty coffee bowl in front of the stove the cat sat on its haunches licking a paw rhythmically with a pink curling tongue like a rose petal andrews whistled a few bars staring at the cat what dyou think of that minet thats la reine de sabala reine de saba the cat curled into a ball again with great deliberation and went to sleep andrews began thinking of jeanne and the thought gave him a sense of quiet wellbeing strolling with her in the evening through the streets full of men and women walking significantly together sent a languid calm through his jangling nerves which he had never known in his life before it excited him to be with her but very suavely so that he forgot that his limbs were swathed stiffly in an uncomfortable uniform so that his feverish desire seemed to fly out of him until with her body beside him he seemed to drift effortlessly in the stream of the lives of all the people he passed so languid from the quiet loves that streamed up about him that the hard walls of his personality seemed to have melted entirely into the mistiness of twilight streets and for a moment as he thought of it a scent of flowers heavy with pollen and sprouting grass and damp moss and swelling sap seemed to tingle in his nostrils sometimes swimming in the ocean on a rough day he had felt that same reckless exhilaration when towards the shore a huge seething wave had caught him up and sped him forward on its crest sitting quietly in the empty wine shop that grey afternoon he felt his blood grumble and swell in his veins as the new life was grumbling and swelling in the sticky buds of the trees in the tender green quick under their rough bark in the little furry animals of the woods and in the sweetsmelling cattle that tramped into mud the lush meadows in the premonition of spring was a resistless wave of force that carried him and all of them with it tumultuously the clock struck five andrews jumped to his feet and still struggling into his overcoat darted out of the door a raw wind blew on the square the river was a muddy greygreen swollen and rapid a hoarse triumphant roaring came from it the sleet had stopped but the pavements were covered with slush and in the gutters were large puddles which the wind ruffled everything houses bridges river and sky was in shades of cold greygreen broken by one jagged ochrecolored rift across the sky against which the bulk of notre dame and the slender spire of the crossing rose dark and purplish andrews walked with long strides splashing through the puddles until opposite the low building of the morgue he caught a crowded green bus outside the hotel crillon were many limousines painted olivedrab with numbers in white letters on the doors the drivers men with their olivedrab coat collars turned up round their red faces stood in groups under the portico andrews passed the sentry and went through the revolving doors into the lobby which was vividly familiar it had the smell he remembered having smelt in the lobbies of new york hotels a smell of cigar smoke and furniture polish on one side a door led to a big dining room where many men and women were having tea from which came a smell of pastry and rich food on the expanse of red carpet in front of him officers and civilians stood in groups talking in low voices there was a sound of jingling spurs and jingling dishes from the restaurant and near where andrews stood shifting his weight from one foot to the other sprawled in a leather chair a fat man with a black felt hat over his eyes and a large watch chain dangling limply over his bulbous paunch he cleared his throat occasionally with a rasping noise and spat loudly into the spittoon beside him at last andrews caught sight of aubrey who was dapper with white cheeks and tortoise shell glasses come along he said seizing andrews by the arm you are late then he went on whispering in andrewss ear as they went out through the revolving doors great things happened in the conference today i can tell you that old man they crossed the bridge towards the portico of the chamber of deputies with its high pediment and its grey columns down the river they could see faintly the eiffel tower with a drift of mist athwart it like a section of spider web spun between the city and the clouds do we have to go to see these people aubrey yes you cant back out now genevieve rod wants to know about american music but what on earth can i tell her about american music wasnt there a man named macdowell who went mad or something andrews laughed but you know i havent any social graces i suppose ill have to say i think foch is a little tin god you neednt say anything if you dont want to theyre very advanced anyway oh rats they were going up a browncarpeted stair that had engravings on the landings where there was a faint smell of stale food and dustpans at the top landing aubrey rang the bell at a varnished door in a moment a girl opened it she had a cigarette in her hand her face was pale under a mass of reddishchestnut hair her eyes very large a pale brown as large as the eyes of women in those paintings of artemisias and berenikes found in tombs in the fayum she wore a plain black dress enfin she said and held out her hand to aubrey theres my friend andrews she held out her hand to him absently still looking at aubrey does he speak french good this way they went into a large room with a piano where an elderly woman with grey hair and yellow teeth and the same large eyes as her daughter stood before the fireplace mamanenfin ils arrivent ces messieurs genevieve was afraid you werent coming mme rod said to andrews smiling monsieur aubrey gave us such a picture of your playing that we have been excited all day we adore music i wish i could do something more to the point with it than adore it said genevieve rod hastily then she went on with a laugh but i forget monsieur andreffs monsieur ronsard she made a gesture with her hand from andrews to a young frenchman in a cutaway coat with small mustaches and a very tight vest who bowed towards andrews now well have tea said genevieve rod everybody talks sense until theyve had tea its only after tea that anyone is ever amusing she pulled open some curtains that covered the door into the adjoining room i understand why sarah bernhardt is so fond of curtains she said they give an air of drama to existence there is nothing more heroic than curtains she sat at the head of an oak table where were china platters with varicolored pastries an old pewter kettle under which an alcohol lamp burned a dresden china teapot in pale yellows and greens and cups and saucers and plates with a doubleheaded eagle design in dull vermilion tout ca said genevieve waving her hand across the table cest boche but we havent any others so theyll have to do the older woman who sat beside her whispered something in her ear and laughed genevieve put on a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles and starting pouring out tea debussy once drank out of that cup its cracked she said handing a cup to john andrews do you know anything of moussorgskis you can play to us after tea i cant play anything any more ask me three months from now oh yes but nobody expects you to do any tricks with it you can certainly make it intelligible thats all i want i have my doubts andrews sipped his tea slowly looking now and then at genevieve rod who had suddenly begun talking very fast to ronsard she held a cigarette between the fingers of a long thin hand her large palebrown eyes kept their startled look of having just opened on the world a little smile appeared and disappeared maliciously in the curve of her cheek away from her small firm lips the older woman beside her kept looking round the table with a jolly air of hospitality and showing her yellow teeth in a smile afterwards they went back to the sitting room and andrews sat down at the piano the girl sat very straight on a little chair beside the piano andrews ran his fingers up and down the keys did you say you knew debussy he said suddenly i no but he used to come to see my father when i was a little girl i have been brought up in the middle of music that shows how silly it is to be a woman there is no music in my head of course i am sensitive to it but so are the tables and chairs in this apartment after all theyve heard andrews started playing schumann he stopped suddenly can you sing he said no id like to do the proses lyriques ive never heard them i once tried to sing le soir she said wonderful do bring it out but good lord its too difficult what is the use of being fond of music if you arent willing to mangle it for the sake of producing it i swear id rather hear a man picking out aupres de ma blonde on a trombone that kreisler playing paganini impeccably enough to make you ill but there is a middle ground he interrupted her by starting to play again as he played without looking at her he felt that her eyes were fixed on him that she was standing tensely behind him her hand touched his shoulder he stopped playing oh i am dreadfully sorry she said nothing i am finished you were playing something of your own have you ever read la tentation de saint antoine he asked in a low voice flauberts yes its not his best work a very interesting failure though she said andrews got up from the piano with difficulty controlling a sudden growing irritation they seem to teach everybody to say that he muttered suddenly he realized that other people were in the room he went up to mme rod you must excuse me he said i have an engagement aubrey dont let me drag you away i am late ive got to run you must come to see us again thank you mumbled andrews genevieve rod went with him to the door we must know each other better she said i like you for going off in a huff andrews flushed i was badly brought up he said pressing her thin cold hand and you french must always remember that we are barbarians some are repentant barbarians i am not she laughed and john andrews ran down the stairs and out into the greyblue streets where the lamps were blooming into primrose color he had a confused feeling that he had made a fool of himself which made him writhe with helpless anger he walked with long strides through the streets of the rive gauche full of people going home from work towards the little wine shop on the quai de la tournelle it was a paris sunday morning old women in black shawls were going into the church of st etiennedumont each time the leather doors opened it let a little whiff of incense out into the smoky morning air three pigeons walked about the cobblestones putting their coral feet one before the other with an air of importance the pointed facade of the church and its slender tower and cupola cast a bluish shadow on the square in front of it into which the shadows the old women trailed behind them vanished as they hobbled towards the church the opposite side of the square and the railing of the pantheon and its tall brownishgray flank were flooded with dull orangecolored sunlight andrews walked back and forth in front of the church looking at the sky and the pigeons and the facade of the library of ste genevieve and at the rare people who passed across the end of the square noting forms and colors and small comical aspects of things with calm delight savoring everything almost with complacency his music he felt was progressing now that undisturbed he lived all day long in the rhythm of it his mind and his fingers were growing supple the hard moulds that had grown up about his spirit were softening as he walked back and forth in front of the church waiting for jeanne he took an inventory of his state of mind he was very happy eh bien jeanne had come up behind him they ran like children hand in hand across the sunny square i have not had any coffee yet said andrews how late you must get up but you cant have any till we get to the porte maillot jean why not because i say you cant but thats cruelty it wont be long but i am dying with hunger i will die in your hands cant you understand once we get to the porte maillot well be far from your life and my life the day will be ours one must not tempt fate you funny girl the metro was not crowded andrews and jeanne sat opposite each other without talking andrews was looking at the girls hands limp on her lap small overworked hands with places at the tips of the fingers where the skin was broken and scarred with chipped uneven nails suddenly she caught his glance he flushed and she said jauntily well well all be rich some day like princes and princesses in fairy tales they both laughed as they were leaving the train at the terminus he put his arm timidly round her waist she wore no corsets his fingers trembled at the litheness of the flesh under her clothes feeling a sort of terror go through him he took away his arm now she said quietly as they emerged into the sunlight and the bare trees of the broad avenue you can have all the cafeaulait you want youll have some too why be extravagant ive had my petit dejeuner but im going to be extravagant all day we might as well start now i dont know exactly why but i am very happy well eat brioches but my dear its only profiteers who can eat brioches nowadays you just watch us they went into a patisserie an elderly woman with a lean yellow face and thin hair waited on them casting envious glances up through her eyelashes as she piled the rich brown brioches on a piece of tissue paper youll pass the day in the country she asked in a little wistful voice as she handed andrews the change yes he said how well you guessed as they went out of the door they heard her muttering o la jeunesse la jeunesse they found a table in the sun at a cafe opposite the gate from which they could watch people and automobiles and carriages coming in and out beyond a grassgrown bit of fortifications gave an look to things how jolly it is at the porte maillot cried andrews she looked at him and laughed but how gay he is today no i always like it here its the spot in paris where you always feel well when you go out you have all the fun of leaving town when you go in you have all the fun of coming back to town but you arent eating any brioches ive eaten one you eat them you are hungry jeanne i dont think i have ever been so happy in my life its almost worth having been in the army for the joy your freedom gives you that frightful life how is etienne he is in mayence hes bored jeanne we must live very much we who are free to make up for all the people who are stillbored a lot of good itll do them she cried laughing its funny jeanne i threw myself into the army i was so sick of being free and not getting anywhere now i have learnt that life is to be used not just held in the hand like a box of bonbons that nobody eats she looked at him blankly i mean i dont think i get enough out of life he said lets go they got to their feet what do you mean she said slowly one takes what life gives that is all theres no choice but look theres the malmaison train we must run giggling and breathless they climbed on the trailer squeezing themselves on the back platform where everyone was pushing and exclaiming the car began to joggle its way through neuilly their bodies were pressed together by the men and women about them andrews put his arm firmly round jeannes waist and looked down at her pale cheek that was pressed against his chest her little round black straw hat with a bit of a red flower on it was just under his chin i cant see a thing she gasped still giggling ill describe the landscape said andrews why we are crossing the seine already oh how pretty it must be an old gentleman with a pointed white beard who stood beside them laughed benevolently but dont you think the seines pretty jeanne looked up at him impudently without a doubt without a doubt it was the way you said it said the old gentleman you are going to st germain he asked andrews no to malmaison oh you should go to st germain m reinachs prehistoric museum is there it is very beautiful you should not go home to your country without seeing it are there monkeys in it asked jeanne no said the old gentleman turning away i adore monkeys said jeanne the car was going along a broad empty boulevard with trees and grass plots and rows of low storehouses and little dilapidated rooming houses along either side many people had got out and there was plenty of room but andrews kept his arm round the girls waist the constant contact with her body made him feel very languid how good it smells said jeanne its the spring i want to lie on the grass and eat violets oh how good you were to bring me out like this jean you must know lots of fine ladies you could have brought out because you are so well educated how is it you are only an ordinary soldier good god i wouldnt be an officer why it must be rather nice to be an officer does etienne want to be an officer but hes a socialist thats different well i suppose i must be a socialist too but lets talk of something else andrews moved over to the other side of the platform they were passing little villas with gardens on the road where yellow and palepurple crocuses bloomed now and then there was a scent of violets in the moist air the sun had disappeared under soft purplishgrey clouds there was occasionally a rainy chill in the wind andrews suddenly thought of genevieve rod curious how vividly he remembered her face her wide open eyes and her way of smiling without moving her firm lips a feeling of annoyance went through him how silly of him to go off rudely like that and he became very anxious to talk to her again things he wanted to say to her came to his mind well are you asleep said jeanne tugging at his arm here we are andrews flushed furiously oh how nice it is here how nice it is here jeanne was saying why it is eleven oclock said andrews we must see the palace before lunch cried jeanne and she started running up a lane of linden trees where the fat buds were just bursting into little crinkling fans of green new grass was sprouting in the wet ditches on either side andrews ran after her his feet pounding hard in the moist gravel road when he caught up to her he threw his arms round her recklessly and kissed her panting mouth she broke away from him and strode demurely arranging her hat monster she said i trimmed this hat specially to come out with you and you do your best to wreck it poor little hat said andrews but it is so beautiful today and you are very lovely jeanne the great napoleon must have said that to the empress josephine and you know what he did to her said jeanne almost solemnly but she must have been awfully bored with him long before no said jeanne thats how women are they went through big iron gates into the palace grounds later they sat at a table in the garden of a little restaurant the sun very pale had just showed itself making the knives and forks and the white wine in their glasses gleam faintly lunch had not come yet they sat looking at each other silently andrews felt weary and melancholy he could think of nothing to say jeanne was playing with some tiny white daisies with pink tips to their petals arranging them in circles and crosses on the tablecloth arent they slow said andrews but its nice here isnt it jeanne smiled brilliantly but how glum he looks now she threw some daisies at him then after a pause she added mockingly its hunger my dear good lord how dependent men are on food andrews drank down his wine at a gulp he felt that if he could only make an effort he could lift off the stifling melancholy that was settling down on him like a weight that kept growing heavier a man in khaki with his face and neck scarlet staggered into the garden dragging beside him a mudencrusted bicycle he sank into an iron chair letting the bicycle fall with a clatter at his feet hi hi he called in a hoarse voice a waiter appeared and contemplated him suspiciously the man in khaki had hair as red as his face which was glistening with sweat his shirt was torn and he had no coat his breeches and puttees were invisible for mud gimme a beer croaked the man in khaki the waiter shrugged his shoulders and walked away il demande une biere said andrews mais monsieur ill pay get it for him the waiter disappeared thankee yank roared the man in khaki the waiter brought a tall narrow yellow glass the man in khaki took it from his hand drank it down at a draught and handed back the empty glass then he spat wiped his mouth on the back of his hand got with difficulty to his feet and shambled towards andrewss table oi presoom the loidy and you dont mind yank if oi parley wi yez a bit do yez no come along where did you come from the man in khaki dragged an iron chair behind him to a spot near the table before sitting down he bobbed his head in the direction of jeanne with an air of solemnity tugging at the same time at a lock of his red hair after some fumbling he got a redbordered handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his face with it leaving a long black smudge of machine oil on his forehead oim a bearer of important secret messages yank he said leaning back in the little iron chair oim a despatchrider you look all in not a bit of it oi just had a little hold up thats all in a woodland lane some buggers tried to do me in

keep all right the beers on me thank ye yank the man got to his feet shook hands with andrews and jeanne jumped on the bicycle and rode out of the garden to the road threading his way through the iron chairs and tables wasnt he a funny customer cried andrews laughing what a wonderful joke things are the waiter arrived with the omelette that began their lunch gives you an idea of how the old lavas bubbling in the volcano theres nowhere on earth a man can dance so well as on a volcano but dont talk that way said jeanne laying down her knife and fork its terrible we will waste our youth to no purpose our fathers enjoyed themselves when they were young and if there had been no war we should have been so happy etienne and i my father was a small manufacturer of soap and perfumery etienne would have had a splendid situation i should never have had to work we had a nice house i should have been married but this way jeanne havent you more freedom she shrugged her shoulders later she burst out but whats the good of freedom what can you do with it what one wants is to live well and have a beautiful house and be respected by people oh life was so sweet in france before the war in that case its not worth living said andrews in a savage voice holding himself in they went on eating silently the sky became overcast a few drops splashed on the tablecloth well have to take coffee inside said andrews and you think it is funny that people shoot at a man on a motorcycle going through a wood all that seems to me terrible terrible said jeanne look out here comes the rain they ran into the restaurant through the first hissing sheet of the shower and sat at a table near a window watching the rain drops dance and flicker on the green iron tables a scent of wet earth and the mushroomlike odor of sodden leaves came in borne on damp gusts through the open door a waiter closed the glass doors and bolted them he wants to keep out the spring he cant said andrews they smiled at each other over their coffee cups they were in sympathy again when the rain stopped they walked across wet fields by a foot path full of little clear puddles that reflected the blue sky and the whiteand ambertinged clouds where the shadows were light purplishgrey they walked slowly arm in arm pressing their bodies together they were very tired they did not know why and stopped often to rest leaning against the damp boles of trees beside a pond pale blue and amber and silver from the reflected sky they found under a big beech tree a patch of wild violets which jeanne picked greedily mixing them with the little crimsontipped daisies in the tight bouquet at the suburban railway station they sat silent side by side on a bench sniffing the flowers now and then so sunk in languid weariness that they could hardly summon strength to climb into a seat on top of a third class coach which was crowded with people coming home from a day in the country everybody had violets and crocuses and twigs with buds on them in peoples stiff citified clothes lingered a smell of wet fields and sprouting woods all the girls shrieked and threw their arms round the men when the train went through a tunnel or under a bridge whatever happened everybody laughed when the train arrived in the station it was almost with reluctance that they left it as if they felt that from that moment their workaday lives began again andrews and jeanne walked down the platform without touching each other their fingers were stained and sticky from touching buds and crushing young sappy leaves and grass stalks the air of the city seemed dense and unbreathable after the scented moisture of the fields they dined at a little restaurant on the quai voltaire and afterwards walked slowly towards the place st michel feeling the wine and the warmth of the food sending new vigor into their tired bodies andrews had his arm round her shoulder and they talked in low intimate voices hardly moving their lips looking long at the men and women they saw sitting twined in each others arms on benches at the couples of boys and girls that kept passing them talking slowly and quietly as they were bodies pressed together as theirs were how many lovers there are said andrews are we lovers asked jeanne with a curious little laugh i wonder have you ever been crazily in love jeanne i dont know there was a boy in laon named marcelin but i was a little fool then the last news of him was from verdun have you had manylike i am how sentimental we are she cried laughing no i wanted to know i know so little of life said andrews i have amused myself as best i could said jeanne in a serious tone but i am not frivolous there have been very few men i have liked so i have had few friendsdo you want to call them lovers but lovers are what married women have on the stage all that sort of thing is very silly not so very long ago said andrews i used to dream of being romantically in love with people climbing up the ivy on castle walls and fiery kisses on balconies in the moonlight like at the opera comique cried jeanne laughing that was all very silly but even now i want so much more of life than life can give they leaned over the parapet and listened to the hurrying swish of the river now soft and now loud where the reflections of the lights on the opposite bank writhed like golden snakes andrews noticed that there was someone beside them the faint greenish glow from the lamp on the quai enabled him to recognize the lame boy he had talked to months ago on the butte i wonder if youll remember me he said you are the american who was in the restaurant place du terte i dont remember when but it was long ago they shook hands but you are alone said andrews yes i am always alone said the lame boy firmly he held out his hand again au revoir said andrews good luck said the lame boy andrews heard his crutch tapping on the pavement as he went away along the quai jeanne said andrews suddenly youll come home with me wont you but you have a friend living with you hes gone to brussels he wont be back till tomorrow i suppose one must pay for ones dinner said jeanne maliciously good god no andrews buried his face in his hands the singsong of the river pouring through the bridges filled his ears he wanted desperately to cry bitter desire that was like hatred made his flesh tingle made his hands ache to crush her hands in them come along he said gruffly i didnt mean to say that she said in a gentle tired voice you know im not a very nice person the greenish glow of the lamp lit up the contour of one of her cheeks as she tilted her head up and glimmered in her eyes a soft sentimental sadness suddenly took hold of andrews he felt as he used to feel when as a very small child his mother used to tell him br rabbit stories and he would feel himself drifting helplessly on the stream of her soft voice narrating drifting towards something unknown and very sad which he could not help they started walking again past the pont neuf towards the glare of the place st michel three names had come into andrewss head arsinoe berenike artemisia for a little while he puzzled over them and then he remembered that genevieve rod had the large eyes and the wide smooth forehead and the firm little lips the women had in the portraits that were sewn on the mummy cases in the fayum but those patrician women of alexandria had not had chestnut hair with a glimpse of burnished copper in it they might have dyed it though why are you laughing asked jeanne because things are so silly perhaps you mean people are silly she said looking up at him out of the corners of her eyes youre right they walked in silence till they reached andrewss door you go up first and see that theres no one there said jeanne in a businesslike tone andrewss hands were cold he felt his heart thumping while he climbed the stairs the room was empty a fire was ready to light in the small fireplace andrews hastily tidied up the table and kicked under the bed some soiled clothes that lay in a heap in a corner a thought came to him how like his performances in his room at college when he had heard that a relative was coming to see him he tiptoed downstairs bien tu peux venir jeanne he said she sat down rather stiffly in the straightbacked armchair beside the fire how pretty the fire is she said jeanne i think im crazily in love with you said andrews in an excited voice like at the opera comique she shrugged her shoulders the rooms nice she said oh but what a big bed youre the first woman whos been up here in my time jeanne oh but this uniform is frightful andrews thought suddenly of all the tingling bodies constrained into the rigid attitudes of automatons in uniforms like this one of all the hideous farce of making men into machines oh if some gesture of his could only free them all for life and freedom and joy the thought drowned everything else for the moment but you pulled a button off cried jeanne laughing hysterically ill just have to sew it on again never mind if you knew how i hated them what white skin you have like a womans i suppose thats because you are blond said jeanne the sound of the door being shaken vigorously woke andrews he got up and stood in the middle of the floor for a moment without being able to collect his wits the shaking of the door continued and he heard walterss voice crying andy andy andrews felt shame creeping up through him like nausea he felt a passionate disgust towards himself and jeanne and walters he had an impulse to move furtively as if he had stolen something he went to the door and opened it a little say walters old man he said i cant let you in ive got a girl with me im sorry i thought you wouldnt get back till tomorrow youre kidding arent you came walterss voice out of the dark hall no andrews shut the door decisively and bolted it again jeanne was still asleep her black hair had come undone and spread over the pillow andrews pulled the covers up about her carefully then he got into the other bed where he lay awake a long time staring at the ceiling iv people walking along the boulevard looked curiously through the railing at the line of men in olivedrab that straggled round the edge of the courtyard the line moved slowly past a table where an officer and two enlisted men sat poring over big lists of names and piles of palely tinted banknotes and silver francs that glittered white above the mens heads a thin haze of cigarette smoke rose into the sunlight there was a sound of voices and of feet shuffling on the gravel the men who had been paid went off jauntily the money jingling in their pockets the men at the table had red faces and tense serious expressions they pushed the money into the soldiers hands with a rough jerk and pronounced the names as if they were machines clicking andrews saw that one of the men at the table was walters he smiled and whispered hello as he came up to him walters kept his eyes fixed on the list while andrews was waiting for the man ahead of him to be paid he heard two men in the line talking wasnt that a hell of a place dyou remember the lad that died in the barracks one day sure i was in the medicks there too there was a hell of a sergeant in that company tried to make the kid get up and the loot came and said hed courtmartial him an then they found out that hed cashed in his checks whatd ee die of heart failure i guess i dunno though he never did take to the life no that place cosne was enough to make any guy cash in his checks andrews got his money as he was walking away he strolled up to the two men he had heard talking were you fellows in cosne sure did you know a fellow named fuselli i dunno sure you do said the other man you remember dan fuselli the little wop thought he was goin to be corporal he had another think comin they both laughed andrews walked off vaguely angry there were many soldiers on the boulevard montparnasse he turned into a side street feeling suddenly furtive and humble as if he would hear any minute the harsh voice of a sergeant shouting orders at him the silver in his breeches pocket jingled with every step andrews leaned on the balustrade of the balcony looking down into the square in front of the opera comique he was dizzy with the beauty of the music he had been hearing he had a sense somewhere in the distances of his mind of the great rhythm of the sea people chattered all about him on the wide crowded balcony but he was only conscious of the bluegrey mistiness of the night where the lights made patterns in greengold and redgold and compelling his attention from everything else the rhythm swept through him like sea waves i thought youd be here said genevieve rod in a quiet voice beside him andrews felt strangely tonguetied its nice to see you he blurted out after looking at her silently for a moment of course you love pelleas it is the first time ive heard it why havent you been to see us its two weeks weve been expecting you i didnt knowoh ill certainly come i dont know anyone at present i can talk music to you know me anyone else i should have said are you working yes but this hinders frightfully andrews yanked at the front of his tunic still i expect to be free very soon im putting in an application for discharge i suppose you will feel you can do so much better you will be much stronger now that you have done your duty noby no means tell me what was that you played at our house the three green riders on wild asses said andrews smiling what do you mean its a prelude to the queen of sheba said andrews if you didnt think the same as m emile faguet and everyone else about st antoine id tell you what i mean that was very silly of me but if you pick up all the silly things people say accidentallywell you must be angry most of the time in the dim light he could not see her eyes there was a little glow on the curve of her cheek coming from under the dark of her hat to her rather pointed chin behind it he could see other faces of men and women crowded on the balcony talking lit up crudely by the gold glare that came out through the french windows from the lobby i have always been tremendously fascinated by the place in la tentation where the queen of sheba visited antoine thats all said andrews gruffly is that the first thing youve done it made me think a little of borodine the first thats at all pretentious its probably just a steal from everything ive ever heard no its good i suppose you had it in your head all through those dreadful and glorious days at the front is it for piano or orchestra all thats finished is for piano i hope to orchestrate it eventually oh but its really silly to talk this way i dont know enough i need years of hard work before i can do anything and i have wasted so much time that is the most frightful thing one has so few years of youth theres the bell we must scuttle back to our seats till the next intermission she slipped through the glass doors and disappeared andrews went back to his seat very excited full of unquiet exultation the first strains of the orchestra were pain he felt them so acutely after the last act they walked in silence down a dark street hurrying to get away from the crowds of the boulevards when they reached the avenue de lopera she said did you say you were going to stay in france yes indeed if i can i am going tomorrow to put in an application for discharge in france what will you do then i shall have to find a job of some sort that will let me study at the schola cantorum but i have enough money to last a little while you are courageous i forgot to ask you if you would rather take the metro no lets walk they went under the arch of the louvre the air was full of a fine wet mist so that every street lamp was surrounded by a blur of light my blood is full of the music of debussy said genevieve rod spreading out her arms its no use trying to say what one feels about it words arent much good anyway are they that depends they walked silently along the quais the mist was so thick they could not see the seine but whenever they came near a bridge they could hear the water rustling through the arches france is stifling said andrews all of a sudden it stifles you very slowly with beautiful silk bands america beats your brains out with a policemans billy what do you mean she asked letting pique chill her voice you know so much in france you have made the world so neat but you seem to want to stay here she said with a laugh its that theres nowhere else there is nowhere except paris where one can find out things about music particularly but i am one of those people who was not made to be contented only sheep are contented i think i have been happier this month in paris than ever before in my life it seems six so much has happened in it poissac is where i am happiest where is that we have a country house there very old and very tumbledown they say that rabelais used to come to the village but our house is from later from the time of henri quatre poissac is not far from tours an ugly name isnt it but to me it is very beautiful the house has orchards all round it and yellow roses with flushed centers poke themselves in my window and there is a little tower like montaignes when i get out of the army i shall go somewhere in the country and work and work music should be made in the country when the sap is rising in the trees dapres nature as the rabbit man said whos the rabbit man a very pleasant person said andrews bubbling with laughter you shall meet him some day he sells little stuffed rabbits that jump outside the cafe de rohan here we are thank you for coming home with me but how soon are you sure it is the house we cant have got there as soon as this yes its my house said genevieve rod laughing she held out her hand to him and he shook it eagerly the latchkey clicked in the door why dont you have a cup of tea with us here tomorrow she said with pleasure the big varnished door with its knocker in the shape of a ring closed behind her andrews walked away with a light step feeling jolly and exhilarated as he walked down the mistfilled quai towards the place st michel his ears were filled with the lisping gurgle of the river past the piers of the bridges walters was asleep on the table in his room was a card from jeanne andrews read the card holding it close to the candle how long it is since i saw you it read i shall pass the cafe de rohan wednesday at seven along the pavement opposite the magazin du louvre it was a card of malmaison andrews flushed bitter melancholy throbbed through him he walked languidly to the window and looked out into the dark court a window below his spilled a warm golden haze into the misty night through which he could make out vaguely some pots of ferns standing on the wet flagstones from somewhere came a dense smell of hyacinths fragments of thought slipped one after another through his mind he thought of himself washing windows long ago at training camp and remembered the way the gritty sponge scraped his hands he could not help feeling shame when he thought of those days well thats all over now he told himself he wondered in a halfirritated way about genevieve rod what sort of a person was she her face with its wide eyes and pointed chin and the reddishchestnut hair unpretentiously coiled above the white forehead was very vivid in his mind though when he tried to remember what it was like in profile he could not she had thin hands with long fingers that ought to play the piano well when she grew old would she be yellowtoothed and jolly like her mother he could not think of her old she was too vigorous there was too much malice in her passionatelyrestrained gestures the memory of her faded and there came to his mind jeannes overworked little hands with callous places and the tips of the fingers grimy and scarred from needlework but the smell of hyacinths that came up from the mistfilled courtyard was like a sponge wiping all impressions from his brain the dense sweet smell in the damp air made him feel languid and melancholy he took off his clothes slowly and got into bed the smell of the hyacinths came to him very faintly so that he did not know whether or not he was imagining it the majors office was a large whitepainted room with elaborate mouldings and mirrors in all four walls so that while andrews waited cap in hand to go up to the desk he could see the small round major with his pink face and bald head repeated to infinity in two directions in the grey brilliance of the mirrors what do you want said the major looking up from some papers he was signing andrews stepped up to the desk on both sides of the room a skinny figure in olivedrab repeated endlessly stepped up to endless mahogany desks which faded into each other in an endless dusty perspective would you mind oking this application for discharge major how many dependents muttered the major through his teeth poring over the application none its for discharge in france to study music wont do you need an affidavit that you can support yourself that you have enough money to continue your studies you want to study music eh dyou think youve got talent needs a very great deal of talent to study music yes sir but is there anything else i need except the affidavit no itll go through in short order were glad to release men were glad to release any man with a good military record williams yes sir a sergeant came over from a small table by the door show this man what he needs to do to get discharged in france andrews saluted out of the corner of his eye he saw the figures in the mirror saluting down an endless corridor when he got out on the street in front of the great white building where the majors office was a morose feeling of helplessness came over him there were many automobiles of different sizes and shapes limousines runabouts touring cars lined up along the curb all painted olivedrab and neatly stenciled with numbers in white now and then a personage came out of the white marble building puttees and sam browne belt gleaming and darted into an automobile or a noisy motorcycle stopped with a jerk in front of the wide door to let out an officer in goggles and mudsplattered trench coat who disappeared immediately through revolving doors andrews could imagine him striding along halls where from every door came an imperious clicking of typewriters where papers were piled high on yellow varnished desks where sallowfaced clerks in uniform loafed in rooms where the four walls were covered from floor to ceiling with card catalogues and every day they were adding to the paper piling up more little drawers with index cards it seemed to andrews that the shiny white marble building would have to burst with all the paper stored up within it and would flood the broad avenue with avalanches of index cards button yer coat snarled a voice in his ear andrews looked up suddenly an m p with a rawlooking face in which was a long sharp nose had come up to him andrews buttoned up his overcoat and said nothing ye cant hang around here this way the m p called after him andrews flushed and walked away without turning his head he was stinging with humiliation an angry voice inside him kept telling him that he was a coward that he should make some futile gesture of protest grotesque pictures of revolt flamed through his mind until he remembered that when he was very small the same tumultuous pride had seethed and ached in him whenever he had been reproved by an older person helpless despair fluttered about within him like a bird beating against the wires of a cage was there no outlet no gesture of expression would he have to go on this way day after day swallowing the bitter gall of indignation that every new symbol of his slavery brought to his lips he was walking in an agitated way across the jardin des tuileries full of little children and women with dogs on leashes and nursemaids with starched white caps when he met genevieve rod and her mother genevieve was dressed in pearl grey with an elegance a little too fashionable to please andrews mme rod wore black in front of them a black and tan terrier ran from one side to the other on nervous little legs that trembled like steel springs isnt it lovely this morning cried genevieve i didnt know you had a dog oh we never go out without santo a protection to two lone women you know said mme rod laughing viens santo dis bonjour au monsieur he usually lives at poissac said genevieve the little dog barked furiously at andrews a shrill bark like a child squalling he knows he ought to be suspicious of soldiers i imagine most soldiers would change with him if they had a chance viens santo viens santo will you change lives with me santo you look as if youd been quarrelling with somebody said genevieve rod lightly i have with myself im going to write a book on slave psychology it would be very amusing said andrews in a gruff breathless voice but we must hurry dear or well be late to the tailors said mme rod she held out her blackgloved hand to andrews well be in at tea time this afternoon you might play me some more of the queen of sheba said genevieve im afraid i shant be able to but you never can tell thank you he was relieved to have left them he had been afraid he would burst out into some childish tirade what a shame old henslowe hadnt come back yet he could have poured out all his despair to him he had often enough before and henslowe was out of the army now wearily andrews decided that he would have to start scheming and intriguing again as he had schemed and intrigued to come to paris in the first place he thought of the white marble building and the officers with shiny puttees going in and out and the typewriters clicking in every room and the understanding of his helplessness before all that complication made him shiver an idea came to him he ran down the steps of a metro station aubrey would know someone at the crillon who could help him but when the train reached the concorde station he could not summon the will power to get out he felt a harsh repugnance to any effort what was the use of humiliating himself and begging favors of people it was hopeless anyway in a fierce burst of pride a voice inside of him was shouting that he john andrews should have no shame that he should force people to do things for him that he who lived more acutely than the rest suffering more pain and more joy who had the power to express his pain and his joy so that it would impose itself on others should force his will on those around him more of the psychology of slavery said andrews to himself suddenly smashing the soapbubble of his egoism the train had reached the porte maillot andrews stood in the sunny boulevard in front of the metro station where the plane trees were showing tiny goldbrown leaves sniffing the smell of a flowerstall in front of which a woman stood with a deft abstracted gesture tying up bunch after bunch of violets he felt a desire to be out in the country to be away from houses and people there was a line of men and women buying tickets for st germain still indecisive he joined it and at last almost without intending it found himself jolting through neuilly in the green trailer of the electric car that waggled like a ducks tail when the car went fast he remembered his last trip on that same car with jeanne and wished mournfully that he might have fallen in love with her that he might have forgotten himself and the army and everything in crazy romantic love when he got off the car at st germain he had stopped formulating his thoughts soggy despair throbbed in him like an infected wound he sat for a while at the cafe opposite the chateau looking at the light red walls and the strong stonebordered windows and the jaunty turrets and chimneys that rose above the classic balustrade with its big urns on the edge of the roof the park through the tall iron railings was full of russet and pale lines all mist of new leaves had they really lived more vividly the people of the renaissance andrews could almost see men with plumed hats and short cloaks and elaborate brocaded tunics swaggering with a hand at the sword hilt about the quiet square in front of the gate of the chateau and he thought of the great sudden wind of freedom that had blown out of italy before which dogmas and slaveries had crumbled to dust in contrast the world today seemed pitifully arid men seemed to have shrunk in stature before the vastness of the mechanical contrivances they had invented michael angelo da vinci aretino cellini would the strong figures of men ever so dominate the world again today everything was congestion the scurrying of crowds men had become antlike perhaps it was inevitable that the crowds should sink deeper and deeper in slavery whichever won tyranny from above or spontaneous organization from below there could be no individuals he went through the gates into the park laid out with a few flower beds where pansies bloomed through the dark ranks of elm trunks was brilliant sky with here and there a mossgreen statue standing out against it at the head of an alley he came out on a terrace beyond the strong curves of the pattern of the iron balustrade was an expanse of country pale green falling to blue towards the horizon patched with pink and slatecolored houses and carved with railway tracks at his feet the seine shone like a curved sword blade he walked with long strides along the terrace and followed a road that turned into the forest forgetting the monotonous tread mill of his thoughts in the flush that the fast walking sent through his whole body in the rustling silence of the woods where the moss on the north side of the boles of the trees was emerald and where the sky was soft grey through a lavender lacework of branches the green gnarled woods made him think of the first act of pelleas with his tunic unbuttoned and his shirt open at the neck and his hands stuck deep in his pockets he went along whistling like a school boy after an hour he came out of the woods on a highroad where he found himself walking beside a twowheeled cart that kept pace with him exactly try as he would to get ahead of it after a while a boy leaned out hey lamericain vous voulez monter where are you going conflansstehonorine wheres that the boy flourished his whip vaguely towards the horses head all right said andrews these are potatoes said the boy make yourself comfortable andrews offered him a cigarette which he took with muddy fingers he had a broad face red cheeks and chunky features reddishbrown hair escaped spikily from under a mudspattered beret where did you say you were going conflansstehonorine silly all these saints arent they andrews laughed where are you going the boy asked i dont know i was taking a walk the boy leaned over to andrews and whispered in his car deserter no i had a day off and wanted to see the country i just thought if you were a deserter i might be able to help you must be silly to be a soldier dirty life but you like the country so do i you cant call this country im not from this part im from brittany there we have real country its stifling near paris here so many people so many houses it seems mighty fine to me thats because youre a soldier better than barracks hein dirty life that ill never be a soldier im going into the navy merchant marine and then if i have to do service ill do it on the sea i suppose it is pleasanter theres more freedom and the sea we bretons you know we all die of the sea or of liquor they laughed have you been long in this part of the country asked andrews six months its very dull this farming work im head of a gang in a fruit orchard but not for long i have a brother shipped on a sailing vessel when he comes back to bordeaux ill ship on the same boat where to south america peru how should i know id like to ship on a sailing vessel said andrews you would it seems very fine to me to travel and see new countries and perhaps i shall stay over there where how should i know if i like it that is life is very bad in europe it is stifling i suppose said andrews slowly all these nations all these hatreds but stillit is very beautiful life is very ugly in america lets have something to drink theres a bistro the boy jumped down from the cart and tied the horse to a tree they went into a small wine shop with a counter and one square oak table but wont you be late said andrews i dont care i like talking dont you yes indeed they ordered wine of an old woman in a green apron who had three yellow teeth that protruded from her mouth when she spoke i havent had anything to eat said andrews wait a minute the boy ran out to the cart and came back with a canvas bag from which he took half a loaf of bread and some cheese my names marcel the boy said when they had sat for a while sipping wine mine is jeanjean andre i have a brother named jean and my fathers name is andre thats pleasant isnt it but it must be a splendid job working in a fruit orchard said andrews munching bread and cheese its well paid but you get tired of being in one place all the time its not as it is in brittany marcel paused he sat rocking a little on the stool holding on to the seat between his legs a curious brilliance came into his grey eyes there he went on in a soft voice it is so quiet in the fields and from every hill you look at the sea i like that dont you he turned to andrews with a smile you are lucky to be free said andrews bitterly he felt as if he would burst into tears but you will be demobilized soon the butchery is over you will go home to your family that will be good hein i wonder its not far enough away restless what do you expect a fine rain was falling they climbed in on the potato sacks and the horse started a jog trot its lanky brown shanks glistened a little from the rain do you come out this way often asked marcel i shall its the nicest place near paris some sunday you must come and ill take you round the castle is very fine and then there is malmaison where the great emperor lived with the empress josephine andrews suddenly remembered jeannes card this was wednesday he pictured her dark figure among the crowd of the pavement in front of the cafe de rohan of course it had to be that way despair so helpless as to be almost sweet came over him and girls he said suddenly to marcel are they pretty round here marcel shrugged his shoulders its not women that we lack if a fellow has money he said andrews felt a sense of shame he did not exactly know why my brother writes that in south america the women are very brown and very passionate added marcel with a wistful smile but travelling and reading books thats what i like but look if you want to take the train back to paris marcel pulled up the horse to a standstill if you want to take the train cross that field by the foot path and keep right along the road to the left till you come to the river theres a ferryman the towns herblay and theres a station and any sunday before noon ill be at rue des eveques reuil you must come and well take a walk together they shook hands and andrews strode off across the wet fields something strangely sweet and wistful that he could not analyse lingered in his mind from marcels talk somewhere beyond everything he was conscious of the great free rhythm of the sea then he thought of the majors office that morning and of his own skinny figure in the mirrors repeated endlessly standing helpless and humble before the shining mahogany desk even out here in these fields where the wet earth seemed to heave with the sprouting of new growth he was not free in those office buildings with white marble halls full of the clank of officers heels in index cards and piles of typewritten papers his real self which they had power to kill if they wanted to was in his name and his number on lists with millions of other names and other numbers this sentient body of his full of possibilities and hopes and desires was only a pale ghost that depended on the other self that suffered for it and cringed for it he could not drive out of his head the picture of himself skinny in an illfitting uniform repeated endlessly in the two mirrors of the majors whitepainted office all of a sudden through bare poplar trees he saw the seine he hurried along the road splashing now and then in a shining puddle until he came to a landing place the river was very wide silvery streaked with palegreen and violet and strawcolor from the evening sky opposite were bare poplars and behind them clusters of buffcolored houses climbing up a green hill to a church all repeated upside down in the colorstreaked river the river was very full and welled up above its banks the way the water stands up above the rim of a glass filled too full from the water came an indefinable rustling flowing sound that rose and fell with quiet rhythm in andrewss ears andrews forgot everything in the great wave of music that rose impetuously through him poured with the hot blood through his veins with the streaked colors of the river and the sky through his eyes with the rhythm of the flowing river through his ears v so i came without said andrews laughing what fun cried genevieve but anyway they couldnt do anything to you chartres is so near its at the gates of paris they were alone in the compartment the train had pulled out of the station and was going through suburbs where the trees were in leaf in the gardens and fruit trees foamed above the red brick walls among the boxlike villas anyway said andrews it was an opportunity not to be missed that must be one of the most amusing things about being a soldier avoiding regulations i wonder whether damocles didnt really enjoy his sword dont you think so they laughed but mother was very doubtful about my coming with you this way shes such a dear she wants to be very modern and liberal but she always gets frightened at the last minute and my aunt will think the worlds end has come when we appear they went through some tunnels and when the train stopped at sevres had a glimpse of the seine valley where the blue mist made a patina over the soft peagreen of new leaves then the train came out on wide plains full of the glaucous shimmer of young oats and the goldengreen of freshsprinkled wheat fields where the mist on the horizon was purplish the trains shadow blue sped along beside them over the grass and fences how beautiful it is to go out of the city this way in the early morning has your aunt a piano yes a very old and tinkly one it would be amusing to play you all i have done at the queen of sheba you say the most helpful things it is that i am interested i think you will do something some day andrews shrugged his shoulders they sat silent their ears filled up by the jerking rhythm of wheels over rails now and then looking at each other almost furtively outside fields and hedges and patches of blossom and poplar trees faintly powdered with green unrolled like a scroll before them behind the nicker of telegraph poles and the festooned wires on which the sun gave glints of red copper andrews discovered all at once that the coppery glint on the telegraph wires was the same as the glint in genevieves hair berenike artemisia arsinoe the names lingered in his mind so that as he looked out of the window at the long curves of the telegraph wires that seemed to rise and fall as they glided past he could imagine her face with its large pale brown eyes and its small mouth and broad smooth forehead suddenly stilled into the encaustic painting on the mummy case of some alexandrian girl tell me she said when did you begin to write music andrews brushed the light disordered hair off his forehead why i think i forgot to brush my hair this morning he said you see i was so excited by the idea of coming to chartres with you they laughed but my mother taught me to play the piano when i was very small he went on seriously she and i lived alone in an old house belonging to her family in virginia how different all that was from anything you have ever lived it would not be possible in europe to be as isolated as we were in virginia mother was very unhappy she had led a dreadfully thwarted lifethat unrelieved hopeless misery that only a woman can suffer she used to tell me stories and i used to make up little tunes about them and about anything the great success he laughed was i remember to a dandelion i can remember so well the way mother pursed up her lips as she leaned over the writing desk she was very tall and as it was dark in our old sitting room had to lean far over to see she used to spend hours making beautiful copies of tunes i made up my mother is the only person who has ever really had any importance in my life but i lack technical training terribly do you think it is so important said genevieve leaning towards him to make herself heard above the clatter of the train perhaps it isnt i dont know i think it always comes sooner or later if you feel intensely enough but it is so frightful to feel all you want to express getting away beyond you an idea comes into your head and you feel it grow stronger and stronger and you cant grasp it you have no means to express it its like standing on a street corner and seeing a gorgeous procession go by without being able to join it or like opening a bottle of beer and having it foam all over you without having a glass to pour it into genevieve burst out laughing but you can drink from the bottle cant you she said her eyes sparkling im trying to said andrews here we are theres the cathedral no its hidden cried genevieve they got to their feet as they left the station andrews said but after all its only freedom that matters when im out of the army yes i suppose you are rightfor you that is the artist should be free from any sort of entanglement i dont see what difference there is between an artist and any other sort of workman said andrews savagely no but look from the square where they stood above the green blur of a little park they could see the cathedral creamy yellow and rust color with the sober tower and the gaudy tower and the great rose window between the whole pile standing nonchalantly knee deep in the packed roofs of the town they stood shoulder to shoulder looking at it without speaking in the afternoon they walked down the hill towards the river that flowed through a quarter of tottering peakgabled houses and mills from which came a sound of grinding wheels above them towering over gardens full of pear trees in bloom the apse of the cathedral bulged against the pale sky on a narrow and very ancient bridge they stopped and looked at the water full of a shimmer of blue and green and grey from the sky and from the vivid new leaves of the willow trees along the bank their senses glutted with the beauty of the day and the intricate magnificence of the cathedral languid with all they had seen and said they were talking of the future with quiet voices its all in forming a habit of work andrews was saying you have to be a slave to get anything done its all a question of choosing your master dont you think so yes i suppose all the men who have left their imprint on peoples lives have been slaves in a sense said genevieve slowly everyone has to give up a great deal of life to live anything deeply but its worth it she looked andrews full in the eyes yes i think its worth it said andrews but you must help me now i am like a man who has come up out of a dark cellar im almost too dazzled by the gorgeousness of everything but at least i am out of the cellar look a fish jumped cried genevieve i wonder if we could hire a boat anywhere dont you think itd be fun to go out in a boat a voice broke in on genevieves answer lets see your pass will you andrews turned round a soldier with a round brown face and red cheeks stood beside him on the bridge andrews looked at him fixedly a little zigzag scar above his left eye showed white on his heavily tanned skin lets see your pass the man said again he had a high pitched squeaky voice andrews felt the blood thumping in his ears are you an m p yes well im in the sorbonne detachment what the hells that said the m p laughing thinly what does he say asked genevieve smiling nothing ill have to go see the officer and explain said andrews in a breathless voice you go back to your aunts and ill come as soon as ive arranged it no ill come with you please go back it may be serious ill come as soon as i

small wine shop a man with a red m p badge sat smoking he got up when he saw them pass and opened the door with one hand on his pistol holster i got one bird bill said the man shoving andrews roughly in the door good for you handsome is he quiet um handsome grunted sit down there if you move youll git a bullet in your guts the m p stuck out a square jaw he had a sallow skin puffy under the eyes

spreading his legs out over the floor aint that rich said handsome laughing shrilly again got any papers on ye ye must have some sort of papers andrews searched his pockets he flushed i ought to have

the top of his tunic andrews pulled his body away i havent got any on i forgot to put any on this morning no tag no insignia yes i have infantry no papers i bet hes been out a hell of a time said handsome meditatively better put the cuffs on him said bill in the middle of a yawn lets wait a while whens the loot coming not till night sure yes aint no train how about a side car no i know he aint

he came back swinging a bottle of cognac in his hand tole the madame youd pay skinny said the man as he passed andrewss chair andrews nodded the two m ps drew up to the table beside which andrews sat andrews could not keep his eyes off them bill huggis hummed as he pulled the cork out of the bottle its the smile that makes you happy its the smile that makes you sad handsome watched him grinning suddenly they both burst out laughing an the damn fool thinks hes in a school battalion said handsome in his shrill voice itll be another kind of a battalion youll be in skinny cried bill huggis he stifled his laughter with a long drink from the bottle he smacked his lips not so goddam bad he said then he started humming again its the smile that makes you happy its the smile that makes you sad have some skinny said handsome pushing the bottle towards andrews no thanks said andrews ye wont be gettin good cognac where yer goin skinny not by a damn sight growled bill huggis in the middle of a laugh all right ill take a swig an idea had suddenly come into andrewss head gee the bastard kin drink cognac cried handsome got enough money to buy us another bottle andrews nodded he wiped his mouth absently with his handkerchief he had drunk the raw cognac without tasting it get another bottle handsome said bill huggis carelessly a purplish flush had appeared in the lower part of his cheeks when the other man came back he burst out laughing the last cognac this skinny guy from the school detachmentll get for many a day better drink up strong skinny they dont have that stuff down on the farm school detachment ill be goddamned he leaned back in his chair shaking with laughter handsomes face was crimson only the zigzag scar over his eye remained white he was swearing in a low voice as he worked the cork out of the bottle andrews could not keep his eyes off the mens faces they went from one to the other in spite of him now and then for an instant he caught a glimpse of the yellow and brown squares of the wall paper and the bar with a few empty bottles behind it he tried to count the bottles one two three but he was staring in the lustreless grey eyes of bill huggis who lay back in his chair blowing smoke out of his nose now and then reaching for the cognac bottle all the while humming faintly under his breath its the smile that makes you happy its the smile that makes you sad handsome sat with his elbows on the table and his chin in his beefy hands his face was flushed crimson but the skin was softly moulded like a womans the light in the room was beginning to grow grey handsome and bill huggis stood up a young officer with clearlymarked features and a campaign hat worn a little on one side came in stood with his feet wide apart in the middle of the floor andrews went up to him im in the sorbonne detachment lieutenant stationed in paris dont you know enough to salute said the officer looking him up and down one of you men teach him to salute he said slowly handsome made a step towards andrews and hit him with his fist between the eyes there was a flash of light and the room swung round and there was a splitting crash as his head struck the floor he got to his feet the fist hit him in the same place blinding him the three figures and the bright oblong of the window swung round a chair crashed down with him and a hard rap in the back of his skull brought momentary blackness thats enough let him be he heard a voice far away at the end of a black tunnel a great weight seemed to be holding him down as he struggled to get up blinded by tears and blood rending pains darted like arrows through his head there were handcuffs on his wrists git up snarled a voice he got to his feet faint light came through the streaming tears in his eyes his forehead flamed as if hot coals were being pressed against it prisoner attention shouted the officers voice march automatically andrews lifted one foot and then the other he felt in his face the cool air of the street on either side of him were the hard steps of the m ps within him a nightmare voice was shrieking shrieking part six under the wheels i the uncovered garbage cans clattered as they were thrown one by one into the truck dust and a smell of putrid things hung in the air about the men as they worked a guard stood by with his legs wide apart and his riflebutt on the pavement between them the early mist hung low hiding the upper windows of the hospital from the door beside which the garbage cans were ranged came a thick odor of carbolic the last garbage can rattled into place on the truck the four prisoners and the guard clambered on finding room as best they could among the cans from which dripped bloody bandages ashes and bits of decaying food and the truck rumbled off towards the incinerator through the streets of paris that sparkled with the gaiety of early morning the prisoners wore no tunics their shirts and breeches had dark stains of grease and dirt on their hands were torn canvas gloves the guard was a sheepish pinkfaced youth who kept grinning apologetically and had trouble keeping his balance when the truck went round corners how many days do they keep a guy on this job happy asked a boy with mild blue eyes and a creamy complexion and reddish curly hair damned if i know kid as long as they please i guess said the bullnecked man next him who had a lined prize fighters face with a heavy protruding jaw then after looking at the boy for a minute with his face twisted into an astonished sort of grin he went on say kid how in hell did you git here robbin the cradle oi call it to send you here kid i stole a ford the boy answered cheerfully like hell you did sold it for five hundred francs happy laughed and caught hold of an ash can to keep from being thrown out of the jolting truck kin ye beat that guard he cried aint that somethin the guard sniggered didnt send me to leavenworth cause i was so young went on the kid placidly how old are you kid asked andrews who was leaning against the drivers seat seventeen said the boy blushing and casting his eyes down he must have lied like hell to git in this goddam army boomed the deep voice of the truck driver who had leaned over to spit s long squirt of tobacco juice the truck driver jammed the brakes on the garbage cans banged against each other the kid cried out in pain hold your horses cant you you nearly broke my leg the truck driver was swearing in a long string of words goddam these dreamin skygazin sons of french bastards why dont they get out of your way git out an crank her up happy guess a fellerd be lucky if hed break his leg or somethin dont you think so skinny said the fourth prisoner in a low voice itll take morn a broken leg to git you out o this labor battalion hoggenback wont it guard said happy as he climbed on again the truck jolted away trailing a haze of cinder dust and a sour stench of garbage behind it andrews noticed all at once that they were going down the quais along the river notre dame was rosy in the misty sunlight the color of lilacs in full bloom he looked at it fixedly a moment and then looked away he felt very far from it like a man looking at the stars from the bottom of a pit my mate hes gone to leavenworth for five years said the kid when they had been silent some time listening to the rattle of the garbage cans as the trucks jolted over the cobbles helped yer steal the ford did he asked happy ford nothin he sold an ammunition train he was a railroad man he was a mason thats why he only got five years i guess five years in leavenworths enough for anybody muttered hoggenback scowling he was a squareshouldered dark man who always hung his head when he worked we didnt meet up till we got to paris we was on a hell of a party together at the olympia thats where they picked us up took us to the bastille ever been in the bastille i have said hoggenback aint no joke is it christ said hoggenback his face flushed a furious red he turned away and looked at the civilians walking briskly along the early morning streets at the waiters in shirt sleeves swabbing off the cafe tables at the women pushing handcarts full of brightcolored vegetables over the cobblestones i guess they aint nobody gone through what we guys go through with said happy itd be better if the ole war was still a goin to my way o thinkin theyd chuck us into the trenches then aint so low as this look lively shouted the truck driver as the truck stopped in a dirty yard full of cinder piles aint got all day five more loads to get yet the guard stood by with angry face and stiff limbs for he feared there were officers about and the prisoners started unloading the garbage cans their nostrils were full of the stench of putrescence between their lips was a gritty taste of cinders the air in the dark mess shack was thick with steam from the kitchen at one end the men filed past the counter holding out their mess kits into which the k ps splashed the food occasionally someone stopped to ask for a larger helping in an ingratiating voice they ate packed together at long tables of roughly planed boards stained from the constant spilling of grease and coffee and still wet from a perfunctory scrubbing andrews sat at the end of a bench near the door through which came the glimmer of twilight eating slowly surprised at the relish with which he ate the greasy food and at the exhausted contentment that had come over him almost in spite of himself hoggenback sat opposite him funny he said to hoggenback its not really as bad as i thought it would be what dyou mean this labor battalion hell a feller can put up with anything thats one thing you learn in the army i guess people would rather put up with things than make an effort to change them youre goddam right got a butt andrews handed him a cigarette they got to their feet and walked out into the twilight holding their mess kits in front of them as they were washing their mess kits in a tub of greasy water where bits of food floated in a thick scum hoggenback suddenly said in a low voice but it all piles up buddy some day therell be an accountin dyou believe in religion no neither do i i come of folks as done their own accountin my father an my granfather before him a feller cant eat his bile day after day day after day im afraid he can hoggenback broke in andrews they walked towards the barracks goddam it no cried hoggenback aloud there comes a point where you cant eat yer bile any more where it dont do no good to cuss then you runs amuck hanging his head he went slowly into the barracks andrews leaned against the outside of the building staring up at the sky he was trying desperately to think to pull together a few threads of his life in this moment of respite from the nightmare in five minutes the bugle would din in his ears and he would be driven into the barracks a tune came to his head that he played with eagerly for a moment and then as memory came to him tried to efface with a shudder of disgust theres the smile that makes you happy theres the smile that makes you sad it was almost dark two men walked slowly by in front of him sarge may i speak to you came a voice in a whisper the sergeant grunted i think theres two guys trying to break loose out of here who if youre wrong itll be the worse for you remember that surley an watson i heard em talkin about it behind the latrine damn fools they was sayin theyd rather be dead than keep up this life they did did they dont talk so loud sarge it wouldnt do for any of the fellers to know i was talkin to yer say sarge the voice became whining dont you think ive nearly served my time down here what do i know about that taint my job but sarge i used to be company clerk with my old outfit dont ye need a guy round the office andrews strode past them into the barracks dull fury possessed him he took off his clothes and got silently into his blankets hoggenback and happy were talking beside his bunk never you mind said hoggenback somebodyll get that guy sooner or later git him nauthin the fellers in that camp was so damn skeered they jumped if you snapped yer fingers at em its the discipline im tellin yer it gits a feller in the end said happy andrews lay without speaking listening to their talk aching in every muscle from the crushing work of the day they courtmartialled that guy a feller told me went on hoggenback an what dye think they did to him retired on half pay he was a major gawd if i iver git out o this army ill be so goddam glad began happy hoggenback interrupted that youll forgit all about the raw deal they gave you an tell everybody how fine ye liked it andrews felt the mocking notes of the bugle outside stabbing his ears a noncoms voice roared quiet from the end of the building and the lights went out already andrews could hear the deep breathing of men asleep he lay awake staring into the darkness his body throbbing with the monotonous rhythms of the work of the day he seemed still to hear the sickening whine in the mans voice as he talked to the sergeant outside in the twilight and shall i be reduced to that he was asking himself andrews was leaving the latrine when he heard a voice call softly skinny yes he said come here i want to talk to you it was the kids voice there was no light in the illsmelling shack that served for a latrine outside they could hear the guard humming softly to himself as he went back and forth before the barracks door lets you and me be buddies skinny sure said andrews say what dyou think the chance is o cuttin loose pretty damn poor said andrews couldnt you just make a noise like a hoop an roll away they giggled softly andrews put his hand on the boys arm but kid its too risky i got in this fix by taking a risk i dont feel like beginning over again and if they catch you its desertion leavenworth for twenty years or life thatd be the end of everything well what the hells this oh i dont know theyve got to let us out some day shsh kid put his hand suddenly over andrewss mouth they stood rigid so that they could hear their hearts pounding outside there was a brisk step on the gravel the sentry halted and saluted the steps faded into the distance and the sentrys humming began again they put two fellers in the jug for a month for talking like we are in solitary whispered kid but kid i havent got the guts to try anything now sure you have skinny you an mes got more guts than all the rest of em put together god if people had guts you couldnt treat em like they were curs look if i can ever get out o this ive got a hunch i can make a good thing writing movie scenarios i want to get on in the world skinny but kid you wont be able to go back to the states i dont care new rochelles not the whole world they got the movies in italy aint they sure lets go to bed all right look you an me are buddies from now on skinny andrews felt the kids hand press his arm in his dark airless bunk in the lowest of three tiers andrews lay awake a long time listening to the snores and the heavy breathing about him thoughts fluttered restlessly in his head but in his blank hopelessness he could only frown and bite his lips and roll his head from side to side on the rolledup tunic he used for a pillow listening with desperate attention to the heavy breathing of the men who slept above him and beside him when he fell asleep he dreamed that he was alone with genevieve rod in the concert hall of the schola cantorum and that he was trying desperately hard to play some tune for her on the violin a tune he kept forgetting and in the agony of trying to remember the tears streamed down his cheeks then he had his arms round genevieves shoulders and was kissing her kissing her until he found that it was a wooden board he was kissing a wooden board on which was painted a face with broad forehead and great pale brown eyes and small tight lips and all the while a boy who seemed to be both chrisfield and the kid kept telling him to run or the mps would get him then he sat frozen in icy terror with a bottle in his hand while a frightful voice behind him sang very loud theres the smile that makes you happy theres the smile that makes you sad the bugle woke him and he sat up with such a start that he hit his head hard against the bunk above him he lay back cringing from the pain like a child but he had to hurry desperately to get his clothes on in time for roll call it was with a feeling of relief that he found that mess was not ready and that men were waiting in line outside the kitchen shack stamping their feet and clattering their mess kits as they moved about through the chilly twilight of the spring morning andrews found he was standing behind hoggenback hows she comin skinny whispered hoggenback in his low mysterious voice oh were all in the same boat said andrews with a laugh wish itd sink muttered the other man dye know he went on after a pause i kinder thought an edicated guy like youd be able to keep out of a mess like this i wasnt brought up without edication but i guess i didnt have enough i guess most of em can i dont sec that its much to the point a man suffers as much if he doesnt know how to read and write as if he had a college education i dunno skinny a feller whos led a rough life can put up with an awful lot the thing is skinny i might have had a commission if i hadnt been so damned impatient im a lumberman by trade and my dads cleaned up a pretty thing in war contracts jus a short time ago he could have got me in the engineers if i hadnt gone off an enlisted why did you i was restlesslike i guess i wanted to see the world i didnt care about the goddam war but i wanted to see what things was like over here well youve seen said andrews smiling in the neck said hoggenback as he pushed out his cup for coffee in the truck that was taking them to work andrews and the kid sat side by side on the jouncing backboard and tried to talk above the rumble of the exhaust like paris asked the kid not this way said andrews say one of the guys said you could parlay french real well i want you to teach me a guys got to know languages to get along in this country but you must know some bedroom french said the kid laughing well but if i want to write a movie scenario for an eytalian firm i cant just write voulayvous couchezavecmoa over and over again but youll have to learn italian kid im goin to say aint they taking us a hell of a ways today skinny were goin to passy wharf to unload rock said somebody in a grumbling voice no its a cementcement for the stadium were presentin the french nation aint you read in the stars and stripes about it id present em with a swift kick and a hell of a lot of other people too so we have to sweat unloadin cement all day muttered hoggenback to give these goddam frawgs a stadium if it werent that itd be somethin else but aint we got folks at home to work for cried hoggenback mightnt all this sweat be doin some good for us building a stadium my gawd pile out there quick rasped a voice from the drivers seat through the haze of choking white dust andrews got now and then a glimpse of the greygreen river with its tugboats sporting their white cockades of steam and their long trailing plumes of smoke and its bluntnosed barges and its bridges where people walked jauntily back and forth going about their business going where they wanted to go the bags of cement were very heavy and the unaccustomed work sent racking pains through his back the biting dust stung under his finger nails and in his mouth and eyes all the morning a sort of refrain went through his head people have spent their livesdoing only this people have spent their lives doing only this as he crossed and recrossed the narrow plank from the barge to the shore he looked at the black water speeding seawards and took extraordinary care not to let his foot slip he did not know why for onehalf of him was thinking how wonderful it would be to drown to forget in eternal black silence the hopeless struggle once he saw the kid standing before the sergeant in charge in an attitude of complete exhaustion and caught a glint of his blue eyes as he looked up appealingly looking like a child begging out of a spanking the sight amused him and he said to himself if i had pink cheeks and cupids bow lips i might be able to go through life on my blue eyes and he pictured the kid a fat cherubic old man stepping out of a white limousine the way people do in the movies and looking about him with those same mild blue eyes but soon he forgot everything in the agony of the heavy cement bags bearing down on his back and hips in the truck on the way back to the mess the kid looking fresh and smiling among the sweating men like ghosts from the white dust talking hoarsely above the clatter of the truck sidled up very close to andrews dyou like swimmin skinny yes id give a lot to get some of this cement dust off me said andrews without interest i once won a boys swimmin race at coney said the kid andrews did not answer were you in the swimmin team or anything like that skinny when you went to school no it would be wonderful to be in the water though i used to swim way out in chesapeake bay at night when the water was phosphorescent andrews suddenly found the kids blue eyes bright as flames from excitement staring into his god im an ass he muttered he felt the kids fist punch him softly in the back sergeant said they was goin to work us late as hell tonight the kid was saying aloud to the men round him ill be dead if they do muttered hoggenback an you a lumberjack it aint that i could carry their bloody bags two at a time if i wanted ter a feller gets so goddam mad thats all so goddam mad dont he skinny hoggenback turned to andrews and smiled andrews nodded his head after the first two or three bags andrews carried in the afternoon it seemed as if every one would be the last he could possibly lift his back and thighs throbbed with exhaustion his face and the tips of his fingers felt raw from the biting cement dust when the river began to grow purple with evening he noticed that two civilians young men with buffcolored coats and canes were watching the gang at work they says theys newspaper reporters writing up how fast the armys being demobilized said one man in an awed voice they come to the right place tell em were leavin for home now loadin our barracks bags on the steamer the newspaper men were giving out cigarettes several men grouped round them one shouted out were the guys does the light work blackjack pershings own pet labor battalion they like us so well they just cant let us go damn jackasses muttered hoggenback as with his eyes to the ground he passed andrews i could tell em some thingsd make their goddam ears buzz why dont you what the hells the use i aint got the edication to talk up to guys like that the sergeant a short redfaced man with a mustache clipped very short went up to the group round the newspaper men come on fellers weve got a hell of a lot of this cement to get in before it rains he said in a kindly voice the sooner we get it in the sooner we get off listen to that bastard aint he juss too sweet for pie when theres company muttered hoggenback on his way from the barge with a bag of cement the kid brushed past andrews without looking at him do what i do skinny he said andrews did not turn round but his heart started thumping very fast a dull sort of terror took possession of him he tried desperately to summon his will power to keep from cringing but he kept remembering the way the room had swung round when the mp had hit him and heard again the cold voice of the lieutenant saying one of you men teach him how to salute time dragged out interminably at last coming back to the edge of the wharf andrews saw that there were no more bags in the barge he sat down on the plank too exhausted to think bluegrey dusk was closing down on everything the passy bridge stood out purple against a great crimson afterglow the kid sat down beside him and threw an arm trembling with excitement round his shoulders the guards lookin the other way they wont miss us till they get to the truck come on skinny he said in a low quiet voice holding on to the plank he let himself down into the speeding water andrews slipped after him hardly knowing what he was doing the icy water closing about his body made him suddenly feel awake and vigorous as he was swept by the big rudder of the barge he caught hold of the kid who was holding on to a rope they worked their way without speaking round to the outer side of the rudder the swift river tugging savagely at them made it hard to hold on now they cant see us said the kid between clenched teeth can you work your shoes an pants off andrews started struggling with one boot the kid helping to hold him up with his free hand mine are off he said i was all fixed he laughed though his teeth were chattering all right ive broken the laces said andrews can you swim under water andrews nodded we want to make for that bunch of barges the other side of the bridge the barge peoplell hide us how dye know they will the kid had disappeared andrews hesitated a moment then let go his hold and started swimming with the current for all his might at first he felt strong and exultant but very soon he began to feel the icy grip of the water bearing him down his arms and legs seemed to stiffen more than against the water he was struggling against paralysis within him so that he thought that every moment his limbs would go rigid he came to the surface and gasped for air he had a seconds glimpse of figures tiny like toy soldiers gesticulating wildly on the deck of the barge the report of a rifle snapped through the air he dove again without thinking as if his body were working independently of his mind the next time he came up his eyes were blurred from the cold there was a taste of blood in his mouth the shadow of the bridge was just above him he turned on his back for a second there were lights on the bridge a current swept him past one barge and then another certainty possessed him that he was going to be drowned a voice seemed to sob in his ears grotesquely and so john andrews was drowned in the seine drowned in the seine in the seine then he was kicking and fighting in a furious rage against the coils about him that wanted to drag him down and away the black side of a barge was slipping up stream beside him with lightning speed how fast those barges go he thought then suddenly he found that he had hold of a rope that his shoulders were banging against the bow of a small boat while in front of him against the dull purple sky towered the rudder of the barge a strong warm hand grasped his shoulder from behind and he was being drawn up and up over the bow of the boat that hurt his numbed body like blows out of the clutching coils of the water hide me im a deserter he said over and over again in french a brown and red face with a bristly white beard a bulbous mullioned sort of face hovered over him in the middle of a pinkish mist ii oh quil est propre oh quil a la peau blanche womens voices were shrilling behind the mist a coverlet that felt soft and fuzzy against his skin was being put about him he was very warm and torpid but somewhere in his thoughts a black crawling thing like a spider was trying to reach him trying to work its way through the pinkish veils of torpor after a long while he managed to roll over and looked about him mais reste tranquille came the womans shrill voice again and the other one did you see the other one he asked in a choked whisper yes its all right im drying it by the stove came another womans voice deep and growling almost like a mans mamans drying your money by the stove its all safe how rich they are these americans and to think that i nearly threw it overboard with the trousers said the other woman again john andrews began to look about him he was in a dark low cabin behind him in the direction of the voices a yellow light flickered great dishevelled shadows of heads moved about on the ceiling through the close smell of the cabin came a warmth of food cooking he could hear the soothing hiss of frying grease but didnt you see the kid he asked in english dazedly trying to pull himself together to think coherently then he went on in french in a more natural voice there was another one with me we saw no one rosaline ask the old man said the older woman no he didnt see anyone came the girls shrill voice she walked over to the bed and pulled the coverlet round andrews with an awkward gesture looking up at her he had a glimpse of the bulge of her breasts and her large teeth that glinted in the lamplight and very vague in the shadow a mop of snaky disordered hair quil parle bien francais she said beaming at him heavy steps shuffled across the cabin as the older woman came up to the bed and peered in his face il va mieux she said with a knowing air she was a broad woman with a broad flat face and a swollen body swathed in shawls her eyebrows were very bushy and she had thick grey whiskers that came down to a point on either side of her mouth as well as a few bristling hairs on her chin her voice was deep and growling and seemed to come from far down inside her huge body steps creaked somewhere and the old man looked at him through spectacles placed on the end of his nose andrews recognized the irregular face full of red knobs and protrusions thanks very much he said all three looked at him silently for some time then the old man pulled a newspaper out of his pocket unfolded it carefully and fluttered it above andrewss eyes in the scant light andrews made out the name libertaire thats why said the old man looking at andrews fixedly through his spectacles im a sort of a socialist said andrews socialists are goodfornothings snarled the old man every red protrusion on his face seeming to get redder but i have great sympathy for anarchist comrades went on andrews feeling a certain liveliness of amusement go through him and fade again lucky you caught hold of my rope instead of getting on to the next barge hed have given you up for sure sont des royalistes ces salaudsla we must give him something to eat hurry maman dont worry hell pay wont you my little american andrews nodded his head all you want he said no if he says hes a comrade he shant pay not a sou growled the old man well see about that cried the old woman drawing her breath in with an angry whistling sound its only that livings so dear nowadays came the girls voice oh ill pay anything ive got said andrews peevishly closing his eyes again he lay a long while on his back without moving a hand shoved in between his back and the pillow roused him he sat up rosaline was holding a bowl of broth in front of him that steamed in his face mange ca she said he looked into her eyes smiling her rusty hair was neatly combed a bright green parrot with a scarlet splash in its wings balanced itself unsteadily on her shoulder looking at andrews out of angry eyes hard as gems il est jaloux coco said rosaline with a shrill little giggle andrews took the bowl in his two hands and drank some of the scalding broth its too hot he said leaning back against the girls arm the parrot squawked out a sentence that andrews did not understand andrews heard the old mans voice answer from somewhere behind him nom de dieu the parrot squawked again rosaline laughed its the old man who taught him that she said poor coco he doesnt know what hes saying what does he say asked andrews les bourgeois a la lanterne nom de dieu its from a song said rosaline oh quil est malin ce coco rosaline was standing with her arms folded beside the bunk the parrot stretched out his neck and rubbed it against her cheek closing and unclosing his gemlike eyes the girl formed her lips into a kiss and murmured in a drowsy voice tu maimes coco nestce pas coco bon coco could i have something more im awfully hungry said andrews oh i was forgetting cried rosaline running off with the empty bowl in a moment she came back without the parrot with the bowl in her hand full of a brown stew of potatoes and meat andrews ate it mechanically and handed back the bowl thank you he said i am going to sleep he settled himself into the bunk rosaline drew the covers up about him and tucked them in round his shoulders her hand seemed to linger a moment as it brushed past his cheek but andrews had already sunk into a torpor again feeling nothing but the warmth of the food within him and a great stiffness in his legs and arms when he woke up the light was grey instead of yellow and a swishing sound puzzled him he lay listening to it for a long time wondering what it was at last the thought came with a sudden warm spurt of joy that the barge must be moving he lay very quietly on his back looking up at the faint silvery light on the ceiling of the bunk thinking of nothing with only a vague dread in the back of his head that someone would come to speak to him to question him after a long time he began to think of genevieve rod he was having a long conversation with her about his music and in his imagination she kept telling him that he must finish the queen of sheba and that she would show it to monsieur gibier who was a great friend of a certain concert director who might get it played how long ago it must be since they had talked about that a picture floated through his mind of himself and genevieve standing shoulder to shoulder looking at the cathedral at chartres which stood up nonchalantly above the tumultuous roofs of the town with its sober tower and its gaudy towers and the great rose windows between inexorably his memory carried him forward moment by moment over that day until he writhed with shame and revolt good god would he have to go on all his life remembering that teach him how to salute the officer had said and handsome had stepped up to him and hit him would he have to go on all his life remembering that we tied up the uniform with some stones and threw it overboard said rosaline jabbing him in the shoulder to draw his attention that was a good idea are you going to get up its nearly time to eat how you have slept but i havent anything to put on said andrews laughing and waved a bare arm above the bedclothes wait ill find something of the old mans say do all americans have skin so white as that look she put her brown hand with its grimed and broken nails on andrewss arm that was white with a few silky yellow hairs its because im blond said andrews there are plenty of blond frenchmen arent there rosaline ran off giggling and came back in a moment with a pair of corduroy trousers and a torn flannel shirt that smelt of pipe tobacco thatll do for now she said its warm today for april tonight well buy you some clothes and shoes where are you going by god i dont know were going to havre for cargo she put both hands to her head and began rearranging her straggling rustycolored hair oh my hair she said its the water you know you cant keep respectablelooking on these filthy barges say american why dont you stay with us a while you can help the old man run the boat he found suddenly that her eyes were looking into his with trembling eagerness i dont know what to do he said carelessly i wonder if its safe to go on deck she turned away from him petulantly and led the way up the ladder oh vla le camarade cried the old man who was leaning with all his might against the long tiller of the barge come and help me the barge was the last of a string of four that were describing a wide curve in the midst of a reach of silvery river full of glittering patches of pale peagreen lavender hemmed in on either side by frail blue roots of poplars the sky was a mottled luminous grey with occasional patches the color of robins eggs andrews breathed in the dank smell of the river and leaned against the tiller when he was told to answering the old mans curt questions he stayed with the tiller when the rest of them went down to the cabin to eat the pale colors and the swishing sound of the water and the bluegreen banks slipping by and unfolding on either hand were as soothing as his deep sleep had been yet they seemed only a veil covering other realities where men stood interminably in line and marched with legs made all the same length on the drill field and wore the same clothes and cringed before the same hierarchy of polished belts and polished puttees and stiffvisored caps that had its homes in vast offices crammed with index cards and card catalogues a world full of the tramp of marching where cold voices kept saying teach him how to salute like a bird in a net andrewss mind struggled to free itself from the obsession then he thought of his table in his room in paris with its piled sheets of ruled paper and he felt he wanted nothing in the world except to work it would not matter what happened to him if he could only have time to weave into designs the tangled skein of music that seethed through him as the blood seethed through his veins there he stood leaning against the long tiller watching the bluegreen poplars glide by here and there reflected in the etched silver mirror of the river feeling the moist river wind flutter his ragged shirt thinking of nothing after a while the old man came up out of the cabin his face purplish puffing clouds of smoke out of his pipe all right young fellow go down and eat he said andrews lay flat on his belly on the deck with his chin resting on the back of his two hands the barge was tied up along the river bank among many other barges beside him a small fuzzy dog barked furiously at a yellow mongrel on the shore it was nearly dark and through the pearly mist of the river came red oblongs of light from the taverns along the bank a slip of a new moon shrouded in haze was setting behind the poplar trees amid the round of despairing thoughts the memory of the kid intruded itself he had sold a ford for five hundred francs and gone on a party with a man whod stolen an ammunition train and he wanted to write for the italian movies no war could down people like that andrews smiled looking into the black water funny the kid was dead probably and he john andrews was alive and free and he lay there moping still whimpering over old wrongs for gods sake be a man he said to himself he got to his feet at the cabin door rosaline was playing with the parrot give me a kiss coco she was saying in a drowsy voice just a little kiss just a little kiss for rosaline poor little rosaline the parrot which andrews could hardly see in the dusk leaned towards her fluttering his feathers making little clucking noises rosaline caught sight of andrews oh i thought youd gone to have a drink with the old man she cried no i stayed here dyou like it this life rosaline put the parrot back on his perch where he swayed from side to side squawking in protest les bourgeois a la lanterne nom de dieu they both laughed oh it must be a wonderful life this barge seems like heaven after the army but they pay you well you americans seven francs a day thats luxury that and be ordered around all day long but you have no expenses its clear gain you men are funny the old mans like that too its nice here all by ourselves isnt it jean andrews did not answer he was wondering what genevieve rod would say when she found out he was a deserter i hate it its dirty and cold and miserable in winter went on rosaline id like to see them at the bottom of the river all these barges and paris women did you have a good time with them i only knew one i go very little with women all the same loves nice isnt it they were sitting on the rail at the bow of the barge rosaline had sidled up so that her leg touched andrewss leg along its whole length the memory of genevieve rod became more and more vivid in his mind he kept thinking of things she had said of the intonations of her voice of the blundering way she poured tea and of her palebrown eyes wide open on the world like the eyes of a woman in an encaustic painting from a tomb in the fayoum mothers talking to the old woman at the creamery theyre great friends she wont be home for two hours yet said rosaline shes bringing my clothes isnt she but youre all right as you are but theyre your fathers what does that matter i must go back to paris soon there is somebody i must see in paris a woman andrews nodded but its not so bad this life on the barge im just lonesome and sick of the old people thats why i talk nastily about it we could have good times together if you stayed with us a little she leaned her head on his shoulder and put a hand awkwardly on his bare forearm how cold these americans are she muttered giggling drowsily andrews felt her hair tickle his cheek no its not a bad life on the barge honestly the only thing is theres nothing but old people on the river it isnt life to be always with old people i want to have a good time she pressed her cheek against his he could feel her breath heavy in his face after all its lovely in summer to drowse on the deck thats all warm with the sun and see the trees and the fields and the little houses slipping by on either side if there werent so many old people all the boys go away to the cities i hate old people theyre so dirty and slow we mustnt waste our youth must we andrews got to his feet whats the matter she cried sharply rosaline andrews said in a low soft voice i can only think of going to paris oh the paris woman said rosaline scornfully but what does that matter she isnt here now i dont know perhaps i shall never see her again anyway said andrews youre a fool you must amuse yourself when you can in this life and you a deserter why they may catch you and shoot you any time oh i know youre right youre right but im not made like that thats all she must be very good to you your little paris girl ive never touched her rosaline threw her head back and laughed raspingly but you arent sick are you she cried probably i remember too vividly thats all anyway im a fool rosaline because youre a nice girl there were steps on the plank that led to the shore a shawl over her head and a big bundle under her arm the old woman came up to them panting wheezily she looked from one to the other trying to make out their faces in the dark its a dangerlike thatyouth she muttered between hard short breaths did you find the clothes asked andrews in a casual voice yes that leaves you fortyfive francs out of your money when ive taken out for your food and all that does that suit you thank you very much for your trouble you paid for it dont worry about that said the old woman she gave him the bundle here are your clothes and the fortyfive francs if you want ill tell you exactly what each thing cost ill put them on first he said with a laugh he climbed down the ladder into the cabin putting on new unfamiliarshaped clothes made him suddenly feel strong and joyous the old woman had bought him corduroy trousers cheap cloth shoes a blue cotton shirt woollen socks and a secondhand black serge jacket when he came on deck she held up a lantern to look at him doesnt he look fine altogether french she said rosaline turned away without answering a little later she picked up the perch and carried the parrot that swayed sleepily on the crosspiece down the ladder les bourgeois a la lanterne nom de dieu came the old mans voice singing on the shore hes drunk as a pig muttered the old woman if only he doesnt fall off the gang plank a swaying shadow appeared at the end of the plank standing out against the haze of light from the houses behind the poplar trees andrews put out a hand to catch him as he reached the side of the barge the old man sprawled against the cabin dont bawl me out dearie he said dangling an arm round andrewss neck and a hand beckoning vaguely towards his wife ive found a comrade for the little american whats that said andrews sharply his mouth suddenly went dry with terror he felt his nails pressing into the palms of his coldhands ive found another american for you said the old man in an important voice here he comes another shadow appeared at the end of the gangplank les bourgeois a la lanterne nom de dieu shouted the old man andrews backed away cautiously towards the other side of the barge all the little muscles of his thighs were trembling a hard voice was saying in his head drown yourself drown yourself then they wont get you the man was standing on the end of the plank andrews could see the contour of the uniform against the haze of light behind the poplar trees god if i only had a pistol he thought say buddy where are you came an american voice the man advanced towards him across the deck andrews stood with every muscle taut gee youve taken off your uniform say im not an mp im awol too shake he held out his hand andrews took the hand doubtfully without moving from the edge of the barge say buddy its a damn fool thing to take off your uniform aint you got any if they pick you up like that its life kid i cant help it its done now gawd you still think im an mp dont yer i swear i aint maybe you are gawd its hell this life a feller cant put his trust in nobody what division are you from hell i came to warn you this bastard frawgs got soused an has been blabbin in the gin mill there how he was an

followed the other man across the gangplank as they walked away along the road they heard the old mans voice roaring les bourgeois a la lanterne nom de dieu my names eddy chambers said the american mines john andrews how longve you been out two days eddy let the air out through his teeth in a whistle i got away from a labor battalion in paris theyd picked me up in chartres without a pass gee ive

soon marry a french girl an git to be a regular frawg myself after the raw deal theyve given me in the army i dont want to have nothin more to do with their damn country democracy he cleared his throat and spat angrily on the road before him they walked on silently andrews was looking at the sky picking out constellations he knew among the glittering masses of stars why dont you try spain or italy he said after a while dont know the lingo no im going to scotland but how can you get there crossing on the car ferries to england from havre ive talked to guys has done it but whatll you do when you do get there how should i know live around best i can what can a feller do when he dont dare show his face in the street anyway it makes you feel as if you had some guts in you to be out on

always understand anything you do i spose youre goin to git married i dont see why that would spoil everything eddy whistled softly they walked along briskly without speaking for a long time their steps ringing on the hard road while the dome of the sky shimmered above their heads and from the ditches came the singsong shrilling of toads for the first time in months andrews felt himself bubbling with a spirit of joyous adventure the rhythm of the three green horsemen that was to have been the prelude to the queen of sheba began rollicking through his head but eddy this is wonderful its us against the universe he said in a boisterous voice you wait said eddy when andrews walked by the mp at the garest lazare his hands were cold with fear the mp did not look at him he stopped on the crowded pavement a little way from the station and stared into a mirror in a shop window unshaven with a check cap on the side of his head and his corduroy trousers he looked like a young workman who had been out of work for a month gee clothes do make a difference he said to himself he smiled when he thought how shocked walters would be when he turned up in that rig and started walking with leisurely stride across paris where everything bustled and jingled with early morning where from every cafe came a hot smell of coffee and fresh bread steamed in the windows of the bakeries he still had three francs in his pocket on a side street the fumes of coffee roasting attracted him into a small bar several men were arguing boisterously at the end of the bar one of them turned a ruddy towwhiskered face to andrews and said et toi tu vas chomer le premier mai im on strike already answered andrews laughing the man noticed his accent looked at him sharply a second and turned back to the conversation lowering his voice as he did so andrews drank down his coffee and left the bar his heart pounding he could not help glancing back over his shoulder now and then to see if he was being followed at a corner he stopped with his fists clenched and leaned a second against a house wall wheres your nerve wheres your nerve he was saying to himself he strode off suddenly full of bitter determination not to turn round again he tried to occupy his mind with plans lets see what should he do first hed go to his room and look up old henslowe and walters then he would go to see genevieve then hed work work forget everything in his work until the army should go back to america and there should be no more uniforms on the streets and as for the future what did he care about the future when he turned the corner into the familiar street where his room was a thought came to him suppose he should find mps waiting for him there he brushed it aside angrily and strode fast up the sidewalk catching up to a soldier who was slouching along in the same direction with his hands in his pockets and eyes on the ground andrews stopped suddenly as he was about to pass the soldier and turned the man looked up it was chrisfield andrews held out his hand chrisfield seized it eagerly and shook it for a long time jesus christ ah thought you was a frenchman andy ah guess you got yer discharge then god ahm glad im glad i look like a frenchman anyway been on leave long chris two buttons were off the front of chrisfields uniform there were streaks of dirt on his face and his puttees were clothed

stand talking out here in the street like this it isnt safe but mebbe youll be able to tell me what to do you think andy mebbe tomorrow youll have thought up somethin we can doso long chrisfield walked away hurriedly andrews looked after him a moment and then went in through the court to the house where his room was at the foot of the stairs an old womans voice startled him mais monsieur andre que vous avez lair etrange how funny you look dressed like that the concierge was smiling at him from her cubbyhole beside the stairs she sat knitting with a black shawl round her head a tiny old woman with a hooked birdlike nose and eyes sunk in depressions full of little wrinkles like a monkeys eyes yes at the town where i was demobilized i couldnt get anything else stammered andrews oh youre demobilized are you thats why youve been away so long monsieur valters said he didnt know where you were its better that way isnt it yes said andrews starting up the stairs monsieur valters is in now went on the old woman talking after him and youve got in just in time for the first of may oh yes the strike said andrews stopping halfway up the flight itll be dreadful said the old woman i hope you wont go out young folks are so likely to get into troubleoh but all your friends have been worried about your being away so long have they said andrews he continued up the stairs au revoir monsieur au revoir madame iii no nothing can make me go back now its no use talking about it but youre crazy man youre crazy one man alone cant buck the system like that can he henslowe walters was talking earnestly leaning across the table beside the lamp henslowe who sat very stiff on the edge of a chair nodded with compressed lips andrews lay at full length on the bed out of the circle of light honestly andy said henslowe with tears in his voice i think youd better do what walters says its no use being heroic about it im not being heroic henny cried andrews sitting up on the bed he drew his feet under him tailor fashion and went on talking very quietly look its a purely personal matter ive got to a point where i dont give a damn what happens to me i dont care if im shot or if i live to be eightyim sick of being ordered round one more order shouted at my head is not worth living to be eightyto me thats all for gods sake lets talk about something else but how many orders have you had shouted at your head since you got in this school detachment not one you can put through your discharge application probably walters got to his feet letting the chair crash to the floor behind him he stopped to pick it up look here heres my proposition he went on i dont think you are marked awol in the school office things are so damn badly run there you can turn up and say youve been sick and draw your back pay and nobodyll say a thing or else ill put it right up to the guy whos top sergeant hes a good friend of mine we can fix it up on the records some way but for gods sake dont ruin your whole life on account of a little stubbornness and some damn fool anarchistic ideas or other a feller like you ought to have had more sense than to pick up hes right andy said henslowe in a low voice please dont talk any more about it youve told me all that before said andrews sharply he threw himself back on the bed and rolled over towards the wall they were silent a long time a sound of voices and footsteps drifted up from the courtyard but look here andy said henslowe nervously stroking his moustache you care much more about your work than any abstract idea of asserting your right of individual liberty even if you dont get caught i think the chances of getting caught are mighty slim if you use your head but even if you dont you havent enough money to live for long over here you havent dont you think ive thought of all that im not crazy you know ive figured up the balance perfectly sanely the only thing is you fellows cant understand have you ever been in a labor battalion have you ever had a man youd been chatting with five minutes before deliberately knock you down good god you dont know what you are talking about you two ive got to be free now i dont care at what cost being frees the only thing that matters andrews lay on his back talking towards the ceiling henslowe was on his feet striding nervously about the room as if anyone was ever free he muttered all right quibble quibble you can argue anything away if you want to of course cowardice is the best policy necessary for survival the man whos got most will to live is the most cowardlygo on andrewss voice was shrill and excited breaking occasionally like a halfgrown boys voice andy what on earths got hold of you god i hate to go away this way added henslowe after a pause ill pull through all right henny ill probably come to see you in syria disguised as an arab sheik andrews laughed excitedly if i thought id do any good id stay but theres nothing i can do everybodys got to settle their own affairs in their own damn fool way so long walters walters and henslowe shook hands absently henslowe came over to the bed and held out his hand to andrews look old man you will be as careful as you can wont you and write me care american red cross jerusalem ill be damned anxious honestly dont you worry well go travelling together yet said andrews sitting up and taking henslowes hand they heard henslowes steps fade down the stairs and then ring for a moment on the pavings of the courtyard walters moved his chair over beside andrewss bed now look lets have a mantoman talk andrews even if you want to ruin your life you havent a right to theres your family and havent you any patriotism remember there is such a thing as duty in the world andrews sat up and said in a low furious voice pausing between each word i cant explain it but i shall never put a uniform on again so for christs sake shut up all right do what you goddam please im through with you walters suddenly flashed into a rage he began undressing silently andrews lay a long while flat on his back in the bed staring at the ceiling then he too undressed put the light out and got into bed the rue des petitsjardins was a short street in a district of warehouses a grey windowless wall shut out the light along all of one side opposite was a cluster of three old houses leaning together as if the outer ones were trying to support the beetling mansard roof of the center house behind them rose a huge building with rows and rows of black windows when andrews stopped to look about him he found the street completely deserted the ominous stillness that had brooded over the city during all the walk from his room near the pantheon seemed here to culminate in sheer desolation in the silence he could hear the light padding noise made by the feet of a dog that trotted across the end of the street the house with the mansard roof was number eight the front of the lower storey had once been painted in chocolatecolor across the top of which was still decipherable the sign charbon bois lhomond on the grimed window beside the door was painted in white debit de boissons andrews pushed on the door which opened easily somewhere in the interior a bell jangled startlingly loud after the silence of the street on the wall opposite the door was a speckled mirror with a crack in it the shape of a star and under it a bench with three marbletop tables the zinc bar filled up the third wall in the fourth was a glass door pasted up with newspapers andrews walked over to the bar the jangling of the bell faded to silence he waited a curious uneasiness gradually taking possession of him anyways he thought he was wasting his time he ought to be doing something to arrange his future he walked over to the street door the bell jangled again when he opened it at the same moment a man came out through the door the newspapers were pasted over he was a stout man in a dirty white shirt stained to a brownish color round the armpits and caught in very tightly at the waist by the broad elastic belt that held up his yellow corduroy trousers his face was flabby of a greenish color black eyes looked at andrews fixedly through barely open lids so that they seemed long slits above the cheekbones thats the chink thought andrews well said the man taking his place behind the bar with his legs far apart a beer please said andrews there isnt any a glass of wine then the man nodded his head and keeping his eyes fastened on andrews all the while strode out of the door again a moment later chrisfield came out with rumpled hair yawning rubbing an eye with the knuckles of one fist lawsie ah juss woke up andy come along in back andrews followed him through a small room with tables and benches down a corridor where the reek of ammonia bit into his eyes and up a staircase littered with dirt and garbage chrisfield opened a door directly on the stairs and they stumbled into a large room with a window that gave on the court chrisfield closed the door carefully and turned to andrews with a smile ah was right smart askeered ye wouldnt find it andy so this is where you live um hum a bunch of us lives here a wide bed without coverings where a man in olivedrab slept rolled in a blanket was the only furniture of the room three of us sleeps in that bed said chrisfield whos that cried the man in the bed sitting up suddenly all right al hes a buddy o mine said chrisfield hes taken off his uniform jesus you got guts said the man in the bed andrews looked at him sharply a piece of towelling splotched here and there with dried blood was wrapped round his head and a hand swathed in bandages was drawn up to his body the mans mouth took on a twisted expression of pain as he let his head gradually down to the bed again gosh what did you do to yourself cried andrews i tried to hop a freight at marseilles needs practice to do that sort o thing said chrisfield who sat on the bed pulling his shoes off ahm goin to git back to bed andy ahm juss dead tired ah chucked cabbages all night at the market they give ye a job there without askin no questions have a cigarette andrews sat down on the foot of the bed and threw a cigarette towards chrisfield have one he asked al no i couldnt smoke im almost crazy with this hand one of the wheels went over it i cut what was left of the little finger off with a razor andrews could see the sweat rolling down his cheek as he spoke christ that poor beggars been havin a time andy we was askeert to get a doctor and we all didnt know what to do i got some pure alcohol an washed it in that its not infected i guess itll be all right where are you from al asked andrews frisco oh im goin to try to sleep i havent slept a wink for four nights why dont you get

carefully after him a sudden jangling of the bell was followed by a sound of loud voices and stamping feet andrews and chrisfield tiptoed into the dark corridor where they stood a long time waiting breathing the foul air that stung their nostrils with the stench of plasterdamp and rotting wine at last the chink came back with three bottles of wine well youre right he said to andrews they are putting up barricades on the avenue magenta on the stairs they met a girl sweeping she had untidy hair that straggled out from under a blue handkerchief tied under her chin and a prettycolored fleshy face chrisfield caught her up to him and kissed her as he passed we all calls her the dawgfaced girl he said to andrews in explanation she does our work ah like to had a fight with slippery over her yisterday didnt ah slippery when he followed chrisfield into the room andrews saw a man sitting on the window ledge smoking he was dressed as a second lieutenant his puttees were brilliantly polished

if i can buy some stuff said andrews its safer for me to go out than for you all right heres twenty francs said slippery handing andrews a bill with an offhand gesture chrisfield followed andrews down the stairs when they reached the passage at the foot of the stairs he put his hand on andrewss shoulder and whispered say andy dyou think theres anything in that revolution business ah hadnt never thought they could buck the system thataway they did in russia then wed be free civilians like we all was before the draft but that aint possible andy that aint possible andy well see said andrews as he opened the door to the bar he went up excitedly to the chink who sat behind the row of bottles along the bar well whats happening where by the gare de lest where they were putting up barricades barricades shouted a young man in a red sash who was drinking at a table why they tore down some of the iron guards round the trees if you call that barricades but theyre cowards whenever the cops charge they run theyre dirty cowards dyou think anythings going to happen what can happen when youve got nothing but a bunch of dirty cowards what dyou think about it said andrews turning to the chink the chink shook his head without answering andrews went out when he cams back he found al and chrisfield alone in their room chrisfield was walking up and down biting his finger nails on the wall opposite the window was a square of sunshine reflected from the opposite wall of the court for gods sake beat it chris im all right al was saying in a weak whining voice his face twisted up by pain whats the matter cried andrews putting down a large bundle slipperys seen a m p nosin around in front of the gin mill good god theyve beat it the trouble is als too sick honest to gawd ahll stay with you al no if you know somewhere to go beat it chris ill stay here with al and talk french to the m ps if they come well fool em somehow andrews felt suddenly amused and joyous honest to gawd andy ahd stay if it warnt that that sergeant knows said chrisfield in a jerky voice beat it chris there may be no time to waste so long andy chrisfield slipped out of the door its funny al said andrews sitting on the edge of the bed and unwrapping the package of food im not a damn bit scared any more i think im free of the army al hows your hand i dunno oh how i wish i was in my old bunk at coblenz i warnt made for buckin against the world this way if we had old dan with us funny that you know dan hed have a million ideas for gettin out of this fix but im glad hes not here hed bawl me out so for not havin made good hes a powerful ambitious kid is dan but its not the sort of thing a man can make good in al said andrews slowly they were silent there was no sound in the courtyard only very far away the clatter of a patrol of cavalry over cobblestones the sky had become overcast and the room was very dark the mouldy plaster peeling off the walls had streaks of green in it the light from the courtyard had a greenish tinge that made their faces look pale and dead like the faces of men that have long been shut up between damp prison walls and fuselli had a girl named mabe said andrews oh she married a guy in the naval reserve they had a grand wedding said al iv at last ive got to you john andrews had caught sight of genevieve on a bench at the end of the garden under an arbor of vines her hair flamed bright in a splotch of sun as she got to her feet she held out both hands to him how goodlooking you are like that she cried he was conscious only of her hands in his hands and of her palebrown eyes and of the bright sunsplotches and the green shadows fluttering all about them so you are out of prison she said and demobilized how wonderful why didnt you write i have been very uneasy about you how did you find me here your mother said you were here and how do you like it my poissac she made a wide gesture with her hand they stood silent a moment side by side looking about them in front of the arbor was a parterre of rounded boxbushes edging beds where disorderly roses hung in clusters of pink and purple and apricotcolor and beyond it a brilliant emerald lawn full of daisies sloped down to an old grey house with at one end a squat round tower that had an extinguishershaped roof beyond the house were tall lushgreen poplars through which glittered patches of silvergrey river and of yellow sand banks from somewhere came a drowsy scent of mown grass how brown you are she said again i thought i had lost you you might kiss me jean the muscles of his arms tightened about her shoulders her hair flamed in his eyes the wind that rustled through broad grapeleaves made a flutter of dancing light and shadow about them how hot you are with the sun she said i love the smell of the sweat of your body you must have run very hard coming here do you remember one night in the spring we walked home from pelleas and melisande how i should have liked to have kissed you then like this andrewss voice was strange hoarse as if he spoke with difficulty there is the chateau tres froid et tres profond she said with a little laugh and your hair je les tiens dans les doits je les tiens dans la bouche toute ta chevelure toute ta chevelure melisande est tombee de la tour dyou remember how wonderful you are they sat side by side on the stone bench without touching each other its silly burst out andrews excitedly we should have faith in our own selves we cant live a little rag of romance without dragging in literature we are drugged with literature so that we can never live at all of ourselves jean how did you come down here have you been demobilized long i walked almost all the way from paris you see i am very dirty how wonderful but ill be quiet you must tell me everything from the moment you left me in chartres ill tell you about chartres later said andrews gruffly it has been superb one of the biggest weeks in my life walking all day under the sun with the road like a white ribbon in the sun over the hills and along river banks where there were yellow irises blooming and through woods full of blackbirds and with the dust in a little white cloud round my feet and all the time walking towards you walking towards you and la reine de saba how is it coming i dont know its a long time since i thought of it you have been here long hardly a week but what are you going to do i have a room overlooking the river in a house owned by a very fat woman with a very red face and a tuft of hair on her chin madame boncour of course you must know everybody its so small and youre going to stay here a long time almost forever and work and talk to you may i use your piano now and then how wonderful genevieve rod jumped to her feet then she stood looking at him leaning against one of the twisted stems of the vines so that the broad leaves fluttered about her face a white cloud bright as silver covered the sun so that the hairy young leaves and the windblown grass of the lawn took on a silvery sheen two white butterflies fluttered for a second about the arbor you must always dress like that she said after a while andrews laughed a little cleaner i hope he said but there cant be much change i have no other clothes and ridiculously little money who cares for money cried genevieve andrews fancied he detected a slight affectation in her tone but he drove the idea from his mind immediately i wonder if there is a farm round here where i could get work but you couldnt do the work of a farm labourer cried genevieve laughing you just watch me itll spoil your hands for the piano i dont care about that but all thats later much later before anything else i must finish a thing i am working on there is a theme that came to me when i was first in the army when i was washing windows at the training camp how funny you are jean oh its lovely to have you about again but youre awfully solemn today perhaps its because i made you kiss me but genevieve its not in one day that you can unbend a slaves back but with you in this wonderful place oh ive never seen such sappy richness of vegetation and think of it a weeks walking first across those grey rolling uplands and then at blois down into the haze of richness of the loire dyou know vendome i came by a funny little town from vendome to blois you see my feet and what wonderful cold baths ive had on the sand banks of the loire no after a while the rhythm of legs all being made the same length on drill fields the hopeless caged dullness will be buried deep in me by the gorgeousness of this world of yours he got to his feet and crushed a leaf softly between his fingers you see the little grapes are already forming look up there she said as she brushed the leaves aside just above his head these grapes here are the earliest but i must show you my domain and my cousins and the hen yard and everything she took his hand and pulled him out of the arbor they ran like children hand in hand round the boxbordered paths what i mean is this he stammered following her across the lawn if i could once manage to express all that misery in music i could shove it far down into my memory i should be free to live my own existence in the midst of this carnival of summer at the house she turned to him you see the very battered ladies over the door she said they are said to be by a pupil of jean goujon they fit wonderfully in the landscape dont they did i ever tell you about the sculptures in the hospital where i was when i was wounded no but i want you to look at the house now see thats the tower all thats left of the old building i live there and right under the roof theres a haunted room i used to be terribly afraid of im still afraid of it you see this henri quatre part of the house was just a fourth of the house as planned this lawn would have been the court we dug up foundations where the roses are there are all sorts of traditions as to why the house was never finished you must tell me them i shall later but now you must come and meet my aunt and my cousins please not just now genevieve i dont feel like talking to anyone except you i have so much to talk to you about but its nearly lunch time jean we can have all that after lunch no i cant talk to anyone else now i must go and clean myself up a little anyway just as you like but you must come this afternoon and play to us two or three people are coming to tea it would be very sweet of you if youd play to us jean but cant you understand i cant see you with other people now just as you like said genevieve flushing her hand on the iron latch of the door cant i come to see you tomorrow morning then i shall feel more like meeting people after talking to you a long while you see i he paused with his eyes on the ground then he burst out in a low passionate voice oh if i could only get it out of my mindthose tramping feet those voices shouting orders his hand trembled when he put it in genevieves hand she looked in his eyes calmly with her wide brown eyes how strange you are today jean anyway come back early tomorrow she went in the door he walked round the house through the carriage gate and went off with long strides down the road along the river that led under linden trees to the village thoughts swarmed teasingly through his head like wasps about a rotting fruit so at last he had seen genevieve and had held her in his arms and kissed her and that was all his plans for the future had never gone beyond that point he hardly knew what he had expected but in all the sunny days of walking in all the furtive days in paris he had thought of nothing else he would see genevieve and tell her all about himself he would unroll his life like a scroll before her eyes together they would piece together the future a sudden terror took possession of him she had failed him floods of denial seethed through his mind it was that he had expected so much he had expected her to understand him without explanation instinctively he had told her nothing he had not even told her he was a deserter what was it that had kept him from telling her puzzle as he would he could not formulate it only far within him the certainty lay like an icy weight she had failed him he was alone what a fool he had been to build his whole life on a chance of sympathy no it was rather this morbid playing at phrases that was at fault he was like a touchy old maid thinking imaginary results take life at its face value he kept telling himself they loved each other anyway somehow it did not matter how and he was free to work wasnt that enough but how could he wait until tomorrow to see her to tell her everything to break down all the silly little barriers between them so that they might look directly into each others lives the road turned inland from the river between garden walls at the entrance to the village through halfopen doors andrews got glimpses of neatlycultivated kitchengardens and orchards where silverleaved boughs swayed against the sky then the road swerved again into the village crowded into a narrow paved street by the white and creamcolored houses with green or grey shutters and pale redtiled roofs at the end stained golden with lichen the mauvegrey tower of the church held up its bells against the sky in a belfry of broad pointed arches in front of the church andrews turned down a little lane towards the river again to come out in a moment on a quay shaded by skinny acacia trees on the corner house a ramshackle house with roofs and gables projecting in all directions was a sign rendezvous de la marine the room he stepped into was so low andrews had to stoop under the heavy brown beams as he crossed it stairs went up from a door behind a worn billiard table in the corner mme boncour stood between andrews and the stairs she was a flabby elderly woman with round eyes and a round very red face and a curious smirk about the lips monsieur payera un petit peu dadvance nestce pas monsieur all right said andrews reaching for his pocketbook shall i pay you a week in advance the woman smiled broadly si monsieur desire its that life is so dear nowadays poor people like us can barely get along i know that only too well said andrews monsieur est etranger began the woman in a wheedling tone when she had received the money yes i was only demobilized a short time ago aha monsieur est demobilise monsieur remplira la petite feuille pour la police nestce pas the woman brought from behind her back a hand that held a narrow printed slip all right ill fill it out now said andrews his heart thumping without thinking what he was doing he put the paper on the edge of the billiard table and wrote john brown aged chicago ill etatsunis musician holder of passport no merci monsieur a bientot monsieur au revoir monsieur the womans singing voice followed him up the rickety stairs to his room it was only when he had closed the door that he remembered that he had put down for a passport number his army number and why did i write john brown as a name he asked himself john browns body lies amouldering in the grave but his soul goes marching on glory glory hallelujah but his soul goes marching on he heard the song so vividly that he thought for an instant someone must be standing beside him singing it he went to the window and ran his hand through his hair outside the loire rambled in great loops towards the blue distance silvery reach upon silvery reach with here and there the broad gleam of a sand bank opposite were poplars and fields patched in various greens rising to hills tufted with dense shadowy groves on the bare summit of the highest hill a windmill waved lazy arms against the marbled sky gradually john andrews felt the silvery quiet settle about him he pulled a sausage and a piece of bread out of the pocket of his coat took a long swig of water from the pitcher on his washstand and settled himself at the table before the window in front of a pile of ruled sheets of music paper he nibbled the bread and the sausage meditatively for a long while then wrote arbeit und rhythmus in a large careful hand at the top of the paper after that he looked out of the window without moving watching the plumed clouds sail like huge slow ships against the slateblue sky suddenly he scratched out what he had written and scrawled above it the body and soul of john brown he got to his feet and walked about the room with clenched hands how curious that i should have written that name how curious that i should have written that name he said aloud he sat down at the table again and forgot everything in the music that possessed him the next morning he walked out early along the river trying to occupy himself until it should be time to go to see genevieve the memory of his first days in the army spent washing windows at the training camp was very vivid in his mind he saw himself again standing naked in the middle of a wide bare room while the recruiting sergeant measured and prodded him and now he was a deserter was there any sense to it all had his life led in any particular direction since he had been caught haphazard in the treadmill or was it all chance a toad hopping across a road in front of a steam roller he stood still and looked about him beyond a clover field was the river with its sand banks and its broad silver reaches a boy was wading far out in the river catching minnows with a net andrews watched his quick movements as he jerked the net through the water and that boy too would be a soldier the lithe body would be thrown into a mould to be made the same as other bodies the quick movements would be standardized into the manual at arms the inquisitive petulant mind would be battered into servility the stockade was built not one of the sheep would escape and those that were not sheep they were deserters every rifle muzzle held death for them they would not live long and yet other nightmares had been thrown off the shoulders of men every man who stood up courageously to die loosened the grip of the nightmare andrews walked slowly along the road kicking his feet into the dust like a schoolboy at a turning he threw himself down on the grass under some locust trees the heavy fragrance of their flowers and the grumbling of the bees that hung drunkenly on the white racemes made him feel very drowsy a cart passed pulled by heavy white horses an old man with his back curved like the top of a sunflower stalk hobbled after using the whip as a walking stick andrews saw the old mans eyes turned on him suspiciously a faint pang of fright went through him did the old man know he was a deserter the cart and the old man had already disappeared round the bend in the road andrews lay a long while listening to the jingle of the harness thin into the distance leaving him again to the sound of the drowsy bees among the locust blossoms when he sat up he noticed that through a break in the hedge beyond the slender black trunks of the locusts he could see rising above the trees the extinguishershaped roof of the tower of genevieve rods house he remembered the day he had first seen genevieve and the boyish awkwardness with which she poured tea would he and genevieve ever find a moment of real contact all at once a bitter thought came to him or is it that she wants a tame pianist as an ornament to a clever young womans drawing room he jumped to his feet and started walking fast towards the town again he would go to see her at once and settle all that forever the village clock had begun to strike the clear notes vibrated crisply across the fields ten walking back to the village he began to think of money his room was twenty francs a week he had in his purse a hundred and twentyfour francs after fishing in all his pockets for silver he found three francs and a half more a hundred and twentyseven francs fifty if he could live on forty francs a week he would have three weeks in which to work on the body and soul of john brown only three weeks and then he must find work in any case he would write henslowe to send him money if he had any this was no time for delicacy everything depended on his having money and he swore to himself that he would work for three weeks that he would throw the idea that flamed within him into shape on paper whatever happened he racked his brains to think of someone in america he could write to for money a ghastly sense of solitude possessed him and would genevieve fail him too genevieve was coming out by the front door of the house when he reached the carriage gate beside the road she ran to meet him good morning i was on my way to fetch you she seized his hand and pressed it hard how sweet of you but jean youre not coming from the village ive been walking how early you must get up you see the sun rises just opposite my window and shines in on my bed that makes me get up early she pushed him in the door ahead of her they went through the hall to a long high room that had a grand piano and many old highbacked chairs and in front of the french windows that opened on the garden a round table of black mahogany littered with books two tall girls in muslin dresses stood beside the piano these are my cousins here he is at last monsieur andrews ma cousine berthe et ma cousine jeanne now youve got to play to us we are bored to death with everything we know all right but i have a great deal to talk to you about later said andrews in a low voice genevieve nodded understandingly why dont you play us la reine de saba jean oh do play that twittered the cousins if you dont mind id rather play some bach theres a lot of bach in that chest in the corner cried genevieve its ridiculous everything in the house is jammed with music they leaned over the chest together so that andrews felt her hair brush against his cheek and the smell of her hair in his nostrils the cousins remained by the piano i must talk to you alone soon whispered andrews all right she said her face reddening as she leaned over the chest on top of the music was a revolver look out its loaded she said when he picked it up he looked at her inquiringly i have another in my room you see mother and i are often alone here and then i like firearms dont you i hate them muttered andrews heres tons of bach fine look genevieve he said suddenly lend me that revolver for a few days ill tell you why i want it later certainly be careful because its loaded she said in an offhand manner walking over to the piano with two volumes under each arm andrews closed the chest and followed her suddenly bubbling with gaiety he opened a volume haphazard to a friend to dissuade him from starting on a journey he read oh i used to know that he began to play putting boisterous vigor into the tunes in a pianissimo passage he heard one cousin whisper to the other quil a lair interessant farouche nestce pas genre revolutionnaire answered the other cousin tittering then he noticed that mme rod was smiling at him he got to his feet mais ne vous derangez pas she said a man with white flannel trousers and tennis shoes and a man in black with a pointed grey beard and amused grey eyes had come into the room followed by a stout woman in hat and veil with long white cotton gloves on her arms introductions were made andrewss spirits began to ebb all these people were making strong the barrier between him and genevieve whenever he looked at her some welldressed person stepped in front of her with a gesture of politeness he felt caught in a ring of welldressed conventions that danced about him with grotesque gestures of politeness all through lunch he had a crazy desire to jump to his feet and shout look at me im a deserter im under the wheels of your system if your system doesnt succeed in killing me it will be that much weaker it will have less strength to kill others there was talk about his demobilization and his music and the schola cantorum he felt he was being exhibited but they dont know what theyre exhibiting he said to himself with a certain bitter joy after lunch they went out into the grape arbor where coffee was brought andrews sat silent not listening to the talk which was about empire furniture and the new taxes staring up into the broad sunsplotched leaves of the grape vines remembering how the sun and shade had danced about genevieves hair when they had been in the arbor alone the day before turning it all to red flame today she sat in shadow and her hair was rusty and dull time dragged by very slowly at last genevieve got to her feet you havent seen my boat she said to andrews lets go for a row ill row you about andrews jumped up eagerly make her be careful monsieur andrews shes dreadfully imprudent said madame rod you were bored to death said genevieve as they walked out on the road no but those people all seemed to be building new walls between you and me god knows there are enough already she looked him sharply in the eyes a second but said nothing they walked slowly through the sand of the river edge till they came to an old flatbottomed boat painted green with an orange stripe drawn up among the reeds it will probably sink can you swim she asked laughing andrews smiled and said in a stiff voice i can swim it was by swimming that i got out of the army what do you mean when i deserted when you deserted genevieve leaned over to pull on the boat their heads almost touching they pulled the boat down to the waters edge then pushed it half out on to the river and if you are caught they might shoot me i dont know still as the war is over it would probably be life imprisonment or at least twenty years you can speak of it as coolly as that it is no new idea to my mind what induced you to do such a thing i was not willing to submit any longer to the treadmill come lets go out on the river genevieve stepped into the boat and caught up the oars now push her off and dont fall in she cried the boat glided out into the water genevieve began pulling on the oars slowly and regularly andrews looked at her without speaking when youre tired ill row he said after a while behind them the village patched white and buffcolor and russet and pale red with stucco walls and steep tiled roofs rose in an irregular pyramid to the church through the wide pointed arches of the belfry they could see the bells hanging against the sky below in the river the town was reflected complete with a great rift of steely blue across it where the wind ruffled the water the oars creaked rhythmically as genevieve pulled on them remember when you are tired said andrews again after a long pause genevieve spoke through clenched teeth of course you have no patriotism as you mean it none they rounded the edge of a sand bank where the current ran hard andrews put his hands beside her hands on the oars and pushed with her the bow of the boat grounded in some reeds under willows well stay here she said pulling in the oars that flashed in the sun as she jerked them dripping silver out of the water she clasped her hands round her knees and leaned over towards him so that is why you want my revolver tell me all about it from chartres she said in a choked voice you see i was arrested at chartres and sent to a labor battalion the equivalent for your army prison without being able to get word to my commanding officer in the school detachment he paused a bird was singing in the willow tree the sun was under a cloud beyond the long pale green leaves that fluttered ever so slightly in the wind the sky was full of silvery and creamcolored clouds with here and there a patch the color of a robins egg andrews began laughing softly but genevieve how silly those words are those pompous efficient words detachment battalion commanding officer it would have all happened anyway things reached the breaking point that was all i could not submit any longer to the discipline oh those long roman words what millstones they are about mens necks that was silly too i was quite willing to help in the killing of germans i had no quarrel with out of curiosity or cowardice you see it has taken me so long to find out how the world is there was no one to show me the way he paused as if expecting her to speak the bird in the willow tree was still singing suddenly a dangling twig blew aside a little so that andrews could see him a small grey bird his throat all puffed out with song it seems to me he said very softly that human society has been always that and perhaps will be always that organizations growing and stifling individuals and individuals revolting hopelessly against them and at last forming new societies to crush the old societies and becoming slaves again in their turn i thought you were a socialist broke in genevieve sharply in a voice that hurt him to the quick he did not know why a man told me at the labor battalion began andrews again that theyd tortured a friend of his there once by making him swallow lighted cigarettes well every order shouted at me every new humiliation before the authorities was as great an agony to me cant you understand his voice rose suddenly to a tone of entreaty she nodded her head they were silent the willow leaves shivered in a little wind the bird had gone but tell me about the swimming part of it that sounds exciting we were working unloading cement at passy cement to build the stadium the army is presenting to the french built by slave labor like the pyramids passys where balzac lived have you ever seen his house there there was a boy working with me the kid le gosse itd be in french without him i should never have done it i was completely crushed i suppose that he was drowned anyway we swam under water as far as we could and as it was nearly dark i managed to get on a barge where a funny anarchist family took care of me ive never heard of the kid since then i bought these clothes that amuse you so genevieve and came back to paris to find you mainly i mean as much to you as that whispered genevieve in paris too i tried to find a boy named marcel who worked on a farm near st germain i met him out there one day i found hed gone to sea if it had not been that i had to see you i should have gone straight to bordeaux or marseilles they arent too particular who they take as a seaman now but in the army didnt you have enough of that dreadful life always thrown among uneducated people always in dirty foulsmelling surroundings you a sensitive person an artist no wonder you are almost crazy after years of that genevieve spoke passionately with her eyes fixed on his face oh it wasnt that said andrews with despair in his voice i rather like the people you call low anyway the differences between people are so slight his sentence trailed away he stopped speaking sat stirring uneasily on the seat afraid he would cry out he noticed the hard shape of the revolver against his leg but isnt there something you can do about it you must have friends burst out genevieve you were treated with horrible injustice you can get yourself reinstated and properly demobilised theyll see you are a person of intelligence they cant treat you as they would anybody i must be as you say a little mad genevieve said andrews but now that i by pure accident have made a gesture feeble as it is towards human freedom i cant feel that oh i suppose im a fool but there you have me just as i am genevieve he sat with his head drooping over his chest his two hands clasping the gunwales of the boat after a long while genevieve said in a dry little voice well we must go back now its time for tea andrews looked up there was a dragon fly poised on the top of a reed with silver wings and a long crimson body look just behind you genevieve oh a dragon fly what people was it that made them the symbol of life it wasnt the egyptians o ive forgotten ill row said andrews the boat was hurried along by the current in a very few minutes they had pulled it up on the bank in front of the rods house come and have some tea said genevieve no i must work you are doing something new arent you andrews nodded whats its name the soul and body of john brown whos john brown he was a madman who wanted to free people theres a song about him it is based on popular themes not that i know of i only thought of the name yesterday it came to me by a very curious accident youll come tomorrow if youre not too busy lets see the boileaus are coming to lunch there wont be anybody at tea time we can have tea together alone he took her hand and held it awkward as a child with a new playmate all right at about four if theres nobody there well play music he said she pulled her hand from him hurriedly made a curious formal gesture of farewell and crossed the road to the gate without looking back there was one idea in his head to get to his room and lock the door and throw himself face down on the bed the idea amused some distant part of his mind that had been what he had always done when as a child the world had seemed too much for him he would run upstairs and lock the door and throw himself face downward on the bed i wonder if i shall cry he thought madame boncour was coming down the stairs as he went up he backed down and waited when she got to the bottom pouting a little she said so you are a friend of mme rod monsieur how did you know that a dimple appeared near her mouth in either cheek you know in the country one knows everything she said au revoir he said starting up the stairs mais monsieur you should have told me if i had known i should not have asked you to pay in advance oh never you must pardon me monsieur all right monsieur est americain you see i know a lot her puffy cheeks shook when she giggled and monsieur has known mme rod et mlle rod a long time an old friend monsieur is a musician yes bon soir andrews ran up the stairs au revoir monsieur her chanting voice followed him up the stairs he slammed the door behind him and threw himself on the bed when andrews awoke next morning his first thought was how long he had to wait that day to see genevieve then he remembered their talk of the day before was it worth while going to see her at all he asked himself and very gradually he felt cold despair taking hold of him he felt for a moment that he was the only living thing in a world of dead machines the toad hopping across the road in front of a steam roller suddenly he thought of jeanne he remembered her grimy overworked fingers lying in her lap he pictured her walking up and down in front of the cafe de rohan one wednesday night waiting for him in the place of genevieve what would jeanne have done yet people were always alone really however much they loved each other there could be no real union those who rode in the great car could never feel as the others felt the toads hopping across the road he felt no rancour against genevieve these thoughts slipped from him while he was drinking the coffee and eating the dry bread that made his breakfast and afterwards walking back and forth along the river bank he felt his mind and body becoming as if fluid and supple trembling bent in the rush of his music like a poplar tree bent in a wind he sharpened a pencil and went up to his room again the sky was cloudless that day as he sat at his table the square of blue through the window and the hills topped by their windmill and the silverblue of the river were constantly in his eyes sometimes he wrote notes down fast thinking nothing feeling nothing seeing nothing other times he sat for long periods staring at the sky and at the windmill vaguely happy playing with unexpected thoughts that came and vanished as now and then a moth fluttered in the window to blunder about the ceiling beams and at last to disappear without his knowing how when the clock struck twelve he found he was very hungry for two days he had eaten nothing but bread sausage and cheese finding madame boncour behind the bar downstairs polishing glasses he ordered dinner of her she brought him a stew and a bottle of wine at once and stood over him watching him eat it her arms akimbo and the dimples showing in her huge red cheeks monsieur eats less than any young man i ever saw she said im working hard said andrews flushing but when you work you have to eat a great deal a great deal and if the money is short asked andrews with a smile something in the steely searching look that passed over her eyes for a minute startled him there are not many people here now monsieur but you should see it on a market day monsieur will take some dessert cheese and coffee nothing more its the season of strawberries nothing more thank you when madame boncour came back with the cheese she said i had americans here once monsieur a pretty time i had with them too they were deserters they went away without paying with the gendarmes after them i hope they were caught and sent to the front those goodfornothings there are all sorts of americans said andrews in a low voice he was angry with himself because his heart beat so well im going for a little walk au revoir madame monsieur is going for a little walk amusezvous bien monsieur au revoir monsieur madame boncours singsong tones followed him out a little before four andrews knocked at the front door of the rods house he could hear santo the little black and tan barking inside madame rod opened the door for him herself oh here you are she said come and have some tea did the work go well today and genevieve stammered andrews she went out motoring with some friends she left a note for you its on the teatable he found himself talking making questions and answers drinking tea putting cakes into his mouth all through a white dead mist genevieves note said jean im thinking of ways and means you must get away to a neutral country why couldnt you have talked it over with me first before cutting off every chance of going back ill be in tomorrow at the same time bien a vous g r would it disturb you if i played the piano a few minutes madame rod andrews found himself asking all at once no go ahead well come in later and listen to you it was only as he left the room that he realized he had been talking to the two cousins as well as to madame rod at the piano he forgot everything and regained his mood of vague joyousness he found paper and a pencil in his pocket and played the theme that had come to him while he had been washing windows at the top of a stepladder at training camp arranging it modelling it forgetting everything absorbed in his rhythms and cadences when he stopped work it was nearly dark genevieve rod a veil round her head stood in the french window that led to the garden i heard you she said go on im through how was your motor ride i loved it its not often i get a chance to go motoring nor is it often i get a chance to talk to you alone cried andrews bitterly you seem to feel you have rights of ownership over me i resent it no one has rights over me she spoke as if it were not the first time she had thought of the phrase he walked over and leaned against the window beside her has it made such a difference to you genevieve finding out that i am a deserter no of course not she said hastily i think it has genevieve what do you want me to do do you think i should give myself up a man i knew in paris has given himself up but he hadnt taken his uniform off it seems that makes a difference he was a nice fellow his name was al he was from san francisco he had nerve for he amputated his own little finger when his hand was crushed by a freight car oh no no oh this is so frightful and you would have been a great composer i feel sure of it why would have been the stuff im doing nows better than any of the dribbling things ive done before i know that oh yes but youll need to study to get yourself known if i can pull through six months im safe the army will have gone i dont believe they extradite deserters yes but the shame of it the danger of being found out all the time i am ashamed of many things in my life genevieve im rather proud of this but cant you understand that other people havent your notions of individual liberty i must go genevieve you must come in again soon one of these days and he was out in the road in the windy twilight with his music papers crumpled in his hand the sky was full of tempestuous purple clouds between them were spaces of clear claretcolored light and here and there a gleam of opal there were a few drops of rain in the wind that rustled the broad leaves of the lindens and filled the wheat fields with waves like the sea and made the river very dark between rosy sand banks it began to rain andrews hurried home so as not to drench his only suit once in his room he lit four candles and placed them at the corners of his table a little cold crimson light still filtered in through the rain from the afterglow giving the candles a ghostly glimmer then he lay on his bed and staring up at the flickering light on the ceiling tried to think well youre alone now john andrews he said aloud after a halfhour and jumped jauntily to his feet he stretched himself and yawned outside the rain pattered loudly and steadily lets have a general accounting he said to himself itll be easily a month before i hear from old howe in america and longer before i hear from henslowe and already ive spent twenty francs on food cant make it this way then in real possessions i have one volume of villon a green book on counterpoint a map of france torn in two and a moderately wellstocked mind he put the two books on the middle of the table before him on top of his disorderly bundle of music papers and notebooks then he went on piling his possessions there as he thought of them three pencils a fountain pen automatically he reached for his watch but he remembered hed given it to al to pawn in case he didnt decide to give himself up and needed money a toothbrush a shaving set a piece of soap a hairbrush and a broken comb anything else he groped in the musette that hung on the foot of the bed a box of matches a knife with one blade missing and a mashed cigarette amusement growing on him every minute he contemplated the pile then in the drawer he remembered was a clean shirt and two pairs of soiled socks and that was all absolutely all nothing saleable there except genevieves revolver he pulled it out of his pocket the candlelight flashed on the bright nickel no he might need that it was too valuable to sell he pointed it towards himself under the chin was said to be the best place he wondered if he would pull the trigger when the barrel was pressed against his chin no when his money gave out hed sell the revolver an expensive death for a starving man he sat on the edge of the bed and laughed then he discovered he was very hungry two meals in one day shocking he said to himself whistling joyfully like a schoolboy he strode down the rickety stairs to order a meal of madame boncour it was with a strange start that he noticed that the tune he was whistling was john browns body lies amouldering in the grave but his soul goes marching on the lindens were in bloom from a tree beside the house great gusts of fragrance heavy as incense came in through the open window andrews lay across the table with his eyes closed and his cheek in a mass of ruled papers he was very tired the first movement of the soul and body of john brown was down on paper the village clock struck two he got to his feet and stood a moment looking absently out of the window it was a sultry afternoon of swollen clouds that hung low over the river the windmill on the hilltop opposite was motionless he seemed to hear genevieves voice the last time he had seen her so long ago you would have been a great composer he walked over to the table and turned over some sheets without looking at them would have been he shrugged his shoulders so you couldnt be a great composer and a deserter too in the year probably genevieve was right but he must have something to eat but how late it is expostulated madame boncour when he asked for lunch i know its very late i have just finished a third of the work im doing and do you get paid a great deal when that is finished asked madame boncour the dimples appearing in her broad cheeks some day perhaps you will be lonely now that the rods have left have they left didnt you know didnt you go to say goodby theyve gone to the seashore but ill make you a little omelette thank you when madame boncour cams back with the omelette and fried potatoes she said to him in a mysterious voice you didnt go to see the rods as often these last weeks no madame boncour stood staring at him with her red arms folded round her breasts shaking her head when he got up to go upstairs again she suddenly shouted and when are you going to pay me its two weeks since you have paid me but madame boncour i told you i had no money if you wait a day or two im sure to get some in the mail it cant be more than a day or two ive heard that story before ive even tried to get work at several farms round here madame boncour threw back her head and laughed showing the blackened teeth of her lower jaw look here she said at length after this week its finished you either pay me orand i sleep very lightly monsieur her voice took on suddenly its usual sleek singsong tone andrews broke away and ran upstairs to his room i must fly the coop tonight he said to himself but suppose then letters came with money the next day he writhed in indecision all the afternoon that evening he took a long walk in passing the rods house he saw that the shutters were closed it gave him a sort of relief to know that genevieve no longer lived near him his solitude was complete now and why instead of writing music that would have been worth while if he hadnt been a deserter he kept asking himself hadnt he tried long ago to act to make a gesture however feeble however forlorn for other peoples freedom half by accident he had managed to free himself from the treadmill couldnt he have helped others if he only had his life to live over again no he had not lived up to the name of john brown it was dark when he got back to the village he had decided to wait one more day the next morning he started working on the second movement the lack of a piano made it very difficult to get ahead yet he said to himself that he should put down what he could as it would be long before he found leisure again one night he had blown out his candle and stood at the window watching the glint of the moon on the river he heard a soft heavy step on the landing outside his room a floorboard creaked and the key turned in the lock the step was heard again on the stairs john andrews laughed aloud the window was only twenty feet from the ground and there was a trellis he got into bed contentedly he must sleep well for tomorrow night he would slip out of the window and make for bordeaux another morning a brisk wind blew fluttering andrewss papers as he worked outside the river was streaked blue and silver and slatecolored the windmills arms waved fast against the piled clouds the scent of the lindens came only intermittently on the sharp wind in spite of himself the tune of john browns body had crept in among his ideas andrews sat with a pencil at his lips whistling softly while in the back of his mind a vast chorus seemed singing john browns body lies amouldering in the grave but his soul goes marching on glory glory hallelujah but his soul goes marching on if one could only find freedom by marching for it came the thought all at once he became rigid his hands clutched the table edge there was an american voice under his window dyou think shes kiddin us charley andrews was blinded falling from a dizzy height god could things repeat themselves like that would everything be repeated and he seemed to hear voices whisper in his ears one of you men teach him how to salute he jumped to his feet and pulled open the drawer it was empty the woman had taken the revolver its all planned then she knew he said aloud in a low voice he became suddenly calm a man in a boat was passing down the river the boat was painted bright green the man wore a curious jacket of a burntbrown color and held a fishing pole andrews sat in his chair again the boat was out of sight now but there was the windmill turning turning against the piled white clouds there were steps on the stairs two swallows twittering curved past the window very near so that andrews could make out the marking on their wings and the way they folded their legs against their palegrey bellies there was a knock come in said andrews firmly i beg yer pardon said a soldier with his hat that had a band in his hand are you the american yes well the woman down there said she thought your papers wasnt in very good order the man stammered with embarrassment their eyes met no im a deserter said andrews the m p snatched for his whistle and blew it hard there was an answering whistle from outside the window get your stuff together i have nothing all right walk downstairs slowly in front of me outside the windmill was turning turning against the piled white clouds of the sky andrews turned his eyes towards the door the m p closed the door after them and followed on his heels down the steps on john andrewss writing table the brisk wind rustled among the broad sheets of paper first one sheet then another blew off the table until the floor was littered with them
