 the robbery in phillimore terrace baroness orczy this page copyright blackmask online chapter iv the robbery in phillimore terrace chapter v a nights adventure chapter vi all he knew chapter iv the robbery in phillimore terrace whether miss polly burton really did expect to see the man in the corner that saturday afternoon twere difficult to say certain it is that when she found her way to the table close by the window and realized that he was not there she felt conscious of an overwhelming sense of disappointment and yet during the whole of the week she had with more pride than wisdom avoided this particular abc shop i thought you would not keep away very long said a quiet voice close to her ear she nearly lost her balancewhere in the world had he come from she certainly had not heard the slightest sound and yet there he sat in the corner like a veritable jackinthebox his mild blue eyes staring apologetically at her his nervous fingers toying with the inevitable bit of string the waitress brought him his glass of milk and a cheesecake he ate it in silence while his piece of string lay idly beside him on the table when he had finished he fumbled in his capacious pockets and drew out the inevitable pocketbook placing a small photograph before the girl he said quietly that is the back of the houses in phillimore terrace which overlook adam and eve mews she looked at the photograph then at him with a kindly look of indulgent expectancy you will notice that the row of back gardens have each an exit into the mews these mews are built in the shape of a capital f the photograph is taken looking straight down the short horizontal line which ends as you see in a culdesac the bottom of the vertical line turns into phillimore terrace and the end of the upper long horizontal line into high street kensington now on that particular night or rather early morning of january th constable d having turned into the mews from phillimore terrace stood for a moment at the angle formed by the long vertical artery of the mews and the short horizontal one which as i observed before looks on to the back gardens of the terrace houses and ends in a culdesac how long d stood at that particular corner he could not exactly say but he thinks it must have been three or four minutes before he noticed a suspiciouslooking shambling along under the shadow of the garden walls he was working his way cautiously in the direction of the culdesac and d also keeping well within the shadow went noiselessly after him he had almost overtaken himwas in fact not more than thirty yards from himwhen from out of one of the two end housesno phillimore terrace in facta man in nothing but his nightshirt rushed out excitedly and before d had time to intervene literally threw himself upon the suspected individual rolling over and over with him on the hard cobblestones and frantically shrieking thief thief police it was some time before the constable succeeded in rescuing the tramp from the excited grip of his assailant and several minutes before he could make himself heard there there thatll do he managed to say at last as he gave the man in the shirt a vigorous shove which silenced him for the moment leave the man alone now you mustnt make that noise this time o night wakin up all the folks the unfortunate tramp who in the meanwhile had managed to get on to his feet again made no attempt to get away probably he thought he would stand but a poor chance but the man in the shirt had partly recovered his power of speech and was now blurting out jerky halfintelligible sentences i have been robbedrobbedithat ismy mastermr knopf the desk is openthe diamonds goneall in my chargeandnow they are stolen thats the thiefill sweari heard himnot three minutes agoi rushed downstairsthe door into the garden was smashedi ran across the gardenhe was sneaking about here stillthief thief police diamonds constable dont let him goill make you responsible if you let him go now thenthatll do admonished d as soon as he could get a word in stop that row will you the man in the shirt was gradually recovering from his excitement can i give this man in charge he asked what for burglary and housebreaking i heard him i tell you he must have mr knopfs diamonds about him at this moment where is mr knopf out of town groaned the man in the shirt he went to brighton last night and left me in charge and now this thief has been and the tramp shrugged his shoulders and suddenly without a word he quietly began taking off his coat and waistcoat these he handed across to the constable eagerly the man in the shirt fell on them and turned the ragged pockets inside out from one of the windows a hilarious voice made some facetious remark as the tramp with equal solemnity began divesting himself of his nether garments now then stop that nonsense pronounced d severely what were you doing here this time o night anyway the streets o london is free to the public aint they queried the tramp this dont lead nowhere my man then ive lost my way thats all growled the man surlily and praps youll let me get along now by this time a couple of constables had appeared upon the scene d had no intention of losing sight of his friend the tramp and the man in the shirt had again made a dash for the latters collar at the bare idea that he should be allowed to get along i think d was alive to the humour of the situation he suggested that robertson should go in and get some clothes on whilst he himself would wait for the inspector and the detective whom d would send round from the station immediately poor robertsons teeth were chattering with cold he had a violent fit of sneezing as d hurried him into the house the latter with another constable remained to watch the but glared premises both back and front and d took the wretched tramp to the station with view to sending an inspector and a detective round immediately when the two latter gentlemen arrived at no phillimore terrace they found poor old robertson in bed shivering and still quite blue he had got himself a hot drink but his eyes were streaming and his voice was terribly husky d had stationed himself in the diningroom where robertson had pointed the desk out to him with its broken lock and scattered contents robertson between his sneezes gave what account he could of the events which happened immediately before the robbery his master mr ferdinand knopf he said was a diamond merchant and a bachelor he himself had been in mr knopfs employ over fifteen years and was his only indoor servant a charwoman came every day to do the housework last night mr knopf dined at the house of mr shipman at no lower down mr shipman is the great jeweller who has his place of business in south audley street by the last post there came a letter with the brighton postmark and marked urgent for mr knopf and he was just wondering if he should run over to no with it when his master returned he gave one glance at the contents of the letter asked for his abc railway guide and ordered him to pack his bag at once and fetch him a cab i guessed what it was continued robertson after another violent fit of sneezing mr knopf has a brother mr emile knopf to whom he is very much attached and who is a great invalid he generally goes about from one seaside place to another he is now at brighton and has recently been very ill if you will take the trouble to go downstairs i think you will still find the letter lying on the hall table i read it after mr knopf left it was not from his brother but from a gentleman who signed himself j collins md i dont remember the exact words but of course youll be able to read the lettermr j collins said he had been called in very suddenly to see mr emile knopf who he added had not many hours to live and had begged of the doctor to communicate at once with his brother in london before leaving mr knopf warned me that there were some valuables in his deskdiamonds mostly and told me to be particularly careful about locking up the house he often has left me like this in charge of his premises and usually there have been diamonds in his desk for mr knopf has no regular city office as he is a commercial traveller this briefly was the gist of the matter which robertson related to the inspector with many repetitions and persistent volubility the detective and inspector before returning to the station with their report thought they would call at no on mr shipman the great jeweller you remember of course added the man in the corner dreamily contemplating his bit of string the exciting developments of this extraordinary case mr arthur shipman is the head of the firm of shipman and co the wealthy jewellers he is a widower and lives very quietly by himself in his own oldfashioned way in the small kensington house leaving it to his two married sons to keep up the style and swagger befitting the representatives of so wealthy a firm i have only known mr knopf a very little while he explained to the detectives he sold me two or three stones once or twice i think but we are both single men and we have often dined together last night he dined with me he had that afternoon received a very fine consignment of brazilian diamonds as he told me and knowing how beset i am with callers at my business place he had brought the stones with him hoping perhaps to do a bit of trade over the nuts and wine i bought ј worth of him added the jeweller as if he were speaking of so many farthings and gave him a cheque across the dinner table for that amount i think we were both pleased with our bargain and we had a final bottle of port over it together mr knopf left me at about for he knows i go very early to bed and i took my new stock upstairs with me and locked it up in the safe i certainly heard nothing of the noise in the mews last night i sleep on the second floor in the front of the house and this is the first i have heard of poor mr knopfs loss at this point of his narrative mr shipman very suddenly paused and his face became very pale with a hasty word of excuse he unceremoniously left the room and the detective heard him running quickly upstairs less than two minutes later mr shipman returned there was no need for him to speak both the detective and the inspector guessed the truth in a moment by the look upon his face the diamonds he gasped i have been robbed chapter v a nights adventure now i must tell you continued the man in the corner that after i had read the account of the double robbery which appeared in the early afternoon papers i set to work and had a good thinkyes he added with a smile noting pollys look at the bit of string on which he was still at work yes aided by this small adjunct to continued thoughti made notes as to how i should proceed to discover the clever thief who had carried off a small fortune in a single night of course my methods are not those of a london detective he has his own way of going to work the one who was conducting this case questioned the unfortunate jeweller very closely about his servants and his household generally i have three servants explained mr shipman two of whom have been with me for many years one the housemaid is a fairly new comershe has been here about six months she came recommended by a friend and bore an excellent character she and the parlourmaid room together the cook who knew me when i was a schoolboy sleeps alone all three servants sleep on the floor above i locked the jewels up in the safe which stands in the dressingroom my keys and watch i placed as usual beside my bed as a rule i am a fairly light sleeper i cannot understand how it could have happenedbutyou had better come up and have a look at the safe the key must have been abstracted from my bedside the safe opened and the keys replacedall while i was fast asleep though i had no occasion to look into the safe until just now i should have discovered my loss before going to business for i intended to take the diamonds away with me the detective and the inspector went up to have a look at the safe the lock had in no way been tampered withit had been opened with its own key the detective spoke of chloroform but mr shipman declared that when he woke in the morning at about halfpast seven there vas no smell of chloroform in the room however the proceedings of the daring thief certainly pointed to the use of an anжsthetic an examination of the premises brought to light the fact that the burglar had as in mr knopfs house used the glasspanelled door from the garden as a means of entrance but in this instance he had carefully cut out the pane of glass with a diamond slipped the bolts turned the key and walked in which among your servants knew that you had the diamonds in your house last night mr shipman asked the detective not one i should say replied the jeweller though perhaps the parlourmaid whilst waiting at table may have heard me and mr knopf discussing our bargain would yon object to my searching all your servants boxes certainly not they would not object either i am sure they are perfectly honest the searching of servants belongings is invariably a useless proceeding added the man in the corner with a shrug of the shoulders no one not even a latterday domestic would be fool enough to keep stolen property in the house however the usual farce was gone through with more or less protest on the part of mr shipmans servants and with the usual result the jeweller could give no further information the detective and inspector to do them justice did their work of investigation minutely and what is more intelligently it seemed evident from their deductions that the burglar had commenced proceedings on no phillimore terrace and had then gone on probably climbing over the garden walls between the houses to no where he was almost caught in the act by robertson the facts were simple enough but the mystery remained as to the individual who had managed to glean the information of the presence of the diamonds in both the houses and the means which he had adopted to get that information it was obvious that the thief or thieves knew more about mr knopfs affairs than mr shipmans since they had known how to use mr emile knopfs name in order to get his brother out of the way it was now nearly ten oclock and the detectives having taken leave of mr shipman went back to no in order to ascertain whether mr knopf had come back the door was opened by the old charwoman who said that her master had returned and was having some breakfast in the diningroom mr ferdinand knopf was a middleaged man with sallow complexion black hair and beard of obviously hebrew extraction he spoke with a marked foreign accent but very courteously to the two officials who he begged would excuse him if he went on with his breakfast i was fully prepared to hear the bad news he explained which my man robertson told me when i arrived the letter i got last night was a bogus one there is no such person as j collins m d my brother had never felt better in his life you will i am sure very soon trace the cunning writer of that epistleah but i was in a rage i can tell you when i got to the metropole at brighton and found that emile my brother had never heard of any doctor collins the last train to town had gone although i raced back to the station as hard as i could poor old robertson he has a terrible cold ah yes my loss it is for me a very serious one if i had not made that lucky bargain with mr shipman last night i should perhaps at this moment be a ruined man the stones i had yesterday were firstly some magnificent brazilians these i sold to mr shipman mostly then i had some very good cape diamondsall gone and some quite special parisians of wonderful work and finish entrusted to me for sale by a great french house i tell you sir my loss will be nearly ј altogether i sell on commission and of course have to make good the loss he was evidently trying to bear up manfully and as a business man should under his sad fate he refused in any way to attach the slightest blame to his old and faithful servant robertson who had caught perhaps his death of cold in his zeal for his absent master as for any hint of suspicion falling even remotely upon the man the very idea appeared to mr knopf absolutely preposterous with regard to the old charwoman mr knopf certainly knew nothing about her beyond the fact that she had been recommended to him by one of the tradespeople in the neighbourhood and seemed perfectly honest respectable and sober about the tramp mr knopf knew still less nor could he imagine how he or in fact anybody else could possibly know that he happened to have diamonds in his house that night this certainly seemed the great hitch in the case mr ferdinand knopf at the instance of the police later on went to the station and had a look at the suspected tramp he declared that he had never set eyes on him before mr shipman on his way home from business in the afternoon had done likewise and made a similar statement brought before the magistrate the tramp gave but a poor account of himself he gave a name and address which latter of course proved to be false after that he absolutely refused to speak he seemed not to care whether he was kept in custody or not very soon even the police realized that for the present at any rate nothing could be got out of the suspected tramp mr francis howard the detective who had charge of the case though he would not admit it even to himself was at his wits ends you must remember that the burglary through its very simplicity was an exceedingly mysterious affair the constable d who had stood in adam and eve mews presumably while mr knopfs house was being robbed had seen no one turn out from the culdesac into the main passage of the mews the stables which immediately faced the back entrance of the phillimore terrace houses were all private ones belonging to residents in the neighbourhood the coachmen their families and all the grooms who slept in the stablings were rigidly watched and questioned one and all had seen nothing heard nothing until robertsons shrieks had roused them from their sleep as for the letter from brighton it was absolutely commonplace and written upon notepaper which the detective with machiavellian cunning traced to a stationers shop in west street but the trade at that particular shop was a very brisk one scores of people had bought notepaper there similar to that on which the supposed doctor had written his tricky letter the handwriting was cramped perhaps a disguised one in any case except under very exceptional circumstances it could afford no clue to the identity of the thief needless to say the tramp who told to write his name wrote a totally different and absolutely uneducated hand matters stood however in the same persistently mysterious state when a small discovery was made which suggested to mr francis howard an idea which if properly carried out would he hoped inevitably bring the cunning burglar safely within the grasp of the police that was the discovery of a few of mr knopfs diamonds continued the man in the comer after a slight pause evidently trampled into the ground by the thief whilst making his hurried exit through the garden of no phillimore terrace at the end of this garden there is a small studio which had been built by a former owner of the house and behind it a small piece of waste ground about seven feet square which had once been a rockery and is still filled with large loose stones in the shadow of which earwigs and woodlice innumerable have made a happy hunting ground it was robertson who two days after the robbery having need of a large stone for some household purpose or other dislodged one from that piece of waste ground and found a few shining pebbles beneath it mr knopf took them round to the policestation himself immediately and identified the stones as some of his parisian ones later on the detective went to view the place where the find had been made and there conceived the plan upon which he built his cherished hopes acting upon the advice of mr francis howard the police decided to let the anonymous tramp out of his safe retreat within the station and to allow him to wander whithersoever he chose a good idea perhapsthe presumption being that sooner or later if the man was in any way mixed up with the cunning thieves he would either rejoin his comrades or even lead the police to where the remnant of his hoard lay hidden needless to say his footsteps were to be literally dogged the wretched tramp on his discharge wandered out of the yard wrapping his thin coat round his shoulders for it was a bitterly cold afternoon he began operations by turning into the town hall tavern for a good feed and a copious drink mr francis howard noted that he seemed to eye every passerby with suspicion but he seemed to enjoy his dinner and sat some time over his bottle of wine it was close upon four oclock when he left the tavern and then began for the indefatigable mr howard one of the most wearisome and uninteresting chases through the mazes of the london streets he ever remembers to have made up notting hill down the slums of notting dale along the high street beyond hammersmith and through shepherds bush did that anonymous tramp lead the unfortunate detective never hurrying himself stopping every now and then at a publichouse to get a drink whither mr howard did not always care to follow him in spite of his fatigue mr francis howards hopes rose with every halfhour of this weary tramp the man was obviously striving to kill time he seemed to feel no weariness but walked on and on perhaps suspecting that he was being followed at last with a beating heart though half perished with cold and with terribly sore feet the detective began to realize that the tramp was gradually working his way back towards kensington it was then close upon eleven oclock at night once or twice the man had walked up and down the high street from st pauls school to derry and toms shops and back again he had looked down one or two of the side streets andat lasthe turned into phillimore terrace he seemed in no hurry he even stopped once in the middle of the road trying to light a pipe which as there was a high east wind took him some considerable time then he leisurely sauntered down the street and turned into adam and eve mews with mr francis howard close at his heels acting upon the detectives instructions there were several men in plain clothes ready to his call in the immediate neighbourhood two stood within the shadow of the steps of the congregational church at the corner of the mews others were stationed well within a soft call hardly therefore had the hare turned into the culdesac at the back of phillimore terrace than at a slight sound from mr francis howard every egress was barred to him and he was caught like a rat in a trap as soon as the tramp had advanced some thirty yards or so the whole length of this part of the mews is about one hundred yards and was lost in the shadow mr francis howard directed four or five of his men to proceed cautiously up the mews whilst the same number were to form a line all along the front of phillimore terrace between the mews and the high street remember the backgarden walls threw long and dense shadows but the silhouette of the man would be clearly outlined if he made any attempt at climbing over them mr howard felt quite sure that the thief was bent on recovering the stolen goods which no doubt he had hidden in the rear of one of the houses he would be caught in flagrante delicto and with a heavy sentence hovering over him he would probably be induced to name his accomplice mr francis howard was thoroughly enjoying himself the minutes sped on absolute silence in spite of the presence of so many men reigned in the dark and deserted mews of course this nights adventure was never allowed to get into the papers added the man in the corner with his mild smile had the plan been successful we should have heard all about it with a long eulogistic article as to the astuteness of our police but as it waswell the tramp sauntered up the mewsandthere he remained for aught mr francis howard or the other constables could ever explain the earth or the shadows swallowed him up no one saw him climb one of the garden walls no one heard him break open a door he had retreated within the shadow of the garden walls and was seen or heard of no more one of the servants in the phillimore terrace houses must have belonged to the gang said polly with quick decision ah yes but which said the man in the corner making a beautiful knot in his bit of string i can assure you that the police left not a stone unturned once more to catch sight of that tramp whom they had had in custody for two days but not a trace of him could they find nor of the diamonds from that day to this chapter vi all he knew the tramp was missing continued the man in the corner and mr francis howard tried to find the missing tramp going round to the front and seeing the lights at no still in he called upon mr shipman the jeweller had had a few friends to dinner and was giving them whiskiesandsodas before saying good night the servants had just finished washing up and were waiting to go to bed neither they nor mr shipman nor his guests had seen or heard anything of the suspicious individual mr francis howard went on to see mr ferdinand knopf this gentleman was having his warm bath preparatory to going to bed so robertson told the detective however mr knopf insisted on talking to mr howard through his bathroom door mr knopf thanked him for all the trouble he was talking and felt sure that he and mr shipman would soon recover possession of their diamonds thanks to the persevering detective he he he laughed the man in the corner poor mr howard he perseveredbut got no farther no nor anyone else for that matter even i might not be able to convict the thieves if i told all i knew to the police now follow my reasoning point by point he added eagerly who knew of the presence of the diamonds in the house of mr shipman and mr knopf firstly he said putting up an ugly clawlike finger mr shipman then mr knopf then presumably the man robertson and the tramp said polly leave the tramp alone for the present since he has vanished and take point number two mr shipman was drugged that was pretty obvious no man under ordinary circumstances would without waking have his keys abstracted and then replaced at his own bedside mr howard suggested that the thief was armed with some anжsthetic but how did the thief get into mr shipmans room without waking him from his natural sleep is it not simpler to suppose that the thief had taken the precaution to drug the jeweller before the latter went to bed but wait a moment and take point number three though there was every proof that mr shipman had been in possession of ј worth of goods since mr knopf had a cheque from him for that amount there was no proof that in mr knopfs house there was even an odd stone worth a sovereign and then again went on the scarecrow getting more and more excited did it ever strike you or anybody else that at no time while the tramp was in custody while all that searching examination was being gone on with no one ever saw mr knopf and his man robertson together at the same time ah he continued whilst suddenly the young girl seemed to see the whole thing as in a vision they did not forget a single detailfollow them with me point by point two cunning scoundrelsgeniuses they should be calledwell provided with some illgotten fundsbut determined on a grand coup they play at respectability for six months say one is the master the other the servant they take a house in the same street as their intended victim make friends with him accomplish one or two creditable but very small business transactions always drawing on the reserve funds which might even have amounted to a few hundredsand a bit of credit then the brazilian diamonds and the parisianswhich remember were so perfect that they required chemical testing to be detected the parisian stones are soldnot in business of coursein the evening after dinner and a good deal of wine mr knopfs brazilians were beautiful perfect mr knopf was a wellknown diamond merchant mr shipman boughtbut with the morning would have come sober sense the cheque stopped before it could have been presented the swindler caught no those exquisite parisians were never intended to rest in mr shipmans safe until the morning that last bottle of port with the aid of a powerful soporific ensured that mr shipman would sleep undisturbed during the night ah remember all the details they were so admirable the letter posted in brighton by the cunning rogue to himself the smashed desk the broken pane of glass in his own house the man robertson on the watch while knopf himself in ragged clothing found his way into no if constable d had not appeared upon the scene that exciting comedy in the early morning would not have been enacted as it was in the supposed fight mr shipmans diamonds passed from the hands of the tramp into those of his accomplice then later on robertson ill in bed while his master was supposed to have returnedby the way it never struck anybody that no one saw mr knopf come home though he surely would have driven up in a cab then the double part played by one man for the next two days it certainly never struck either the police or the inspector remember they only saw robertson when in bed with a streaming cold but knopf had to be got out of gaol as soon as possible the dual rфle could not have been kept up for long hence the story of the diamonds found in the garden of no the cunning rogues guessed that the usual plan would be acted upon and the suspected thief allowed to visit the scene where his hoard lay hidden it had all been foreseen and robertson must have been constantly on the watch the tramp stopped mind you in phillimore terrace for some moments lighting a pipe the accomplice then was fully on the alert he slipped the bolts of the back garden gate five minutes later knopf was in the house in a hot bath getting rid of the disguise of our friend the tramp remember that again here the detective did not actually see him the next morning mr knopf black hair and beard and all was himself again the whole trick lay in one simple art which those two cunning rascals knew to absolute perfection the art of impersonating one another they are brothers presumablytwin brothers i should say but mr knopf suggested polly well look in the trades directory you will see f knopf co diamond merchants of some city address ask about the firm among the trade you will hear that it is firmly established on a sound financial basis he he he and it deserves to be added the man in the corner as calling for the waitress he received his ticket and taking up his shabby hat took himself and his bit of string rapidly out of the room
