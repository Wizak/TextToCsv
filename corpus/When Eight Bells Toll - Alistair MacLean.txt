 one dusk monday am tuesday the peacemaker colt has now been in production without change in design for a century buy one today and it would be indistinguishable from the one wyatt earp wore when he was the marshal of dodge city it is the oldest handgun in the world without question the most famous and if efficiency in its designated task of maiming and killing be taken as criterion of its worth then h is also probably the best handgun ever made it is no light thing it is true to be wounded by some of the peacemakers more highly esteemed competitors such as the luger or mauser but the highvelocity narrowcalibre steelceased shell from either of those just goes straight through you leaving a small neat hole in its wake and spending the bulk of its energy on the distant landscape whereas the large and unjacketed softnosed lead bullet from the colt mushrooms on impact tearing and smashing bone and muscle and tissue as it goes and expending all its energy on you in short when a peacemakers bullet hits you in say the kg you dont curse step into shelter roll and light a cigarette onehanded then smartly shoot your assailant between the eyes when a peacemaker bullet hits your leg you fall to the ground unconscious and if it hits the thighbone and you are lucky enough to survive the torn arteries and shock then you will never walk again without crutches because a totally disintegrated femur leaves the surgeon with no option but to cut your leg off and so i stood absolutely motionless not breathing for the peacemaker colt that had prompted this unpleasant train of thought was pointed directly at my right thigh another thing about the peacemaker because of the very heavy and varying trigger pressure required to operate the semiautomatic mechanism it can be wildly inaccurate unless held in a strong and steady hand there was no such hope here the hand that held the colt the hand that lay so lightly yet purposefully on the radiooperators table was the steadiest hand ive ever seen it was literally motionless i could see the hand very clearly the light in the radio cabin was very dim the rheostat of the angled table lamp had been turned down until only a faint pool of yellow fell on the scratched metal of the table cutting the arm off at the cuff but the hand was very clear rocksteady the gun could have kin no quieter in the marbled hand of a statue beyond the pool of light i could half sense half see the dark outline of a figure leaning back against the bulkhead head slightly tilted to one side the white gleam of unwinking eyes under the peak of a hat my eyes went back to the hand the angle of the colt hadnt varied by a fraction of a degree unconsciously almost i braced my right leg to meet the impending shock defensively this was a very good move about as useful as holding up a sheet of newspaper in front of me i wished to god that colonel sam colt had gone in for inventing something else something useful like safetypins very slowly very steadily i raised both hands palms outward until they were level with my shoulders the careful deliberation was so that the nervously inclined wouldnt be deceived into thinking that i was contemplating anything ridiculous like resistance it was probably a pretty superfluous precaution as the man behind that immobile pistol didnt seem to have any nerves and the last thought i had in my head was that of resistance the sun was long down but the faint red afterglow of sunset still loomed on the northwest horizon and i was perfectly silhouetted against it through the cabin doorway the lad behind the desk probably had his left hand on the rheostat switch ready to turn it up and blind me at an instants notice and there was that gun i was paid to take chances i was paid even to step on occasion into danger but i wasnt paid to act the part of a congenital and suicidal idiot i hoisted my hands a couple of inches higher and tried to look as peaceful and harmless as possible the way i felt that was no feat the man with the gun said nothing and did nothing he remained completely still i could see the white blur of teeth now the gleaming eyes stared unwinkingly at me the smile the head cocked slightly to one side the negligent relaxation of the body the aura in that tiny cabin of a brooding and sardonic menace was so heavy as to be almost palpable there was something evil something frighteningly unnatural and wrong and foreboding in the mans stillness and silence and coldblooded catandmouse indifference death was waiting to reach out and touch with his icy forefinger in that tiny cabin in spite of two scots grandparents im in no way psychic or fey or secondsighted as far as extrasensory perception goes ive about the same degree of receptive sensitivity as a lump of old lead but i could smell death in the air i think were both making a mistake i said well you are maybe were both on the same side the words came with difficulty a suddenly dry throat and tongue being no aid to clarity of elocution but they sounded all right to me just as i wanted them to sound low and calm and soothing maybe he was a nut case humour him anything just stay alive i nodded to the stool at the front corner of his desk its been a hard day okay if we sit and talk ill keep my hands high i promise you the total reaction i got was nil the white teeth and eyes the relaxed contempt that iron gun in that iron hand i felt my own hands begin to clench into fists and hastily unclenched them again but i couldnt do anything about the slow burn of anger that touched me for the first time i smiled what i hoped was a friendly and encouraging smile and moved slowly towards the stool i faced him all the time the cordial smile making my face ache and the hands even higher than before a peacemaker colt can kill a steer at sixty yards god only knew what it would do to me i tried to put it out of my mind ive only got two legs and im attached to them both i made it with both still intact i sat down hands still high and started breathing again id stopped breathing but hadnt been aware of it which was understandable enough as id had other things on my mind such as crutches bleeding to death and suchlike matters that tend to grip the imagination the colt was as motionless as ever the barrel hadnt followed me as id moved across the cabin it was still pointing rigidly at the spot where id been standing ten seconds earlier i moved fast going for that gunhand but it was no breakneck dive i didnt i was almost certain even have to move fast but i havent reached the advanced age in which my chief thinks he honours me by giving me all the dirtiest jobs going by ever taking a chance when i dont have to i eat all the right foods take plenty of exercise and even although no insurance company in the world will look at me their medical men would pass me any time but even so i couldnt tear that gun away the hand that had looked like marble felt like marble only colder id smelled death all right but the old man hadnt been hanging around with his scythe at the ready hed been and gone and left this lifeless shell behind him i straightened checked that the windows were curtained closed the door noiselessly locked it as quietly and switched on the overhead light theres seldom any doubt about the exact time of a murder in an old english country house murder story after a cursory examination and a lot of pseudomedical mumbojumbo tile good doctor drops the corpses wrist and says the decedent deceased at test nightor words to that effect then with a thin deprecatory smile magnanimously conceding that hes a member of the fallible human race adds give or take a minute or two the good doctor outside the pages of the detective novel finds rather more difficult weight build ambient temperature and cause of death all bear so heavily and often unpredictably on the cooling of the body that the estimated time of death may well lie in a span of several hours im not a doctor far less a good one and all i could tell about the man behind the desk was that he had been dead long enough for rigor mortis to set in but not long enough for it to wear off he was stiff as a man frozen to death in a siberian winter hed been gone for hours how many id no idea he wore four gold bands on his sleeves so that would seem to make him the captain the captain in the radio cabin captains are seldom found in the radio cabin and never behind the desk he was slumped back in his chair his head to one side the back of it resting against a jacket hanging from a hook on the bulkhead the side of it against a wall cabinet rigor mortis kept him in that position but he should have slipped to the floor or at least slumped forward on to the table before rigor mortis had set in there were no outward signs of violence that i could see but on the assumption that it would be stretching the arm of coincidence a bit far to assume that he had succumbed from natural causes while preparing to defend his life with his peacemaker i took a closer look i tried to pull him upright but he wouldnt budge i tried harder i heard the sound of cloth ripping then suddenly he was upright then fallen over to the left of the table the right arm pivoting stiffly around and upwards the colt an accusing finger pointing at heaven i knew now how he had died and why he hadnt fallen forward before hed been killed by a weapon that projected from his spinal column between maybe the sixth and seventh vertebra i couldnt be sure and the handle of this weapon had caught in the pocket of the jacket on the bulkhead and held him there my job was one that had brought me into contact with a fair number of people who had died from a fair assortment of unnatural causes but this was the first time id ever seen a man who had been killed by a chisel a halfinch wood chisel apparently quite ordinary in every respect except that its wooden handle had been sheathed by a bicycles rubber handgrip the kind that doesnt show fingerprints the blade was imbedded to a depth of at least four inches and even allowing for an edge honed to a razor sharpness it had taken a man as powerful as he was violent to strike that blow i tried to jerk the chisel free but it wouldnt come it often happens that way with a knife bone or cartilage that has been pierced by a sharp instrument locks solid over the steel when an attempt is made to withdraw it i didnt try again the chances were that the killer himself had tried to move it and failed he wouldnt have wanted to abandon a handy little sticker like that if he could help it maybe someone had interrupted him or maybe he had a large supply of halfinch wood chisels and could afford to leave the odd one lying around carelessly in someones back anyway i didnt really want it i had my own not m chisel but a knife i eased it out of the plastic sheath that had been sewn into the inner lining of my coat just behind the neck it didnt look so much a fourinch handle and a little doubleedged threeinch blade but that little blade could slice through a twoinch manila with one gentle stroke and the point was the point of a lancet i looked at it and looked at the inner door behind die radio table the one that led to the radiooperators sleeping cabin then i slid a little fountainpen torch from my breast pocket crossed to the outer door switched off the overhead lamp did the same for the table lamp and stood there waiting how long i stood there i couldnt be sure maybe two minutes maybe as long as five why waited i dont know i told myself i was waiting until my eyes became adjusted to the almost total darkness inside the cabin but i knew it wasnt that maybe i was waiting for some noise the slightest imagined whisper of stealthy sound maybe i was waiting for something anything to happen or maybe i was just scared to go through that inner door scared for myself perhaps i was i couldnt be sure or perhaps i was scared of what i would find behind that door i transferred the knife to my left hand im righthanded but ambidextrous in some things and slowly closed my fingers round the handle of the inner door it took me all of twenty seconds to open that door the twelve inches that was necessary for me to squeeze through the opening in the very last halfinch the damned hinges creaked it was a tiny sound a sound you wouldnt normally have heard two yards away with my steeltaut nerves in the state they were in a sixinch naval gun going off in my ear would have sounded muffled by contrast i stood petrified as any graven image the dead man by my side was no more immobile than i i could hear the thump of my accelerating heartbeat and savagely wished the damned thing would keep quiet if there was anyone inside waiting to flash a torch in my face and shoot me knife me or do a little fancy carving up with a chisel he was taking his time about it i treated my lungs to a little oxygen stepped soundlessly and sideways through the opening i held the flash at the full outstretch extent of my right arm if the ungodly are going to shoot at a person who is shining a torch at them they generally aim in the very close vicinity of the torch as the unwary habitually hold a torch in front of them this as i had learnt many years previously from a colleague whod just had a bullet extracted from the lobe of his left lung because of this very unwariness was a very unwise thing to do so i held the torch as far from my body as possible drew my left arm back with the knife ready to go hoping fervently that the reactions of any person who might be in that cabin were slower than mine and slid forward the switch of the torch there was someone there all right but i didnt have to worry about his reactions not any more hed none left he was lying face down on the bunk with that huddled shapeless look that belongs only to the dead i made a quick traverse of the cabin with the pencil beam the dead man was alone as in the radio cabin there was no sign of a struggle i didnt even have to touch him to ascertain the cause of death the amount of blood that had seeped from that halfinch incision in his spine wouldnt have filled a teaspoon i wouldnt have expected to find more when the spinal column has been neatly severed the heart doesnt go on pumping long enough to matter a damn there would have been a little more internal bleeding but not much the curtains were drawn i quartered every foot of the deck bulkheads and furniture with my flash i dont know what i expected to find what i found was nothing i went out closed the door behind me and searched the radio cabin with the same results there was nothing more for me here i had found all i wanted to find all i had never wanted to find and i never once looked at the faces of the two dead men i didnt have to they were faces i knew as well as the face that looked back at me every morning out of my shaving mirror seven days previously they had dined with me and our chief in our favourite pub in london and they had been as cheerful and relaxed as men in their profession can ever be their normal still watchfulness overlaid by the momentary savouring of the lighter side of life they knew could never really be for them and i had no doubt they had gone on being as still and watchful as ever but they hadnt been watchful enough and now they were only still what had happened to them was what inevitably happened to people in our trade which would inevitably happen to myself when the time came no matter how clever and strong and ruthless you were sooner or later you would meet up with someone who was cleverer and stronger and more ruthless than yourself and that someone would have a halfinch wood chisel in his band and all your hardly won years of experience and knowledge and cunning counted for nothing for you never saw him coming and you never saw him coming because you had met your match at last and then you were dead and i had sent them to their deaths not willingly not knowingly but the ultimate responsibility had been mine this had all been my idea my brainchild and mine alone and id overridden all objections and fasttalked our very doubtful and highly sceptical chief into giving if not his enthusiastic approval at least his grudging consent id told the two men baker and delmont that if they played it my way no harm would come to them so theyd trusted me blindly and played it my way and now they lay dead beside me no hesitation gentlemen put your faith in me only see to it that you make your wills first of all there was nothing more to be done here now id sent two men to their deaths and that couldnt be undone it was time to be gone i opened that outer door the way youd open the door to a cellar you knew to be full of cobras and black widow spiders the way you would open the door that is were cobras and black widow spiders all i had to contend with aboard that ship id have gone through that door without a second thought they were harmless and almost lovable little creatures compared to some specimens of homo sapiens that were loose on the decks of the freighter nantesville that night with the door opened at its fullest extent i just stood there i stood there for a long time without moving a muscle of body or limbs breathing shallowly and evenly and when you stand like that even a minute seems half a lifetime all my being was in my ears i just stood there and listened i could hear die slap of waves against the hull the occasional low metallic rumble as the nantesville worked against wind and tide on its moorings the low moan of the strengthening night wind in the rigging and once the faroff lonely call of a curlew lonesome sounds safe sounds sounds of the night and nature not the sounds i was listening for gradually these sounds too became part of the silence foreign sounds sounds of stealth and menace and danger there were none no sound of breathing no slightest scrape of feet on steel decks no rustle of clothing nothing if there was anyone waiting out there he was possessed of a patience and immobility that was superhuman and i wasnt worried about superhumans that night just about humans humans with knives and guns and chisels in their hands silently i stepped out over the storm sill ive never paddled along the nighttime orinoco in a dugout canoe and had a thirtyfoot anaconda drop from a tree wrap a coil around my neck and start constricting me to death and whats more i dont have to go there now to describe the experience for i know exactly what it feels like the sheer animal power the feral ferocity of the pair of huge hands that closed round my neck from behind was terrifying something id never known of never dreamed of after the first moment of blind panic and shocked paralysis there was only one thought in my mind it comes to us all and now it has come to me someone who is cleverer and stronger and more ruthless than i am i lashed back with all the power of my right foot but the man behind me knew every rule in the book his own right foot traveling with even more speed and power than mine smashed into the back of my swinging kg it wasnt a man behind me it was a centaur and he was shod with the biggest set of horseshoes id ever come across my leg didnt just feel as if it had been broken it felt as if it had been cut in half i felt his left toe behind my left foot and stamped on it with every vicious ounce of power left me but when my foot came down his toe wasnt there any more all i had on my feet was a pair of thin rubber swimming moccasins and the agonising jar from the steel deck plates shot clear to the top of my head i reached up my hands to break his little fingers but he knew all about that too for his hands were clenched into ironhard balls with the second knuckle grinding into the carotid artery i wasnt the first man hed strangled and unless i did something pretty quickly i wasnt going to be the last either in my ears i could hear the hiss of compressed air escaping under high pressure and behind my eyes the shooting lines and flashes of colour were deepening and brightening by the moment what saved me in those first few seconds were he folded hood and thick rubberised canvas neck ruff of the scuba suit i was wearing under my coat but it wasnt going to save me many seconds longer the lifes ambition of the character behind me seemed to be to make his knuckles meet in the middle of my neck with the progress he was making that wouldnt take him too long he was halfway there already i bent forward in a convulsive jerk half of his weight came on my back that throttling grip not easing a fraction and at the same time he moved his feet as far backwards as possible the instinctive reaction to my move he would have thought that i was making a grab for one of his legs when i had him momentarily offbalance i swung round in a short arc till both our backs were towards the sea i thrust backwards with all my strength one two three steps accelerating all the way the nantesville didnt boast of any fancy teak guardrails just smallsection chain and the small of the stranglers back took our combined charging weights on the top chain if id taken that impact id have broken my back or slipped enough discs to keep an orthopaedic surgeon in steady employment for months but no shouts of agony from this lad no gasps even not a whisper of sound maybe he was a deaf mute id heard of several deaf mutes possessed of this phenomenal strength part of natures compensatory process i suppose but hed been forced to break his grip to grab swiftly at the tipper chain to save us both from toppling over the side into the cold dark waters of loch houron i thrust myself away and spun round to face him my back against the radio office bulkhead i needed that bulkhead too any support while my swimming head cleared and a semblance of life came back into my numbed right leg i could see him now as he straightened up from the guardrail not clearly it was too dark for that but i could see the white blur of face and hands and the general outline of his body id expected some towering giant of a man but he was no giant unless my eyes werent focusing properly which was likely enough from what i could see in the gloom he seemed a compact and well enough made figure but that was all he wasnt even as big as i was not that that meant a thing george hackenschmidt was a mere five foot nine and a paltry fourteen stone when he used to throw the terrible turk through the air like a football and prance around the training ring with eight hundred pounds of cement strapped to his back just to keep him in trim i had no compunction or false pride about running from a smaller man and as far as this character was concerned the farther and faster the better but not yet my right leg wasnt up to it i reached my hand behind my neck and brought the knife down holding it in front of me the blade in the palm of my hand so that he couldnt see the sheen of steel in the faint starlight he came at me calmly and purposefully like a man who knew exactly what he intended to do and was in no doubt at all as to the outcome of his intended action god knows i didnt doubt he had reason enough for his confidence he came at me sideways so that my foot couldnt damage him with his right hand extended at the full stretch of his arm a one track mind he was going for my throat again i waited till his hand was inches from my face then jerked my own right hand violently upwards our hands smacked solidly together as die blade sliced cleanly through the centre of his palm he wasnt a deaf mute after all three short unprintable words an unjustified slur on my ancestry and he stepped quickly backwards rubbed the back and front of his hand against his clothes then licked it in a queer animallike gesture he peered closely at the blood black as ink in the starlight welling from both sides of his hand so the little man has a little knife has he he said softly the voice was a shock with this cavemanlike strength id have expected a cavemanlike intelligence and voice to match but the words came in the calm pleasant cultured almost accentless speech of the welleducated southern englishman we shall have to take the little knife from him shant we he raised his voice captain imrie at least thats what the name sounded like be quiet you fool the urgent irate voice came from the direction of the crew accommodation aft do you want to dont worry captain the eyes didnt leave me i have him here by the wireless office hes armed a knife im just going to take it away from him you have him you have him good good good it was the kind of a voice a man uses when hes smacking his lips and rubbing his hands together it was also the kind of voice that a german or austrian uses when he speaks english the short guttural gutwas unmistakable be careful this one i want alive jacques henry kramer all of you quickly the bridge wireless office alive the man opposite me said pleasantly can also mean not quite dead he sucked some more blood from the palm of his hand or will you hand over the knife quietly and peaceably i would suggest i didnt wait for more this was an old technique you talked to an opponent who courteously waited to hear you out not appreciating that halfway through some wellturned phrase you were going to shoot him through the middle when lulled into a sense of temporary false security he least expected it not quite cricket but effective and i wasnt going to wait until it took effect on me i didnt know how he was coming at me but i guessed it would be a dive either head or feet first and that if he got me down on the deck i wouldnt be getting up again not without assistance i took a quick step forward flashed my torch a foot from his face saw the dazzled eyes screw shut for the only fraction of time id ever have and kicked him it wasnt as hard as it might have been owing to the fact that my right leg still felt as if it were broken nor as accurate because of the darkness but it was a pretty creditable effort in the circumstances and it should have left him rolling and writhing about the deck whooping in agony instead he just stood there unable to move bent forward and clutching himself with his hands he was more than human all right i could see the sheen of his eyes but i couldnt see the expression in them which was just as well as i dont think i would have cared for it very much i left i remembered a gorilla id once seen in basle zoo a big black monster who used to twist heavy truck tyres into figures of eight for light exercise id as soon have stepped inside that cage as stay around that deck when this lad became more like his old self again i hobbled forward round the corner of the radio office climbed up a liferaft and stretched myself flat on the deck the nearest running figures some with torches were already at the foot of the companionway leading up to the bridge i had to get right aft to the rope with the rubbercovered hook id swung up to swarm aboard but i couldnt do it until the midship decks were clear and then suddenly i couldnt do it all now that the need for secrecy and stealth was over someone had switched on the cargo loading lights and the midships and foredecks were bathed in a brilliant dazzle of white one of the foredeck arc lamps was on a jumbo mast just forard of and well above where i was lying i felt as exposed as a fly pinned to a white ceiling i flattened myself on that deck as if i were trying to push myself through it they were up the companion way and by the radio office now i heard the sudden exclamations and curses and knew theyd found the hurt man i didnt hear his voice so i assumed he wasnt able to speak yet the curt authoritative germanaccented voice took command you cackle like a flock of hens be silent jacques you have your machinepistol i have my pistol captain jacques had the quiet competent sort of voice that i would have found reassuring in certain circumstances but didnt very much care for in the present ones go aft stand at the entrance to the saloon and face forard cover the midships decks we will go to the focsle and then come aft in line abreast and drive him to you if he doesnt surrender to you shoot him through the legs i want him alive god this was worse than the peacemaker colt at least that fired only one shot at a time id no idea what kind of machinepistol jacques had probably it fired bursts of a dozen or more i could feel my right thigh muscle begin to stiffen again it was becoming almost a reflex action now and if he jumps over the side sir do i have to tell you jacques no sir i was just as clever as jacques was he didnt have to tell me either that nasty dry taste was back in my throat and mouth again id a minute left no more and then it would be too late i slid silently to the side of the radio office roof the starboard side the side remote from the spot where captain imrie was issuing curt instructions to his men lowered myself soundlessly to the deck and made my way to the wheelhouse i didnt need my torch in there the backwash of light from the big arclamps gave me all the illumination i wanted crouching down to keep below window level i looked around and saw what i wanted right away a metal box of distress flares two quick flicks of the knife severed the lashings that secured the flarebox to the deck one piece of rope perhaps ten feet in all i left secured to a handle of the box i pulled a plastic bag from the pocket of my coat tore off the coat and the yachtsmans rubber trousers that i was wearing over my scuba suit stuffed them inside and secured the bag to my waist the coat and trousers had been essential a figure in a dripping rubber diving suit walking across the decks of the nantesville would hardly have been likely to escape comment whereas in the dusk and with the outer clothing i had on i could have passed for a crewman and indeed had done so twice at a distance equally important when id left the port of torbay in my rubber dinghy it had been broad daylight and the sight of a scubaclad figure putting to sea towards evening wouldnt have escaped comment either as the curiosity factor of the inhabitants of the smaller ports of the western highlands and islands did not i had discovered jag noticeably behind that of their mainland brethren some would put it even more strongly than that still crouching low i moved out through the wheelhouse door on to the starboard wing of the bridge i reached the outer end and stood up straight i had to i had to take the risk it was now or never at all i could hear the crew already beginning to move forward to start their search i lifted the flare box over the side eased it down the full length of the rope and started to swing it slowly gently from side to side like a leadsman preparing to cast his lead the box weighed at least forty pounds but i barely noticed the weight the pendulum arc increased with every swing i made it had reached an angle of about fortyfive degrees on each swing now pretty close to the maximum i could get and both time and my luck must be running out i felt about as conspicuous as a trapese artist under a dozen spotlights and just about as vulnerable too as the box swung aft on its last arc i gave the rope a final thrust to achieve all the distance and momentum i could opened my hands at the extremity of the arc and dropped down behind the canvas winddodger it was as i dropped that i remembered i hadnt holed the damned box i had no idea whether it would float or sink but i did have a very clear idea of what would happen to me if it didnt sink one thing for sure it was too late to worry about it now i heard a shout come from the main deck some twenty or thirty feet aft of the bridge i was certain i had been seen but i hadnt a second after the shout came a loud and very satisfactory splash and a voice i recognised as jacquess shouting hes gone over the side starboard abaft the bridge a torch quick he must have been walking aft as ordered seen this dark bhir falling heard the splash and come on the inevitable conclusion a dangerous customer who thought fast was jacques in three seconds hed told his mates all they required to know what had happened where and what he wanted done as the necessary preliminary to shooting me full of holes the men who had been moving forward to start the sweep for me now came running aft pounding along the deck directly beneath where i was crouching on the wing of the bridge can you see him jacques captain imries voice very quick very calm not yet sir hell be up soon i wished he wouldnt sound so damned confident a dive like that must have knocked most of the breath out of him kramer two men and into the boat take lamps and circle around henry the box of grenades carlo the bridge quick starboard searchlight id never thought of the boat that was bad enough but the grenades i felt chilled i knew what an underwater explosion even a small explosion can do to the human body it was twenty times as deadly as the same explosion on land and i had to i just had to be in that water in minutes but at least i could do something about that searchlight it was only two feet above my head i had the power cable in my left hand the knife in my right and had just brought the two into contact when my mind stopped thinking about those damned grenades and started working again cutting that cable would be about as clever as leaning over the winddodger and yelling here i am come and catch me a dead giveaway that i was still on board clobbering carlo from behind as he came up the ladder would have the same effect and i couldnt fool them twice not people like these hobbling as fast as i could i passed through the wheelhouse on to the port wing slid down the ladder and ran towards the forepeak the foredeck was deserted i heard a shout and the harsh chatter ofsome automatic weapon jacques and his machinepistol for a certainty had he imagined hed seen something had the box come to the surface had he actually seen the box and mistaken it for me in the dark waters it must have been the last of these he wouldnt have wasted ammunition on anything hed definitely recognised as a box whatever the reason it had all my blessing if they thought i was floundering about down there riddled like a gruyere cheese then they wouldnt be looking for me up here they had the port anchor down i swung over the side on a rope got my feet in the hawsepipe reached down and grabbed the chain the international athletics board should have had their stopwatches on me that night i must have set a new world record for shinning down anchor chains the water was cold but my exposure suit took care of that it was choppy with a heavy tide running both of which suited me well i swam downthe port side of the nantesville underwater for ninety per cent of the time and i saw no one and no one saw me all the activity was on the starboard side of the vessel my aqualung unit and weights and flippers were where i had left them tied to the top of the rudder post the nantesville was not much more than halfway down to her marks and the top of the post not far under water fining on an aqualung in choppy seas with a heavy tide running isnt the easiest of tasks but the thought of kramer and his grenades was a considerable help besides i was in a hurry to be gone for had a long way to go and many things to do when i arrived at my destination i could hear the engine note of the lifeboat rising and falling as it circled off the ships starboard side but at no time did it come within a hundred feet of me no more shots were fired and captain imrie had obviously decided against using the grenades i adjusted the weights round my waist dropped down into the dark safety of the waters checked my direction on my luminous wrist compass and started to swim after five minutes i came to the surface and after another five felt my feet ground on the shore of the rocky islet where id cached my rubber dinghy i clambered up on the rocks and looked back the nantesville was ablaze with light a searchlight was shining down into the sea and the lifeboat still circling around i could hear the steady clanking of the anchor being weighed i hauled the dinghy into the water climbed in unshipped the two stubby oars and paddled off to the southwest i was still within effective range of the searchlight but its chances of picking up a blackclad figure in a lowsilhouette black dinghy on those black waters were remote indeed after a mile i shipped the oars and started up the outboard or tried to start it up outboards always work perfectly for me except when im cold wet and exhausted whenever i really need them they never work so i took to the stubby oars again and rowed and rowed and rowed but not for what seemed any longer than a month i arrived back at the firecrest at ten to three in the morning two tuesday am dawn calvert hunsletts voice was a barely audible murmur in the darkness yes standing there above me on the firecrests deck he was more imagined than seen against the blackness of the night sky heavy clouds had rolled in from the southwest and the last of the stars were gone big heavy drops of cold rain were beginning to spatter off the surface of the sea give me a hand to get the dinghy aboard how did it go later this first i climbed up the accommodation ladder painter in hand i had to lift my right leg over the gunwale stiff and numb and just beginning to ache again it could barely take my weight and hurry we can expect company soon so thats the way of it hunslett said thoughtfully uncle arthur will be pleased about this i said nothing to that our employer rearadmiral sir arthur arnfordjason kcb and most of the rest of the alphabet wasnt going to be pleased at all we heaved the dripping dinghy inboard undamped the outboard and took them both on to the foredeck get me a couple of waterproof bags i said then start getting the anchor chain in keep it quiet leave the brake pawl off and use a tarpaulin were leaving we would if we had any sense were staying just get the anchor up and down by the time hed returned with the bags id the dinghy deflated and in its canvas cover i stripped off my aqualung and scuba suit and stuffed them into one of the bags along with the weights my bigdialled waterproof watch and the combined wristcompass and depthgauge i put the outboard in the other bag restraining the impulse just to throw the damn thing overboard an outboard motor was a harmless enough object to have aboard any boat but we already had one attached to the wooden dinghy hanging from the davits over the stern hunslett had the electric windlass going and the chain coming in steadily an electric windlass is in itself a pretty noiseless machine when weighing anchor all the racket comes from four sources the chain passing through the hawsepipe the clacking of the brake pawl over the successive stops the links passing over the drum itself and the clattering of the chain as it falls into the chain locker about the first of these we could do nothing but with the brake pawl off and a heavy tarpaulin smothering the sound from the drum and chain locker the noise level was surprisingly low sound travels far over the surface of the sea but the nearest anchored boats were almost two hundred yards away we had no craving for the company of other boats to harbour at two hundred yards in torbay we felt ourselves uncomfortably close but the seabed shelved fairly steeply away from the little town and our present depth of twenty fathoms was the safe maximum for the sixty fathoms of chain we carried i heard the click as hunslets foot stepped on the deckswitch shes up and down put the pawl in for a moment if that drum slips ill have no hands left t pulled the bags right forard leaned out under the pulpit raft and used lengths of heaving line to secure them to the anchor chain when the lines were secure i lifted the bags over the side and let them dangle from the chain ill take the weight i said lift the chain off the drum well lower it by hand forty fathoms is feet of chain and letting that lot down to the bottom didnt do my back or arms much good at all and the rest of me was a long way below par before we started i was pretty close to exhaustion from the nights work my neck ached fiercely my leg only badly and i was shivering violently i know of various ways of achieving a warm rosy glow but wearing only a set of underclothes in the middle of a cold wet and windy autumn night in the western isles is not one of them but at last the job was done and we were able to go below if anyone wanted to investigate what lay at the foot of our anchor chain hed need a steel articulated diving suit hunslett pulled the saloon door to behind us moved around in the darkness adjusting the heavy velvet curtains then switched on a small table lamp it didnt give much light but we knew from experience that it didnt show up through the velvet and advertising the fact that we were up and around in the middle of die night was the last thing i wanted to do hunslett had a dark narrow saturnine face with a strong jaw black bushy eyebrows and thick black hair the kind of face which is so essentially an expression in itself that it rarely shows much else it was expressionless now and very still youll have to buy another shirt he said your collars too tight leaves marks i stopped towelling myself and looked in a mirror even in that dim light my neck looked a mess it was badly swollen and discoloured with four wickedlooking bruises where the thumbs and forefinger joints had sunk deep into the flesh blue and green and purple they were and they looked as if they would be there for a long time to come he got me from behind hes wasting his time being a criminal hed sweep the board at the olympic weightlifting i was lucky he also wears heavy boots i twisted around and looked down at my right calf the bruise was bigger than my fist and if it missed out any of the colours of the rainbow i couldnt offhand think which one there was a deep red gash across the middle of it and blood was ebbing slowly along its entire length hunslett gazed at it with interest if you hadnt been wearing that tight scuba suit youd have most like bled to death i better fix that for you i dont need bandages what i need is a scotch stop wasting your time oh hell sorry yes youd better fix it we cant have our guests sloshing about ankle deep in blood youre very sure were going to have guests i half expected to have them waiting on the doorstep when i got back to the firecrest were going to have guests all right whatever our pals aboard the nantesville may be theyre no fools theyll have figured out by this time that i could have approached only by dinghy theyll know damn well that it was no noseyparker local prowling about the ship local lads in search of a bit of fun dont go aboard anchored ships in the first place in the second place the locals wouldnt go near beul nan uamh the mouth of the grave in daylight far less at night time even the pilot says the place has an evil reputation and in the third place no local lad would get aboard as i did behave aboard as i did or leave as i did the local lad would be dead i shouldnt wonder and so were not locals were visitors we wouldnt be staying at any hotel or boardinghouse too restricted couldnt move almost certainly well have a boat now where would our boat be not to the north of loch hourort for with a forecast promising a southwest force strengthening to force no boat is going to be daft enough to hang about a lee shore in that lot the only holding ground and shallow enough sheltered anchorage in the other direction down the sound for forty miles is in torbay and thats only four or five miles from where the nantesville was lying at the mouth of loch houron where would you look for us id look for a boat anchored in torbay which gun do you want i dont want any gun you dont want any gun people like us dont carry guns marine biologists dont carry guns he nodded employees of the ministry of agriculture and fisheries dont carry guns civil servants are above reproach so we play it clever youre the boss i dont feel clever any more and ill take long odds that im not your boss any more not after uncle arthur hears what i have to tell him you havent told me anything yet he finished tying the bandage round my leg and straightened hows that feel i tried it better thanks better still when youve taken the cork from that bottle get into pyjamas or something people found fully dressed in the middle of the night cause eyebrows to go up i towelled my head as vigorously as my tired arms would let me one wet hair on my head and eyebrows wouldnt just be lifting theyd be disappearing into hairlines there isnt much to tell and all of it is bad he poured me a large drink a smaller one for himself and added water to both it tasted the way scotch always does after youve swum and rowed for hours and damn near got yourself killed in the process i got there without trouble i hid behind carrara point till it was dusk and then paddled out to the bogha nuadh i left the dinghy there and swam underwater as far as the stern of the ship it was the nantesville all right name and flag were different a mast was gone and the white superstructure was now stone but it was her all right near as dammit didnt make it it was close to the turn of the tide but it took me thirty minutes against that current must be wicked at the full flood or ebb they say its the worst on the west coast worse even than coirebhreachan id rather not be the one to find out i had to hang on to the stern post for ten minutes before id got enough strength back to shin up that rope you took a chance it was near enough dark besides i added bitterly there are some precautions intelligent people dont think to take about crazy ones there were only two or three people in the after accommodation just a skeleton crew aboard seven or eight no more all the original crew have vanished completely no sign of them anywhere no sign dead or alive no sign at all i had a bit of bad luck i was leaving the after accommodation to go to the bridge when i passed someone a few feet away i gave a half wave and grunted something and he answered back i dont know what i followed him back to the quarters he picked up a phone in the crews mess and i heard him talking to someone quick and urgent said that one of the original crew must have been hiding and was trying to get away i couldnt stop him he faced the door as he was talking and he had a gun in his hand i had to move quickly i walked to the bridge structure you what when you knew they were on to you mr calvert you want your bloody head examined uncle arthur will put it less kindly it was the only chance id ever have besides if they thought it was only a terrified member of the original crew they wouldnt have been so worried if this guy had seen me walking around dripping wet in a scuba suit hed have turned me into a colander he wasnt sure on the way forard i passed another bloke without incident hed left the bridge superstructure before the alarm had been given i suppose i didnt stop at the bridge i went right forard and hid behind the winchmans shelter for about ten minutes there was a fair bit of commotion and a lot of flashlight work around the bridge island then i saw and heard them moving aft must have thought i was still in the after accommodation i went through all the officers cabins in the bridge island no one one cabin an engineers i think had smashed furniture and a carpet heavily stained with dry blood next door the captains bunk had been saturated with blood theyd been warned to offer no resistance i know then i found baker and delmont so you found them baker and delmont hunsletts eyes were hooded gazing down at the glass in his hand i wished to god hed show some expression on that dark face of his delmont must have made a lastsecond attempt to send a call for help theyd been warned not to except in emergency so they must have been discovered hed been stabbed in the back with a halfinch wood chisel and then dragged into the radio officers cabin which adjoined the radio office some time later baker had come in he was wearing an officers clothes some desperate attempt to disguise himself i suppose hed a gun in his hand but he was looking the wrong way and the gun was pointing the wrong way the same chisel in the back hunslett poured himself another drink a much larger one hunslett hardly ever drank he swallowed half of it in one gulp he said and they hadnt all gone aft theyd left a reception committee theyre very clever theyre very dangerous maybe weve moved out of our class or i have a oneman reception committee but when that one man was this man two would have been superfluous i know he killed baker and delmont ill never be so lucky again you got away your luck hadnt run out and bakers and delmons had i knew he was blaming me i knew london would blame me i blamed myself i hadnt much option there was no one else to blame uncle arthur hunslett said dont you think the hell with uncle arthur who cares about uncle arthur how in gods name do you think i feel i felt savage and i know i sounded it for the first time a flicker of expression showed on hunsletts face i wasnt supposed to have any feelings not that he said about the nantesville now that shes been identified as the nantesville now we know her new name and flag what were they by the way alta fjord norwegian it doesnt matter it does matter we radio uncle arthur and have our guests find us in the engineroom with earphones round our heads are you mad you seem damned sure theyll come i am sure you too you said so i agreed this is where they would come if they come if they come if they come good god man for all that they know i was aboard that ship for hours i may have the names and full descriptions of all of them as k happens i couldnt identify any of them and their names may or may not mean anything but theyre not to know that for all they know im on the blower right now bawling out descriptions to interpol the chances are at least even that some of them are on file theyre too good to be little men some must be known in that case theyd be too late anyway the damage would be done not without the sole witness who could testify against them i think wed better have those guns out no you dont blame me for trying no baker and delmont think of them im thinking of nothing else but them you dont have to stay he set his glass down very carefully he was really letting himself go tonight hed allowed that dark craggy face its second expression in ten minutes and it wasnt a very encouraging one then he picked up his glass and grinned you dont know what youre saying he said kindly your neck thats what comes from the blood supply to the brain being interrupted youre not fit to fight off a teddybear whos going to look after you if they start playing games im sorry i said i meant it id worked with hunslett maybe ten times in the ten years id known him and it had been a stupid thing for me to say about the only thing hunslett was incapable of was leaving your side in time of trouble you were speaking of uncle yes we know where the nantesville is uncle could get a navy boat to shadow her by radar if i know where she was she upped anchor as i left by dawn shell be a hundred miles away in any direction shes gone weve scared them off theyre going to jove this he sot down heavily then looked at me but we have her new description i said that didnt matter by tomorrow shell have another description the hokomaru from yokohama with green topsides japanese flag different masts an air search we could by the time an air search could be organised theyd have twenty thousand square miles of sea to cover youve heard the forecast its bad low cloud and theyd have to fly under the low cloud cuts their effectiveness by ninety per cent and poor visibility and rain not a chance in a hundred not one in a thousand of positive identification and if they do locate them if what then a friendly wave from the pilot not much else he can do the navy they could call up the navy call up what navy from the med or the far east the navy has very few ships left and practically none in those parts by the time any naval vessel could get to the scene it would be night again and the nantesville to hell and gone even if a naval ship did catch up with it what then sink it with gunfire with maybe the twentyfive missing crew members of the nantesville locked up in the hold a boarding party with the same twentyfive excrew members lined up on deck with pistols at their backs and captain imrie and his thugs politely asking the navy boys what their next move was going to be ill get into my pyjamas hunslett said tiredly at the doorway he paused and turned if the nantesville had gone her crew the new crew have gone too and well be having no visitors after all had you thought of that no i dont really believe it either they came at twenty past four in the morning they came in a very calm and orderly and lawabiding and official fashion they stayed for forty minutes and by the time they had left i still wasnt sure whether they were our men or not hunslett came into my small cabin starboard side forward switched on the light and shook me wake up he said loudly come on wake up i was wide awake i hadnt closed an eye since id lain down i groaned and yawned a bit without overdoing it then opened a bleary eye there was no one behind him what is it what do you want a pause what the hells up its just after four in the morning dont ask me whats up hunslett said irritably police just come aboard they say its urgent police did you say police yes come on now theyre waiting police aboard our boat what oh for gods sake how many more nightcaps did you have last night after i went to bed police two of them and two customs ifs urgent they say it better bloody well be urgent in the middle ofthe bloody night who do they think we are escaped train robbers havent you told them who we are oh all right all right all right im coming hunslett left and thirty seconds afterwards i joined him in the saloon four men sat there two police officers and two customs officials they didnt look a very villainous bunch to me the older bigger policeman got to his feet a tall burly brownfaced sergeant in his late forties he looked me over with a cold eye looked at the nearempty whisky bottle with the two unwashed glasses on the table then looked back at me he didnt like wealthy yachtsmen he didnt like wealthy yachtsmen who drank too much at nighttime and were blearyeyed bloodshot and touslehaired at the following crack of dawn he didnt like wealthy effete yachtsmen who wore red silk dragon chinese dressinggowns with a paisley scarf to match tied negligently round the neck i didnt like them very much myself especially the paisley scarf much in favour though it was with the yachting fraternity but i had to have something to conceal those bruises on my neck are you the owner of this boat sir the sergeant inquired an unmistakable west highland voice and a courteous one but it took him all his time to get his tongue round the sir if you would tell me what makes it any of your damn business i said unpleasantly maybe ill answer that and maybe i wont a private boat is the same as a private house sergeant you have to have a warrant before you shove your way in or dont you know the law he knows the law one of the customs men put in a small dark character smoothshaven at four in the morning with a persuasive voice not west highland be reasonable this is not the sergeants job we got him out of bed almost three hours ago hes just obliging us i ignored him i said to the sergeant this is the middle of die night in a lonely scottish bay how would you fed if four unidentified men came aboard in the middle of the night i was taking a chance on that one but a fair chance if they were who i thought they might be and if i were who they thought i might be then id never talk like that but an innocent man would any means of identifying yourselves identifying myself the sergeant stared coldly at me i dont have to identify myself sergeant macdonald ive been in charge of the torbay police station for eight years ask any man in torbay they all know me if he was who he claimed to be this was probably the first time in his life that anyone had asked him for identification he nodded to the seated policeman policeconstable macdonald your son the resemblance was unmistakable nothing like keeping it in the family eh sergeant i didnt know whether to believe him or not but i felt id been an irate householder long enough a degree less truculence was in order and customs eh i know the law about you too no search warrants for you boys i believe the police would like your powers go anywhere you like and ask no ones permission beforehand thats it isnt it yes sir it was the younger customs man who answered medium height fair hair running a little to fat belfast accent dressed like the other in blue overcoat peaked hat brown gloves smartly creased trousers we hardly ever do though we prefer cooperation we like to ask and youd like to ask to search this boat is that it hunslett said yes sir why i asked puzzlement now in my voice and in my mind i just didnt know what i had on my hands if were all going to be so courteous and cooperative could we have any explanation no reason in the world why not sir the older customs man was almost apologetic a truck with contents valued at was hijacked on the ayrshire coast last night night before last that is now in the news this evening from information received we know it was transferred to a small boat we think it came north why sorry sir confidential this is the third port weve visited and the thirteenth boat the fourth hi torbay that weve been on an the past fifteen hours weve been kept on the run i can tell you an easy friendly voice a voice that said you dont really think we suspect you weve a job to do thats all and youre searching all boats that have come up from the south or you think have come from there fresh arrivals anyway has it occurred to you that any boat with hijacked goods on board wouldnt dare pass through the crinan canal once youre in there youre trapped for four hours so hed have to come round the mull of kintyre weve been here since this afternoon it would take a pretty fast boat to get up here in that time youve got a pretty fast boat here sir sergeant macdonald said i wondered how the hellthey managed it from the western isles tothe east london docks every sergeant in the country had the same wooden voice the same wooden face the same cold eye must be something to do with the uniform i ignored him what are we um supposed to have stolen chemicals it was an ici truck chemicals i looked at hunslett grinned then turned back to the customs officer chemicals eh were loaded with them but not worth im afraid there was a brief silence macdonald said would you mind explaining sir not at all i lit a cigarette the little mind enjoying its big moment and smiled this is a government boat sergeant macdonald i thought you would have seen the flag ministry of agriculture and fisheries were marine biologists our after cabin is a floating laboratory look at our library here two shelves loaded with technical tomes and if youve still any doubt left i can give you two numbers one hi glasgow one in london that will establish our bona fides or phone the lockmaster in the crinan seabasin we spent last night there yes sir the lack of impression i had made on the sergeant was total where did you go in your dinghy this evening i beg your pardon sergeant you were seen to leave this boat in a black rubber dinghy about five oclock this evening id heard of icy fingers playing up and down ones spine but it wasnt fingers i felt then it was a centipede with a hundred icy boots on you went out into the sound mr mcllroy the postmaster saw you i hate to impugn the character of a fellow civil servant but he must have been drunk funny how an icy feeling could make you sweat i havent got a black rubber dinghy ive never owned a black rubber dinghy you just get out your little magnifying glass sergeant and if you can find a black rubber dinghy ill make you a present of the brown wooden dinghy which is the only one we have on the firecrest the wooden expression cracked a little he wasnt so certain now so you werent out i was out in our own dinghy i was just round the comer of garve island there collecting some marine samples from the sound i can show them to you in the after cabin were not here on holiday you know no offence no offence i was a member of the working classes now not a plutocrat and he could afford to thaw a little mr mcllroys eyesight isnt what it was and everything looks black against the setting sun you dont look the type i must say whod land on the shores of the sound and bring down the telephone wires to the mainland the centipede started up again and broke into a fast gallop cut off from the mainland how very convenient for somebody i didnt spend any time wondering who had brought the wires down it had been no act of god i was sure of that did you mean what i thought you to mean sergeant i said slowly that you suspected me we cant take chances sir he was almost apologetic now not only was i a working man i was a man working for the government all men working for the government are ipso facto respectable and trustworthy citizens but you wont mind if we take a little look round the darkhaired customs officer was even more apologetic the lines are down and well you know his voice trailed off and he smiled if you were the hijackers i appreciate now that its a chance in a million but still and if we didnt search well wed be out of a job tomorrow just a formality i wouldnt want to see that happen mr ah thomas thank you your ships papers ah thank you he handed them to the younger man lets see now ah the wheelhouse could mr durran here use the wheelhouse to make copies wont take five minutes certainly wouldnt he be more comfortable here were modernised now sir portable photocopier standard on the job has to be dark wont take five minutes can we begin in this laboratory of yours a formality hed said well he was right there as a search it was the least informal thing id ever come across five minutes after hed gone to the wheelhouse durran came aft to join us and he and thomas went through the firecrest as if they were looking for the kohinoor to begin with at least every piece of mechanical and electrical equipment in the after cabin had to be explained to them they looked in every locker and cupboard they rummaged through the ropes and fenders in the large stem locker aft of the laboratory and i thanked god i hadnt followed my original idea of stowing the dinghy motor and scuba gear in there they even examined the after toilet as if id be careless enough to drop the kohinoor in there they spent most time of all in the engineroom it was worth examining everything looked brand new and gleamed two big hp diesels diesel generator radio generator hot and cold water pumps central heating plant big oi and water tanks and the two long rows of leadacid batteries thomas seemed especially interested in the batteries you carry a lot of reserve there mr petersen he said hed learnt my name by now even though it wasnt the one id been christened with why all the power we havent even got enough care to start those two engines by hand we have eight electric motors in the lab and the only time theyre used in harbour we cant run either the engines or generators to supply juice too much interference a constant drain i was ticking off my fingers then theres the central heating hot and cold water pumps radar radio automatic steering windlass power winch for the dinghy echosounder navigation lights you win you win hed become quite friendly by this time boats arent really in my line lets move forward shall we the remainder of the inspection curiously didnt take long in the saloon i found that hunslett had persuaded the torbay police force to accept the hospitality of the firecrest sergeant macdonald hadnt exactly become jovia but he was much more human than when hed come on board constable macdonald i noticed didnt seem so relaxed he looked positively glum maybe he didnt approve of his old man consorting with potential criminals if the examination of the saloon was cursory that of the two forward cabins was positively perfunctory back in the saloon i said sorry i was a bit short gentlemen i like my sleep a drink before you go well thomas smiled we dont want to be rude either thank you five minutes and they were gone thomas didnt even glance at the wheelhouse durran had been there of course he had a quick look at one of the deck lockers but didnt bother about the others we were in the clear a civil goodbye on both sides and they were gone their boat a big indeterminate shape in the darkness seemed to have plenty of power odd i said whats odd that boat any idea what h was like how could i hunslett was testy he was as short of sleep as i was it was pitch dark thats just the point a gentle glow in their wheelhouse you couldnt even see what that was like and no more no deck lights no interior lights no navigation lights even sergeant macdonald has been looking out over this harbour for eight years do you need light to find your way about your own livingroom after dark i havent got twenty yachts and cruisers in my livingroom swinging all over the place with wind and tide and wind and tide doesnt alter my own course when fm crossing my livingroom there are only three boats in the harbour carrying anchor lights hell have to use something to see where hes going and he did from the direction of the receding sound of engines a light stabbed out into the darkness a fiveinch searchlight i would have guessed it picked up a small yacht riding at anchor less than a hundred yards ahead of it altered to starboard picked up another altered to port then swung back on course again odd was the word you used hunslett murmured quite a good word too in the circumstances and what are we to think of the alleged torbay police force you talked to the sergeant longer than i did when i was aft with thomas and durran id like to think otherwise hunslett said inconsequentially it would make things easier in a way but i cant hes a genuine oldfashioned cop and a good one too ive met too many so have you a good cop and an honest one i agreed this is not his line of country and he was fooled it is our line of country and we were fooled until now that is speak for yourself thomas made one careless remark an offbeat remark you didnt hear it we were in the engineroom i shivered maybe it was the cold night wind it meant nothing not until i saw that they didnt want their boat recognised again he said boats arent really in my line probably thought hed been asking too many questions and wanted to reassure me boats not in his line a customs officer and boats not in his line they only spend their lives aboard boats examining boats thats all they spend their lives looking and poking in so many odd corners and quarters that they know more about boats than the designers themselves another thing did you notice how sharply dressed they were a credit to carnaby street customs officers dont usually go around in oilstained overalls theyve been living in those clothes for twentyfour hours this is the what the thirteenth boat theyve searched in that time would you still have knifeedged creases to your pants after that lot or would you say theyd only just taken them from the hangers and put hem on what else did they say what else did they do hunslett spoke so quietly that i could hear the note of the engines of the customs boat fall away sharply as their searchlight lit up the lowwater stone pier half a mile away take an undue interest in anything they took an undue interest in everything wait a minute though wait a minute thomas seemed particularly intrigued by the batteries by the large amount of reserve electrical power we had did he now did he indeed and did you notice how lightly our two customs friends swung aboard their launch when leaving theyll have done it a thousand times both of them had their hand a free they werent carrying anything they should have been carrying something the photocopier im getting old the photocopier standard equipment my ruddy foot so if our fairhaired pal wasnt busy photocopying he was busy doing something else we moved inside the wheelhouse hunslett selected the larger screwdriver from the toolrack beside the echosounder and had the faceplate off our rtd df set inside sixty seconds he looked at the interior for five seconds looked at me for the same length of time then started screwing the faceplate back into position one thing was certain we wouldnt be using that transmitter for a long time to come i turned away and stared out through the wheelhouse windows into the darkness the wind was still rising the black sea gleamed palely as the whitecaps came marching in from the southwest the firecrest snubbed sharply on her anchor chain and with the wind and the tide at variance she was beginning to corkscrew quite noticeably now i felt desperately tired but my eyes were stilt working hunslett offered me a cigarette i didnt want one but i took one who knew it might even help me to think and then i had caught his wrist and was staring down at his palm well well i said the cobbler should stick to his last he what wrong proverb cant think of the right one a good workman uses only his own tools our pal with the penchant for smashing valves and condensers should have remembered that no wonder my neck was twitching when durran was around how did you cut yourself i didnt cut myself i know but theres a smear of blood on your paten hes been taking lessons from peter sellers i shouldnt wonder standard southern english on the nantesville northern irish on the firecrest i wonder how many other accents he has up his sleeve behind his iarynx i should say and i thought he was running to a little fat hes running to a great deal of muscle you noticed he never took his gloves off even when he had that drink im the best noticer you ever saw beat me over the head with a club and ill notice anything he sounded bitter why didnt they clobber us you anyway the star witness maybe we have moved out of our class two reasons they couldnt do anything with the oops there genuine cops as weve both agreed not unless they attended to the cops too only a madman would deliberately kill a cop and whatever those boys may lack it isnt sanity but why cops in the first place aura of respectability cops are above suspicion when a uniformed policeman shoves his uniformed cap above your gunwale in the dark watches of the night you dont whack him over the head with a marlinespike you invite him aboard all others you might whack especially if we had the bad consciences we might have been supposed to have maybe its arguable and the second point they took a big chance a desperate chance almost with durran he was thrown to the wolves to see what the reaction would be whether either of us recognised him why durran i didnt tell you i shone a torch in his face the face didnt register just a white blur with screwedup eyes halfhidden behind an upflung hand i was really looking lower down picking the right spot to kick him but they werent to know that they wanted to find out if we would recognise him we didnt if we had done wed either have started throwing the crockery at him or yelped for the cops to arrest them if were against them then were with the cops but we didnt not a nicker of recognition nobodys as good as that i defy any man in the world to meet up again in the same night with a man who has murdered two other people and nearly murdered himself without at least twitching an eyebrow so the immediate heat is off the urgent necessity to do us in has become less urgent its a safe bet that if we didnt recognise durran then we recognised nobody on the nantesville and so we wont be burning up the lines to interpol were in the clear i wish to god we were theyre on to us but you said i dont know how i know i said irritably i know they went through the after end of the firecrest like a treble chance winner hunting for the coupon hes afraid hes forgotten to post then halfway through the engineroom search click just like that and they werent interested any more at least thomas wasnt hed found out something you saw him afterwards in the saloon the fore cabins and the upper deck he couldnt have cared less the batteries no he was satisfied with my explanation i could tell i dont know why i only know im sure so theyll be back theyll be back i get the guns out now theres no hurry our friends will be sure we cant communicate with anyone the mainland boat calls here only twice a week it came today and wont be back for four days the lines to the mainland are down and if i thought for a moment they would stay down i should be back in kindergarten our transmitter is out assuming there are no carrier pigeons in torbay whats the only remaining means of communication with the mainland theres the shangrila the shangrila the nearest craft to ours was white gleaming a hundred and twenty feet long and wouldnt have left her owner a handful of change from a quarter of a million pounds when hed bought her shell have a couple of thousand quids worth of radio equipment aboard then there are twos maybe three yachts big enough to carry transmitters the rest will carry only receivers if that and how many transmitters in torbay harbour will still be in operating condition tomorrow one one our friends will attend to the rest theyll have to we cant warn anyone we cant give ourselves away the insurance companies can stand it he glanced at his watch this would be a nice time to wake up uncle arthur i cant put it off any longer i wasnt looking forward to talking to uncle arthur hunslett reached for a heavy coat pulled h on made for the door and stopped i thought id take a walk on the upper deck while youre talking just in case a second thought id better have that gun now thomas said theyd already checked three boats in the harbour macdonald didnt contradict him so it was probably true maybe there are no serviceable transmitters left in torbay now maybe our friends just dumped the cops ashore and are corning straight back for us maybe but those yachts are smaller than the firecrest apart from us theres only one with a separate wheelhouse the others will carry transmitters in the saloon cabin lots of them sleep in their saloon cabins the owners would have to be banged on the head first before the radios could be attended to they couldnt do that with macdonald around youd bet your pension on that maybe macdonald didnt always go aboard ill never live to collect my pension but maybe youd better have that gun the firecrest was just over three years old the southampton boatyard and marineradio firm that had combined to build her had done so under conditions of sworn secrecy to a design provided by uncle arthur uncle arthur had not designed her himself although he had never said so to the few people who knew of the existence of the boat hed pinched the idea from a japanesedesigned indonesianowned fishing craft that had been picked up with engine failure off the malaysian coast only one engine had failed though two were installed but still she had been not under command an odd circumstance that had led the alert engineer lieutenant on the frigate that had picked her up to look pretty closely at her the net result of his investigation apart from giving this splendid inspiration to uncle arthur was that the crew still languished in a singapore prisoner of war camp the firecrests career had been chequered and inglorious she had cruised around the eastern baltic for some time without achieving anything until the authorities in memel and leningrad getting tired of the sight of her had declared the firecrest persona non grata and sent her back to england uncle arthur had been furious especially as he had to account to a parsimonious undersecretary for the considerable expense involved the waterguard had tried their hand with it at catching smugglers and returned it without thanks no smugglers now for the first time ever it was going to justify its existence and in other circumstances uncle arthur would have been delighted when he heard what i had to tell him he would have no difficulty in restraining his joy what made the firecrest unique was that while she bad two screws and two propeller shafts she had only one engine two engine casings but only one engine even although that one engine was a special job fitted with an underwater bypass exhaust valve a simple matter of disengaging the fuel pump coupling and unscrewing four bolts on top the rest were dummies enabled the entire head of the diesel starboard engine to be lifted clear away together with the fuel lines and injectors with the assistance of the seventy foot telescopic radio mast housed inside our aluminium foremast the huge gleaming transmitter that took up eighty per cent of the space inside the starboard engine casing could have sent a signal to the moon if need be as thomas had observed we had power and to spare as it happened i didnt want to send a signal to the moon just to uncle arthurs combinex office and home in knightsbridge the other twenty per cent of space was taken up with a motley collection of material that even the assistant commissioner in new scotland yard wouldnt have regarded without a thoughtful expression on his face there were some packages of prefabricated explosives with amatol primer and chemical detonator combined in one neat unit with a miniature timing device that ranged from five seconds to five minutes complete with sucker clamps there was a fine range of burglars housebreaking tools bunches of skeleton keys several highly sophisticated listening devices including one that could be shot from a verytype pistol several tubes of various harmlesslooking tablets which were alleged when dropped in some unsuspecting characters drink to induce unconsciousness for varying periods four pistols and a box of ammunition anyone who was going to use that lot in one operation was in for a busy time indeed two of the pistols were lugers two were german lilliputs the smallest really effective automatic pistol on the market the lilliput had the great advantage that it could be concealed practically anywhere on your person even upside down in a springloaded clip in your lower left sleeve if that was you didnt get your suits cut in carnaby street hunslett lifted one of the lugers from its clamp checked the loading indicator and left at once it wasnt that he was imagining that he could already hear stealthy footsteps on the upper deck he just didnt want to be around when uncle arthur came on the air i didnt blame him i didnt really want to be around then either i pulled out the two insulated rubber cables fitted the powerfully springloaded sawtoothed metal clamps on to the battery terminals hung on a pair of earphones turned on the set pulled another switch that actuated the callup and waited i didnt have to tune in the transmitter was permanently preset and preset on a vhf frequency that would have cost the licence of any ham operator who dared wander anywhere near it for transmission purposes the red receiver warning light came on i reached down and adjusted the magic eye control untilthe green fans met in the middle this is station spfx a voice came station spfx good morning this is caroline may i speak to the manager please will you wait please this meant that uncle arthur was in bed uncle arthur was never at his best on rising three minutes passed and the earphones came to life again good morning caroline this is annabelle good morning location you wouldnt find those references in any ordnance survey map there werent a dozen maps in existence with them but uncle arthur had one and so had i there was a pause then i have you caroline proceed i located the missing vessel this afternoon four or five miles northwest of here i went on board tonight you did what caroline went on board the old crew has gone home theres a new crew aboard a smaller crew you located betty and dorothy despite the fact that we both had scramblers fitted to our radio phones making intelligible eavesdropping impossible uncle arthur always insisted that we spoke in a roundabout riddle fashion and used code names for his employees and himself girls names for our surnames initials to match an irritating foible but one that we had to observe he was annabelle i was caroline baker was betty delmont dorothy and hunslett harriet it sounded like a series of caribbean hurricane warnings i found them i took a deep breath they wont be coming home again annabelle they wont be coming home again he repeated mechanically he was silent for so long that i began to think that he had gone off the air then he came again his voice empty remote i warned you of this caroline yes annabelle you warned me of this and the vessel gone gone where i dont know just gone north i suppose north you suppose uncle arthur never raised hfe voice when he went on it was as calm and impersonal as ever but the sudden disregard of his own rules about circumlocution betrayed the savage anger in his mind north where iceland a norwegian fjord to effect a transshipment of cargo anywhere in a million square miles between the midatlantic and the barents sea and you lost her after all the time the trouble the planning the expense youve lost her he might have spared me that bit about the planning it had been mine all the way and betty and dorothy the last words showed hed taken control of himself again yes annabelle ive lost her i could feel the slow anger in myself and theres worse than that if you want to listen to it im listening i told him the rest and at the end of the he said i see youve lost the vessel youve lost betty and dorothy and now our friends know about you the one vital element of secrecy is gone for ever and every usefulness and effectiveness you might ever have had is completely negated a pause shaft expect you in my office at nine pm tonight instruct harriet to take the boat back to base yes sir the hell with his annabelle i had expected that ive failed ive let you down im being pulled off nine oclock tonight caroline ill be waiting youll have a long wait annabelle and what might you mean by that if uncle arthur had had a low silky menacing voice then hed have spoken those words in a low silky menacing voice but he hadnt hed only this flat level monotone and it carried infinitely more weight and authority than any carefully modulated theatrical voice that had ever graced a stage there are no planes to this place annabelle the mailboat doesnt call for another four days the weathers breaking down and i wouldnt risk our boat to try to get to the mainland im stuck here for the time being im afraid do you take me for a nincompoop sir now he was at it go ashore this morning an airsea rescue helicopter will pick you up at noon nine pm at my office dont keep me waiting this then was it but one last try couldnt you give me another twentyfour hours annabelle now youre being ridiculous and wasting my time goodbye i beg of you sir id thought better of you than that goodbye goodbye we may meet again sometime its not likely goodbye i switched the radio off lit a cigarette and waited the callup came through in half a minute i waited another halfminute and switched on i was very calm the die was cast and i didnt give a damn caroline is that you caroline i could have sworn to a note of agitation in his voice this was something for the record books yes what did you say at the end there goodbye you said goodbye i said goodbye dont quibble with me sir you said if you want me aboard that helicopter i said youll have to send a guard with the pilot an armed guard i hope theyre good ive got a luger and you know im good and if i have to kill anyone and go into court then youll have to stand there beside me because theres no single civil action or criminal charge that even you with all your connections can bring against me that would justify the sending of armed men to apprehend me an innocent man further i am no longer in your employment the terms of my civil service contract state clearly that i can resign at any moment provided that i am not actively engaged on an operation at that moment youve pulled me off youve recalled me to london my resignation will be on your desk as soon as the mail can get through baker and delmont werent your friends they were my friends they were my friends ever since i joined the service you have the temerity to sit there and lay all the blame for their deaths on my shoulders when you know damn well that every operation must bave your final approval and now you have the final temerity to deny me a one last chance to square accounts im sick of your damned soulless service goodbye now wait a moment caroline there was a cautious almost placatory note to his voice no need to go off halfcocked i was sure that no one had ever talked to rearadmiral sir arthur arnfordjason like that before but he didnt seem particularly upset about it he had the cunning of a fox that infinitely agile and shrewd mind would be examining and discarding possibilities with the speed of a computer hed be wondering whether i was playing a game and if so how far he could play it with me without making it impossible for me to retreat from the edge of the precipice finally he said quietly you wouldnt want to hang around there just to shed tears youre on to something yes sir im on to something i wondered what in the name of god i was on to ill give you twentyfour hours caroline fortyeight fortyeight and then you return to london i have your word i promise and caroline sir i didnt care for your way of talking there i trust we never have a repetition of it no sir im sorry sir fortyeight hours report to me at noon and midnight a click uncle arthur was gone the false dawn was in the sky when i went on deck cold heavy slanting driving rain was churning up the foamflecked sea the firecrest pulling heavily on her anchor chain was swinging slowlythrough an arc of forty degrees corkscrewing quite heavily now on the outer arc of the swing pitching in the centre of them she was snubbing very heavily on the anchor and i wondered uneasily how long the lengths of heaving line securing the dinghy outboard and scuba gear to the chain could stand up to this sort of treatment hunslett was abaftthe saloon huddling in what little shelter it afforded he looked up at my approach and said what do you make of that he pointed to the palely gleaming shape of the shangrila one moment on our quarter the next dead astern as we swung on our anchor lights were burning brightly in the fore part of her superstructure where the wheelhouse would be someone with insomnia i said or checking to see if the anchor is dragging what do you think it is our recent guests laying about the shangrila radio installation with crowbars maybe they leave lights on all night came on just ten minutes ago and look now theyre out funny how did you get on with uncle badly fired me then changed his mind we have fortyeight hours fortyeight hours what are you going to do in fortyeight hours god knows have some sleep first you too too much light in the sky for callers now passing through the saloon hunslett said apropos of nothing ive been wondering what did you make of pc macdonald the young one what do you mean well glum downcast heavy weight on his shoulders maybe hes like me maybe he doesnt like getting up in the middle of the night maybe he has girl trouble and if he has i can tell you that pc macdonalds lovelife is the least of my concerns good night i should have listened to hunslett more for hunsletts sake three tuesday asn pm i need my sleep just like anyone else ten hours perhaps only eight and i would have been my own man again maybe not exuding brightness optimism and cheerfulness the circumstances werent right for that but at least a going concern alert perceptive my mind operating on what uncle arthur would be by now regarding as its customary abysmal level but still the best it could achieve but i wasnt given that ten hours nor even the eight exactly three hours after dropping off i was wide awake again well anyway awake i would have had to be stone deaf drugged or dead to go on sleeping through the bawling and thumping that was currently assailing my left ear from what appeared to be a distance of not more than twelve inches ahoy there firecrest ahoy there thump thump thump on the boats side can i come aboard ahoy there ahoy ahoy ahoy i cursed this nautical idiot from the depths of my sleepridden being swung a pair of unsteady legs to the deck and levered myself out of the bunk i almost fell down i seemed to have only one leg left and my neck ached fiercely a glance at the mirror gave quick external confirmation of my internal decrepitude a haggard unshaven face unnaturally pale and bleary bloodshot eyes with dark circles under them i looked away hurriedly there were lots of things i could put up with first thing in the morning but not sights like that i opened the door across the passage hunslett was sound asleep and snoring i returned to my own cabin and got busy with the dressinggown and paisley scarf again the ironlunged thumping character outside was still at it if i didnt hurry he would be roaring out a vast there any moment i combed my hair into some sort of order and made my way to die upper deck it was a cold wet and windy world a grey dreary unpleasant world why the hell couldnt they have let me sleep on the rain was coining down in slanting sheets bouncing inches high on the decks doubling the milkiness of the spumeflecked sea the lonely wind mourned through the rigging and the lower registers of sound and the steepsided windtruncated waves maybe three feet from tip to trough were high enough to make passage difficult if not dangerous for the average yacht tender they didnt make things in the slightest difficult or dangerous for the yacht tender that now lay alongside us it maybe wasnt as big it looked it at first sight as the firecrest but it was big enough to have a glassedin cabin forard a wheelhouse that bristled and gleamed with controls and instrumentation that would have been no disgrace to a vc and abaft that a sunken cockpit that could have sunbathed a football team without overcrowding there were three crewmen dressed in black oilskins and fancy french navy hats with black ribbons down the back two of them each with a boathook round one of the firecrests guardrail stanchions half a dozen big inflated spherical rubber fenders kept the firecrest from rubbing its plebeian paintwork against the whitelyvamished spotlessness of the tender alongside and it didnt require the name on the bows or the crews hats to let me know that this was the tender that normally took up most of the afterdeck space on the shangrila amidships a stocky figuj clad in a white vaguely naval brassbuttoned uniform and holding above his head a golf umbrella that would have had joseph green with envy stopped banging his gloved fist against the firecrests planking and glared up at me ha ive never actually heard anyone snort out a word but this came pretty close to it there you are at last took your time about it didnt you im soaked man soaked a few spots of rain did show up quite clearly on the white seersucker may i come aboard he didnt wait for any permission just leaped aboard with surprising nimbleness for a man of his build and years and nipped into the firecrests wheelhouse ahead of me which was pretty selfish of him as he still had his umbrella and all i had was my dressinggown i followed and closed the door behind me he was a short powerfully built character fiftyfive i would have guessed with a heavilytanned jowled face closecropped irongrey hair with tufted eyebrows to match long straight nose and a mouth that looked as if it had been closed with a zipfastener a goodlooking cove if you liked that type of looks the dark darting eyes looked me up and down and if he was impressed by what he saw he made a heroic effort to keep his admiration in check sorry for the delay i apologised short of sleep we had the customs aboard in the middle of the night and i couldnt get off after that always tell everyone the truth if theres an even chance of that truth coming out anyway which in this case there was gives one a reputation for forthright honesty the customs he looked as if he intended to say pshawor fiddlesticksor something of that order then changed his mind and looked up sharply an intolerable bunch of busybodies and in the middle of the night shouldnt have let them aboard sent them packing intolerable what the deuce did they want he gave the distinct impression of having himself had some trouble with the customs in the past they were looking for stolen chemicals stolen from some place in ayrshire wrong boat idiots he thrust out a stubby hand hed passed his final judgment on the unfortunate customs and the subject was now closed skouras sir anthony skouras petersen his grip made me wince fess from the sheer power of it than from the gouging effects of the large number of thickly encrusted rings that adorned his fingers i wouldnt have been surprised to see some on his thumbs but hed missed out onthat i looked at him with new interest sir anthony skouras ive heard of you of course nothing good columnists dont like me because they know i despise them a cypriot who made his shipping millions through sheer ruthlessness they say true asked by the greek government to leave athens true became a naturalised british citizen and bought a knighthood absolutely true charitable works and public services money can buy anything a baronetcy next hut the markers not right at the moment price is bound to fall can i use your radio transmitter i see you have one whats that the abrupt switch had me offbalance no great achievement the way i was feeling your radio transmitter man dont you listen to the news all those major defence projects cancelled by the pentagon price of steel tumbling must get through to my new york broker at once sorry certainly you may but but your own radiotelephone surely its out of action his mouth became more tightlipped than ever and the inevitable happened it disappeared its urgent mr petersen immediately you know how to operate this model he smiled thinly which was probably the only way he was capable of smiling compared to the cinemaorgan job hed have aboard the shangrila asking him if he could operate this was like asking the captain of a transatlantic jet if he could fly a tiger moth i think i can manage mr petersen call me when youre finished be in the saloon hed be calling roe before hed finished hed be calling me before hed even started but i couldnt tell him word gets around i went down to the saloon contemplated a shave and decided against it it wouldnt take that long it didnt he appeared at the saloon door inside a minute his face grim your radio is out of order mr petersen theyre tricky to operates some of those older fobs i said tactfully maybe if i i say its out of order i mean if a out of order damned odd it was working would you care to try it please i tried it nothing i twiddled everything i could lay hands on nothing a power failure perhaps i suggested ill check would you be so good as to remove the faceplate please i stared at him in perplexity switching the expression after a suitable interval to shrewd thoughtfulness what do you know sir anthony that i dont youll find out so i found out and went through all the proper motions of consternation incredulity and tightlipped indignation finally i said you knew how did you know obvious isnt it your transmitter i said slowly its more than just out order you had the same midnight caller and the orion the mouth vanished again the big blue ketch lying close in only other craft in the harbour apart from us with a radio transmitter smashed just come from there smashed theirs as well but who in gods name it must be the work of a madman is it is it the work of a madman i know something of those matters my first wifehe broke off abruptly and gave an odd shake of the head then went on slowly the mentally disturbed are irrational haphazard purposeless aimless in their behaviour patterns this seems an entirely irrational act but an act with a method and a purpose to it not haphazard its planned theres a reason at first i thought the reason was to cut off my connection with the mainland but it cant be that by rendering me temporarily incommunicado nobody stands to gain i dont stand to lose but you said the new york stock a bagatelle he said contemptuously nobody likes to lose money not more than a few millions anyway no mr petersen i am not the target we have here an a and a b a regards it as vital that he remains in constant communication with the mainland b regards it as vital that a doesnt so b takes steps theres something damned funny going on in torbay and something big i have a nose for such things he was no fool but then not many morons have ended up as multimillionaires i couldnt have put it better myself i said reported this to the police yet going there now after ive made a phone call or two the eyes suddenly became bleak and cold unless our friend has smashed up the two public call boxes in the main street hes done better than that hes brought down the lines to the mainland somewhere down the sound no one knows where he stared at me wheeled to leave then turned his face empty of expression how did you know that the tone matched the face police told me they were aboard with the customs last night the police thats damned odd what were the police doing here he paused and looked at me with his cold measuring eyes a personal question mr petersen no impertinence intended a question of elimination what are you doing here no offence no offence my friend and i are marine biologists a working trip not our boat the ministry of agriculture and fisheries i smiled we have impeccable references sir anthony marine biology eh hobby of mine you might say layman of course must have a talk sometime he was speaking absentmindedly his thoughts elsewhere could you describe the policeman mr petersen i did and he nodded thats him all right odd very odd must have a word with archie about this archie sergeant macdonald this is my fifth consecutive seasons cruising based on torbay the south of france and the egean cant hold a candle to these waters know quite a few of the locals pretty well by this time he was alone no a young constable his son he said melancholy son of lad peter macdonald he has reason for his melancholy mr petersen his two young brothers sixteen years old twins died a few months back at an inverness school lost in a late snowstorm in the cairngorms the father is tougher doesnt show it so much a great tragedy i knew them both fine boys i made some appropriate comment but he wasnt listening i must be on my way mr petersen put this damned strange affair in macdonalds hand dont see that he can do much then off for a short cruise i looked through the wheelhouse windows at the dark skies the whitecapped seas the driving rain you picked a day for it the rougher the better no bravado i like a millpond as well as any man just had new stabilisers fitted in the clyde we got back up here only two days ago and it seems like a good day to try them out he smiled suddenly and put out his hand sorry to have barged in taken up far too much of your time seemed rude i suppose some say i am you and your colleague care to come aboard for a drink tonight we eat early at sea eight oclock say ill send the tender that meant we didnt rate an invitation to dinner which would have made a change from hunslett and his damned baked beans but even an invitation like this would have given rise to envious toothgnashing in some of the stateliest homes in the land it was no secret that the bluest blood in england from royalty downwards regarded a holiday invitation to the island skouras owned off the albanian coast as the conferment of the social cachet of the year or any year skouras didnt wait for an answer and didnt seem to expect one i didnt blame him it would have been many years since skouras had discovered that it was an immutable law of human nature human nature being what it is that no one ever turned down one of his invitations youll be coming to tell me about your smashed transmitter and asking me what the devil i intend to do about it sergeant macdonald said tiredly well mr petersen i know all about it already sir anthony skouras was here half an hour ago sir anthony had a lot to say and mr campbell the owner of the orion has just left hed a lot to say too not me sergeant im a man of few words i gave him what i hoped looked like a selfdeprecatory smile except of course when the police and customs drag me out of bed in the middle of the night i take it our friends have left just as soon as theyd put us ashore customs arc just a damn nuisance like myself he looked as if he could do with some hours sleep frankly mr petersen i dont know what to do about the broken radiotransmitters why on earth who on earth would want to do a daft vicious thing like that thats what i came to ask you i can go aboard your boat macdonald said slowly i can take out my notebook look around and see if i cant find any clues i wouldnt know what to look for maybe if i knew something about fingerprinting and analysis and microscopy i might just find out something but i dont im an island policeman not a oneman flying squad this is cid work and wed have to call in glasgow i doubt if theyd send a couple of detectives to investigate a few smashed radio valves old man skouras draws a lot of water sir hes powerful he has influence if skouras wanted action im damned sure he could get it if the need arose and the mood struck him im sure he could be a very unpleasant character indeed theres not a better man or a kinder man ever sailed into torbay macdonald said warmly that hard brown fact could conceal practically anything that macdonald wanted it to conceal but this rime he was hiding nothing maybe his ways arent my ways maybe hes a hard aye a ruthless businessman maybe as die papers hint his private life wouldnt bear investigation thats none of my business but if you were to look for a man in torbay to say a word against him youll nave a busy rime on your hands mr petersen youve taken me up wrongly sergeant i said mildly i dont even know the man no but we do see that he pointed through the side window of the police station to a large swedishstyle timber building beyond the pier our new village hall town hall they call it sir anthony gave us that those six wee chalets up the hill there for old folks sir anthony again every penny from his own pocket who takes all the schoolchildren to the oban games sir anthony on the shangrila contributes to every charity going and now he has plans to build a boatyard to give employment to the young men of torbay theres not much else going since the fishingboats left well good for old skouras i said he seems to have adopted the place lucky torbay i wish hed buy me a new radiotransmitter ill keep my eyes and ears open mr petersen i cant do more if anything turns up ill let you know at once i told him thanks and left i hadnt particularly wanted to go there but it would have looked damned odd if i hadnt turned up to add my pennyworth to the chorus of bitter complaint i was very glad that i had turned up the midday reception from london was poor this was due less the fact that reception is always better after dark than to the fact that i couldnt use our telescopic radio mast but it was fair enough and uncles voice was brisk and businesslike and clear well caroline weve found our missing friends he said how many i asked cautiously uncle arthurs ambiguous references werent always as clear as uncle arthur imagined them to be all twentyfive that made it the former crew of the nantesville two of them are pretty badly hurt but theyll be all right that accounted for the blood i had found in the captains and one of the engineers cabins where i asked he gave me a map reference just north of wexford the nantesville had sailed from bristol she couldnt have been more than a few hours on her way before shed run into trouble exactly the same procedure as on the previous occasions uncle arthur was saying held in a lonely farmhouse for a couple of nights plenty to eat and drink and blankets to keep the cold out then they woke up one morning and found their guards had gone but a different procedure in stopping the our friend id almost said nantesville and uncle arthur wouldnt have liked that at all as always we must concede them a certain ingenuity caroline after having smuggled men aboard in port then using the sinking fishingboat routine the police launch routine and the yacht with the appendicitis case aboard i thought they would be starting to repeat themselves but this time they came up with a new one possibly because its the first time theyve hijacked a ship during the hours of darkness carley rafts this time with about ten survivors aboard dead ahead of the vessel oil all over the sea a weak distress flare that couldnt have been seen a mile away and probably was designed that way you know the rest yes annabelle i knew the rest after that the routine was always the same the rescued survivors displaying a marked lack of gratitude would whip out pistols round up the crew tie black muslin bags over their heads so that they couldnt identify the vessel that would appear within the hour to take them off march them on board the unknown vessel land them on some lonely beach during the dark then march them again often a very long way indeed till they arrived at their prison a deserted farmhouse always a deserted farmhouse and always in ireland three times in the north and now twice in the south meantime the prize crew sailed the hijacked vessel to god alone knew where and the first the world knew of the disappearance of the pirated vessel was when the original crew released after two or three days painless captivity would turn up at some remote dwelling and start hollering for the nearest telephone betty and dorothy i said were they still in safe concealment when the crew were taken off i imagine so i dont know details are still coming in and i understand the doctors wont let anyone see the captain yet only the captain had known of the presence aboard of baker and delmont fortyone hours now caroline what have you done for a moment i wondered irritably what the devil he was talking about then i remembered hed given me fortyeight hours seven were gone ive had three hours sleep hed consider that an utter waste of time his employees werent considered to need sleep ive talked to the constabulary ashore and ive talked to a wealthy yachtsman next boat to us here were paying him a social call tonight there was a pause youre doing what tonight caroline visiting weve been invited harriet and i for drinks this time the pause was markedly longer then he said yon have fortyone hours caroline yes annabelle we assume you havent taken leave of your senses i dont know how unanimous informed opinion might be about that i dont think i have and you havent given up no not that youre too damn stiffnecked and and stupid whos the yachtsman i told him it took me some time partly because i had to spell out names with the aid of his damned codebook partly because i gave him a very full account of everything skouras had said to me and everything sergeant macdonald had said about skouras when his voice came again it was cagey and wary as uncle arthur couldnt see me i permitted myself a cynical grin even cabinet ministers found it difficult to make the grade as far as skourass dinnertable but the permanent undersecretaries the men with whom the real power of government lies practically had their own initialled napkin rings undersecretaries were the bane of uncle arthurs life youll have to watch your step very carefully here caroline betty and dorothy arent coming home any more annabelle someone has to pay i want someone to pay you want someone to pay we all do but its inconceivable that a man in his position a man of his wealth im sorry annabelle i dont understand a man like that dammit all i know him well caroline we dine together firstname terms know his present wife even better exactress a philanthropist like that a man whos spent five consecutive seasons there would a man like that a millionaire like that spend all that time all that money just to build up a front skouras i used the code name interrogatory incredulous as if it had just dawned upon me what uncle arthur was talking about i never said i suspected him annabelle i have no reason to suspect him ah its difficult to convey a sense of heartfelt gladness profound satisfaction and browmopping relief in a single syllable but uncle arthur managed it without any trouble then why go a casual eavesdropper might have thought he detected a note of pained jealousy in uncle arthurs voice and the casual eavesdropper would have been right uncle arthur had only one weakness in his makeup he was a social snob of monumental proportions i want aboard i want to see this smashed transmitter of his why a hunch let me call it annabelle no more uncle arthur was going in for the long silences in a big way today then he said a hunch a hunch you told me this morning you were on to something theres something else i want you to contact the post office savings bank head office in scotland after that the records files of some scottish newspapers i suggest the glasgow herald the scottish dotty express and most particularly the west highland weekly the oban times ah no relief this time just satisfaction this is more like it caroline what do you want and why so i told him what i wanted and why jots more of the fancy code work and when id finished he said ill have my staff on to this straight away ill have all the information you want by midnight then i dont want it annabelle midnights too late for me midnights no use to me dont ask the impossible caroline he muttered something to himself something i couldnt catch then ill pull every strings caroline nine oclock four oclock annabelle four oclock this afternoon when it came to incredulity he had me whacked to the wide four hours time you have taken leave of your senses you can have ten men on it in ten minutes twenty in twenty minutes wheres the door that isnt open to you especially the door of the assistant commissioner professionals dont kill for the hell of it they kill because they must they kill to gain time every additional hour is vital to them and if its vital to them how much more so is it to us or do you think were dealing with amateurs annabelle call me at four he said heavily ill see what i have for you whats your next move caroline bed i said im going to get some sleep of course time as you said is of the essence you mustnt waste it must you caroline he signed off he sounded bitter no doubt he was bitter but then insomnia apart uncle arthur could rely on a full quota of sleep during the coming night which was more than i could no certain foreknowledge no second sight just a hunch but not a small one the kind of hunch you couldnt have hidden behind the empire state building just like the one i had about the shangrila i only just managed to catch the last fading notes of the alarm as it went off at ten minutes to four i felt worse than i had done when wed lain down after a miserable lunch of corned beef and reconstituted powdered potatoes if old skouras bad had a spark of human decency hed have made that invitation for dinner i wasnt only growing old i felt old id been working too long for uncle arthur the pay was good but the hours and working conditions id have wagered that uncle arthur hadnt even set eyes on a tin of corned beef since world war ii were shocking and all this constant worrying chiefly about life expectancy helped wear a man down hunslett came out of his cabin as i came out of mine he looked just as old as i did if they had to rely on a couple of ageing crocks like us i thought morosely the rising generation must be a pretty sorry lot passing through the saloon i wondered bitterly about the identity of all those characters who wrote so glibly about the western isles in general and the torbay area in particular as being a yachtsmans paradise without equal in europe obviously theyd never been there fleet street was their home and home was a place they never left not if they could help it an ignorant bunch of travel and advertising copy writers who regarded kings cross as the northern limits of civilisation well maybe not all that ignorant at least they were smart enough to stay south of kings cross four oclock on an autumn afternoon but already it was more night than day the sun wasnt down yet not by a very long way but it might as well have been for all the chance it had of penetrating the rolling masses of heavy dark cloud hurrying away to the eastwards to the inky blackness of the horizon beyond torbay the slanting sheeting rain that foamed whitely across the bay further reduced what little visibility there was to a limit of not more than four hundred yards the village itself half a mile distant andnestling in the dark shadow of the steeplyrising pinecovered hills behind might never have existed off to the northwest i could sec the navigation lights of a craft rounding the headland skouras returning from his stabiliser test run down in the shangrilas gleaming galley a master chef would be preparing the sumptuous evening meal the one to which we hadnt been invited i tried to put the thought of that meal out of my mind but i couldnt so i just put it as far away as possible and followed hunslett into the engineroom hunslett took the spare earphones and squatted beside me on the deck notebook on his knee hunslett was as competent in shorthand as he was in everything else i hoped that uncle arthur would have something to tell us that hunsletts presence there would be necessary it was congratulations caroline uncle arthur said without preamble you really are on to something as far as it is possible for a dead flat monotone voice to assume an overtone of warmth then uncle arthurs did just that he sounded positively friendly more likely it was some freak of transmission or reception but at least he hadnt started off by bawling me out weve traced those post office savings books he went on he rattled off book numbers and details of times and amounts of deposits things of no interest to me then said last deposits were on december th ten pounds in each case present balance is d exactly the same in both and those accounts have not been closed he paused for a moment to let me congratulate him which i did then continued thats nothing caroline listen your queries about any mysterious accidents deaths disappearances off the west coasts of invernessshire or argyll or anything happening to people from that area weve struck oil caroline weve really struck oil my god why did we never think of this before have your pencil handy harriet has here we go this seems to have been the most disastrous sailing season for years in the west of scotland but first one from last year the pinto a wellfound seaworthy fortyfive foot motor cruiser left kyle of lochalsh for oban at eight ajn september th she should have arrived that afternoon she never did no trace of her has ever been found what was the weather at the time annabelle i thought youd ask me that caroline uncle arthurs combination of modesty and quiet satisfaction could be very trying at times i checked with the met office force one variable flat calm cloudless sky then we come to this year april th and april th the evening star and the jeannie rose two east coast fishing boats one from buckie the other from fraserburgh but both based on the west coast i wish you wouldnt try to steal my thunder uncle arthur complained both were based on oban both were lobster boats the evening star the first one to go was found stranded on the rocks off islay the jeannie rose vanished without trace no member of either crew was ever found then again on the th of may this time a wellknown racing yacht the cap gris nez an english built and owned craft despite her name highly experienced skipper navigator and crew all of them longtime and often successful competitors in rorc races that class left londonderry for the north of scotland in fine weather disappeared she was found almost a month later or what was left of her washed up on the isle of skye and the crew need you ask never found then the last case a few weeks ago august th husband wife two teenage children son and daughter converted lifeboat the kingfisher by all accounts a pretty competent sailor been at it for years but hed never done any night navigation so he set out one calm evening to do a night cruise vanished boat and crew where did he set out from torbay that one word made his afternoon it made mine too i said and do you still think the nantesville is hell and gone to iceland or some remote fjord in northern norway i never thought anything of the kind uncles human relationship barometer had suddenly swung back from friendly to normal normal lying somewhere between cool and glacial the significance of the dates will not have escaped you no annabelle the significance has not escaped me the buckie fishingboat the evening star had been found washed up on islay three days after the ss holmivood had vanished off the south coast of ireland the jeanme rose had vanished exactly three days after the mv antara had as mysteriously disappeared in the st georges channel the cap gris nez the rorc racer that had finally landed up on the rocks of the island of skye had vanished the same day as the mv headley pioneer had disappeared somewhere it was thought off northern ireland and the converted lifeboat kingfisher had disappeared never to be seen again just two days after the ss hurricane spray had left the clyde also never to be seen again coincidence was coincidence and i classed those who denied its existence with intellectual giants like the twentiethcentury south african president who stoutly maintained that the world was flat and that an incautious step would take you over the edge with results as permanent as they would be disastrous but this was plain ridiculous the odds against such a perfect matching of dates could be calculated only in astronomical terms while the complete disappearance of the crews of four small boats that had come to grief in so very limited an area was the final nail in the coffin of coincidence i said as much to uncle let us not waste time by dwelling upon the obvious caroline uncle said coldly which was pretty ungracious of him as the idea had never even entered his head until i had put it there four hours previously the point is what is to be done islay to skye is a pretty big area where does this get us how much weight can you bring to bear to secure the cooperationof the television and radio networks there was a pause then what do you have in mind caroline uncle at his most forbidding an insertion of an item in their news bulletins well an even longer pause it was done daily during the war of course i believe its been done once or twice since cant compel them of course theyre a stuffy lot both the bbc and the ita his tone left little doubt as to his opinion of those diehard reactionaries who brooked no interference an odd reaction from one who was himself a pastmaster of brookmanship of this nature if they can be persuaded that its completely apolitical and in the national interest theres a chance what do you want an item that a distress signal has been received from a sinking yacht somewhere south of skye exact position unknown signals ceased the worst feared an airsea search to be mounted at first light tomorrow thats all i may manage it your reason caroline i want to look around i want an excuse to move around without raising eyebrows youre going to volunteer the firecrest for this search and then poke around where you shouldnt we have our faults annabelle harriet and i but were not crazy i wouldnt take this tub across the serpentine without a favourable weather forecast its blowing a force outside and a boat search would take a lifetime too long in those parts what i had in mind was this at the very eastern rip of torbay island about five miles from the villages theres a small deserted sandy cove semicircular and well protected by steep bluffs and pine trees will you please arrange to have a longrange helicopter there exactly at dawn and now its your turn to think i am crazy uncle arthur said coldly that remark about the seakeeping qualities of big own brainchild the firecrest would have rankled badly im supposed to snap my fingers and hey presto i a helicopter will be there at dawn thats fourteen hours from now annabelle at five oclock this morning you were prepared to snap your fingers and have a helicopter here by noon seven hours exactly half the time but that was for something important like getting me down to london to give me the bawling out of a lifetime before firing me call me at midnight caroline i hope to god you know what you are doing i said yes sir and hung up i didnt mean yes sir i knew what i was doing i meant yes sir i hoped to god i knew what i was doing if the carpet in the shangrila saloon had cost a penny under five thousand pounds then old skouras must have picked it up secondhand somewhere twenty by thirty brone and russet and gold but mainly gold it flowed across the deck like a field of ripe corn an illusion heightened both by its depth and the impediment it offered to progress you had to wade through the damn thing id never seen an item of furnishing like it in my life except for the curtains that covered twothirds of the bulkhead space the curtains made the carpet look rather shoddy persian or afghanistan with a heavy gleaming weave that gave a shimmering shotsilk effect with every little movement of the shangrila they stretched all the way from deckhead to deck what little of the bulkheads that could be seen were sheathed in a satiny tropical hardwood the same wood as was used for the magnificent bar that took up most of the after bulkhead of the saloon the opulently upholstered settees and armchairs and barstools dark green leather with gold piping would have cost another fortune even the tradein value of the beaten copper tables scattered carelessly about the carpet would have fed a family of five for a year at the savoy grill on the port bulkhead hung two cézannes on the starboard two renoirs the pictures were a mistake in that room they didnt have a chance theyd have felt more at home in the galley so would i so i was pretty sure would hunslett it wasnt merely that our sports coats and paisley scarves clashed violently with the decor in general and the black ties and dinner jackets of our host and his other guests in particular it wasnt even that the general run of conversation might have been specifically designed to reduce hunslett and myself to our proper status of artisans and pretty inferior artisans at that ah this talk about debentures and mergers and crossoptions and takeovers and millions and millions of dollars has a pretty demoralising effect on the lower classes but you didnt need to have the iq of a genius to realise that this line of talk wasnt being aimed specifically at us to the lads with the black ties debentures and takeovers were the stuff and staff of life and so a principal staple of conversation besides this wish to be somewhere else obviously didnt apply only to us at least two others a baldheaded goateebearded merchant banker by the name of henri biscarte and a big bluff scots lawyer by the name of maccallum were just as uncomfortable as i felt but showed it a great deal more a silent movie picture of the scene would have given no due as to what was wrong everything was so very comfortable so very civilised the deep armchairs invited complete relaxation a blazing if superfluous logfire burned in the hearth skouras was the smiling and genial host to the life the glasses were never empty the press of an unheard bell brought a whitejacketed steward who silently refilled glasses and as silently departed again all so urbane so wealthy so pleasantly peaceful until you cut in the movie soundtrack that was that was when you wished you were in the galley skouras had his glass refilled for the fourth time in the fortyfive minutes we had been there smiled at his wife sitting in the armchair across the fire from him lifted his glass in a toast to you my dear to your patience with putting up with us all so well a most boring trip for you most boring i congratulate you i looked at charlotte skouras everybody looked at charlotte skouras there was nothing unusual in that millions of peoplehad looked at charlotte skouras when she had been the most soughtafter actress in europe even in those days shed been neither particularly young nor beautiful she didnt have to be because shed been a great actress and not a beautiful but boneheaded movie star now she was even older and less goodlooking and her figure was beginning to go but men still looked at her she was somewhere in her late thirties but they would still be looking at her when she was in her bathchair she had that kind of face a worn face a used face a face that had been used for living and laughing and thinking and feeling and suffering a face with brown tired wiseknowing eyes a thousand years old a face that had more quality and character in every little line and wrinkle and heaven only knew there was no shortage of these than in a whole battalion of the fringehaired darlings of contemporary society the ones in the glossy magazines the ones who week after week stared out at you with their smooth and beautiful faces with their beautiful and empty eyes put them in the same room as charlotte skouras and no one would ever have seen them massproduced carbon copies of chocolate boxes are no kind of competition at all for a great painters original in oils you are very kind anthony charlotte skouras had a deep slow slightlyforeign accented voice and just then a tired strained smile that accorded well with the darkness under the brown eyes but i am never bored truly you know that with this lot as guests skourass smile was as broad as ever a skouras board meeting in the western isles instead of your blueblooded favourites on a cruise in the levant take dollmann here he nodded to the man by his side a tall thin bespectacled character with receding thin dark hair who looked as if he needed a shave but didnt john dollmann the managing director of the skouras shipping lines eh john how do you rate yourself as a substitute for young viscount horley the one with sawdust in his head and fifteen million in the bank poorly im afraid sir anthony dollmann was as urbane as skouras himself as apparently unconscious of anything untoward in the atmosphere very poorly ive a great deal more brains a great deal less money and ive no pretensions to being a gay and witty conversationalist young horley was rather the life and soul of the party wasnt he especially when i wasnt around skouras added thoughtfully he looked at me you know him mr petersen ive heard of him i dont move in those circles sir anthony urbane as all hell that was me um skouras looked quizzically at the two men sitting close by myself one rejoicing in the good anglosaxon name of hermann lavorski a big jovial twinklingeyed man with a great booming laugh and an inexhaustible supply of risqué stories was id been told his accountant and financial adviser id never seen anyone less like an accountant and finance wizard so that probably made him the best in the business the other a middleaged balding sphinxfaced character with a drooping handlebar moustache of the type once sported by wild bin hickock and a head that cried out for a bowler hat was lord charnley who in spite of his title found it necessary to work as a broker in the city to make ends meet and how would you rate our two good friends here charlotte this with another wide and friendly smile at his wife im afraid i dont understand charlotte skouras looked at her husband steadily not smiling come now come now of course you do understand pm still talking about the poor company i provide for so young and attractive a woman as you he looked at hunslett she is a young and attractive woman dont you think mr hunslett well now hunslett leaned back in his armchair fingers judiciously steepled an urbanely sophisticated man entering into the spirit of things what is youth sir anthony i dont know he smiled across at charlotte skouras mrs skouras will never be old as for attractive well its a bit superfluous to ask that for ten million european men and for myself mrs skouras was the most attractive actress of her time was mr hunslett was old skouras was leaning forward in his chair now the smile a shadow of its former self but now mr hunslett mrs skourass producers must have employed the worst cameramen in europe hunsletts dark saturnine face gave nothing away he smiled at charlotte skouras if i may be pardoned so personal a remark if id had a sword in my hand and the authority to use it id have knighted hunslett on the spot after of course having first had a swipe at skouras the days of chivalry are not yet over skouras smiled i saw maccallum and biscarte the bearded banker stir uncomfortably in their seats it was damnably awkward skouras went on i only meant my dear that charnley and lavorski here are poor substitutes for sparkling young company like welshblood the young american oil man or domenico that spanish count with the passion for amateur astronomy the one who used to take you on the afterdeck to point out the stars in the aigean he looked again at charnley and lavorski im sorry gentlemen you just wouldnt do at all i dont know if im all that insulted lavorski said comfortably charnley and i have our points um i havent seen young domenico around for quite some time hed have made an excellent stage feed man would lavorski trained to say his lines at exactly the right time you wont see him around for a very much longer time skouras said grimly at least not in my yacht or in any of my houses a pause or near anything i own i promised him id see the colour of his noble castilian blood if i ever clapped eyes on him again he laughed suddenly i must apologise for even bringing that nonentitys name into the conversation mr hunslett mr petersen your glasses are empty youve been very kind sir anthony weve enjoyed ourselves immensely bluff old stupid old calvert too obtuse to notice what was going on but wed like to get back its blowing up badly tonight and hunslett and i would like to move the firecrest into the shelter of garve island i rose to a window pulling one of his afghanistan or whatever curtains to one side it felt as heavy as a stage fire curtain no wonder he needed stabilisers with all that topweight on thats why we left our riding and cabin lights on to see if wed moved she dragged a fair bit earlier this evening so soon so soon he sounded genuinely disappointed but of course if youre worriedhe pressed a button not the one for the steward and the saloon door opened the man who entered was a small weatherbeaten character with two gold stripes on his skeves captain black the shangrila captain hed accompanied skouras when wed been briefly shown around the shangrila after arriving aboard a tour that had included an inspection of the smashed radio transmitter no question about it their radio was well and truly out of action ah captain black have the tender brought alongside at once will you mr petersen and mr hunslett are anxious to get back to the firecrest as soon as possible yes sir im afraid therell be a certain delay sir anthony delay old skouras could put a frown in his voice without putting one on his face the old trouble im afraid captain black said apologetically those bloody carburettors skouras swore you were right captain black you were right last tender ill ever have with petrol engines fitted let me know as soon as shes all right and detail one of the hands to keep an eye on the firecrest to see that she doesnt lose position mr petersons afraid shell drag dont worry sir i didnt know whether black was speaking to skouras or myself shell be all right he left skouras spent some time in extolling diesel engines and cursing petrol ones pressed some more whisky on hunslett and myself and ignored my protests which were based less on any dislike of whisky in general or skouras in particular than on the fact that i didnt consider it very good preparation for the night that lay ahead of me just before nine oclock he pressed a button by his arm rest and the doors of a cabinet automatically opened to reveal a inch tv set uncle arthur hadnt let me down the newscaster gave quite a dramatic account of the last message received from the tsdy moray rose reported not under command and making water fast somewhere to the south of the island of skye a fullscale air and sea search starting at dawn the next day was promised skouras switched the set off the seas crowded with damn fools who should never be allowed outside a canal basin whats the latest on the weather anyone know there was a hebrides force warning on the shipping forecast charlotte skouras said quietly southwest they said since when did you start listening to forecasts skouras demanded or to the radio at all but of course my dear id forgotten not so much to occupy your time these days have you force and southwest eh and the yacht would be coming down from the kyle of lochalsh straight into it they must be mad and they have a radio they sent a message that makes them stark staring lunatics whether they didnt listen to the forecast or whether they listened and still set out they must have been lunatics get them everywhere some of those lunatics may be dying drowning now or already drowned charlotte skouras said the shadows under the brown eyes seemed bigger and darker than ever but there was still life in those brown eyes for perhaps five seconds skouras face set stared at her and felt that if i snapped my fingers there would be a loud tinkling or crashing sound the atmosphere was as brittle as that then he turned away with a laugh and said to me the little woman eh petersen the little mother only she has no children tell me petersen are you married i smiled at him while debating the wisdom of throwing my whisky glass in his face or clobbering him with something heavy then decided against it apart from the fact that it would only make matters worse i didnt fancy the swim back to the firecrest so i smiled and smiled feeling the knife under the cloak and said afraid not sir arthur afraid not afraid not he laughed his hearty goodfellowship laugh the kind i cant stand and went on cryptically youre not so young to be sufficiently naive to talk that way come now are you mr petersen thirtyeight and never had a chance i said cheerfully the old story sir anthony the ones id have wouldnt have me and viceversa which wasnt quite true the driver of a bentley with the doctors had estimated certainly not less than a bottle of whisky inside him had ended my marriage before it was two months old and also accounted for the savagely scarred left side of my face it was then that uncle arthur had prised me from my marine salvage business and since then no girl with any sense would ever have contemplated marrying me if shed known what my job was what made it even more difficult was the fact that i couldnt tell her in the first place and the scars didnt help you dont look a fool to me skouras smiled if i may say so without offence that was rich old skouras worrying about giving offence the zipfastener of a mouth softened into what in view of his next words i correctly interpreted in advance as being a nostalgic smile im joking of course its not all that bad a man must have his fun charlotte yes the brown eyes wary watchful theres something i want from our stateroom would you the stewardess couldnt she this is personal my dear and as air hunslett has pointed out at least by inference youre a good deal younger than i am he smiled at hunslett to show that no offence was intended the picture on my dressingtable what she suddenly sat forward in her armchair hands reaching for the fronts of the arm rests as if about to pull herself to her feet something touched a switch inside skouras and the smiling eyes went bleak and hard and cold changing their direction of gaze fractionally it lasted only a moment because his wife had caught it even before i did because she sat forward abruptly smoothing down the short sleeves of her dress over suntanned arms quick and smooth but not quite quick enough for a period of not more than two seconds the sleeves had ridden nearly all the way up to her shoulders and nearly four inches below those shoulders each arm had been encircled by a ring of bluishred bruises a continuous ring not the kind of bruises that are made by blows or finger pressure the kind that are made by a rope skouras was smiling again pressing the bell to summon the steward charlotte skouras rose without a further word and hurried quickly from the room i could have wondered if id only imagined this momentary tableau id seen but i knew damned well i hadnt i was paid not to have an imagination of that kind she was back inside a moment a picture frame maybe six by eight in her hand she handed it to skouras and sat down quickly in her own chair this time she was very careful with the sleeves without seeming to be my wife gentlemen skouras said he rose from his armchair and handed round a photograph of a darkeyed darkhaired woman with a smiling face that emphasised the high slavonic cheekbones my first wife anna we were married for thirty years marriage isnt all that bad thats anna gentlemen if id a gramme of human decency left in me i should have knocked him down and trampled all over him for a man to state openly in company that he kept the picture of his former wife by his bedside and then impose upon his present wife the final and utter humiliation and degradation of fetching it was beyond belief that and the ropeburns on his present wifes arms made him almost too good for shooting but i couldnt do it i couldnt do anything about it the old coots heart was in his voice and his eyes if this was acting it was the most superb acting i had ever seen the tear that trickled down from his right eye would have rated an oscar any year since cinema had begun and if it wasnt acting then it was just the picture of a sad and lonely man no longer young momentarily oblivious of this world gazing desolately at the only thing in this world that he loved that he ever had loved or ever would love something gone beyond recall and that was what it was if it hadnt been for the other picture the picture of the still proud humiliated charlotte skouras staring sightlessly into the fire i might have felt a lump in my own throat as it happened id no difficulty in restraining my emotion one man couldnt however but it wasnt sympathy for skouras that got the better of him maccallum the scots lawyer palefaced with outrage rose to his feet said something in a thick voice about not feeling well wished us good night and left the bearded banker left on his heels skouras didnt see them go hed fumbled his way back to his seat and was staring before him his eyes as sightless as those of his wife like his wife he was seeing something in the depths of the flames the picture lay face down on his knee he didnt even look up when captain black came in and told us the tender was ready to take us back to the firecrest when the tender had left us aboard our own boat we waited till it was halfway back to the shangrila closed the saloon door unbuttoned the studded carpet and pulled it back carefully i lifted a sheet of newspaper and there on the thin film of flour spread out on the paper below it were four perfect sets of footprints we tried our two forard cabins the engineroom and the after cabin and the silk threads wed so laboriously fitted before our departure to the shangrila were all snapped somebody two at least to judge from the footprints had been through the entire length of the firecrest they could have had at least a clear hour for the job so hunslett and i spent a clear hour trying to find out why they had been there we found nothing no reason at all well i said at least we know now why they were so anxious to have us aboard the shangrila to give them a dear field here thats why the tender wasnt ready it was here what else theres something else i cant put my finger on it but theres something else let me know in the morning when you call uncle at midnight ask him to dig up what information he can on those characters on the shangrila and about the physician who attended the late lady skouras theres a lot i want to know about the late lady skouras i told him what i wanted to know meantime lets shift this boat over to garve island ive got to be up at threethirty youve all the time for sleep in the world i should have listened to hunslett again i should have listened to hunslett and again for hunsletts sake but i didnt know then that hunslett was to have time for all the sleep in the world four wednesday am dusk as the saying went in those parts ft was as black as the earl of hells waistcoat the sky was black the woods were black and the icy heavy driving rain reduced what little visibility there was to just nothing at all the only way to locate a tree was to walk straight into it the only way to locate a dip in the ground was to fall into it when hunslett had woken me at threethirty with a cup of tea he told me that when hed been speaking to uncle arthur at midnight id been asleep he was left in no doubt that although the helicopter had been laid on uncle had been most unenthusiastic and considered the whole thing a waste of time it was a rare occasion indeed when i ever felt myself in total agreement with uncle arthur but this was one of those rare occasions it was beginning to look as if id never even find that damned helicopter anyway i wouldnt have believed that it could have been so difficult to find ones way across five miles of wooded island at nighttime it wasnt even as if i had to contend with rivers or rushing torrents or cliffs or precipitous clefts in the ground or any kind of dense or tangled vegetation torbay was just a moderately wooded gently sloping island and crossing from one side to the other of it would have been only an easy sunday afternoon stroll for a fairly active octogenarian i was no octogenarian though i felt like one but then this wasnt a sunday afternoon the trouble had started from the moment id landed on the torbay shore opposite garve island from the moment id tried to land wearing rubbersoled shoes and trying to haul a rubber dinghy over slippery seaweedcovered rocks some as much as six feet in diameter to a shoreline twenty interminable yards away is even in broad daylight a bonebreaking job in pitch darkness ifs almost as good a way as any for a potential suicide to finish off the job with efficiency and dispatch the third time i fell i smashed my torch several bonejarring bruises later my wristcompass went the same way the attached depthgauge almost inevitably remained intact a depthgauge is a great help in finding your way through a trackless wood at night after deflating and caching the dinghy and pump id set off along the shoreline remote from the village of torbay it was logical that if i followed this long enough id be bound to come to the sandy cove at the far end of the island where i was to rendezvous with the helicopter it was also logical that if the tree line came right down to the shore if that shore was heavily indented with little coves and if i couldnt see where i was going id fall into the sea with a fair degree of regularity after id hauled myself out for the third time i gave up and struck inland it wasnt because i was afraid of getting wet as i hadnt seen much point in wearing a scuba suit for walking through a wood and sitting in a helicopter id left it aboard and was already soaked to the skin nor was it because of the possibility that the hand distress flares id brought along for signalling the helicopter pilot wrapped though they were in oilskin might not stand up to this treatment indefinitely the reason why i was now blundering my blind and painful way through the wood was that if id stuck to the shoreline my rate of progress there wouldnt have brought me to the rendezvous before midday my only guides were the windlashed rain and the lie of the land the cove i was heading for lay to the east the neargale force wind was almost due west so as long as i kept that cold stinging rain on the back of my neck id be heading in approximately die right direction as a check on that the island of torbay has a spinal hogs back covered in pines to the tops running its eastwest length and when i felt the land falling away to one side or the other it meant i was wandering but the rainladen wind swirled unpredictably as the wood alternately thinned and became dense again the hogs back had offshoots and irregularities and as a result of the combination of die two i lost a great deal of time half an hour before dawn by my watch that was it was still as black as the midnight hour i was beginning to wonder if i could possibly make it in time and i was beginning to wonder if the helicopter could make it either there was no doubt in my mind that it could land that eastern cove was perfectly sheltered but whether it could get there at all was another question i had a vague idea that helicopters were unmanageable above certain wind speeds but had no idea what those wind speeds were and if the helicopter didnt turn up then i was faced with the long cold wet trudge back to where i had hidden the dinghy and then an even longer colder and hungry wait until darkness fell at night and i could get out to the firecrest unseen even now i had only twentyfour hours left by nightfall i would have only twelve i began to run fifteen minutes and god knows how many ironhard tree trunks later i heard it faint and intermittent at first then gradually swelling in strength the clattering roar of a helicopter engine he was early damn him he was far too early hed land there find the place deserted and take off for base again it says much for my sudden desperate state of mind that it never occurred to me how he could even begin to locate far less land in that sandy cove in a condition of darkness that was still only a degree less than total for a moment i even contemplated lighting a flare to let the pilot know that i was at least there or thereabouts and had the flare halfway out of my pocket before i shoved it back again the arrangement had been that the flare would be lit only to show the landing strip in the sand if i lit one there and then he might head for it strike the tops of the pine trees and that would be the end of that i ran even faster it had been years since id run more than a couple of hundred yards and my lungs were already wheezing and gasping like a fractured bellows in a blacksmiths shop but i ran as hard as i could i cannoned into trees i tripped over roots fell into gullies had my face whipped time and again by lowspreading branches but above all i cannoned into those damned trees i stretched my arms before me but it did no good i ran into them all the same i picked up a broken branch id tripped over and held it in front of me but no matter how i pointed h the trees always seemed to come at me from another direction i hit every tree in die island of torbay i felt the way a bowling ball must feel after a hard season in a bowling alley the only difference and a notable one being that whereas the ball knocked the skittles down the trees knocked me down once twice three times i heard the sound of the helicopter engine disappearing away to the east and the third time i was sure be was gone for good but each time it came back the sky was lightening to the east now but still i couldnt see the helicopter for the pilot everything below would still be as black as night the ground gave way beneath my feet and i fell i braced myself arms outstretched for the impact as i struck the other side of the gully but my reaching hands found nothing no impact i kept on falling rolling and twisting down a heathery slope and for the first time that night i would have welcomed the appearance of a pine tree any kind of tree to stop my progress i dont know how many trees there were on that slope i missed the lot if it was a gully it was the biggest gully on the island of torbay but it wasnt a gully at all it was the end of torbay i rolled and bumped over a sudden horizontal grassy bank and landed on my back in soft wet sand even white i was whooping and gasping and trying to get my knockedout breath back into my lungs i still had time to appreciate the fortunate fact that kindly providence arid a few million years had changed the jagged rocks that must once have fringed that shore into a nice soft yielding sandy beach i got to my feet this was the place all right there was only one such sandy bay id been told in the east of the isle of torbay and there was now enough light for me to see that this was indeed just that though a lot smaller than it appeared on the chart the helicopter was coming in again from the east not as far as i could judge more than three or four hundred feet up i ran halfway down to the waters edge pulled a hand flare from my pocket slid away the waterproof covering and tore off the ignition strip it flared into life at once a dazzling bluewhite magnesium light so blinding that i had to clap my free hand over my eyes it lasted for only thirty seconds but that was enough even as it fizzled and sputtered its acrid and nostrilwrinkling way to extinction the helicopter was almost directly overhead two verticallydownward pointing searchlights mounted fore and aft on the helicopter switched on simultaneously interlocking pools of brilliance on the pale white sand twenty seconds later the skids sank into the soft sand the rackety clangour of the motor died away and the blades idled slowly to a stop id never been in a helicopter in my life but id seen plenty in the halfdarkness this looked like the biggest one id ever seen the righthand door opened and a torch shone in my face as i approached a voice welsh as the rhondda valley said morning you calvert me can i come aboard how do i know youre calvert im telling you dont come the hard man laddie youve no authority to make an identification check have you no proof no papers have you no sense havent you enough sense to know that there are some people who never

unemployed before sunset a very auspicious beginning to our association i was told to be careful he was as worried and upset as a cat snoozing on a sunwarmed wall still a marked lack of cordiality lieutenant scott williams fleet air arm takes an admiral to sack me step up i stepped up closed the door and sat he didnt offer to shake hands he flicked on an overhead light and said what the hells happened to your face whats the matter with my face blood hundreds of little scratches pine needles i told him what had happened why a machine this size you could ferry a battalion in this one

for the first time sorry sir lieutenant williams scotty to you is now his normal cheerful willing self whats on know the coastlines and islands of this area well prom the air yes ive been here twenty months now airsea rescue and in between army and navy exercises and hunting for lost climbers most of my work is with the marine commandos i know this area at least as well as any man alive im looking for a place where a man could hide a boat a fairly big boat forty feet maybe fifty might be in a big boathouse might be under overhanging trees up some creek might even be in some tiny secluded harbour normally invisible from the sea between islay and skye well now is that all have you any idea how many hundreds of miles of coastline there is in that lot taking in au the islands maybe thousands how long do i have for this job a month by sunset today now wait we can cut out all centres of population and by that i mean anything with more than two or three houses together we can cut out known fishing grounds we can cut out regular steamship routes does that help a lot what are we really looking for ive told you okay okay so mine is not to reason why any idea where youd like to start any ideas for limiting the search lets go due east to the mainland twenty miles up the coast then twenty south then well try torbay sound and the isle of torbay then the islands farther west and north torbay sound has a steamer service sorry i should have said a daily service torbay has a biweekly service fasten your seatbelt and get on those earphones were going to get thrown around quite a bit today i hope youre a good sailor and the earphones they were the biggest id ever seen four inches wide with inchthick linings of what looked like sorbo rubber a spring loaded swing microphone was attached to the headband for the ears the lieutenant said kindly so that you dont get perforated drums and so you wont be deaf for a week afterwards if you can imagine yourself inside a steel drum in the middle of a boiler factory with a dozen pneumatic chisels hammering outside youll have some idea of what the racket is like once we start up even with the earphone muffs on it sounded exactly like being in a steel drum in a boiler factory with a dozen pneumatic chisels hammering on the outside the earphones didnt seem to have the slightest effect at all the noise came hammering and beating at you through every facial and cranial bone but on the one and very brief occasion when i cautiously lifted one phone to find out what the noise was like without them and if they were really doing any good at all i found out exactly what lieutenant williams meant about perforated drums he hadnt been joking but even with them on after a couple of hours ray head felt as if it were coming apart i looked occasionally at the dark lean face of the young welshman beside me a man who had to stand this racket day in day out the year round he looked quite sane to me id have been in a padded cell in a week i didnt have to be in that helicopter a week altogether i spent eight hours flying time in it and it felt like a leap year our first run northwards up the mainland coast produced what was to be the first of many false alarms that day twenty minutes after leaving torbay we spotted a river a small one but still ariver flowing into the sea we followed it upstream for a mile then suddenly the trees crowding down close to the banks on both sides met in the middle where the river seemed to run through some rocky gorge i shouted into the microphone i want to see whats there williams nodded we passed a place a quarter of a mile back ill set you down youve got a winch couldnt you lower me when you know as much as i do about the effect of forty to fifty miles an hour winds in steepsided valley he said youll never talk about such things not even in a joke i want to take this kite home again so he turned back and set me down without much difficulty in the shelter of a bluff five minutes later id reached the beginning of the overhanging stretch another five minutes and i was back in the helicopter what luck the lieutenant asked no luck an ancient oak tree right across the river just at the entrance to the overhang could be shifted it weighs two or three tons its imbedded feet deep in the mud and its been there for years well well we cant be right first time every time a few more minutes and another river mouth it hardly looked big enough to take a boat of any size but we turned up anyway less than half a mile from its mouth the river foamed whitely as it passed through rapids we turned back by the time it was fully daylight we had reached the northern limit of possibility in this area steepsided mountains gave way to precipitous cliffs that plunged almost vertically into the sea hew far doesthis go north i asked ten twelve miles to the head of loch lairg know h flown up there a score of times caves nary a cave i hadnt really thought that there would be how about the oilier side i pointed to the west where the mountainous shoreline not five miles away yet barely visible through the driving rain and low scudding cloud ran in almost sheer drop from the head of loch lairg to the entrance to torbay sound even the gulls cant find a foothold there believe me i believed him we flew back the way we had come as far as our starting point on the coast then continued southwards from the isle of torbay to the mainland the sea was an almost unbroken mass of foaming white big whitecapped rollers marching eastwards across the darkened firth long creamy lines of spume torn from the wavetops veining the troughs between there wasnt a single craft in sight even the big drifters had stayed at home it was as bad as that in that buffeting galeforce wind our big helicopter was having a bad time of it now violently shaking and swaying like an outofcontrol express train in the last moments before it leaves the track one hours flying in those conditions had turned me against helicopters for life but when i thought of what h would be like down there in a boat in that seething maelstrom of a firth i could feel a positive bond of attachment growing between me and that damned helicopter we flew twenty miles south if the way we were being jarred and flung through the air could be called flying but covered sixty miles in that southing every little sound between the islands and the mainland every natural harbour every sealoch and inlet had to be investigated we flew very low most of the time not much above two hundred feet sometimes we were forced down to a hundred feet so heavy was the rain and so powerful the wind now battering against the streaming windscreen that the wipers were almost useless and we had to get as low as possible to see anything at all as it was i dont think we missed a yard of the coastline of the mainland or the close inshore islands we saw everything and we saw nothing i looked at my watch ninethirty the day wearing on and nothing achieved i said how much more of this can the helicopter stand ive been miles out over the atlantic in weather a damn sight worse than this lieutenant williams showed no signs of strain or anxiety or fatigue if anything he seemed to be enjoying himself the point is how much more can you stand very little but well have to back to where you picked me up and well make a circuit of the coast of torbay south coast first then north up the west coast then east past torbay and down the southern shore of the sound yours to command williams brought the helicopter round to the northwest in a swinging sideslipping movement that didnt do my stomach any good youll find coffee and sandwiches in that box there i left the sandwiches and coffee where they were it took us almost forty minutes to cover the twentyfive miles to the eastern tip of the isle of torbay that wind took us two steps back for every three forward visibility was so bad that williams flew on instruments the whole way and with that violent crosswind blowing he should have missed our target by miles instead he hit that sandy cove right on the nose as if hed been flying in on a radio beacon i was beginning to have a very great deal of confidence in williams a man who knew exactly what he was doing i was beginning to have no confidence at all in myself and to wonder if i had any idea in the world what i was doing i thought about uncle arthur and quickly decided id rather think about something else there williams pointed we were about halfway along the south coast of torbay a likely setup wouldnt you say and a likely setup it was a large white threestory stonebuilt georgian house set in a clearing about a hundred yards back from and thirty yards above the shore there are dozens of such houses scattered in the most unlikely positions in some of the most barren and desolate islands in the hebrides heaven only knew who built them why or how but it wasnt the house that was the focal point of interest in this case it was the big boathouse on the edge of a tiny landlocked harbour without a further word from me williams brought the big machine down neatly in the shelter of the trees behind the house i unwrapped the polythene bag id been carrying under my shirt two guns the luger i stuck in my pocket the little german lilliput i fixed to the spring clip in my left sleeve williams stared unconcernedly ahead and began to whistle to himself nobody had lived in that house for years part of the roof had fallen in years of salt air erosion had removed all paintwork and the rooms when i looked in through the cracked and broken windows were bare and crumbling with long strips of wallpaper lying on the floor the path down to the little harbour was completely overgrown with moss every time my heel sunk into the path a deep muddy mark was left behind the first made there for a long long time the boatshed was big enough at least sixty by twenty but that was all that could be said for it the two big doors had three hinges apiece and two huge padlocks where they met in the middle padlocks and hinges alike were almost eaten through by rust i could feel the heavy tug of the luger in my pocket and the weight made me feel faintly ridiculous i went back to the helicopter twice more in the next twenty minutes we came across almost identical situations big white georgian houses with big boathouses at their feet i knew they would be false alarms but i had to check them both false alarms they were the last occupants of those houses had been dead before id been born people had lived in those houses once people with families big families people with money and ambition and confidence and no fear at all of the future not if they had built houses as big as those and now the people were gone and all that was left were those crumbling mouldering monuments to a misplaced faith in the future some years previously id seen houses in plantations in south carolina and georgia houses widely dissimilar but exactly the same whiteporticoed antebellum houses hemmed in by evergreen live oaks and overgrown with long grey festoons of spanish moss sadness and desolation and a world that was gone for ever the west coast of the isle of torbay yielded nothing we gave the town of torbay and garve island a wide berth and flew eastwards down the southern shore of the sound with the gale behind us two small hamlets each with its disintegrating pier beyond that nothing we reached the sandy cove again flew north till we reached the northern shore of the sound then westwards along this shore we stopped twice once to investigate a treeoverhung landlocked harbour less than forty yards in diameter and again to investigate a small complex of industrial buildings which had once so williams said produced a finequality sand that bad been one of the ingredients in a famous brand of toothpaste again nothing at the last place we stopped for five minutes lieutenant williams said he was hungry i wasnt id become used to the helicopter by now but i wasnt hungry it was midday half our tune gone and nothing accomplished and it was beginning to look very much as if nothing was going to be accomplished uncle arthur would be pleased i took the chart from williams we have to pick and choose i said well have to take a chance well go up the sound to dolman head opposite garve island then go up loch hynart loch hynart was a seven mile long loch winding and manyislanded that ran more or less due east nowhere more than half a mile wide deep into the heart of the mountain massif back to dolman point again then along the southern shore of the mainland peninsula again as far as carrara point then east along the southern shore of loch houron loch houron williams nodded the wildest waters and the worst place for boats in the west of scotland last place id go looking mr calvert thats for sure from all accounts youll find nothing there but wrecks and skeletons there are more reefs and skerries and underwater rocks and overfalls and whirlpools and tidal races in twenty miles there than in the whole of the rest of scotland local fishermen wont go near the place he pointed at the chart see this passage betwen dubh sgeir and ballara island the two islands at the mouth of loch houron thats the most feared spot of all you should see the grip the fishermen get on their whisky glasses when they talk about it beul nan uamh its called the mouth of the grave theyre a cheery lot hereabouts its time we were gone the wind blew as strongly as ever the sea below looked as wicked as ever but the rain had stopped and that made our search all that much easier the stretch of the sound from the sand quarry to dolman point yielded nothing neither did loch hynart between loch hynart and carrara point eight miles to the west there were only two tiny hamlets crouched against the waters edge their backs to the barren hills behind their inhabitants if there were any inhabitants subsisting on god alone knew what carrara point was stormtorn desolation itself great jagged broken fissured cliffs huge fanged rocks rising from the sea massive atlantic breakers smashing in hundred foot high spray against the cliffs the rocks and the tinyseeming lighthouse at the foot of the cliffs if i were sir billy butlin looking for the site for my latest holiday camp i wouldnt have spent too much time on carrara point we turned north now then northeast then east along the southern shore of loch houron many places have evil reputations few at first seeing live up to those reputations but there are a few in scotland the pass of glencoej the scene of the infamous massacre is one of them the pass of brander is another and loch houron was beyond all doubt another it required no imagination at all to see this as a dark and deadly and dangerous place it looked dark and deadly and dangerous the shores were black and rocky and precipitous and devoid of any form of vegetation at all the four islands strung out in a line to the east were a splendid match for the hospitable appearance of the shores in the far distance the northern and the southern shores of the loch came close together and vanished in a towering vertical cleft in the sinister brooding mountains in the lee of the islands the loch was black as midnight but elsewhere it was a seething boiling white the waters wickedly swirling churning spinning in evillooking whirlpools as it passed across overfalls or forced its way through the narrow channels between the islands or between the islands and the shore water in torment in the beul nan uarnh the mouth of the grave between the first two islands the rushing leaping milkwhite waters looked like floodwater in the mackenzie river rapids in springtime when the snows melt a yachtsmans paradise only a madman would take his boat into these waters apparently there were still a few madmen around wed just left the first of the islands dubh sgeir to port when i caught sight of a narrow break in the cliffs on the southern mainland a small rockgirt bay if bay it could be called about the size of a couple of tennis courts almost completely enclosed from the sea the entrance couldnt have been more than ten yards wide i glanced at the chart little horseshoe bay it was called not original but very apt there was a boat in there a fairly big one a converted mfv by the looks of her anchored fore and aft in the middle of the bay behind the bay was a little plateau mossy or grasscovered i couldnt tell which and behind that what looked like a driedup river bed rising steeply into the hills behind on the little plateau were four khakicoloured tents with men working at them this could be it williams said this could be it this wasnt it a glance at the thin wispybearded pebblebespectacled lad who came hurrying forward to greet me when i stepped on to the ground was all the proof i required that this was indeed not it another glance at the seven or eight bearded scarved and duffelcoated characters behind him who had not as id thought been working but were struggling to prevent their tents from being blown away by the wind was almost superfluous proof that lot couldnt have hijacked a rowing boat the mfv i could see now was down by the stern and listing heavily to starboard hallo hallo hallo said the character with the wispy beard good afternoon good afternoon by jove are we glad to see you i looked at him shook the outstretched hand glanced at the listing boat and said mildly you may be shipwrecked but those are hardly what id call desperate straits youre not on a deserted island youre on the mainland help is at hand oh we know where we are all right he waved a deprecating hand we put in here three days ago but im afraid our boat was holed in a storm duringthe night most unfortunate most inconvenient holed as she lay there just as shes moored now yes indeed bad luck oxford or cambridge oxford of course he seemed a bit huffed at my ignorance combined geological and marine biological party no shortage of rocks and seawater hereabouts i agreed how bad is the damage a holed plank sprung too much for us im afraid all right for food of course no transmitter receiver only the helicopter pilot will radio for a shipwright and engineer to be sent out as soon as the weather moderates goodbye his jaw fell about a couple of inches youre off just like that airsea rescue vessel reported sinking last night ah that we heard thought you might be it glad for your sakes youre not weve a lot of ground to cover yet we continued eastwards towards the head of loch houron halfway there i said far enough lets have a look at those four islands out in the loch we start with the most easterly one first of all whats it called yes eilean oran then make our way back towards the mouth of loch houron again you said you wanted to go all the way to the top ive changed my mind youre the man who pays the piper he said equably he was a singularly incurious character was young lieutenant williams northward ho for eilean oran we were over eilean oran in three minutes compared to eilean oran alcatraz was a green and lovely holiday resort half a square mile of solid rock and never a blade of grass in sight but there was a house a house with smoke coming from its chimney and beside it a boatshed but no boat the smoke meant an inhabitant at least one inhabitant and however he earned his living he certainly didnt do it from tilling the good earth so he would have a boat a boat for fishing for his livelihood a boat for transportation to the mainland for one certain thing among the manifold uncertainties of this world was that no passenger vessel had called at eilean oran since robert fulton had invented the steamboat williams set me down not twenty yards from the shed i rounded the comer of the boathouse and stopped abruptly i always stop abruptly when im struck in the stomach by a batteringram after a few minutes i managed to whoop enough air into my lungs to let me straighten up again he was tall gaunt grey in his middle sixties he hadnt shaved for a week or changed his collarless shirt in a month it wasnt a batteringram hed used after all it was a gun none of your fancy pistols just a good oldfashioned doublebarrelied twelvebore shotgun the kind of gun that at close range six inches in this case can give points even to the peacemaker colt when it comes to blowing your head off he had it aimed at my right eye it was lite staring down the mersey tunnel when he spoke i could see hed missed out on all those books that laud the unfailing courtesy of the highlander and who the hell are you he snarled my names johnson put that gun away i and what the hell do you want here how about trying the ceud mile failte approach i said you see it everywhere in those parts a hundred thousand welcomes i wont ask again mister airsea rescue theres a missing boat i havent seen any boat you can just get to hell off my island he lowered his gun till it pointed at my stomach maybe because he thought it would be more effective there or make for a less messy job when it came to burying me now i nodded to the gun you could get prison for this maybe i could and maybe i couldnt all i know is that i dont like strangers on my island and that donald maceachern protects his own and a very good job you make of it too donald i said approvingly the gun moved and i said quickly im off and dont bother saying haste ye back for i wont be as we rose from the island williams said i just caught a glimpse that was a gun he had there it wasnt the outstretched hand of friendship theyre always talking about in those parts i said bitterly who is he what is he hes an undercover agent for the scottish tourist board in secret training to be their goodwill ambassador abroad hes not any of those im looking for that i know hes not a nut case either hes as sane as you are hes a worried man and a desperate one you didnt look in the shed you wanted to find out about a boat maybe there was someone pointing a gun at him that was one of the thoughts that accounted for my rapid departure i could have taken the gun from him you could have got your head blown off guns are my business the safety catch was in the on position sorry williamss face showed how out of his depth he was he wasnt as good at concealing his expression as i was what now island number two to the west here i glanced at the chart craigmore youll be wasting your time going there he sounded very positive ive been there flew out a badly injured man to a glasgow hospital injured how hed cut himself to the thighbone with a flensing knife infection had set in a flensing knife for whales id never heard for sharks basking sharks theyre as common as mackerel hereabouts catch them for their livers you can get a ton of liver oil from a goodsized one he pointed to the chart to a tiny mark on the north coast craigmore village been abandoned they say from before the first world war were coming up to it now some of those old boys built their homes in the damnedest places some of those old boys had indeed built their homes in the damnedest places if id been compelled to build a home either there or at the north pole id have been hard put to it to make a choice a huddle of four small grey houses built out near the tip of a foreland several wicked reefs that made a natural breakwater an even more wickedlooking entrance through the reefs and two fishing boats swinging and rolling wildly at anchor inside the reefs one of the houses the one nearest the shore had had its entire seaward wall cut away on the twenty or thirty feet of sloping ground that separated the house from the sea could see three unmistakable sharks a handful of men appeared at the open end of the house and waved at us thats one way of making a living can you put me down what do you think mr calvert i dont think you can not unless he set his helicopter down on top of one of the little houses that was you winched this sick man up yes and id rather not winch you down if you dont mind not in this weather and not without a crewman to help me unless youre desperate not all that desperate would you vouch for them id vouch for them theyre a good bunch ive met the boss tim hutchinson an aussie about the size of a house several times most of the fishermen on the west coast would vouch for them fair enough the next island is ballara we circled ballara once once was enough not even a barnacle would have made his home in ballara we were over the channel between ballara and dubh sgeir now and the beul nan uamh was a sight to daunt even the stoutesthearted fish it certainly daunted me five minutes in that lot whether in a boat or scuba suit and that would have been that the ebbtide and the wind were in headon collision and the result was the most spectacular witches cauldron id ever seen there were no waves as such just a bubbling swirling seething maelstrom of whirlpools overfalls and races running no way and every way gleaming boiling white in the overfalls and races dark and smooth and evil in the hearts of the whirlpools not a place to take aunty gladys out in a rowboat for a gentle paddle in the quiet even fall oddly enough close in to the east and south coast of dubh sgeir one could have taken aunty gladys out in those tidal races between islands a common but not yet clearly understood phenomenon frequently leaves an undisturbed stretch of water close in to one or other of the shores calm and smooth and fiat a millpond with a sharply outlined boundary between h and the foaming races beyond so it was here for almost a mile between the most southerly and easterly headlands of dubh sgeir for a distance of two or three hundred yards out from the shore the waters were black and still it was uncanny sure you really want to land here williams asked is h tricky easy helicopters often land on dubh sgeir not mine others its just that youre likely to get the same reception here as you got on eilean oran there are dozens of privately owned islands off the west coast and none of them like uninvited visitors the owner of dubh sgeir hates them this worldfamous highland hospitality becomes positively embarrassing at times the scotsmans home is his castle eh there is a castle here the ancestral home of the dan dalwhinnie i think dalwhinnies a town not a clan well something unpronounceable that was good considering that he like as not hailed from rhosllanerchrugog or pomrhydfendgaid hes the clan chief lord kirkside exlord lieutenant of the shire very important citizen but a bit of a recluse now seldom leaves the place except to attend highland games or go south about once a mouth to flay the archbishop of canterbury inthe lords must be difficult for him to tell which place hes at at times ive heard of him used to have a very low opinion of the commons and made a long speech to that effect every other day thats him but not any more lost his older son and his future soninlaw in an air accident some time ago took the heart from the old boy so they say people in these parts think the world of him we were round to the south of dubh sgeir now and suddenly the castle was in sight despite its crenulated battlements round towers and embrasures it didnt begin to rank with the windsors and balmorals of this world a pocket castle but the side had the windsors and balmorals whacked to the wide it grew straight out of the top of a hundred and fifty foot cliff and if you leaned too far out of your bedroom window the first thing to stop your fall would be the rocks a long long way down you wouldnt even bounce once below the castle and a fair way to the right of it a clifffall belonging to some bygone age had created an artificial foreshore some thirty yards wide from this obviously at the cost of immense labour an artificial harbour had been scooped out the boulders and rubble having been used for the construction of a horseshoe breakwater with an entrance of not more than six or seven yards in width at the inner end of this harbour a boathouse no wider than the harbour entrance and less than twenty feet in length had been constructed against the cliff face a boathouse to berth a goodsized rowboat no more williams took his machine up until we were two hundred feet above the castle it was built in the form of a hollow square with the landward side missing the seaward side was dominated by two crenulated towers one topped by a twentyfoot flagpole and flag the other by an even taller tv mast aesthetically the flagpole had it every time surprisingly the island was not as barren as it had appeared from the sea beginning some distance from the castle and extending clear to the cliffbound northern shore of the island ran a two hundred yard wide stretch of what seemed to be flat smooth turf not the bowling green standard but undoubtedly grass of the genuine variety as testified to by the heads down position of a handful of goats that browsed close to the castle williams tried to land on the grass but the wind was too strong to allow him to hold position he finally put down in the eastern ke of the castle close but not too close to the cliff edge i got out keeping a wary eye on the goats and was rounding the landward corner of the castle when i almost literally bumped into the girl ive always known what to look for in a suddenlyencountered girl in a remote hebridean island a kilt of course a hebridean girl without a kilt was unthinkable a shetland twopiece and brown brogues and that she would be a ravenhaired beauty with wild green fey eyes went without saying her name would be deirdre this one wasnt like that at all except for the eyes which were neither green nor fey but certainly looked wild enough what little i could see of them that was her blonde hair was cut in the uniform peekaboo scalloped style of the day the one where the long side hair meets under the chin and the central fringe is hacked off at eyebrow level a coiffure which in any wind above force i allows no more than ten per cent of the face to be seen at any one time below hair level she wore a horizontally striped blue and white sailors jersey and faded blue denim pants that must have been fixed on with a portable sewing machine as i didnt see how else she could have got into them her tanned feet were bare it was comforting to see that the civilising influence of television reached even the remoter outposts of empire i said good afternoon miss um engine failure she asked coldly well no mechanical failure of any kind no then this is private property i must ask you to leave at once please there seemed to be little for me here an outstretched hand and a warm smile of welcome and shed have been on my list of suspects at once but this was true to established form the weary stranger at the gates receiving not the palm of the hand but the back of it apart from the fact that she lacked a blunderbuss and had a much better figure she had a great deal in common with mr maceachera i bent forward to peer through the windblown camouflage of blonde hair she looked as if she had spent most of the night and half the morning down in the castle wine cellars pale face pale lips dark smudges under the bluegrey eyes but clear bluegrey eyes what the hells the matter with you she demanded nothing the end of a dream deirdre would never have talked like that wheres your old man my old man the one eye i could see had the power turned up to its maximum shrivelling voltage you mean my father sorry lord kirkside it was no feat to guess that she was lord kirksides daughter hired help are too ignorant to have the execrable manners of their aristocratic betters im lord kirkside i turned round to see the owner of the deep voice behind me a tall ruggedoofcing character in his fifties hawk nose jutting grey eyebrows and moustache grey tweeds grey deerstalker hawthorn stick in hand whats the trouble sue sue i might have known exit the last vestige of the hebridean dream i said my name is johnson airsea rescue there was a boat the moray rose in badtrouble somewhere south of skye if shed been not under command but still afloat she might have come drifting this way we wondered and sue was going to fling you over the cliff before you had a chance to open your mouth he smiled down affectionately at his daughter thats my sue im afraid she doesnt like newspapermen some do and some dont but why pick on me when you were twentyone could you as the saying goes tell a newspaperman from a human being i couldnt but i can now a mile away i can also tell a genuine airsea rescue helicopter when i see one and so should yon too young lady fm sorry mr johnson we cant help you my men and i spent several hours last night patrolling the clifftops to see if we could sec anything lights flares anything nothing tm afraid thank you sir i wish we had more voluntary cooperation of this kind from where i stood i could see due south the gently rocking masts of the oxford field expeditions boat in little horseshoe bay the boat itself and the tents beyond were hidden behind the rocky eastern arm of the bay i said to lord kirkside but why newspapermen sir dubh sgeir isnt quite as accessible as westminster indeed mr johnson he smiled not with his eyes you may have heard of well of our family tragedy my elder hoy jonathan and john rollinson sues fiancé knew what was coming and after all those months she had those smudges under her eyes she must have loved him a lot i could hardly believe it im no newspaperman sir prying isnt my business it wasnt my business it was my life the raison d etre for my existence but now wasnt the time to tell him the air accident jonathan had his own private beechcraft he waved towards the stretch of green turf running to the northern cliffs he took off from here that morning they the reporters wanted onthespot reporting they came by helicopter and boat theres a landing stage to the west again the mirthless smile they werent well received care for a drink you and your pilot lord kirkside for all the reputation williams had given him seemed to be cast in a different mould from his daughter and mr donald maceachern on the other hand as the archbishop of canterbury knew to his cost lord kirkside was a very much tougher citizen than either his daughter or mr maceachern thank you sir i appreciate that but we havent many hours of daylight left of course of course how thoughtless of me but you cant have much hope left by this time frankly none but well you know bow it is sir well cross our fingers for that one chance in a million good luck mr johnson he shook my hand and turned away his daughter hesitated then held out her hand and smiled a fluke of the wind had blown the hair off her face and when she smiled like that sooty eyes or not the end of deirdre and the hebridean dream didnt seem to be of so much account after all i went back to the helicopter were getting low on both fuel and time williams said another hour or so and well have the dark with us where now mr calvert north follow this patch of grass seems it used to be used as a light aircraft runway out over the edge of the cliff take your time so he did taking his time as id asked him then continued on a northward course for another ten minutes after we were out of sight of watchers on any of the islands we came round in a great half circle to west and south and east and headed back for home the sun was down and the world below was more night than day as we came in to land on the sandy cove on the eastern side of the isle of torbay could just vaguely distinguish the blackness of the treeclad island the faint silvery gleam of the sand and the semicircular whiteness where the jagged reef of rocks fringed the seaward approach to the cove it looked a very dicey approach indeed to me but williams was as unworried as a mother at a babyshow who has already slipped the judge a fivepound note well if he wasnt going to worry neither was i i knew nothing about helicopters but i knew enough about men to recognise a superb pilot when i sat beside one ah i had to worry about was that damned walk back through those stygian woods one thing i didnt have to run this time williams reached up his hand to flick on the landing lights but the light came on a fraction of a second before his fingers touched the switch not from the helicopter but from the ground a bright light a dazzling light at least a fiveinch searchlight located between the highwater line of the cove and the treeline beyond for a moment the light wavered then steadied on the cockpit of the helicopter making the interior bright as the light from the noonday sun i twisted my head to one side to avoid the glare i saw williams throw up a hand to protect his eyes then slump forward wearily dead in his seat as the white linen of his shirt turned to red and the centre of his chest disintegrated i flung myself forwards and downwards to try to gain what illusory shelter i could from the cannonading submachine shells shattering the windscreen the helicopter was out of control dipping sharply forwards and spinning slowly on its axis i reached out to grab the controls from the dead mans hands but even as i did the trajectory of the bullets changed either because the man with the machinegun had altered his aim or because hed been caught offbalance by the sudden dipping of the helicopter an abruptly mad cacophony of sound the iron clangour of steelnosed bullets smashing into the engine casing mingled with the banshee ricochet of spent and mangled shells the engine stopped stopped as suddenly as if the ignition had been switched off the helicopter was completely out of control lifeless in the sky it wasnt going to be in the sky much longer but there was nothing i could do about it i braced myself for the jarring moment of impact when we struck the water and when the impact came it was not just jarring it was shattering to a degree i would never have anticipated wed landed not in the water but on the encircling reef of rocks i tried to get at the door but couldnt make it wed landed nose down and facing seawards on the outside of the reefs and from the position where id been hurled under the instrument panel the door was above and beyond my reach i was too dazed too weak to make any real effort to get at it icy water poured in through the smashed windscreen and the fractured floor of the fuselage for a moment everything was as silent as the grave the hiss of the flooding waters seemed only to emphasise the silence then the machinegun started again the shells smashed through the lower after part of the fuselage behind me and went out through the top of the windscreen above me twice i felt angry tugs on the right shoulder of my coat and i tried to bury my head even more deeply into the freezing waters then due probably to a combination of an accumulation of water in the nose and the effect of the fusillade of bullets aft the helicopter lurched forwards stopped momentarily then slid off the face of the reef and fell like a stone nose first to the bottom of the sea five wednesday dusk pm among the more ridiculous and wholly unsubstantiated fictions perpetuated by people who dont know what they are talking about is the particularly halfwitted one that death by drowning is peaceful easy and in fact downright pleasant its not its a terrible way to die i know because i was drowning and i didnt like it one little bit my ballooning head felt as if it were being pumped full of compressed air my ears and eyes ached savagely my nostrils mouth and stomach were full of sea water and my bursting lungs felt as if someone had filled them with petrol and struck a match maybe if i opened my mouth maybe if to relieve that flaming agony that was my lungs i took that one great gasping breath that would be the last i would ever take maybe then it would be quiet and pleasant and peaceful on die form to date i couldnt believe it the damned door was jammed after the beating the fuselage had taken first of all in smashing into the reef and then into the seabed it would be a miracle if it hadnt jammed i pushed the door i pulled at it i beat at it with my clenched fists it stayed jammed the blood roared and hissed in my ears the flaming vice around my chest was crushing my ribs and lungs crushing the life out of me i braced both feet on the instrument panel laid both hands on the door handle i thrust with my legs and twisted with my hands using the power and the leverage a man can use only when he knows he is dying the door handle sheared the thrust of my legs carried me backwards and upwards toward the after end of the fuselage and suddenly my lungs could take no more death couldnt be worse than this agony the air rushed out through my waterfilled mouth and nostrils and i sucked in this one great gasping breath this lungful of seawater this last i would ever it wasnt a lungful of water it was a lungful of air noxious compressed air laden with the fumes of petrol and oil but air for all that not the tangy saltladen air of the western isles not the wineladen air of the aegean the pineladen air of norway or the sparkling champagne air of the high alps all those id tasted and all of them put together were a thin and anaemic substitute for this marvellous mixture of nitrogen and oxygen and petrol and oil that had been trapped in an air pocket under the undamaged upper rear part of the helicopters fuselage the only part of the plane that hadnt been riddled by machinegun bullets this was air as it ought to be the water level was around my neck i took half a dozen deep whooping breaths enough to ease the fire in my lungs and the roaring and hissing and dizziness in my head to tolerable levels then pushed myself backwards and upwards to the extreme limit of the fuselage the water was at chest level now i moved a hand around in the blind darkness to try to estimate the amount of air available to me impossible to judge accurately but enough i guessed compressed as it was to last for ten to fifteen minutes i moved across to the left of the fuselage took a deep breath and pushed myself forwards and downwards eight feet behind the pilots seat was the passenger door maybe i could force that i found it right away not the door but the opening where the door had been the impact that had jammed the door on the righthand side where id been had burst this door open i pushed myself back to the upper part of the fuselage again and helped myself to a few more deep breaths of that compressed air it didnt taste quite so good as it had done the first time now that i knew i could go at any time i was in no hurry to leave up above guns in hand those men would be waiting and if there was one outstanding attribute that characterised their attitude to work on hand it was a singleminded thoroughness where those lads were concerned a job half done was no job at all they could only have come there by boat and that boat would have been very nearby by this time it would be even nearer by it would be sitting directly over the spot where the helicopter had gone down and the crew wouldnt be sitting around with drinks in their hands congratulating themselves on their success theyd be lining the side with searchlights or flashes and waiting to see if anyone would break surface with their guns in their hands if i ever got back to the firecrest again if i ever pot in touch with uncle arthur again i wondered dully what i would say to him already id lost die nantesville already id been responsible for the deaths of baker and delmont already id given away to the unknown enemy the secret of my identity if that hadnt been obvious after the fake customs officers had smashed our transmitter it was bitterly obvious now and now id lost lieutenant scott williams his life and the navy a valuable helicopter of uncle arthurs fortyeight hours onlytwelve were left now and nothing could be more certain than when uncle arthur had finished with me i wouldnt be allowed even those twelve hours after uncle arthur had finished with me my days as an investigator would be finished and finished for ever with the kind of references hed give me i wouldnt even qualify as a store detective in a street barrow not that it would make any difference what uncle arthur thought now baker and delmont and williams were gone there was a heavy debt that had to be paid and the matter was out of uncle arthurs bands now on the form to date i thought bleakly there wasnt one bookmaker in the land who would have given odds of one in a thousand of that debt ever being repaid only a fool bets against a certainty wondered vaguely how long the men up top would wait my conviction that they would be waiting was absolute and then i felt a dry salty taste in my mouth that had nothing to do with the steadily deteriorating quality of air it was pretty foul by this time but a man can survive a surprisingly long time in foul air and there was enough oxygen left in that heavily tainted atmosphere to last me for a good few minutes yet the question was not how long they would wait but bow long i could wait or had i already waited too long i could feel the panic in my throat like some solid lump in my windpipe completely obstructing my breathing and had to make a conscious physical effort to force it down i tried to recall all i could from my marine salvage days how long had i been under water and how deep down was i how long had that dive down from the surface of the sea to the bottom taken under those conditions time loses all meaning say forty seconds just over halfway down id taken my last gulp of air before the water in the fuselage had flooded over my head and then a minute probably a minute and a half fighting with that jammed door since then a minute to recover half a minute to locate that open door and then how long since six minutes seven not less than seven i couldnt reckon on a total of less than ten minutes the lump was back in my throat again how deep was i that was the lifeordeath question i could tell from the pressure that i war pretty deep but how deep ten fathoms fifteen twenty i tried to recall the chart of torbay sound there were eighty fathoms in the deepest channel and the channel was pretty close to the southern shore at this point so that the water was steepto god above i might even be in twentyfive fathoms if i was well that was it finish how did the decompression tables go again at thirty fathoms a man who has been under water for ten minutes requires to spend eighteen minutes for decompression stops on the way up when you breathe air under pressure the excess nitrogen is stored in the tissues when you begin to surface this nitrogen is carried by the bloodstream to the lungs and is eliminated in respiration and if you rise too rapidly respiration cant cope with it and nitrogen bubbles form in the blood causing the agonising and crippling divers bends even at twenty fathoms id require a sixminute hah for decompression on the way up and if there was one certain fact in life it was that decompression stops were out for me id be a broken man what i did know for certain was that every additional second i remained there would make the bends all the more agonising and crippling when they finally struck all at once the prospect of surfacing beneath the steady guns and the pitiless eyes of the men above seemed positively attractive compared to the alternative i took several deep breaths to get as much oxygen as possible into my bloodstream exhaled to the fullest extent took a long final breath to fill every last cubic millimetre in every last nook and cranny in my lungs dived under the water pushed my way out through the doorway and made for the surface id lost count of time on the way down and i now lost all count of time on the way up i swam slowly and steadily using enough power to assist my progress through the water but not so much as prematurely to use up all the stored oxygen every few seconds i let a little air escape from my mouth not much just enough to ease the pressure in my lungs i looked up but the waters above me were as black as ink there could have been fifty fathoms above my head for any trace of light i could see and then suddenly quite some time before the air supply was exhausted and before my lungs had begun to hurt again the water was a shade less than pitch black and my head struck something hard and unyielding i grabbed it held on surfaced sucked in some lungfuls of that cold salt wonderful air and waited for the decompression pains to start those sharply agonising twinges in the joints of the limbs but none came i couldnt have been more than fifteen fathoms down and even then i should have felt something it had probably been something nearer ten during the past ten minutes my mind had taken as much a beating as any other part of me but it would have to have been in very much poorer shape than it was for me not to recognise what i was clinging to a boats rudder and if any confirmation had been required the milkily phosphorescent water being turned up by the two slowly turning screws a couple of feet ahead of me would have been all that was required id surfaced right under their boat i was lucky i might have surfaced right under one of their propellers and had my head cut in half even now if the man at the wheel suddenly decided to go astern id be sucked into the vortex of one or other of the screws and end up like something that had passed through a turnipcutting machine but id been through to much to cross any bridges before i came to them off to port i could see sharply illuminated by a couple of powerful lights from the boats deck the reef where wed crashed we were about forty yards away and relative to the reefs stationary in the water the enginesturning just enough to maintain the boats position against the effect of wind and tide now and again a searchlight patrolled the dark waters all around i couldnt see anything of the men on deck but i didnt have to be told what they were doing they were waiting and watching and the safety catches would be off nor could i see anything of the boat itself but i made up my mind that even though i couldnt recognise it id know it if i ever came across it again i took out the knife from the sheath behind my neck and cut a deep vee notch in the trailing edge of the rudder for the first time i heard voices i heard four voices and i had no difficulty in the world in identifying any of them if i lived to make methuselah look a teenager id never forget any one of them nothing on your side quinn captain imrie the man who had organised the manhunt for me aboard the nantesville nothing on my side captain i could feel the hairs rise on the nape of my neck quinn durran the bogus customs officer the man who had almost but not quite strangled me to death your side jacques captain imrie again nothing sir the machinepistol specialist eight minutes since weve been here fifteen since they went under a man would require pretty good lungs to stay down that long captain enough imrie said therell be a bonus for all of us for this nights work kramer captain imrie a voice as guttural as imries own full ahead up the sound i thrust myself backwards and dived deep the waters above my head boiled into turbulent phosphorescent life i stayed deep maybe ten feet down heading for the reef how long i swam like that i dont know certainly less than a minute my lungs werent what they used to be not even what they had been fifteen minutes ago but when i was forced to the surface id my dark oilskin over my head i neednt have bothered i could see the faintly shimmering outline of the disappearing wake no more the searchlights were extinguished when captain imrie decided a job was finished then that job was finished predictably the boat was in complete darkness with neither interior nor navigation lights showing i turned and swam slowly towards the reef i reached a rock and clung to it until a measure of strength returned to my aching muscles to my exhausted body i would not have believed that fifteen minutes could have taken so much out of a man i stayed there for five minutes i could have stayed there for an hour but time was not on my side i slipped into deep water again and made for the shore three times i tried and three times i failed to pull myself up from the rubber dinghy over the gunwale of the firecrest four feet no more just four feet a matterhorn a tenyearold could have done it but not calvert calvert was an old old man i called out for hunslett but hunslett did not come three times i called but he did not come the firecrest was dark and still and lifeless where the hell was he asleep ashore no not ashore hed promised to stay aboard in case word came through at any time from uncle arthur asleep then asleep in his cabin i felt the blind unreasoning anger rise this was too much after what i had been through this was too much asleep i shouted at the top of my voice and hammered feebly on the steel hull with the butt of my luger but he didnt come the fourth time i made it it was touch and go but i made it for a few seconds dinghy painter in hand i teetered on my stomach on the edge of the gunwale then managed to drag myself aboard i secured the painter and went in search of hunslett there were words i wished to have with hunslett i never used them he wasnt aboard i searched the firecrest from forepeak to the after storage locker but no hunslett no signs of a hasty departure no remnants of a meal on the saloon table or unwashed dishes in the galley no signs of any struggle everything neat and in good order everything as it ought to have been except that there was no hunslett for a minute or two i sat slumped in the saloon settee trying to figure out a reason for his absence but only for a minute or two i was in no condition to figure out anything wearily i made my way out to the upper deck and brought dinghy and outboard over the side no fancy tricks about securing them to the anchor chain this time apart from the fact that it was the way i felt physically impossible the time for that was past i deflated the dinghy and stowed it along with the outboard in the after locker and if someone came aboard and started looking if someone came aboard and started looking hed get a bullet through him i didnt care if he claimed to be a police superintendent or an assistant commissioner or the top customs official in the country hed get a bullet through him in the arm or leg say and id listen to his explanations afterwards if it was one of my friends one of my friends from nantesville or the reef back there he got it through the head i went below i felt sick the helicopter was at the bottom of the sea the pilot was down there with it half his chest shot away by machinegun bullets id every right to feel sick i stripped off my clothes and towelled myself dry and the very action of towelling seemed to drain away what little strength was left to me sure id had a hard time in the last hour all this running and slipping and stumbling through the dark woods locating and blowing up the dinghy and dragging it over those damned seaweed covered boulders had taken it out of me but i was supposed to be fit it shouldnt have left me like this i was sick but the sickness was inthe heart and mind not in the body i went into my cabin and laboriously dressed myself in fresh clothes not forgetting the paisley scarf the rainbow coloured bruises that quinn had kft on my neck had now swollen and spread to such an extent that i had to bring the scarf right up to the lobes of my ears to hide them i looked in the mirror it might have been my grandfather staring back at me my grandfather on his deathbed my face had that drawn and waxy look that one normally associates with approaching dissolution not an allover waxiness though there was no blood on my face now but the pine needles had left their mark i looked like someone with galloping impetigo i felt like someone with galloping bubonic plague i checked that the luger and the little lilliput id put them both back in their waterproof covering after leaving dubh sgeir were still in working order they were in the saloon i poured myself a stiff three fingers of whisky it went down my throat like a ferret down a burrow after a rabbit one moment there the next vanished in the depths the weary old red corpuscles hoisted themselves to their feet and started trudging around again it seemed a reasonable assumption that if i encouraged them with some more of the same treatment they might even break into a slow gallop and i had just closed my hand around the bottle when i heard the sound of an approaching engine i put the bottle back in the rack switched out the saloon lights although they would have been invisible from outside through the velvet curtains and took up position behind the open saloon door i was pretty sure the precautions were unnecessary ten to one this was hunslett coming back from shore but why hadnt he taken the dinghy still slung on the davits aft probably someone for what hunslett had regarded as an excellent reason had persuaded him to go ashore and was now bringing him back the motorboats engine slowed went into neutral astern then neutral again a slight bump the murmur of voices the sound of someone clambering aboard and then the engine opening up again the footfalls passed over my head as the visitor there was only one set of footfalls made his way towards the wheelhouse door the springy confident step of a man who knew what he was about there was only one thing wrong with that springy confident step it didnt belong to hunslett i flattened myself against the bulkhead took out the luger slid off the safety catch and prepared to receive my visitor in what i had now come to regard as the best traditions of the highlands i heard the click as the wheelhouse door opened the louder click as it was shut by a firm hand a pool of light from a flashlamp preceded the visitor down the four steps from the wheelhouse to the saloon he paused at the foot of the steps and the light moved away as he made to locate the lightswitch i stepped round the door and did three things at once i hooked an arm around his neck brought up a far from gentle knee into the small of his back and ground the muzzle of the luger into his right ear violent stuff but not unnecessarily violent stuff it might have been my old friend quinn the gasp of pain was enough to show that it wasnt this isnt a hearing aid you feel friend its a luger pistol youre one pound pressure from a better world dont make me nervous the better world seemed to have no appeal for him he didnt make me nervous he made an odd gurgling noise in his throat he was trying either to speak or breathe but he stood motionless head and back arched i eased the pressure a little put that light switch on with your left hand slowly carefully he was very slow very careful the saloon flooded with light raise your hands above your head as high as you can reach he was a model prisoner this one he did exactly he was told i turned him round propelled him into the centre of the room and told him to face me he was of medium height nattily dressed in an astrakhan coat and a fur cossack hat he had a beautifully trimmed white beard and moustache with a perfectly symmetrical black streak in the centre of the beard the only one of its kind i had ever seen the tanned face was red either from anger or nearsuffocation from both i decided he lowered his hands without permission sat on the settee pulled out a monocle screwed it into his right eye and stared at me with cold fury i gave him look for look stare for stare pocketed the luger poured a whisky and handed it to uncle arthur rearadmiral sir arthur arnfordjason kcb and all the rest of the alphabet you should have knocked sir i said reproachfully i should have knocked his voice sounded halfstrangled maybe i had exerted more pressure than had been necessary do you always greet your guests this way i dont have guests sir i dont have friends either not fn the western isles all i have is enemies anyone who comes through that door is an enemy i didnt expect to see you here sir i hope not in view of that performance i hope not he rubbed his throat drank some whisky and coughed didnt expect to be here myself do you know how much bullion was aboard the nantesville close on a million i understand thats what i understood eight millions think of it eight million pounds worth all this gold thats being shovelled back from europe into the vaults at fort knox usually goes in small lots lb ingots at a time for safety for security in case anything goes wrong but the bank knew that nothing could go wrong this time they knew our agents were aboard they were behind with their payments so they cleverly loaded fourteen hundred and forty ingots without telling anyone eight million the bank is hopping mad and everyone is taking it out on me and hed come up here to take it out on me i said you should have let me know that you were coming i tried to you failed to keep your noonday schedule the most elementary of crimes calvert and the most serious you failed to keep a schedule you or hunslett then i knew things were going from bad to worse i knew i had to take over myself so i came by plane and raf rescue launch that would have been the highspeed jaunch id seen taking a bad battering in the sound as we had headed down towards the cove wheres hunslett i dont know sir you dont know he was using his quiet unemphatic tone the one i didnt care for very much youre out of your depth in this one calvert arent you yes sir im afraid hes been removed by force im not sure how what have you been doing in the past two hours sir explain yourself i wished hed stop screwing that damned monocle into his eye it was no affectation that monocle he was nearly blind on that side but h was an irritating mannerism at that moment anything would have irritated me that raf launch that dropped you off here just now it should have been here at least two hours ago why didnt you come aboard then i did we almost ran the firecrest down in the darkness as we came round the headland no one here so i went and had some dinner nothing but baked beans aboard this damned boat as far as i could see the columbia hotel wouldnt offer you much more toast below the beans if you were lucky the columbia was torbays only hotel i had smoked trout filet mignon and an excellent bottle of hock i dined aboard the shangrila this with the slight him of a smite uncle arthurs achilles heel was showing again uncle arthur loved a lord like nobodys business and a knight with a sevenfigure income was as good as a lord any day the shangrila i stared at him then remembered of course you told me you know lady skouras well no you said you knew her very well and her husband well how is my old sir anthony very well he said coldly uncle arthur had as much humour as the next man but discussing titled millionaires in tones of levity was not humorous and lady skouras he hesitated well not so well pale drawn unhappy with dark smudges under her eyes not unlike myself her husband mistreats her and mistreats her badly mentally and physically he humiliated her in front of a group of men last night and she had rope burns on her arms why would she have rope burns on her arms sir arthur impossible quite fantastic i knew the former lady skouras the one who died this year in hospital she she was undergoing treatment in a mental hospital skouras as good as told me no matter she adored him he adored her a man cant change like that sir anthony sir anthonys a gentleman is he tell me how he made his last millions you saw lady skouras didnt you i saw her he said slowly she was late she arrived with the filet mignon he didnt seem to find anything funny in that she didnt look very well and shes a bruise on her right temple shed fallen climbing aboard from the tender and hit her head against a guardrail hit her head against her husbands fist more like to get back to the first time you boarded the firecrest this evening did you search it i searched it all except the after cabin it was locked i assumed there was something in there you didnt want chance callers to see there was something in there that callers not chance didnt want you to see i said slowly hunslett hunslett under guard they were wafting for word of my death then theyd have lulled hunslett or kept him prisoner if word came through that i hadnt been killed then theyd have waited until my return and taken me prisoner too or killed us both for by then they would have known that i knew too much to be allowed to live it takes time a long time to open up a strongroom and get all those tons of gold out and they know their time is running out theyre desperate now but they still think of everything they were waiting for word of your death uncle arthur said mechanically i dont understand that helicopter you laid on for me sir we were shot down tonight after sunset the pilots dead and the machine is at the bottom of the sea they believe me to be dead also i see you go from strength to strength calvert the absence of reaction was almost total maybe he was getting punchdrunk by this time more likely he was consideringthe precise phraseology that would return me to the ranks of the unemployed with economy and dispatch he lit a long thin and very black cheroot and puffed meditatively when we get back to london remind me to show you my confidential report on you yes sir so this was how it was coming i was having dinner with the undersecretary just fortyeight hours ago one ofthe things he asked me was which country had the best agents in europe told him id no idea but i told him who i thought on the balance of probabilities was the best agent in europe philip calvert that was very kind of you sir if i could remove that beard whisky cheroot and monocle at least three of which were obscuring his face at any given moment his expression might have given me some faint clue as to what was going on in that devious mind you were going to fire me thirtysix hours ago if you believe that uncle arthur said calmly youll believe anything he puffed out a cloud of foul smoke and went on one of the comments in your report states unsuitable for routine investigation loses interest and becomes easily bored operates at his best only under extreme pressure at this level he is unique its on the files calvert i dont cut off my right hand no sir do you know what you are sir a machiavellian old devil uncle arthur said with some satisfaction you know whats going on yes sir pour me another whisky my boy a large one and tell me whats happened what you know and what you think you know so i poured him another whisky a large one and told him what had happened what i knew and as much of what i thought i knew as seemed advisable to tell him he heard me out then said loch houron you think loch houron it must be i spoke to no one else anywhere else and to the best of my knowledge no one else saw me someone recognised me or someonetransmitted my description by radio it must have been by radio the boat that was waiting for williams and myself came from torbay or somewhere near torbay a boat from loch houron could i never have made it to the eastern end of the sound of torbay in five times the time we took somewhere near here on land or sea is a transceiver set somewhere out on loch houron theres another this university expedition boat you saw on the south shore of loch houron this alleged university expedition it would have a radio transmitter aboard no sir boys with beards i rose pulled back the saloon curtains on both sides then sat down again i told you their boat was damaged and listing shed been riding moored fore and aft in plenty of water they didnt hole it themselves and it wasnt holed by any act of nature somebody kindly obliged another of those odd little boating incidents that occur with such profusion up and down the west coast why did you pull those curtains back another of those odd little boating incidents sir one thats about to happen some time tonight people will be coming aboard hunslett and i those people think are dead at least im dead and hunslett is dead or a prisoner but they cant leave an abandoned firecrest at anchor to excite suspicion and invite investigation so theyll come in a boat up anchor and take die firecrest out into the sound followed by their own boat once there theyll slice through the flexible saltwater cooling intake open the saltwater cock take to their own boat and lift their hats as the firecrest goes down to join the helicopter as far as the big wide innocent world is concerned hunslett and i will just have sailed off into the sunset and the gulfs will have washed you down uncle arthur nodded you are very sure of this calvert you might say im absolutely certain then why open those blasted curtains the scuttling party may be coining from anywhere and they may not come for hours the best time to scuttle a boat in close waters is at slack tide when you can be sure that it will settle exactly where you want it to settle and slack tide is not until one oclock this morning but if someone comes panting hotfoot aboard soon after those curtains are opened then that will be proof enough that the radio transmitter were after and our friends who are working the transmitter are somewhere in this bay ashore or afloat how will it be proof uncle arthur said irritably why should they come as you say panting hotfoot they know they have hunslett at least i assume they have i cant think of any other reason for his absence they think they know im dead but they cant be sure then they see the beckoning oil lamp in the window what is this they say to themselves calvert back from the dead or a third or maybe even a third and a fourth colleague of calvert and hunslett that we wot not of whether its me or my friends they must be silenced and silenced at once wouldnt you come panting hotfoot theres no need to treat the matter with levity uncle arthur complained in your own words sir if you can believe that you can believe anything you should have consulted me first calvert uncle arthur shifted in his seat an almost imperceptible motion though his expression didnt change he was a brilliant administrator but the more executive side of the business the sandbagging and pushing of people off high cliffs wasnt exactly in his line ive told you that i came to take charge sorry sir arthur youd better change that report hadnt you the bit about the best in europe i mean touché touché touché he grumbled and theyre coming at us out of the dark is that it on their way now armed men killers shouldnt we shouldnt we be preparing to defend ourselves dammit man i havent even got a gun you wont need one you may not agree with me i handed him the luger he took it checked the indicator and that the safety catch moved easily then sat there holding it awkwardly in his hand shouldnt we move calvert were sitting targets here they wont be here for some time the nearest house or boat is a mile away to the east theyll be pushing wind and tide and they darent use a motor whether theyre rowing a boat or paddling a rubber dinghy they have a long haul ahead of them times short sir we have a lot to do tonight to get back to loch houron the expeditions out they couldnt pirate a dinghy far less five oceangoing freighters our friend donald maceachern acts in a highly suspicious fashion hes got the facilities there hes dead worried and he might have had half a dozen guns at his back while he had his in my front but it was all too good to be true professionals wouldnt lay it on the line like that maybe thats how professionals would expect a fellowprofessional to react and you said hes worried maybe the fish arent biting maybe hes involved but not directly then theres the sharkfishers they have the boats the facilities and heaven knows theyre tough enough against that theyve been based there for years the place is littered with sharks it should be easy enough to check if regular consignments of liver oil are sent to the mainland and theyre well known and well thought of along the coast theyll bear investigating then theres dubh sgeir lord kirkside and his lovely daughter sue lady susan uncle arthur said its difficult to invest an impersonal inflectionless voice with cool reproach but he managed it without any trouble i know lord kirkside of course his tone implied that it would be remarkable if he didnt and while i may or may not be right about sir anthony and i will lay you a hundred to one in pounds that i am im convinced that lord kirkside is wholly incapable of any dishonest or illegal action me too hes a very tough citizen id say but on the side of the angels and his daughter i havent met her very much a girl of today dressed in the modern idiom speaks in the modern idiom im tough and im competent and i can take care of myself thank you shes not tough at all just a nice oldfashioned girl in newfashioned clothes so that clears them uncle arthur sounded relieved that leaves ms the expedition in spite of your sneers or maceacherns place or the sharkfishers i go for the sharkfishers myself i let him go for wherever he wanted to i thought it was time i went to the upper deck and told him so it wont be long now i shouldnt think so sir well put out the lights in the saloon here it would look very odd if they peered in the windows and saw no one here well put on the two sleepingcabin lights and the stern light that will destroy their nightsight the after deck will be bathed in light forard of that as far as they are concerned it will be pitch dark we hide in the dark where in the dark uncle arthur didnt sound very confident you stand inside the wheelhouse all wheelhouse doors are hinged forard and open outwards keep your hand on the inside handle lightly when you feel it begin to turn a very slow and stealthy turn you can bet your boots wait till the door gives a fraction then kick the rear edge just below the handle with the sole of your right foot and with all the weight you have if you dont break his nose or knock him overboard youll at least set him in line for a set of false teeth ill take care of the other or others how ill be on the saloon roof its three feet lower than the loom of the stern light even if they approach from the wheelhouse roof so they cant see me silhouetted against the loom of the stern light even if they approach from the bows but what arc you going to do clobber him or them a nice big stilson from the engineroom with a rag round it will do nicely why dont we just dazzle them with torches and tell them to put their hands up uncle arthur clearly didnt care for ray proposed modus operandi three reasons these are dangerous and deadly men and you never give them warning not the true sporting spirit but it helps you survive then there will almost certainly be nightglasses trained on the firecrest at this very moment finally sound carries very clearly over water and the wind is blowing towards torbay shots i mean he said no more we took up position and waited it was still raining heavily with the wind still from the west for once the rain didnt bother me id a full set of oilskins on i just lay there spreadeagled on the saloon coachroof occasionally easing the fingers of my hands the right round the stilson the left round the little knife after fifteen minutes they came i heard the gentle scuff of rubber on our starboard side the side of the wheelhouse door i pulled on the cord which passed through the rear window of the wheelhouse the cord was attached to uncle arthurs hand there were only two of them my eyes were perfectly tuned to the dark by this time and i could easily distinguish the shape of the first man coming aboard just below where i lay he secured a painter and waited for his mate they moved forward together the leading man gave a cough of agony as the door smashed fair and square as we later established into his face i wasnt so successful the second man had catlike reactions and had started to drop to the deck as the stilson came down i caught him on back or shoulder i didnt know which and dropped on top of him in one of his hands hed have either a gun or knife and if id wasted a fraction of a second trying to find out which hand and what he had in it id have been a dead man i brought down my left hand and he lay still i passed the other man lying moaning in agony in the scuppers brushed by uncle arthur pulled the saloon curtains to and switched on the lights i then went out halfpulled halflifted the moaning man through the wheelhouse door down the saloon steps and dropped him on the carpet i didnt recognise him that wasnt surprising his own mother or wife wouldnt have recognised him uncle arthur was certainly a man who believed in working with a will and hed left the plastic surgeon a very tricky job keep your gun on him sir i said uncle arthur was looking down at his handiwork with a slightly dazed expression what one could see of his face behind the beard seemed slightly paler than normal if he breathes kill him but but look at his face man we cant leave you look at this sir i stooped and picked up the weapon that had fallen from the mans hand as id dropped him to the floor this is what is technically known to the united states police departments as a whippet a shotgun with twothirds of the barrel and twothirds of the stock sawn off if hed got you first you wouldnt have any face no left at all i mean that literally do you still feel like playing florence nightingale to the fallen hero that wasnt at all the way one should talk to uncle arthur there would be a few more entries in the confidential report when we got back if we got back but i couldnt help myself not then i passed by uncle arthur and went out in the wheelhouse i picked up a small torch went outside and shone it down into the water hooding it with my hand so that the beam couldnt have been seen fifty yards away they had a rubber dinghy all right and an outboard motor attached the conquering heroes bathed in that warm and noble glow of satisfaction that conies from the comforting realisation of a worthwhile job well done had intended to make it home the easy way looping a heaving line round the outboards cylinder head and hauling alternately on the heaving line and painter i had both dinghy and outboard up and over in two minutes i unclamped the outboard lugged the dinghy round to the other side of the superstructure the side remote from the inner harbour and examined it carefully in the light of the torch apart from the manufacturers name there was no mark on it nothing to indicate to which craft it belonged i sliced it to ribbons and threw it over the side back in the wheelhouse i cut a twentyfoot length from a roll of pvc electric wiring cable went outside again and lashed the outboard to the dead mans ankles i searched his pockets nothing id known there would be nothing i was dealing with professionals i hooded the torch and looked at his face id never seen him before i took from him the pistol still clutched in his right hand undid the spring clips holding the guardchains in place above the gunwale slots for our companionway ladder then eased first the outboard and then the man over the side they vanished into the dark waters of torbay harbour without the whisper of a splash i went inside closing wheelhouse and saloon doors behind me uncle arthur and the injured man had reversed positions by this time the man was on his feet now leaning drunkenly against the bulkhead dabbing his face with a bloodstained towel uncle arthur must have found and moaning from time to time i didnt blame him if id a broken nose most of my front teeth displaced and a jaw that might or might not have been fractured id have been moaning too uncle arthur gun in one hand and some more of my scotch in the other was sitting on the settee and contemplating his bloody handiwork with an odd mixture of satisfaction and distaste he looked at me as i came in nodded towards the prisoner making a fearful mess of the carpet he complained what do we do with him hand him over to the police the police you had your reservations about the police i thought reservations is hardly the word we have to make the break some time our friend outside as well who this fellows ah accomplice i threw him over the side uncle arthur made the mess on the carpet even worse he spilt whisky all over it he said you what theres no worry i pointed downwards twenty fathoms and thirty pounds of metal attached to his ankles at at the bottom of the sea what did you expect me to do with him give him a state funeral im sorry i didnt tell you he was dead i had to kill him had to had to he seemed upset why calvert theres no why theres no justification needed i killed him or he killed me and then you and now wed both be where he is do you have to justify killing men who have murdered at least three times probably oftener and if that particular character wasnt a murderer he came tonight to murder i killed him with as little thought and compunction and remorse as id have tramped on a black widow spider but you cant go around acting like a public executioner i can and i will as long as its a choice between them and me youre right youre right he sighed i must confess that reading your reports of an operation is quite different from being with you on one but i must also confess that its rather comforting having you around at times like this well lets put this man in cells id like to go to the shangrila first sir to look for hunslett i see to look for hunslett has it occurred to you calvert that if they are hostile to us as you admit is possible that they may not let you look for hunslett yes sir its not my intention to go through the shangrila a gun in each hand searching for him i wouldnt get five feet im just going to ask for him if anyone has seen him assuming they really are the bandits dont you think it might be most instructive sir to observe their reactions when they see a dead man walking aboard especially a dead man coming alongside from a boat to which theyd shortly beforehand dispatched a couple of killers and dont you think it will become more and more instructive to watch them as time passes by with no sign of first and second murderers entering left assuming they are the bandits of course ill know before we say goodbye to them and how do we account for our knowing one another if theyre white as the driven snow we dont have to account to them if theyre not they wont believe a damned word either of us say anyway i collected the roll of flex from the wheelhouse and led our prisoner to the after cabin i told him to sit down with his back to one of the bulkhead generators and he did resistance was the last thought in his mind i passed a few turns of flex round his waist and secured him to the generator his feet i secured to one of the stanchions his hands i left free he could move he could use the towel and the bucket of cold fresh water i left to administer first aid to himself whenever he felt like it but he was beyond reach of any glass or sharp instrument with which he could either free himself or do himself in on the latter score i wasnt really worried one way or another i started the engines weighed anchor switched on the navigation lights and headed for the shangrila quite suddenly i wasnt tired any more six wednesday pm pm less than two hundred yards from the shangrila the anchor clattered down into fifteen fathoms of water i switched off the navigation lights switched on all the wheelhouse lights passed into the saloon and closed the door behind me how long do we sit here uncle arthur asked not long better get into your oilskins now sir next really heavy shower of rain and well go theyll have had their nightglasses on us all the way across the bay you think no question of that theyll still have the glasses on us theyll be worried stiff wondering what the hell has gone wrong whats happened to the two little playmates they sent to interview us if they are the bandits theyre bound to investigate again not yet not for an hour or two theyll wait for their two friends to turn up they may think that it took them longer than expected to reach the firecrest and that wed upped anchor and left before they got there or they may think theyd trouble with their dinghy i heard the sudden drumming of heavy rain on the coachroof its time to go we left by the galley door felt our way aft quietly lowered the dinghy into the water and climbed down the transom ladder into it i cast off wind and tide carried us in towards the harbour through the driving rain we could dimly see the shangrilas riding light as we drifted by about a hundred yards from her port side halfway between the shangrila and the shore started up the outboard motor and made back towards the shangrila the big tender was riding at the outer end of a boom which stretched out from the shangrilas starboard side about ten feet forard of the bridge the stern of the tender was about fifteen out from the illuminated gangway i approached from astern upwind and dosed in on the gangway an oilskinned figure wearing one of the shangrilas crews fancy french sailor hats came running down the gangway and took the painter ah goodevening my man uncle arthur said he wasnt putting on the style it was the way hetalked to moat people sir anthony is aboard yes sir i wonder if i could see him for a moment if you could wait a the sailor broke off and peered at sir arthur oh its its the admiral sir admiral arnfordjason of course youre the fellow who ran me ashore to the columba after dinner yes sir ill show you to the saloon sir my boat will be all right here for a few moments the unspoken implication was that i was his chauffeur perfectly sir they climbed the gangway and went aft i spent ten seconds examining the portable lead that served the gangway lightj decided that it would offer much resistance to a good hefty tug then followed the two men aft i passed by the passage leading to the saloon and hid behind a ventilator almost at once the sailor emerged from the passage and made his way forard again another twenty seconds and hed be yelling his head off about the mysteriously vanished chauffeur i didnt care what he did in twenty seconds when i reached the partly open saloon door i heard sir arthurs voice no no i really am most sorry to break hi upon you like this well yes thank you small one if you will yes soda please uncle arthur really was having a go at the whisky tonight thank you thank you your health lady skouras your health gentlemen mustnt delay you fact is i wonder if you can help us my friend and i are most anxious really most anxious i wonder where he is by the way i thought he was right behind cue for calvert i turned down the oilskin collar that bad been obscuring the lower part of my face removed the souwester that had been obscuring most of the upper part of my face knocked politely and entered i said good evening lady skouras goodevening gentlemen please forgive the interruption sir anthony apart from uncle arthur there were six of than gathered round the fire at the end of the saloon sir anthony standing the others seated charlotte skouras dolhnann skourass managing director lavorski his accountant lord charnley his broker and a fifth man i didnt recognise all had glasses in their hands their reaction to my sudden appearance as expressed by their faces was interesting old skouras showed a halffrowning halfspeculative surprise charlotte skouras gave me a strained smile of welcome uncle arthur hadnt been exaggerating when he spoke of that bruise it was a beauty the strangers face was noncommittal lavorskis inscrutable dollmanns rigid as if carved from marble and lord charnleys for a fleeting moment that of a man walking through a country churchyard at midnight when someone taps him on the shoulder or so i thought i could have imagined it but there was no imagination about the sudden tiny snapping sound as the stem of the glass fell soundlessly on to the carpet a scene straight from victorian melodrama our aristocratic broker friend had something on his mind whether the others had or not it was difficult to say dollmann lavorski and i was pretty sure sir anthony could make their faces say whatever they wanted them to say good lord petersen skourass tone held surprise but not the surprise of a person wejcoming someone back from the grave i didnt know you two knew each other my goodness yes petersen and i have been colleagues for years tony unesco you know uncle arthur always gave out that he was a british delegate to unesco a cover that gave him an excellent reason for his frequent trips abroad marine biology may not be very cultural but its scientific and educational enough petersens one of my star performers lecturing i mean done missions for me in europe asia africa and south america which was true enough only they werent lecture missions didnt even know he was here until they told me at the hotel but dear me dear me mustnt talk about ourselves its hunslett petersens colleague and mine in a way cant find him anywhere hasnt been in the village yours is the nearest boat have you seen anything of him anything at all afraid i havent skouras said anybody here no nobody he pressed a bell and a steward appeared skouras asked him to make inquiries aboard and the steward left when did he disappear mr petersen ive no idea i left him carrying out experiments ive been away all day collecting specimens jellyfish i laughed deprecatingly and rubbed my inflamed face the poisonous type im afraid no sign of him when i returned could your friend swim mr petersen the stranger asked i looked at him a dark thickset character in his middle forties with black snapping eyes deepset in a tanned face expressionless faces seemed to be the order of the day there so i kept mine expressionless it wasnt easy im afraid not i said quietly im afraid youre thinking along the same lines as myself weve no guard rails aft a careless stepi broke off as the steward reentered and reported that no one had seen a sign of hunslett then went on i think i should report this to sergeant macdonald at once everybody else seemed to think so too so we left the cold slanting rain was heavier than ever at the head of the gangway i pretended to slip flung my arms about wildly for a bit then toppled into the sea taking the gangway wandering lead with me what with the rain the wind and the sudden darkness there was quite a bit of confusion and it was the better part of a minute before i was finally hauled on to the landing stage of the companionway old skouras was commiseration itself and offered me a change of clothes at once but i declined politely and went back to the firecrest with uncle arthur neither of us spoke on the way back as we secured the dinghy i said when you were at dinner on the shangrila you must have given some story to account for your presence here for your dramatic appearance in an raf rescue launch yes it was a good one i told them a vital unesco conference in geneva was being deadlocked because of the absence of a certain dr spenser freeman it happens to be true in all the papers today dr freeman is not there because it suits us not to have him there no one knows that of course i told them that it was of vital national importance that he should be there that wed received information that he was doing field research in torbay and that the government had sent me here to get him back why send the launch away that would seem odd no if hes somewhere in the wilds of torbay i couldnt locate him before daylight theres a helicopter i said standing by to fly him out ive only to lift the phone to have it here in fifty minutes and of course you werent to know that the telephone lines were out of order it might have worked if you hadnt called at the firecrest in the rescue launch before you went to the shangrila you werent to know that our friends who were locked in the after cabin when you went aboard would report back that theyd heard an raf rescue launch here at such and such a time they might have seen it through a porthole but even that wouldnt be necessary the engines are unmistakable so now our friends know youre lying like a trooper the chances are that theyve now a very shrewd idea as to who exactly you are congratulations sir youve now joined the category ive been in for years no insurance company in the world would issue you a life policy even on a ninetynine per cent premium our trip to the shangrila has removed your last doubts about our friends out there yes sir you saw the reaction of our belted broker lord charnley and him an aristocrat to hoot a small thing to base a big decision on calvert uncle arthur said coldly yes sir i fished my scuba suit from the after locker and led the way below i didnt fall into the water by accident by accident on purpose i didnt mention that when i was hanging on to the boats rudder off the reef this evening i cut a notch in it a deep vee notch the shangrilas tender has a deep vee notch in it same notch in fact same boat i see i see indeed uncle arthur sat on the settee and gave me the combination of the cold blue eye and the monocle you forgot to give me advance notification of your intentions i didnt forget i started to change out of my soaking clothes id no means of knowing how good an actor you are sir ill accept that so that removed your last doubts no sir superfluous confirmation really i knew before then remember that swarthy character sitting beside lavorski who asked me if hunslett could swim ill bet a fortune to a penny that he wasnt at the shangrilas dinner table earlier on you would win how do you know because he was in command of the crew of the boat who shot down the helicopter and killed williams and hung around afterwards waiting to have a go at me his name is captain imrie he was the captain of the prize crew of the nantes uncle arthur nodded but his mind was on something else it was on the scuba suit i was pulling on what the hell do you think youre going to do with that thing he demanded advance notification of intentions sir wont be long im taking a little trip to the shangrila the shangrilas tender rather with a little homing device and a bag of sugar with your permission sir something else you forgot to tell me hey calvert like that breaking off the shangrilas gangway light was no accident id like to get there before they replace it sir i cant believe it i cant believe it uncle arthur shook his head for a moment i thought he was referring to the dispatch with which i had made the uneventful return trip to the shangrilas tender but his next words showed that his mind was on higher and more important things that tony skouras should be up to his neck in this theres something far wrong i just cant believe it good god do you know he was up for a peerage in the next list so soon he told me he was waiting for the price to come down uncle arthur said nothing normally he would have regarded such a statement as a mortal insult as he himself automatically collected a life peerage on retirement but nothing he was as shaken as that id like nothing better than to arrest the lot of them i said but our hands are tied were helpless but now that i know what we do know i wonder if you would do me a favour before we go ashore sir there are two things i want to know one is whether sir anthony really was down at some clyde shipyard a few days ago having stabilisers fitted a big job few yards would tackle in a yacht that size should find out in a couple of hours people tell silly and unnecessary lies also id like to find out if lord kirkside has taken the necessary steps to have his dead sons title he was viscount somebody or other transferred to his younger son you get the set ready and ill ask them anything you like uncle arthur said wearily he wasnt really listening to me he was still contemplating with stunned disbelief the possibility that his future fellow peer was up to the neck in skullduggery on a vast scale and pass me that bottle before you go below at the rate uncle arthur was going i reflected it was providential that the home of one of the most famous distilleries in the highlands was lessthan half a mile from where we were anchored i lowered the false head of the starboard diesel to the engineroom deck as if it weighed a ton i straightened and stood there for a full minute without moving then i went to the engineroom door sir arthur coming coming a few seconds and he was at the doorway the glass of whisky in his hand all connected up ive found hunsfelt sir uncle arthur moved slowly forward like a man in a dream the transmitter was gone all our explosives and listening devices and little portable transmitters were gone that had left plenty of room theyd had to double him up to get him in his head was resting on his forearms and his arms on his knees but there was plenty of room i couldnt see his face i could see no marks of violence halfsitting halflying there he seemed curiously peaceful a man drowsing away a summer afternoon by a sunwarmed wall a long summer afternoon because for ever was a long time thats what id told him last night hed all the time in the world for sleep i touched his face it wasnt cold yet hed been dead two to three hours no more i turned his face to see if i could find how he had died his head lolled to one side like that of a broken rag doll i turned and looked at sir arthur the dreamlike expression had gone his eyes were cold and bitter and cruel i thought vaguely of the tales id heard and largely discounted of uncle arthurs total ruthlessness i wasnt so ready to discount them now uncle arthur wasnt where he was now because hed answered an advertisement in the daily telegraph hed have been handpicked by two or three very clever men who would have scoured the country to find the one man with the extraordinary qualifications they required and they had picked uncle arthur the man with the extraordinary qualifications and total ruthlessness must have been one of the prime requisites id never really thought of it before he said murdered of course yes sir how his neck is broken sir his neck a powerful man like hunslett i know a man who could do it with one twist of his hands quinn the man who killed baker and delmont the man who almost killed me i see he paused then went on almost absently you will of course seek out and destroy this man by whatever means you choose you can reconstruct this calvert yes sir when it came to reconstruction when it was too damn late i stood alone our friend or friends boarded the firecrest very shortly after i had left this morning that is before daylight they wouldnt have dared try it after it was light they overpowered hunslett and kept him prisoner confirmation that he was held prisoner all day comes from the fact that he failed to meet the noonday schedule they still held him prisoner when you came aboard there was no reason why you should suspect that there was anyone aboard the boat that putthem aboard before dawn would have gone away at once they couldnt leave one of the shangrilas boats lying alongside the firecrest all day theres no necessity to dot is and cross ts no sir maybe an hour or so after you departed the shangrilas tender with captain imrie quinn and company aboard turns up they report that im dead that was hunsletts death warrant with me dead they couldnt let him live so quinn killed him why he was killed this way i dont know they may have thought shots could be heard they may not have wanted to use knives or blunt instruments in case they left blood all over the deck they were intending to abandon the boat till they came back at night at midnight to take it out to the sound and scuttle it and someone might have come aboard in the interim my own belief is that he was killed this way because quinn is a psychopath and compulsive killer and liked doing it this way i see and then they said to themselves where can we hide hunslett till we come back at midnight just in case someone does come aboard and then they said ha we know well hide him in the dummy diesel so they threw away the transmitter and all the rest ofthe stuff or took it with them it doesnt matter and they put hunslett inside uncle arthur had been speaking very quietly throughout and then suddenly for the first time id ever known it his voice became a shout how in the name of god did they know this was a dummy diesel calvert how could they have known his voice dropped to what was a comparative whisper someone talked calvert or someone was criminally careless no one talked sir someone was criminally careless i was if id used my eyes hunslett wouldnt be lying there now the night the two bogus customs officers were aboard i knew that they had got onto something when we were in the engineroom here up to the time that theyd inspected the batteries theyd gone through the place with a toothcomb after that they didnt give a damn hunslett even suggested that it was something to do with the batteries but i was too clever to believe him i walked to the workbench picked up a torch and handed it to uncle arthur do you see anything about those batteries that would excite suspicion he looked at me that monocled eye still icecold and bitter took the torch and examined the batteries carefully he spent all of two minutes searching then straightened i see nothing he said curtly thomas the customs man who called himself thomas did he was on to us from the start he knew what he was looking for he was looking for a powerful radio transmitter not the tuppenoe hapenny job we have up in the wheelhouse he was looking for signs of a power takeoff from those batteries he was looking for the marks left by screw clamps or by a pair of sawtoothed powerfully springloaded crocodile dips uncle arthur swore very quietly and bent over the batteries again this time his examination took only ten seconds you make your point well calvert the eyes were still bitter but no longer glacial no wonder they knew exactly what i was doing today i said savagely no wonder they knew that hunslett would be alone before dawn that id be landing at that cove this evening all they required was radio confirmation from someone out in loch houron that calvert had been snooping around there and the destruction of the helicopter was a foregone conclusion all this damned folderol about smashing up radio transmitters and making us think that we were the only craft left with a transmitter god how blind can you be i assume that theres some logical thought behind this outburst uncle arthur said coldly that night hunslett and i were aboard the shangrila for drinks i told you that when we returned we knew that wed had visitors we didnt know why then my god youve already been at pains to demonstrate the fact that i was no brighter than yourself about the battery its not necessary to repeat the process let me finish i interrupted uncle arthur didnt like being interrupted they came down to the engineroom here they knew there was a transmitter they looked at that starboard cylinder head four bolts the rest are dummies with the paint well and truly scraped off the port cylinder head bolts without a flake of paint missing they take off this headj wire into the transceiver lines on the output side of the scrambler and lead out to a small radio transmitter hidden like as not behind the battery bank there theyd have all the equipment with them for they knew exactly what they wanted to do from then on they could listen in to our every word they knew all our plans everything we intended to do and made their own plans accordingly they figured and how right they were that it would be a damn sight more advantageous for them to let hunslett and i have our direct communication with you and so know exactly what was going on than to wreck this set and force us to find some other means of communication that they couldnt check on but why but why destroy the advantage they held by by he gestured at the empty engine casing it wasnt an advantage any longer i said tiredly when they ripped out that set hunslett was dead and they thought calvert was dead they didnt need the advantage any more of course of course my god what a fiendish brew this is he took out his monocle and rubbed his eye with the knuckle of his hand theyre bound to know that we will find hunslett the first time we attempt to use this radio i am beginning to appreciate the weight of your remark in the saloon that we might find it difficult to insure ourselves they cannot know how much we know but they cannot afford to take chances not with what is it now a total of seventeen million pounds at stake they will have to silence us up and off is the only answer i agreed weve been down here too long already they might even be on their way across now dont let that luger ever leave your hand sir well be safe enough under way but first we must put hunslett and our friend in the after cabin ashore yes yes we must put them ashore first at the best of times weighing anchor by electric windlass is not a job for a moron even an alert moron even our small windlass had a pull of over pounds a carelessly placed hand or foot a flapping trouser leg or the trailing skirts of an oilskin any of those being caught up between chain and drum and you can be minus a hand or foot before you can cry out far less reach the deck switch which is invariably placed abaft the windlass doing this on a wet slippery deck is twice as dangerous doing it on a wet slippery deck in total darkness heavy rain and with a very unstable boat beneath your feet not to mention having the brake pawl off and the winch covered by a tarpaulin is a highly dangerous practice indeed but it wasnt as dangerous as attracting the attention of our friends on the shangrila perhaps h was because of my total absorption in the job on hand perhaps because of the muffled clank of the anchor coming inboard that i didnt locate and identify the sound as quickly as i might twice id thought id heard the faroff sound of a womans voice twice id vaguely put it down to latenight revelry on one of the smaller yachts in the bay it would require an lbm computer to work out the gallonage of gin consumed in british yacht harbours after the sun goes down then i heard the voice again much nearer this time and i put all thought of revelry afloat out of my mind the only cry of desperation ever heard at a yacht party is when the gin runs out this soft cry had a different quality of desperation altogether i stamped on the deck switch and all sound on the focsle ceased the lilliput was in my hand without my knowing how it had got there help me the voice was low and urgent and desperate for gods sake help me the voice came from the water amidships on the port side i moved back silently to where i thought the voice had come from and stood motionless i thought of hunslett and i didnt move a muscle id no intention of helping anyone until id made sure the voice didnt come from some dinghy a dinghy with two other passengers both carrying machineguns one word one incautious flash of light a seven pound pull on a trigger and calvert would be among his ancestors if that was they would have anything to do with such a bloody fool of a descendant please please help me please i helped her not so much because the desperation in the voice was unquestionably genuine as because of the fact that it as unquestionably belonged to charlotte skouras i pushed through between the scuppers and the lowest guardrail a rubber tyre fender that was permanently attached to one of the guardrail stanchions and lowered it to waterlevel i said lady skouras yes yes ifs me thank god thank god her voice didnt come just as easily as that she was gasping for breath and shed water in her mouth theres a fender at the boats side catch it a moment or two then i have it can you pull yourself up more splashing and gasping then no no i cant do it no matter wait i turned round to go for uncle arthur but he was already by my side i said softly in his ear lady skouras is down there in the water it may be a trap i dont think so but if you see a light shoot at it he said nothing but i felt his arm move as he took the luger from his pocket i stepped over the guardrail and lowered myself till my foot came to rest on the lower part of the tyre i reached down and caught her arm charlotte skouras was no slender sylphlike figure she had some bulky package tied to her waist and i wasnt as fit as id been a long long time ago say about fortyeight hours but with a helping hand from uncle arthur i managed to get her up on deck between us we half carried her to the curtained saloon and set her down on the settee i propped a cushion behind her head and took a good look at her shed never have made the front cover of vogue she looked terrible her dark slacks and shirt looked as if they had spent a month in the sea instead of probably only a few minutes the long tangled auburn hair was plastered to her head and cheeks her face was deadwhite the big brown eyes with the dark halfcircles were wide open and frightened and both mascara and lipstick had begun to run and she hadnt been beautiful to start with i thought she was the most desirable woman id ever seen i must be nuts my dear lady skouras my dear lady skouras uncle arthur was back among the aristocracy and showed it he knelt by her side ineffectually dabbing at her face with a handkerchief what in gods name has happened brandy calvert brandy dont just stand there man brandy uncle arthur seemed to think he was in a pub but as it happened i did have some brandy left i handed him the glass and said if youll attend to lady skouras sir ill finish getting the anchor up no no she took a gulp of the brandy choked on it and i had to wait until she had finished coughing before she went on theyre not coming for at least two hours yet i know i heard theres something terrible going on sir arthur i had to come i had to come now dont distress yourself lady skouras dont distress yourself uncle arthur said as if she werent distressed enough already just drink this down lady skouras no not that i got all set to take a poor view of this it was damned good brandy then i realised she was talking of something else not lady skouras never again charlotte charlotte meiner charlotte one thing about women they always get their sense of priorities right there they were on the shangrila rigging up a homemade atom bomb to throw through our saloon windows and all she could think was to ask us to call her charlotte i said why did you have to come calvert uncle arthurs voice was sharp do you mind lady i mean charlotte has just suffered a severe shock let her take her time to no she struggled to an upright sitting position and forced a wan smile halfscared halfmocking no mr petersen mr calvert whatever your name youre quite right actresses tend to overindulge their emotions fm not an actress any longer she took another sip of the brandy and a little colour came back to her face ive known for some time that something was very far wrong aboard the shangrila strange men have been aboard some of the old crew were changed for no reason several times ive been put ashore with the stewardess in hotels while the shangrila went off on mysterious journeys my husband sir anthony would tell me nothing he has changed terribly since our marriage i think he takes drugs ive seen guns whenever those strange men came aboard i was sent to my stateroom after dinner she smiled mirthlessly it wasnt because of any jealousy on my husbands part you may believe me the last day or two i sensed that everything was coming to a climax tonight just after you were gone i was sent to my stateroom i left but stayed out in the passage lavorski was talking i heard him saying if your admiral pal is a unesco delegate skouras then im king neptune i know who he is we all know who he is its too late in the day now and they know too much its them or us and then captain imrie how i hate that man said ill send quinn and jacques and kramer at midnight at one oclock theyll open the seacocks in the sound charming friends your husband has i murmured she looked at me halfuncertainly halfspecula lively and said mr petersen or mr calvert and i heard lavorski call you johnson it is confusing i admitted calvert philip calvert well philip she pronounced it the french way and very nice it sounded too you are one great bloody fool it you talk like that you are in deadly danger mr calvert uncle arthur said sourly it wasnt her language he disapproved of it was this christian name familiarity between the aristocracy and the peasants is quite aware of the danger he has unfortunate mannerisms of speech thats all you are a very brave woman charlotte bluebloods firstnaming each other was a different thing altogether you took a great risk in eavesdropping you might have been caught i was caught sir arthur the smile showed up the lines on either side of her mouth but didnt touch her eyes that is another reason why i am here even without the knowledge of your danger yes i would have come my husband caught me he took me into my stateroom she stood up shakily turned her back to us and pulled up the sodden dark shirt right across her back ran three great bluered weals uncle arthur stood stockstill a man incapable of movement i crossed the saloon and peered at her back the weals were almost an inch wide and running halfway round her body here and there were tiny bloodspotted punctures lightly i tried a finger on one of the weals the flesh was raised and puffy a fresh weal as lividlygenuine a weal as ever id clapped eyes on she didnt move i stepped back and she turned to face us it is not nice is it it does not feel very nice she smiled and again that smile i could show you worse than that no no no uncle arthur said hastily that will not be necessary he was silent for a moment then burst out my dear charlotte what you must have suffered its fiendish absolutely fiendish he must be he must be inhuman a monster a monster perhaps under the influence of drugs i would never have believed it his face was brickred with outrage and his voice sounded as if quinn had him by the throat strangled no one would ever have believed it except the late lady skouras she said quietly i understand now why she was in and out of mental homes several times before she died she shrugged i have no wish to go the same way i am made of tougher stuff than madeleine skouras so i pick up my bag and run away she nodded at the small polythene bag of clothes that had been tied to her waist like dick whittington is it not theyll be here long before midnight when they discover youre gone i observed it may be morning before they find out most nights i lock my cabin door tonight i locked it from the outside that helps i said standing about in those sodden clothes doesnt theres no point in running away only to die of pneumonia youll find towels in my cabin then we can get you a room in the columba hotel i had hoped for better than that the fractional slump of the shoulders was more imagined than seen but the dull defeat in the eyes left nothing to the imagination you would put me in the first place they would look for me there is no safe place for me in torbay they will catch me and bring me back and my husband will take me into that stateroom again my only hope is to run away your only hope is to run away please can we not run away together no a man not given to evasive answers is that it there was a lonely dejection a proud humiliation about her that did very little for my selfrespect she turned towards uncle arthur took both his hands in hers and said in a low voice sir arthur i appeal to you as an english gentleman thumbs down on calvert that foreignborn peasant may i stay please uncle arthur looked at me hesitated looked at charlotte skouras looked into those big brown eyes and was a lost man of course you may stay my dear charlotte he gave a stiff oldfashioned bow which i had to admit went very well with the beard and the monocle yours to command my dear lady thank you sir arthur she smiled at me not with triumph or satisfaction just an anxioustobefriendly smile it would be nice philip to have the consent what do you say unanimous if sir arthur wishes to expose you to a vastly greater degree of risk aboard this boat than you would experience in torbay that is sir arthurs business as for the rest my consent is not required im a welltrained civil servant and i obey orders you are gracious to a fault uncle arthur said acidly sorry sir id suddenly seen the light and a pretty dazzling beam it was too i should not have called your judgment in question the lady is very welcome but i think she should remain below while we are alongside the pier sir a reasonable request and a wise precaution uncle arthur said mildly he seemed pleased at my change of heart at my proper deference to the wishes of the aristocracy it wont be for long i smiled at charlotte skouras we leave torbay within the hour what do i care what you charge him with i looked from sergeant macdonald to the brokenfaced man with the wet bloodstained towel then back to macdonald again breaking and entering assault and battery islegal possession of a dangerous weapon with intent to create a felony murder anything you like well now its just not quite as easy as that sergeant macdonald spread his big brown hands across the counter of the tiny police station and looked at the prisoner and myself in turn he didnt break and enter you know mr petersen he boarded no law against that assault and battery it looks as if he has been the victim and not the perpetrator and what kind of weapon was he carrying mr petersen i dont know it must have been knocked overboard i see knocked overboard was it so we have no real proof of any felonious intent i was becoming a little tired of sergeant macdonald he was fast enough to cooperate with bogus customs officers but with me he was just being deliberately obstructive i said youll be telling me next that its all a product of my fevered imagination youll be wiling me nextthat i just stepped ashore grabbed the first passerby i saw hit him in the face with a fourbytwo then dragged him up here inventing this tale as i went even you cant be so stupid as to believe that the brown face turned red and on the counter the brown knuckles turned ivory he said softly youll kindly not talk to me like that if you insist on behaving like a fool treat you as such are you going to lock him up if s only your word against his no i had a witness hes down at the old pier now if you want to see him admiral sir arthur arnfordjason a very senior civil servant you had a mr hunslett with you last time i was aboard your boat hes down there too i nodded at the prisoner why dont you ask a few questions of our friend here ive sent for the doctor hell have to fix his face first i cant understand a word he says the state of his face doesnt help i admitted but the main trouble is that he speaks italian italian is it ill soon fix that the owner of the western isles cafe is an italian that helps there are four little questions he might put to our pal here where is his passport how he arrived in this country who is his employer and where does he live the sergeant looked at me for a long moment then said slowly its a mighty queer marine biologist that you are mr petersen and its a mighty queer police sergeant that you are mr macdonald good night i crossed the dimlylit street to the seawall and waited in the shadow of a phone booth after two minutes a man with a small bag came hurrying up the street and turned into the police station he was out again in five minutes which wasnt surprising there was little a gp could do for what was plainly a hospital job the station door opened again and sergeant macdonald came hurrying out long black mackintosh buttoned to the neck he walked quickly along the sea wall looking neither to left nor right which made it very easy for me to follow him and turned down the old stone pier at the end of the pier he flashed a torch went down a flight of steps and began to haul in a small boat i leaned over the pier wall and switched on my own torch why dont they provide you with a telephone or radio for conveying urgent messages i asked you could catch your death of cold rowing out to the shangrila on a night like this he straightened slowly and let the rope fall from his hands the boat drifted out into the darkness he came up the steps with the slow heavy tread of an old man and said quietly what did you say about the shangrila dont let me keep you sergeant i said affably duty before the idle social chitchat your first duty is to your masters off you go now tell them that one of their hirelings has been severely clobbered and that petersen has very grave suspicions about sergeant macdonald i dont know what you are talking abouthe said emptily the shangrila im not going anywhere near the shangrila where are you going then do tell fishing kind of forgotten your tackle havent you and how would you like to mind your own damn business macdonald said heavily thats what im doing come off it sergeant think i give a damn about our italian pal you can charge him with playing tiddleywinks in the high street for all i care i just threw him at you together with a hint that you yourself were up to no good to see what the reaction would be to remove the last doubts in my mind you reacted beautifully im maybe not the cleverest mr petersen he said with dignity neither am i a complete idiot i thought you were one of them or after the same thing as them he paused youre not youre a government agent im a civil servant i nodded to where the firecrest lay not twenty yards away youd better come to meet my boss i dont take orders from civil servants suit yourself i said indifferently turned away and looked out over the seawall about your two sons sergeant macdonald the sixteenyearold twins who im told died in the cairngorms some time back what about my sons he said tondessly just that im not looking forward to telling them that their own father wouldnt lift a finger to bring them back to life again he just stood there in the darkness quite still saying nothing he offered no resistance when i took his arm and led him towards the firecrest uncle arthur was at his most intimidating and uncle arthur in full intimidating cry was a sight to behold hed made no move to rise when id brought macdonald into the saloon and he hadnt ask him to sit the blue basilisk stare channelled and magnified by the glittering monocles transfixed the unfortunate sergeant like a laser beam so your foot slipped sergeant uncle arthur said without preamble he was using his cold sat quite urunflected voice the one that curled your hair the fact that you stand here now indicates that mr calvert went ashore with a prisoner and enough rope for you to hang yourself and you seized it with both hands not very clever of you sergeant you should not have tried to contact your friends they are no friends of mine sir macdonald said bitterly im going to tell you as much as you need to know about calvert petersen was a pseudonym and myself and what we are doing uncle arthur hadnt heard him if you ever repeat any part of what i say to anyone it will cost you your job your pension any hope that you will ever again in whatever capacity get another job in britain and several years in prison for contravention ofthe official secrets act i myself will personally formulate the charges he paused then added in a masterpiece of superfluity do i make myself clear you make yourself very clear macdonald said grimly so uncle arthur told him all he thought macdonald needed to know which wasnt much and finished by saying i am sure we can now count on your hundred per cent cooperation sergeant calvert is just guessing at my part in this he said dully for gods sake i said you knew those customs officers were bogus you knew they had no photocopier with them you knew their only object in coming aboard was tolocate and smash that set and locate any other we might have you knew they couldnt have gone back to the mainland in that launch it was too rough the launch was in fact the tender which is why you left without lights and no launch left the harbour after your departure wed have heard it the only life we saw after that was when they switched on their lights in the shangrilas wheelhouse to smash up their own radio one of their own radios i should have said and how did you know the telephone lines were down in the sound you knew they were down but why did you say the sound because you knew they had been cut there then yesterday morning when i asked you if there was any hope of the lines being repaired you said no odd one would have thought that you would have told the customs boys going back to the mainland to contact the gpo at once but you knew they werent going hack there and your two sons sergeant the boys supposed to be dead you forgot to close their accounts because you knew they werent dead i forgot about the accounts macdonald said slowly and all the other points im afraid im not good at this sort of thing he looked at uncle arthur i know this is the end of the road for me they said they would kill my boys sir if you will extend us your full cooperation uncle arthur said precisely i will personally see to it that you remain the torbay police sergeant until youre falling over your beard who are they the only men ive seen is a fellow called captain imrie and the two customs men durran and thomas durrans real name is quinn i dont know the others names i usually met them in my house after dark ive been out to the shangrila only twice to see imrie and sir anthony skouras i dont know macdonald shrugged helplessly hes a good man sir he really is or i thought so maybe he is mixed up in this anyone can fall into bad company its very strange sir isnt it and whats been your part in this theres been funny things happening in this area in the past months boats have vanished people have vanished fishermen have had their nets torn in harbour and yacht engines have been mysteriously damaged also in harbour this is when captain imrie wants to prevent certain boats from going certain places at the wrong time and your part is to investigate with great diligence and a total lack of success uncle arthur nodded you must be invaluable to them sergeant a man with your record and character is above suspicion tell me sergeant what are they up to before god sir i have no idea youre totally in the dark yes sir dont doubt it this is the way the very top men operate and you will have no idea where your boys are being held no sir how do you know theyre alive i was taken out to the shangrila three weeks ago my sons had been brought there from god only knows where they were well and are you really so naive as to believe that your sons will be well and will be returned alive when all this is over even although your boys will be bound to know who their captors are and would be available for testimony and identification if the time came for that captain imrie said they would come to no harm if i cooperated he said that only fools ever used unnecessary violence you are convinced then they wouldnt go to the length of murder murder what are you talking about sir calvert sir a large whisky for the sergeant yes sir when it came to lashing out with my private supplies uncle arthur was generous to a fault uncle arthur paid no entertainment allowance so i poured the sergeant a large whisky and seeing that bankruptcy was inevitable anyway did the same for myself ten seconds later the sergeants glass was empty i took his arm and led him to the engineroom when we came back to the saloon in a minutes time the sergeant needed no persuading to accept another glass his face was pale i told you that calvert carried out a helicopter reconnaissance today uncle arthur said conversationally what i didnt tell you was that his pilot was murdered this evening i didnt tell you that two other of my best agents have been killed in the last sixty hours and now as youve just seen hunslett do you still believe sergeant that we are dealing with a bunch of gentlemanly lawbreakers to whom human life is sacrosanct what do you warn me to do sir colour was back in the brown cheeks again and the eyes were cold and hard and a little desperate you and calvert will take hunslett ashore to your office you will call in the doctor and ask for an official postmortem we must have an official cause of death for the trial the other dead men are probably beyond recovery you will then row out to the shangrila and tell imrie that we brought hunslett and the other man the italian to your office you will tell them that you heard us say that we must go to the mainland for new depthsounding equipment and for armed help and that we cant be back for two days at least do you know where the telephone lines are cut in the sound yes sir i cut them myself when you get back from the shangrila get out there and fix them before dawn before dawn tomorrow you your wife and son must disappear for thirtysix hours if you want to live that is understood i understand what you want done not why you want it done just do it one last thing hunslett has no relations few of my men have so he may as well be buried in torbay knock up your local undertaker during the night and make arrangements for the funeral on friday calvert and i would like to be there but but friday thats just the day after tomorrow the day after tomorrow it will be all over then youll have your boys back home macdonald looked at him in long silence then said slowly how can you be sure fm not sure at all uncle arthur passed a weary hand across his face and looked at me calvert is its a pity sergeant that the secrets act will never permit you to tell your friends that you once knew philip calvert if it can be done calvert can do it i think he can i certainly hope so i certainly hope so too macdonald said sombrely me too more than either of them but there was already so much despondency around that it didnt seem right to deepen it so i just put on my confident face and led macdonald back down to the engineroom seven wednesday pm thursday am three of them came to kill us not at midnight as promised but at pm that night had they come five minutes earlier then they would have got us because five minutes earlier we were still tied up to the old stone pier and had they come and got us that five minutes earlier then the fault would have been mine for after leaving hunslett in the police station i had insisted that sergeant macdonald accompany me co use his authority in knocking up and obtaining service from the proprietor of the only chemists shop in torbay neither of them had been too keen on giving me the illegal help i wanted and it had taken me a full five minutes and the best part of my extensive repertoire of threats to extract from die very elderly chemist the minimum of reluctant service and small greenribbed bottle informatively labelled the tablets but i was lucky and i was back aboard the firecrest just after pm the west coast of scotland doesnt go in much for golden indian summers and that night was no exception apart from being cold and windy which was standard it was also black as sin and bucketing heavily which if not quite standard was at least not so unusual as to excite comment a minute after leaving the pier i had to switch on the searchlight mounted on thj wheelhouse roof the western entrance to the sound from torbay harbour between tolbay and garve island is a quarter of a mile wide and i could have found it easily on a compass course but there were small yachts i knew between the pier and the entrance and if any of them was carrying a riding light it was invisible in that driving rain the searchlight control was on the wheelhouse deckhead i moved it to point the beam down and ahead then traversed it through a fortydegree arc on either side of the bows i picked up the first boat inside five seconds not a yacht riding at its moorings but a rowing dinghy moving slowly through the water it was fine on the port bow maybe fifty yards away i couldnt identify the man at the oars the oars wrapped at their middle with some white cloth to muffle the sound of the rowlocks because his back was towards me a very broad back quinn the man in the bows was sitting facing me he wore oilskins and a dark beret and in his hand he held a gun at fifty yards its almost impossible to identify any weapon but his looked like a german schmeisser machinepistol without a doubt jacques the machinegun specialist the man crouched low in the sternsheets was quite unidentifiable but i could see the gleam of a short gun in his hand messrs quinn jacques and kramer coming to pay their respects as charlotte skouras had said they would but much ahead of schedule charlotte skouras was on my right in the darkened wheelhouse shed been there only three minutes having spent all our time alongside in her darkened cabin with the door closed uncle arthur was on my left desecrating the clean night air with one of his cheroots i reached up for a clipped torch and patted my right hand pocket to see if the lilliput was still there it was i said to charlotte skouras open the wheelhouse door put it back on the catch and stand clear then i said to uncle arthur take the wheel sir hard aport when i call then back north on course again he took the wheel without a word i heard the starboard wheelhouse door click on its latch we were doing no more than three knots through the water the dinghy was twentyfive yards away the men in the bows and stern holding up arms to shield their eyes from our searchlight quinn had stopped rowing on our present course wed leave them at least ten feet on our port beam i kept the searchlight steady on the boat twenty yards separated us and i could see jacques lining up his machinepistol on our light when i thrust the throttle lever right open the note of the big diesel exhaust deepened and the firecrest began to surge forward hard over now i said uncle arthur spun the wheel the sudden thrust of our single port screw boiled back against the portangled rudder pushing the stem sharply starboard flame lanced from jacques machinepistol a silent flame hed a silencer on bullets ricocheted off our aluminium foremast but missed both light and wheelhowse quinn saw what was coming and dug his oars deep but he was too late i shouted midships now pulled the throttle lever back to neutral and jumped out through the starboard doorway on to the deck we hit them just where jacques was sitting breaking off the dinghys bows capsizing it and throwing the three men into the water the overturned remains of the boat and a couple of struggling figures came slowly down the starboard side of the firecrest my torch picked up the man closer in to our side jacques with the machinepistol held high above his head instinctively trying to keep it dry though it must have been soaked when he had been catapulted into the water i held gunhand and torchhand together aiming down the bright narrow beam i squeezed the lilliputs trigger twice and a bright crimson flower bloomed where his face had been he went down as if a shark had got him the gun in the stifflyupstretched arms it was a schmeisser machinepistol all right i shifted the torch there was only one other to be seen in the water and it wasnt quinn hed either dived under the firecrest or was sheltering under the upturned wreck of the dinghy i fired twice more at the second figure and he started to scream the screaming went on for two or three seconds then stopped in a shuddering gurgle i heard the sound of someone beside me on the deck being violently sick over the side charlotte skouras but id no time to stay and comfort charlotte skouras shed no damned right to be out on deck anyway i had urgent matters to attend to such as preventing uncle arthur from cleaving torbays old stone pier in half the townspeople would not have liked it uncle arthurs idea of midships differed sharply from mine hed brought the firecrest round in a threequarter circle he would have been the ideal man at the helm of one of those ramheaded phoenician galleys that specialised in cutting the opposition in two but as a helmsman in torbay harbour he jacked something i jumped into the wheelhouse pulled the throttle al the way to astern and spun the wheel to port i jumped out again and pulled charlotte skouras away before she got her head knocked off by one of the barnacleencrusted piles that fronted the pier whether or not we grazed the pier was impossible to say but we sure as hell gave the barnacles a nasty turn i moved back into the wheelhouse taking charlotte skouras with me i was breathing heavily all this jumping in and out through wheelhouse doors took it out of a man i said with all respects sir what the hell were you trying to do me he was as perturbed as a hibernating bear in january is something up then i moved the throttle to slow ahead took the wheel from him and brought the firearest round till we were due north on a compass bearing i said keep it there please and did some more traversing with the searchlight the waters around were black and empty there was no sign even of the dinghy id expected to see every light in torbay lit up like a naval review those four shots even the lilliputs sharp lightweighted cracks should have had them all on their feet but nothing no sign no movement at all the gin bottle levels would be lower than ever i looked at the compass northtwentywest like the honeybee for the flower the iron filing for the magnet uncle arthur was determinedly heading straight for the shore again i took the wheel from him gently but firmly and said you came bit close to the pier back there sir i believe i did he took out a handkerchief and wiped his monocle damn glass misted up just at the wrong moment i trust calvert that you werent just firing at random out there uncle arthur had become a good deal more bellicose in the past hour or so hed had a high regard for hunslett i got jacques and kramer jacques was the handy one with the automatic arms hes dead i think kramer is too quinn got away what a setup i thought bleakly what a setup alone with uncle arthur on the high seas in the darkness of the night id always known that his eyesight even in optimum conditions was pretty poor but id never suspected that when the sun was down he was virtually blind as a bat but unfortunately unlike the bat uncle arthur wasnt equipped with a builtin radar which would enable him to shy clear of rocks headlands islands and suchlike obstructions of a similarly permanent and final nature with which we might go bump in the dark to all intents and purposes i was singlehanded this called for a radical revision in plans only i didnt see how i could radically revise anything not too bad uncle arthur said approvingly pity about quinn but otherwise not too bad at alt the ranks of the ungodly are being satisfactorily depleted do you think theyll come after us no for four reasons one they wont know yet what has happened two both their sorties this evening have gone badly and they wont be in a hurry to try any more boarding expeditions for some time three theyd use the tender for this job not the shangrila and if they get that tender a hundred yards ive lost all faith in demerara sugar four theres mist or fog coming up the lights of torbay are obscured already they cant follow us because they cant find us till that moment the only source of illumination wed had in the wheelhouse had come from the reflected light of the compass lamp suddenly the overhead light came on charlotte skourass hand was on the switch her face was haggard and she was staring at me as if i were the thing from outer space not one of those admiring affectionate looks what kind of man are you mr calvert no philip this time her voice was lower and huskier than ever and it had a shake in it you youre not human you kill two men and go on speaking calmly and reasonably as if nothing had happened what in gods name are you a hired killer its its unnatural have you no feelings no emotions no regrets yes i have im sorry i didnt kill quinn too she stared at me with something like horror in her face then switched her gaze to uncle arthur she said to him and her voice was almost a whisper i saw that man sir arthur i saw his face being blown apart by the bullets mr calvert could have could have arrested him held him up and handed him over to the police but he didnt he killed him and the other it was slow and deliberate why why why theres no why about it my dear charlotte sir arthur sounded almost irritable theres no justification needed calvert killed them or they killed us they came to kill us you told us that yourself would you feel any compunction at killing a poisonous snake those men were no better than that as for arresting them uncle arthur paused maybe for the short laugh he gave maybe because he was trying to recall the rest of the homily id delivered to him earlier that evening theres no intermediate stage in this game ifs kill or be killed these are dangerous and deadly men and you never give them warning good old uncle arthur hed remembered the whole lecture practically word for word she looked at him for a long moment her face uncomprehending looked at me then slowly turned and left the wheelhouse i said to uncle arthur youre just as bad as i am she reappeared again exactly at midnight switching on the light as she entered her hair was combed and neat her face was less puffy and she was dressed in one of those synthetic fibre dresses white ribbed and totally failing to give the impression that she stood in need of a good meal from the way she eased her shoulders i could see that her back hurt she gave me a faint tentative smile she got none in return i said half an hour ago rounding carrara point i near as dammit carried away the lighthouse now i hope im heading north of dubh sgeir but i may be heading straight into the middle of it it couldnt be any blacker if you were a mile down in an abandoned coal mine the fog is thickening im a not very experienced sailor trying to navigate my way through the most dangerous waters in britain and whatever hope we have of survival depends on the preservation of what nightsight ive slowly and painfully built up over the past hour or so put out that damned light im sorry the light went out i didnt think and dont switch on any other lights either not even in your cabin rocks are the least of my worries in loch houron im sorry she repeated and im sorry about earlier on thats why i came up to tell you that about the way i spoke and leaving so abruptly i mean ive no right to sit on judgment on others and i think my judgment was wrong i was just well literally shocked to see two men killed like that no not killed theres always heat and anger about killing to see two men executed like that because it wasnt kill or be killed as sir arthur said and then see the person who did it not care her voice faded away uncertainly you might as well get your facts and figures right my dear uncle arthur said three men not two he killed one just before you came on board tonight he had no option but philip calvert is not what any reasonable man would call a killer he doesnt care in the way you say because if he did he would go mad in another way he cares very much he doesnt do this job for money hes miserably paid for a man of his unique talents i made a mental note to bring this up next time we were alone he doesnt do it for excitement for what is the modern expression kicks a man who devotes his spare time to music astronomy and philosophy does not live for kicks but he cares he cares for the difference between right and wrong between good and evil and when that difference is great enough and the evil threatens to destroy the good then he does not hesitate to take steps to redress the balance and maybe that makes him better than either you or me my dear charlotte and thats not all of it either i said im also renowned for my kindness to little children im sorry calvert uncle arthur said no offence and no embarrassment i hope but if charlotte thought it important enough to come up here and apologise i thought it important enough to set the record straight thats not all charlotte came up for i said nastily if dials what she came up for in the first place she came up here because shes consumed with feminine curiosity she wants to know where we are going do you mind if i smoke she asked dont strike the match in front of my eyes she lit the cigarette and said consumed with curiosity is right what do you think not about where were going i know where were going you told me up loch houron what i want to know is what is going on what all this dreadful mystery is about why all the comings and goings of strange men aboard the shangrila what is so fantistically important to justify the deaths of three men in one evening what you are doing here what you are who you are i never really thought you were a unesco delegate sir arthur i know now youre not please i have the right to know i think dont tell her i advised why ever not uncle arthur said huffily as she says she is deeply involved whether she wants it or not she does have the right to know beside the whole thing will be public knowledge in a day or two you didnt think of that when you threatened sergeant macdonald with dismissal and imprisonment if he contravened the official secrets act merely because he could ruin things by talking out of turn he said stiffly lady i mean charlotte is in no position to do so not of course he went on quickly that she would ever dream of doing so preposterous charlotte is an old and dear friend a trusted friend calvert she shall know charlotte said quietly i have the feeling that our friend mr calvert does not care for me overmuch or maybe he just does not care for women i care like anything i said i was merely reminding the admiral of his own dictum never never never i forget how many nevers i think there were four or five tell anyone anything unless its necessary essential and vital in this case its none of the three uncle arthur lit another vile cheroot and ignored me his dictum was not meant to refer to confidential exchanges between members of the aristocracy he said this is the case of the missing ships my dear charlotte five missing ships to be precise not to mention a fair scattering of very much smaller vessels also missing or destroyed five ships i said on th april of this year the ss holmwood disappeared off the south coast of ireland it was an act of piracy the crew was imprisoned ashore kept tinder guard for two or three days then released unharmed the holmwood was never heard of again on th april the mv antara vanished in st georges channel on th may the mv headley pioneer disappeared off northern ireland on th august the ss hurricane spray disappeared after leaving the clyde and finally last saturday a vessel called the nantesville vanished soon after leaving bristol in all cases the crews turned up unharmed apart from their disappearances and the safe reappearances of their crews those five vessels all had one thing in common they were carrying extremely valuable and virtually untraceable cargoes the holmwood had two and a half million pounds of south african gold aboard the antara had a million and a half pounds worth of uncut brazilian diamonds for industrial use the headley pioneer had close on two million pounds worth of mixed cut and uncut andean emeralds from the muzo mines in columbia the hurricane spray which had called in at glasgow en route from rotterdam to new york had just over three million pounds worth of diamonds nearly all cut and the last one the nantesville uncle arthur almost choked over this one had eight million pounds in gold ingots reserves being called in by die us treasury we had no idea where the people responsible for these disappearances were getting their information such arrangements as to the decision to ship when how and how much are made in conditions of intense secrecy they whoever they are had impeccable sources of information calvert says he knows those sources now after the disappearance of the first three ships and about six million pounds worth of specie it was obvious that a meticulously organised gang was at work do you mean to say do you mean to say that captain imrie is mixed up in this charlotte asked mixed up is hardly the word uncle arthur said dryly he may well be the directing mind behind it all and dont forget old man skouras i advised hes pretty deep in the mire too about up to his ears i should say youve no right to say that charlotte said quickly no right why ever not whats he to you and whats all this defence of the maestro of the bullwhip hows your back now she said nothing uncle arthur said nothing in a different kind of way then went on it was calverts idea to hide two of our men and a radio signal transmitter on most of the ships that sailed with cargoes of bullion or specie after the headley pioneer had vanished we had no difficulty as you can imagine in securing the cooperation of the various exporting and shipping companies and governments concerned our agents we had three pairs working usually hid among the cargo or in some empty cabin or machinery space with a food supply only the masters of the vessels concerned knew they were aboard they delivered a fifteensecond homing signal at fixed very fixed but highly irregular intervals those signals were picked up at selected receiving stations round the west coast we limited our stations to that area for that was where the released crews had been picked up and by a receiver aboard this very boat here the firecrest my dear charlotte is a highly unusual craft in many respects i thought he was going to boast quietly of course of his own brilliance in designing the firecrest but he remembered in time that i knew the truth between th may and th august nothing happened no piracy we believe they were deterred by the short light nights on th august the hurricane spray disappeared we had no one aboard that vessel we couldnt cover them all but we had two men aboard the nantesville the ship that sailed last saturday delmont and baker two of our best men the nantesville was forcibly taken just off the bristol channel baker and delmont immediately began the scheduled transmissions crossbearings gave us a completely accurate position at least every halfhour calvert and hunslett were in dublin waiting as soon thats right she interrupted mr hunslett where is he i havent seen in a moment the firecrest moved out not following the nantesville but moving ahead of its predicted course they reached the mull of kintyre and had intended waiting till the nantesville approached there but a southwesterly gale blew up out of nowhere and the firecrest had to run for shelter when the nantesville reached the mull of kintyre area our radio beacon fixes indicated that she was still on a mainly northerly course and that it looked as if she might pass up the mull of kintyre on the outside the western side calvert took a chance ran up loch fyne and through the crinan canal he spent the night in the crinan seabasin the sealock is closed at night calvert could have obtained the authority to have it opened but he didnt want to the wind had veered to westerly late that evening and small boats dont move out of crinan through the dorus mor in a westerly gusting up to force not if they have wives and families to support and even if they havent during the night the nantesville turned out west into the atlantic we thought we had lost her we think we know now why she turned out i she wanted to arrive at a certain place at a certain state of the tide in the hours of darkness and she had time to kill she went west we believe firstly because k was the easiest way to ride out the westerly gale and secondly because she didnt want to be seen hanging around the coast all of the next day and preferred to make a direct approach from the sea as darkness was falling the weather moderated a fair way overnight calvert left crinan at dawn almost at the very minute the nantesville turned back east again radio transmissions were still coming in from baker and delmont exactly on schedule the last transmission came at hours that morning after that nothing uncle arthur stopped and the cheroot glowed fiercely in the darkness he could have made a fortune contracting out to the cargo shipping companies as a oneman fumigating service then he went on very quickly as if he didnt like what he had to say next and im sure lie didnt we dont know what happened they may have betrayed themselves by some careless action i dont think so they were too good for that some member of the prize crew may just have stumbled over their hidingplace again its unlikely and a man who stumbled over baker and delmont wouldnt be doing any more stumbling for some time to come calvert thinks and i agree with him that by the one unpredictable chance in ten thousand the prize crews radiooperator happened to be traversing baker and delmonts waveband at the very moment they were sending their fifteen second transmission at that range hed about have his head blasted off and the rest was inevitable a plot of the nantesvilles fixes between dawn and the last transmission showed her course as true predicted destination loch houron estimated time of arrival sunset calvert had less than a third of the nantesvilles distance to cover but he didnt take the firecrest into loch houron because he was pretty sure that captain imrie would recognise a radio beacon transmitter when he saw one and would assume that we had his course calvert was also pretty sure that if the nantesville elected to continue on that course and he had a hunch that it would any craft found in the entrance to loch houron would receive pretty short shrift either by being run down or sunk by gunfire so he parked the firecrest in torbay and was skulking around the entrance to loch houron in a frogmans suit and with a motorised rubber dinghy when the nantesville turned up he went aboard in darkness the name was changed the flag was changed one mast was missing and the superstructure had been repainted but it was the nantesville next day calvert and hunslett were stormbound in torbay but on wednesday calvert organised an air search for the nantesville or some place where she might have been hidden he made a mistake he considered it extremely unlikely that the nantesville would still be in loch houron because imrie knew that we knew that he had been headed there and therefore would not stay there indefinitely because the chart showed loch houron as being the last place in scotland where anyone in their sane minds would consider hiding a vessel and because after calvert had left the nantesville that evening shed got under way and started to move out to carrara point calvert thought shed just stayed in loch houron till it was dark enough to pass undetected down the sound of torbay or round the south of torbay island to the mainland so he concentrated most of his search on the mainland and on the sound of torbay and torbay itself he thinks now the nantesville is in loch houron were going there to find out his cheroot glowed again and thats it my dear now with your permission id like to spend an hour on the saloon settee those nocturnal escapades he sighed and finished tm not a boy any longer i need my sleep i liked that i wasnt a boy any longer either and i didnt seem to have slept for months uncle arthur i knew always went to bed on the stroke of midnight and the poor man had already lost fifteen minutes but i didnt see what i could do about it one of my few remaining ambitions in life was to reach pensionable age and i couldnt make a better start than by ensuring that uncle arthur never laid hands on the wheel of the firecrest but surely thats not it charlotte protested thats not all of it mr hunslett wheres mr hunslett and you said mr calvert was aboard the nantesville how on earth did there are some things you are better not knowing my dear why distress yourself unnecessarily just leave this to us you havent had a good look at me recently have you sir arthur she asked quietly i dont understand it may have escaped your attention but fm not a child any more im not even young any more please dont treat me as a juvenile and if you want to get to that settee tonight very well if you insist the violence im afraid has not all been onesided calvert as i said was about the nantesville he found my two operatives baker and delmont uncle arthur had the impersonal emotionless voice of a man checking his laundry list both men had been stabbed to death this evening the pilot of calverts helicopter was killed when the machine was shot down in the sound of torbay an hour after that hunslett was murdered calvert found him in the firecrests engineroom with a broken neck uncle arthurs cheroot glowed and faded at least half a dozen times before charlotte spoke the shake was back in her voice they are fiends fiends a long pause then how can you cope with people like that uncle arthur puffed a bit more then said candidly i dont intend to try you dont find generals slugging it out handtohand in the trenches calvert will cope with them good night my dear he pushed off i didnt contradict him but i knew that calvert couldnt cope with them not any more he couldnt calvert had to have help with a crew consisting of a myopic boss and a girl who every time i looked at her listened to her or thought of her starred the warning bells clanging away furiously in the back of my head calvert had to have a great deal of help and he had to have it fast after uncle arthur had retired charlotte and i stood in silence in the darkened wheelhouse but a companionable silence you can always tell the rain drummed on the wheelhouse roof it was as dark as it ever becomes at sea and the patches of white fog were increasing in density and number because of them i had cut down to half speed and with the loss of steerage way and that heavy westerly sea coining up dead astern id normally have been hard put to it to control the direction of the firecrest but i had the autopilot on and switched to fineand we were doing famously the autopilot was a much better helmsman than i was and streets ahead of uncle arthur charlotte said suddenly what is it you intend to do tonight you are a gourmand for information dont you know that uncle arthur sorry sir arthur and i are engaged upon a highly secret mission security is all and now youre laughing at me and forgetting im along on this secret mission too im glad youre along and im not laughing at you because ill be leaving this boat once or twice tonight and i have to have somebody i can trust to look after it when im away you have sir arthur i have as you say sir arthur theres no one alive for whose judgment and intelligence i have greater respect but at the present moment id trade in all the judgment and intelligence in the world for a pair of sharp young eyes going by tonights performance sir arthur shouldnt be allowed out without a white stick how are yours well theyre not so young any more but i think theyre sharp enough so i can rely on you on me i well i dont know anything about handling boats you and sir arthur should make a great team i saw you star once in a french film about we never left the studio even in the studio pool i had a standin well there be no standin tonight i glanced out through the streaming windows and no studio pool this is the real stuff the genuine atlantic a pair of eyes charlotte thats all i require a pair of eyes just cruising up and down till i come back and seeing that you dont go on the rocks can you do that will i have any option nary an option then ill try where are you going ashore eilean oran and craigmore the two innermost islands in loch houron if i said thoughtfully i can find them eilean oran and craigmore i could have been wrong but i thought the faint french accent a vast improvement on the original gaelic pronunciation it seems so wrong so very wrong in the middle of all this hate and avarice and killing these names they breathe the very spirit of romance a highly deceptive form of respiration my dear id have to watch myself i was getting as bad as uncle arthur those islands breathe the very spirit of bare bleak and rocky desolation but eilean oran and craigmore hold the key to everything of that im very sure she said nothing i stared out through the highspeed kent clearview screen and wondered if id see dubh sgeir before it saw me after a couple of minutes i felt a hand on my upper arm and she was very close to me the hand was trembling wherever shed come by her perfume it hadnt been bought in a supermarket or fallen out of a christmas cracker momentarily and vaguely i wondered about the grievous impossibility of ever understanding the feminine mind before fleeing for what she had thought to be her life and embarking upon a hazardous swim in the waters of torbay harbour she hadnt forgotten to pack a sachet of perfume in her polythene kitbag for nothing was ever surer than that any perfume shed been wearing had been well and truly removed before id fished her out of torbay harbour philip well this was better than the mr calvert stuff i was glad uncle arthur wasnt there to have his aristocratic feelings scandalised i said uhhuh im sorry she said it as if she meant it and i supposed i should have tried to forget that she was once the best actress in europe im truly sorry about what i said about what i thought earlier on for thinking you were a monster the men you killed i mean i well i didnt know about hunslett and baker and delmont and the helicopter pilot all your friends im truly sorry philip truly she was overdoing it she was also too damn close too damn warm youd have required a piledriver in top condition to get a cigarette card between us and that perfume that hadnt fallen out of a cracker intoxicating the adboys in the glossies would have called it and all the time the warning bells were clanging away like a burglar alarm with the st viruss dance i made a manful effort to do something about it i put my mind to higher things she said nothing she just squeezed my arm a bit more and even the piledriver would have gone on strike for piecework rates i could hear the big diesel exhaust thudding away behind us a sound of desolate reassurance the firecrest swooned down the long overtaking combers then gently soared again i was conscious for the first time of a curious meteorological freak in the western isles a marked rise in temperature after midnight and id have to speak to the kent boys about their guarantee that their clearview screen wouldnt mist up under any conditions but maybe that wasnt fair maybe theyd never visualised conditions like this i was just thinking of switching off the autopilot to give me something to do when she said i think ill go below soon would you like a cup of coffee first as long as you dont have to put on a light to do it and as long as you dont trip over uncle arthur i mean sir uncle arthur will do just fine she said it suits him another squeeze of the arm and she was gone the meteorological freak was of short duration by and by the temperature dropped back to normal and the kent guarantee became operative again i took a chance left the firecrest to its own devices and nipped aft to the stern locker i took out my scuba diving equipment together with aircylinders and mask and brought them forard to the wheelhouse it took her twentyfive minutes to make the coffee calor gas has many times the calorific efficiency of standard domestic coal gas and even allowing for the difficulties of operating in darkness this was surely a world record for slowness in making coffee at sea i heard the clatter of crockery as the coffee was brought through the saloon and smiled cynically to myself in the darkness then i thought of hunslett and baker and delmont and williams and i wasnt smiling any more i still wasnt smiling when i dragged myself on to the rocks of eilean oran removed the scuba equipment and set the big rectangularbased swivelheaded torch between a couple of stones with its beam staring out to sea i wasnt smiling but it wasnt for the same reason that i hadnt been smiling when charlotte had brought the coffee to the wheelhouse just over half an hour ago i wasnt smiling because i was in a state of high apprehension and i was in a state of high apprehension because for ten minutes before leaving the firecrest id tried to instruct sir arthur and charlotte in the technique of keeping a boat in a constant position relative to a fixed mark on the shore keep her on a due west compass heading id said keep her bows on to the sea and wind with the engine at slow that will give you enough steerage way to keep your head up if you find yourselves creeping too far forwards come round to the south if theyd come round to the north theyd have found themselves high and dry on the rock shores of eilean oran head due east at half speed because if you go any slower youll broach to come sharply round to the north then head west again at slow speed you can see those breakers on the south shore there whatever you do keep them at least two hundred yards away on the starboard hand when youre going west and a bit more when youre going east they had solemnly assured me that they would do just that and seemed a bit chuffed because of what must have been my patent lack of faith in them both but id reason for my lack of faith for neither had shown any marked ability to make a clear distinction between shore breakers and the northsouth line of the foaming tops of the waves rolling eastwards towards the mainland in desperation id said id place a fixed light on the shore and that that would serve as a permanent guide i just trusted to god that uncle arthur wouldnt emulate die part of an eighteenthcentury french sloops skipper visavis the smugglers lamp on a rockgirt cornish shore and run the damned boat aground under the impression that he was heading for a beacon of hope he was a very clever man was uncle arthur but the sea was not his home the boatshed wasnt quite empty but it wasnt far off it i flashed my small torch around its interior and realised that maceacherns boatshed wasnt the place i was after there was nothing there but a weatherbeaten gunwalesplintered launch with amidships an unboxed petrol engine that seemed to be a solid block of rust i came to the house on its northern side the side remote from the sea a light shone through a small window a light at halfpast one in the morning i crawled up to this and hitched a wary eye over the windowsill a neat clean wellcaredfor smah room with limewashed walk matcovered stone floor and the embers of a driftwood fire smouldering in an inglenook in the corner donald maceachern was sitting in a canebottomed chair still unshaven still in his monthold shirt his head bent staring into the dull red bean of the fire he had the look of a man who was staring into a dying fire because that was all that was left in the world for him to do i moved round to the door turned the handle and went inside he heard me and turned around not quickly just the way a man would turn who knows there is nothing left on earth that can hurt him he looked at me looked at the gun in my hand looked at his own twelvebore hanging on a couple of nails on the wall then sank back into his chair again he said tonelessly who in the name of god are you calverts my name i was here yesterday i pulled off my rubber hood and be remembered all right i nodded to the twelvebore you wont be needing that gun tonight mr maceachern anyway you had the safety catch on you dont miss much he said slowly there were no cartridges in the gun and no one standing behind you was there i dont know what you mean he said tiredly who are you man what do you want i want to know why you gave me the welcome you did yesterday i put the gun away it was hardly friendly mr maceachern who are you sir he looked even older than he had done yesterday old and broken and done calvert they told you to discourage visitors didnt they mr maceachern no answer i asked some questions tonight of a friend of yours archie macdonald the torbay police sergeant he told me you were married i dont see mrs maceachern he half rose from his cane chair the old bloodshot eyes had a gleam to them he sank back again and the eyes dimmed you were out in your boat one night werent you mr maceachern you were out in your boat and you saw too much they caught you and they took you back here and they took mrs maceachern away and they told you that if you ever breathed a word to anyone alive you would never see your wife that way again alive i mean they told you to stay here in case any chance acquaintances or strangers should call by and wonder why you werent here and raise the alarm and just to make sure that you wouldnt be tempted to go the mainland for help although heaven knows i would have thought there would be no chance in the world of you being as mad as that they immobilised your engine saltwater impregnated sacks i shouldnt wonder so that any chance caller would think it was due to neglect and disuse not sabotage aye they did that he stared sightlessly into the fire his voice the sunken whisper of a man who is just thinking aloud and hardly aware that he is speaking they took her away and they ruined my boat and i had my life saving in the back room there and they took that too i wish id had a million pounds to give them if only they had left my main shes five years older than myself he had no defences left what in the name of god have you been living on every other week they bring me tinned food not much and condensed milk tea i have and i catch a fish now and then off the rocks he gazed into the fire his forehead wrinkling as if he were suddenly realising that i brought a new dimension into his life who are you sir who are you youre not one of them and youre not a policeman i know youre not a policeman ive seen them ive seen policemen but you are a very different kettle of fish there were the stirrings of life in him now life in his face and in his eyes he stared at me for a full minute and i was beginning to feel uncomfortable under the gaze of those faded eyes when he said i know who you are i know who you must be you are a government man you are an agent of the british secret service well by god i took off my hat to the old boy there i was looking nondescript as anything and buttoned to the chin in a scuba suit and he had me nailed right away so much for the inscrutable faces of the guardians of our countrys secrets i thought of what uncle arthur would have said to him the automatic threats of dismissaland imprisonment if the old man breathed a word but donald maceachern didnt have any job to be dismissed from and after a lifetime in eilean oran even a maximum security prison would have looked like a hostelry to which egon ronay would have lashed out six stars without a second thought so as there didnt seem to be much point in threatening him i said instead for the first time in my life i am an agent of the secret service mr maceachern i am going to bring your wife back to you he nodded very slowly then said you will be a very brave man mr calvert but you do not know the terrible men who will wait for you if i ever earn a medal mr maceachern it will be a case of mistaken identification but for the rest i know very well what i am up against just try to believe me mr maceachern it will be all right you were in the war mr maceachern you know you were told i shook my head nobody had to tell me thank you sir the back was suddenly very straight i was a soldier for twentytwo years i was a sergeant inthe st highland division you were a sergeant in the st highland division i repeated there are many people mr maceachern and not all of them scots who maintain that there was no better in the world and it is not donald maceachern who would be disagreeing with you sir for the first time the shadow of a smile touched the faded eyes there were maybe one or two worse you make your point mr calvert we were not namely for running away for losing hope for giving up too easily he rose abruptly to his feet in the name of god what am i talking about i am coming with you mr calvert i rose to my feet and touched my hands to his shoulders thank you mr maceachern but no youve done enough your fighting days are over leave this to me he looked at me in silence then nodded again the suggestion of a smile aye maybe youre right i would be getting in the way of a man like yourself i can see that he sat down wearily in his chair i moved to the door good night mr maceachern she will soon be safe she will soon be safe he repeated he looked up at me his eyes moist and when he spoke his voice held the same faint surprise as his face you know i believe she will she will im going to bring her back here personally and that will give me more pleasure than anything ive ever done in my life friday morning mr maceachern friday morning so soon so soon he was looking at a spot about a billion light years away and seemed unaware that i was standing by the open door he smiled a genuine smile of delight and the old eyes shone ill not sleep a wink tonight mr calvert nor a wink tomorrow night either youll sleep on friday i promised he couldnt see me any longer the tears were running down his grey unshaven cheeks so i closed the door with a quiet hand and left him alone with his dreams eight thursday am am i had exchanged eilean oran for the island of craigmore and i still wasnt smiling i wasnt smiling for all sorts of reasons i wasnt smiling because uncle arthur and charlotte skouras together made a nautical combination that terrified the life out of me because the northern tip of craigmore was much more exposed and reefhaunted than the south shore of eilean oran had been because the fog was thickening because i was breathless and bruised from big combers hurling me on to unseen reefs on my swim ashore because i was wondering whether i had any chance in the world of carrying out my rash promise to donald maceachern if i thought a bit more id no doubt i could come up with all sorts of other and equally valid reasons why i wasnt smiling but i hadnt the time to think any more about it the night was wearing on and id much to do before the dawn the nearest of the two fishing boats in the little natural harbour was rolling quite heavily in the waves that curled round the reef forming the natural breakwater to the west so i didnt have to worry too much about any splashing sound i might make as i hauled myself up on deck what i did have to worry about was that damned bright light in its sealed inverted glass by the flensing shed it was powerful enough to enable me to be seen from the other houses on shore but my worry about it was a little thing compared to my gratitude for its existence out in the wild blue yonder uncle arthur could do with every beacon of hope he could find it was a typical mfv about fortyfive feet long and with the general look of a boat that could laugh at a hurricane i went through it in two minutes all in immaculate condition not a thing aboard that shouldnt have been there just a genuine fishing boat my hopes began to rise there was no other direction they could go the second mfv was the mirror image of the first down to the last innocuous inch it wouldnt be true to say that my hopes were now soaring but at least they were getting up off the ground where theyd been for a long time i swam ashore parked my scuba equipment above the highwater mark and made my way to the flensing shed keeping its bulk between the light and myself as i went the shed contained winches steel tubs and barrels a variety of ferocious weapons doubtless used for flensing rolling cranes some unidentifiable but obviously harmless machinery the remains of some sharks and the most fearful smell id ever come across in my life i left hurriedly the first of the cottages yielded nothing i flashed a torch through a broken window the room was bare it looked as if no one had set foot there for half a century it was only too easy to believe williamss statement that this tiny hamlet had been abandoned before the first world war curiously the wallpaper looked as if it had been applied the previous day a curious and largely unexplained phenomenon in the western isles your grandmother in those days grandpa would have signed the pledge sooner than lift a finger inside the house slapped up some wallpaper at ninepence a yard and fifty years later it was still there as fresh as the day it had been put up the second cottage was as deserted as the first the third cottage the one most remote from the flensing shed was where the sharkfishers lived a logical and very understandable choice one would have thought the farther away from that olfactory horror the better had i the option id have been living in a tent on the other side of the island but that was a purely personal reaction the stench of that flensing shed was probably to the sharkfishers as is the ammonialaden nostrilwrinkling wholly awful mist liquid manure to the swiss farmers the very breath of being the symbol of success one can pay too high a price for success i eased open the welloiled sharkliver oil no doubt door and passed inside the torch came on again grandma wouldnt have gone very much on this front parlour but grandpa would cheerfully have sat there watching his beard turn white through the changing seasons without ever wanting to go down to the sea again one entire wall was given up to food supplies a miserable couple of dozen crates of whisky and score upon scores of crates of beer australians williams had said i could well believe it the other three walls there was hardly a scrap of wallpaper to be seen was devoted to a form of art in uninhibited detail and glorious technicolor of a type not usually to be found in the betterclass museums and art galleries not grandmas cup of tea at all i skirted the furniture which hadnt come out of harrods and opened the interior door a short corridor lay beyond two doors to the right three to the left working on the theory that the boss of the outfit probably had the largest room to himself i carefully opened the first door to the right the flashlight showed it to be a surprisingly comfortable room a good carpet heavy curtains a couple of good armchairs bedroom furniture in oak a double bed and a bookcase a shaded electric light hung above the bed those rugged australians believed in their home comforts there was a switch beside the door i touched it and the overhead lamp came on there was only one person in the double bed but even at that he was cramped in it its hard to gauge a mans height when hes lying down but if this lad tried to stand up in a room with a ceiling height of less than six feet four inches hed finish up with concussion his face was towards me but i couldnt see much of it it was hidden by a head of thick black hair that had fallen over his brows and the most magnificently bushy black beard id ever clapped eyes on he was sound asleep i crossed to the bed prodded his ribs with the gun barrel and a pressure sufficient to wake a lad of his size and said wake up he woke up i moved a respectful distance away he rubbed his eyes with one hairy forearm got his hands under him and heaved himself to a sitting position i wouldnt have been surprised to see him wearing a bearskin but no he was wearing a pair of pyjamas in excellent taste i might have chosen the colour myself lawabiding citizens woken in the dark watches of the night by a gunpointing stranger react in all sorts of ways varying from terror to apoplecticallypurple outrage the man in the beard didnt react in any of the standard ways at all he just stared at me from under dark overhanging cliffs of eyebrows and the expression in the eyes was that of a bengal tiger mentally tucking in his napkin before launching himself on the thirtyfoot leap that is going to culminate in lunch i stepped back another couple of paces and said dont try it put that gun away sonny boy he said the deep rumbling voice seemed to come from the innermost recesses of the carlsbad cavern put it away or ill have to get up and clobber you and take it from you dont be like that i complained then added politely if i put it away will you clobber me he considered this for a moment then said no he reached out for a big black cigar and lit it his eyes on me all the time the acrid fumes reached across the room and as it isnt polite for a guest in anothers house to rush to open the nearest window without permission i didnt but it was a near thing no wonder hed never notice the stench from the flensing shed compared to this uncle arthurs cheroots came into the same category as charlottes perfume my apologies for the intrusion are you tim hutchinson yeah and you sonny boy philip calvert i want to use one of your boats transmitters to contact london i also need your help how urgently you cant imagine a good many lives and millions of pounds can be lost in the next twentyfour hours he watched a particularly noxious cloud of this vesuvian poison gas drift up to the cringing ceiling then bent his eyes on me again aint you the little kidder now sonny boy im not kidding you big black ape and while were at it well dispense with the sonny boy timothy he bent forward the deepset coalblack eyes not at all as friendly as i would have liked then relaxed with a laugh touché as my french governess used to say maybe you aint kidding at that what are you calvert in for a penny in for a pound this man would grant his cooperation for nothing less than the truth and he looked like a man whose cooperation would be very well worth having so for the second time that night and the second time in my life i said im an agent of the british secret service i was glad that uncle arthur was out there fighting for his life on the rolling deep his blood pressure wasnt what it ought to have been and a thing like this twice in one night could have been enough to see him off he considered my reply for some time then said the secret service i guess you have to be at that or a nut case but you blokes never tell i had to it would have been obvious anyway when i tell you what i have to tell you ill get dressed join you in the front room in two minutes help yourself to a scotch there the beard twitched and i deduced from this that he was grinning you should find some somewhere i went out found some somewhere and was conducting myself on the grand tour of the craigmore art gallery when tim hutchinson came in he was dressed all in black trousers sailors jersey mackinaw and seaboots beds were deceptive hed probably passed the six foot four mark when he was about twelve and had just stopped growing he glanced at the collection and grinned who would have thought it he said the guggenheim and craigmore hotbeds of culture both of them dont you think the one with the earrings looks indecently overdressed you must have scoured the great galleries of the world i said reverently im no connoisseur renoir and matisse are my cup of tea it was so unlikely that it had to be true you look like a man in a hurry just leave out all the inessentials i left out the inessentials but not one of the essentials unlike macdonald and charlotte hutchinson got not only the truth but the whole truth well if that isnt the most goddamned story any man ever heard and right under our bloody noses it was hard to tell at times whether hutchinson was australian or american i learnt later that hed spent many years tunafishing in florida so it was you in that chopper this afternoon brother youve had a day and then some i retract that sonny boy crack one of my more illadvised comments what do you want calvert so i told him what i wanted his own personal assistance that night the loan of his boats and crews for the next twentyfour hours and the use of a radio transmitter immediately he nodded count on us ill tell the boys you can start using that transmitter right away id rather go out with you to our boat right away i said leave you there and come back in myself to transmit you lack a mite confidence in your crew hey im expecting to see the bows of the firecrest coming through that front door any minute i can do better than that ill roust out a couple of the boys well take the charmaine thats the mfv nearest the flensing shed out to the firecrest ill go aboard well cruise around till you get your message off then you come aboard the firecrest while the boys take the charmaine back again i thought of the maelstrom of white breakers outside the mouth of the alleged harbour i said it wont be too dangerous to take an mfv out on a night like this whats wrong with a night like this its a fine fresh night you couldnt ask for better this is nothing ive seen the boys take a boat out there six oclock in a black december evening into a full gale what kind of emergency was that a serious one admittedly he grinned wed run out of supplies and the boys wanted to get to torbay before the pubs shut straight up calvert i said no more it was obviously going to be a great comfort to have hutchinson around with me for the rest of the night he turned towards the corridor and hesitated two of the boys are married i wonder therell be no danger for them besides theyll be well rewarded for their work dont spoil it calvert for a man with such a deep rumbling voice he could make it very soft at times we dont take money for this kind of work im not hiring you i said tiredly id quite enough people fighting me already without tim hutchinson joining their ranks theres an insurance reward i have been instructed to offer you half ah now thats very different indeed ill be delighted to relieve the insurance companies of their excess cash at any time but not half calvert not half not for a days work not after all youve done twentyfive per cent to us seventyfive per cent to you and your friends half is what you get the other hah will be used to pay compensation for those who have suffered hardship theres an old couple on eilean oran for instance who are going to be wealthy beyond their dreams for the rest of their days you get nothing i get my salary the size of which id rather not discuss as its a sore point civil servants are not permitted to accept gratuities you mean to say you get beaten up shot down halfdrowned and suffered another couple of murder attempts just for a lousy pay cheque what makes you tick calvert why the hell do you do it thats not an original question i ask myself the same question about twenty times a day rather more often recently its time we were gone ill get the boys up theyll be tickled pink by those gold watches or whatever the insurance boys will be handing over engraved of course we insist on that the reward will be in cash not kind depends how much of the stolen goods are recovered were pretty sure to recover all the nantesvilles cargo chances are that well recover the lot the award is ten per cent yours will be five the minimum you and your boys will pick up will be four hundred thousand pounds the maximum will be eight hundred and fifty thousand pounds i mean say that in english he looked as if the london post office tower had fallen on top of him so i said it again and after a time he looked as if only a telegraph pole had fallen on him and said carefully at rates like that a man might expect a fair bit of cooperation say no more put right out of your head any thoughts you had of advertising in the telegraph tim hutchinson is your man and tim hutchinson was undoubtedly my man on a night like that dark as doomsday rain sluicing down and a thickening mist making it impossible for me at least to tell the difference between a naturally breaking sea and a wave foaming over a reef tim hutchinson was my man cheap at half a million he was one of that rare breed that very rare breed of naturals to whom the sea is truly home twenty years daily polishing and refining in every conceivable condition a rarelybestowed gift with which you must be born in the first place and anyone can be like this just as the great grand prix drivers the carraciolas and nuvolaris and clarks operate on a level incomprehensible to highly competent drivers of very fast cars so hutchinson operated on a level incomprehensible to the finest of amateur yachtsmen search your ocean racing clubs and olympic yachting teams the world over and you will not find men like this they are to be found and even then so very seldom only in the ranks of the professional deepsea fishermen those huge hands on throttle and wheel had the delicacy of a moth he had the nightsight of a barn owl and an ear which could infallibly distinguish between waves breaking in the open sea on reefs or on shores he could invariably tell the size and direction of seas coming at him out of the darkness and mist and touch wheel or throttle as need be he had an inbuilt computer which provided instant correlation of wind tide current and our own speed and always let him know exactly where he was and ill swear he could smell land even on a lee shore and with the rest of us suffering olfactory paralysis from the fumes of the big black cigars which seemed to be an inseparable part of the man it required only ten minutes beside him to realise that ones ignorance of the sea and ships was almost total a chastening discovery he took the charmaine out through the scylla and charybdis of that evil alleged harbour entrance under full throttle foaming whitefanged reefs reached out at us bare feet away on either side he didnt seem to notice them he certainly didnt look at them the two boys hed brought with him a couple of stunted lads of about six foot two or thereabouts yawned prodigiously hutchinson located the firecrest a hundred yards before i could even begin to imagine i could see any shape at all and brought the charmaine alongside as neatly as i could part my car by the kerb in broad daylight on one of my better days that was i went aboard the firecrest to the vast alarm of uncle arthur and charlotte whod heard no whisper of our arrival explained the situation introduced hutchinson and went back aboard the charmaine fifteen minutes later the radio call over i was back aboard the firecrest uncle arthur and tim hutchinson were already thick as thieves the bearded australian giant was extremely courteous and respectful calling uncle arthur admiralevery other sentence while uncle arthur was plainly delighted and vastly relieved to have him on board if i felt this was a slight on my own seamanlike qualities i was undoubtedly correct where are we off to now charlotte skouras asked i was disappointed to see that she was just as relieved as uncle arthur dubh sgeir i said to pay a call on lord kirkside and his charming daughter dubh sgeir she seemed taken aback i thought you said the answer lay in eilean oran and craigmore so i did the answers to some essential preliminary questions but the end of the road lies in dubh sgeir and die foot of the rainbow you talk in riddles she said impatiently not to me he doesnt hutchinson said jovially the foot of the rainbow maam thats where the pot of gold lies here and now id settle for a pot of coffee i said coffee for four and ill make it with my own fair hands i think i would rather go to bed charlotte said i am very tired you made me drink your coffee i said threateningly now you drink mine fairs fair if you are quick then i was quick id four cups on a little tin tray in nothing flat a powerful mixture of instant coffee milk and sugar in all of them and a little something extra hi one of them there were no complaints about the coffee hutchinson drained his cup and said cant see why you three shouldnt get your heads down for a little unless you think i need help no one thought he needed help charlotte skouras was the first to go saying she felt very sleepy which i didnt doubt she sounded it uncle arthur and i left a moment later tim hutchinson promising to call me when we neared the landing stage on the west side of dubh sgeir uncle arthur wrapped himself in a rug on the saloon settee i went to my own cabin and lay down i lay for three minutes then rose picked up a threecornered file softly opened my cabin door and as softly knocked on charlottes door there was no reply so i opened the door passed in silently closed it and switched on the lights she was asleep all right she was a million miles away she hadnt even managed to make it to bed she was lying on the carpet still fully clothed i put her on the bunk and pulled a couple of blankets over her i pushed up a sleeve and examined the mark left by the rope burn it wasnt a very big cabin and it took me only a minute to find what i was looking for it made a pleasant change and a very refreshing one to transfer myself from the firecrest to land without that damned clammy scuba suit impeding every stroke or step of the way how tim hutchinson located that old stone pier in the rain the fog and the darkness was something that would have been for ever beyond me if he hadnt told me later that night he sent me to the bows with a torch in my hand and damned if the thing didnt loom out of the darkness as if hed gone hi on a radio bearing he went into reverse brought the bows plunging heavily in the deep troughs to within two feet of the pier waited till i picked my moment to jump off then went full astern and disappeared into the fog and darkness i tried to imagine uncle arthur executing that lot but my imagination wasnt up to it it boggled uncle arthur thank heaven slept the sleep of the just drake was in his hammock and a thousand miles away dreaming all the time of wci the path from the landing stage to the plateau above was steep and crumbling and someone had carelessly forgotten to equip k with a handrail on the seaward side i was in no way heavily burdened all i was carrying apart from the weight of my own years was a torch gun and coil of rope id neither the intention nor the expectation of doing a douglas fairbanks on the outer battlements of the dubh sgeir castle but experience had taught me that a rope was the most essential piece of equipment to carry along on a jaunt on a precipitously walled island but even so i was breathing pretty heavily by the time i reached the top i turned not towards the castle but north along the grass strip that led to the cliff at the northern end of the island the strip that lord kirksides elder son had taken off from in his beechcraft on the day when he and his brotherinlaw to be had died the strip that williams and i had flown along less than twelve hours previously after our talk with lord kirkside and his daughter the strip at the abrupt northern end of which id imagined id seen what id wanted to see but couldnt be sure now i was going to make sure the strip was smooth and flat and i made good time without having to use the big rubber torch i had with me i didnt dare use it anyway not so close to the castle there was no light to be seen from there but that was no guarantee that the ungodly werent maintaining a sleepless watch on the battlements if i were the ungodly id have been maintaining a sleepless watch on the battlements i stumbled over something warm and soft and alive and hit the ground hard my nerves werent what they had been fortyeight hours ago and my reactions were comparatively fast i had the knife in my hand and was on to him before he could get to his feet to his four feet he had about him the pungent aroma of a refugee from tim hutchinsons flensing shed well might they say why stinks the goat on yonder hill who seems to dote on chlorophyll i said a few conciliatory words to our fourfooted friend and it seemed to work for he kept his horns to himself i went on my way this humiliating sort of encounter id noticed never happened to the errol flynns of this world moreover if enrol flynn had been carrying a torch a little fall like that would not have smashed it had he been carrying only a candle it would still have kept burning brightly in the darkness but not my torch not my rubber encased rubber mounted bulb plexiglass guaranteed unbreakable torch it was kaput i fished out the little pencil torch and tried it inside my jacket i could have spared myself the caution a glowworm would have sneered at it i stuck it back in my pocket and kept going i didnt know how far i was from the precipitous end of the cliff and id no intention of finding out the hard way i dropped to my hands and knees and crawled forward the glowworm leading the way i reached the cliff edge in five minutes and found what i was looking for almost at once the deep score on the cliff edge was almost eighteen inches in width and four in depth in the centre the mark was fresh but not too fresh the grass had grown in again in most places the time factor would be just about right it was the mark that had been left by the tail fuselage of the beechcraft plane when with no one aboard it had been started up throttle opened and then the chocks removed it hadnt had enough speed to become airborne and had fallen over the cliff edge ripping this score in the earth as it had gone that was all i needed that and the holed hull of the oxford expedition boat and the dark circles under the blue eyes of susan kirkside here was certainty i heard a slight noise behind me a moderately fit fiveyearold grabbing me by the ankles could have had me over the edge with nothing i could do to prevent it or maybe it was billy the kid back to wreak vengeance for the rude interruption of his nights sleep i swung round with torch and gun at the ready it was billy the kid his yellow eyes staring balefully out of the night but his eyes belied him he was just curious or friendly or both i moved back slowly till i was out of butting range patted him weakly on the head and left at this rate id die of heart failure before the night was out the rain had eased by this time and the wind fallen away quite a bit but to compensate for this the mist was worse than ever it swirled clammily around me and i couldnt see four feet in front of my face i wondered grimly how hutchinson was getting on in this lot but put him quickly out of my mind id no doubt he was a damned sight better at his job than i was at mine i kept the wind on my right cheek and continued towards the castle under my rubbercanvas raincoat my last suit was sodden the civil service was going to be faced with a cleaners bill of some note i near as a toucher walked into the castle wall but saw its loom just in time i didnt know whether i was to the right or the left of the entrance gate on the landward side so i felt my way cautiously to the left to find out after about ten feet the wall fell away at right angles to another wall that meant id arrived at the left or eastern side of the gate i began to feel my way to the right it was as well i had come upon the castle wall where i had done had i arrived at the righthand side id have been upwind of the central gate and would never have smelted the tobacco smoke it wasnt much as tobacco went nothing like as robust as uncle arthurs cheroots and positively anaemic as compared to tim hutchinsons portable poisongas factories but tobacco smoke for all that someone at the entrance gate was smoking a cigarette it was axiomatic that sentries should never smoke cigarettes this i could deal with theyd never trained me on how to handle billy goats on the edge of a precipice but on this subject they had become boringly repetitive i held the gun by the barrel and moved quietly forwards he was leaning against the corner of the entrance a hardlyseen shape but his position outlined clearly enough by the movement of his cigarette end i waited till he brought it to his mouth for the third time and when it was glowing at its brightest and his night vision consequently most affected i took one step forward and brought the butt down where by extension of the curve and subsequent glow of the cigarette end the back of the head of a normal man ought to have been fortunately he was a normal man he fell back against me i caught him and something jabbed painfully into my ribs i let him finish the trip down on his own and removed this item that had become stuck in my coat a bayonet and what was more a bayonet with a very nasty point to it attached to the bayonet was a lee enfield very military it seemed unlikely that this was just a routine precaution our friends were becoming worried and i had no means of knowing how much they knew or guessed time was running very short for them almost as short as it was for me in a few hours it would be dawn i took the rifle and moved cautiously towards the edge of the cliff the bayonet prodding the earth ahead of me as i went by this time i was becoming quite adept at not falling over the edges of precipices and besides with a rifle and bayonet stretched out in advance you have fivefeet notification of where eternity begins i found the edge stepped back reversed the rifle made two parallel scores in the sodden turf about a foot apart and eighteen inches in length terminating on the very edge i wiped the butt clean and placed the rifle on the ground when the dawn came the sentry changed and a search made i trusted the proper conclusions would be drawn i hadnt hit him as hard as id thought be was beginning to stir and moan feebly by the time i got back to him this was all to the good the alternative would have been to carry him and i was in no fit state to carry anyone i stuffed a handkerchief into his mouth and the moaning stopped bad practice i knew for a gagged man with a head cold or nasal obstruction can die of suffocation in four minutes but i hadnt the facilities to carry out a sinus examination and more importantly it was his health or mine he was up on his feet in two minutes he didnt try to run away or offer resistance for bythis time he had his ankles on a short hobble his hands tied securely behind his back and the barrel of an automatic pressing into the side of his neck i told him to walk and he walked two hundred yards away at the head of the path leading down to the landing stage i led him off to one side tied his wrists and ankles together and left him there he seemed to be breathing without too much difficulty there were no other sentries at least not on the main gate i crossed the hollow square of a courtyard and came to the main door it was closed but not locked i passed inside and said a few hard things to myself about myself for not having searched that sentry for the torch he would almost certainly have been carrying the window curtains must have been drawn and the darkness inside that hall was total i didnt much fancy moving around a scottish baronial hall in total darkness the risk of bringing down a suit of armour with a resounding metallic crash or impaling oneself on targes claymores or a royal set of antlers must be high i took out my pencil flash but the glowworm inside was breathing its last even when hardpressed against the face of my wristwatch it was impossible to tell the time it was impossible to see the wristwatch from the air yesterday id seen that the castle had been built in perfect symmetry round three sides of a hollow square it was a reasonable assumption then that if the main door was in the middle of the central or seawardfacing section then the main staircase would be directly opposite it seemed likely that the middle of the hall would offer a passage unimpeded by either claymores or antlers it did the stairs were where they should have been ten wide shallow steps and then the stairs branched both right and left i chose the righthand side because above me on that side i could see a faint loom of light six steps on the second flight of stairs another right turn eight more steps and then i was on the landing twentyfour steps and never a creak i blessed the architect who had specified marble the light was much stronger now i advanced towards its source a door no more than an inch ajar and applied a wary eye to the crack all i could see was the corner of a wardrobe a strip of carpet the corner of the foot of a bed and on the last a muddy boot a towregister cacophony of sound emerged reminiscent of a boiler factory in the middle distance i pushed the door and walked inside id come to see lord kirkside and whoever this was it wasnt lord kirkside for whatever lord kirkside was in the habit of doing i was fairly certain that he didnt go to bed in boots braces and cloth cap with a bayoneted rifle lying on die blankets beside him which was what this character had done i couldnt see his face because the cloth cap reached as far as his nose on the bedside table beside him lay a torch and a halfempty whisky bottle no glass but from what little i could see of him i would have judged that he was anyhow one of those characters whose direct and simple enjoyment of life has not been impaired by the effete contentions of modern civilisation the faithful watchman prudently preparing himself for the rigours of the west highland night before taking his turn at sentrygo but he wouldnt be making it at the appointed hour for there was no one now to call him from the look of it hed be lucky to make it for lunch it was just possible that he might wake himself up those stentorian snores wouldnt have gone unremarked in a mortuary he had about him the look of a man who on regaining consciousness would find himself in need of thirstquenching nourishment so i unscrewed the bottle top dropped in half a dozen of the tablets supplied by my pharmaceutical friend in torbay replaced the top took the torch and left behind the next door to the left lay a bathroom a filthy basin with above it a waterstained mirror two shaving brushes covered with lather a jar of shaving cream with the top off two unwashed razors and on the floor two towels that might just possibly have been white at some distant aeon in the past the interior of the bath was immaculate here was where the watchman performed his rudimentary ablutions the next room was a bedroom as dirty and disorderly as the watchmans it was a fair guess that this was the home of the man id left lying out among the gorse and stones on the hillside i moved across to the lefthand side of the central block lord kirkside would have his room somewhere in that block he did but he wasnt at home the first room beyond the sleeping warriors was his all right a glance at the contents of the nearest wardrobe confirmed this but his bed hadnt been slept in predictably in this symmetrically designed house the next room was a bathroom the watchman wouldnt nave felt at all at home in here this antiseptic cleanliness was the hallmark of an effete aristocracy a medicine cabinet was fixed to the wall i took out a tin of elastoplast and covered the face of the torch till i was left with a hole no more than the size of a sixpence i put the tin in my pocket the next door was locked but locks in the days when the dubh sgeir castle had been built were pretty rudimentary affairs i took from my pocket the best skeleton key in the world an oblong of stiff celluloid i shoved it between door and jamb at bolt level pulled the door handle back in the direction of the hinges eased in the celluloid released the handle repeated the process and stood stockstill that click might have wakened my watchman friend it should certainly have wakened the person inside but i heard no sound of movement i opened the door a fraction of an inch and went through the stockstill standing process once more there was a light on inside the room i changed the torch for the gun went on my knees crouched low and abruptly opened the door wide i stood up closed and locked the door and crossed over to the bed susan kirkside wasnt snoring but she was just as deep in sleep as the man id just left she had a blue silk band round her hair and all of her face was visible a sight that must have been rare indeed during her waking hours twentyone her father had said she was but lying there asleep smudged eyes and all she looked no older than seventeen a magazine had slipped from her hands to the floor on the bedside table was a halfempty glass of water and beside that a bottle containing a commercial brand of nanbutal tablets oblivion appeared to be a pretty hard thing to come by in dubh sgeir and id no doubt susan kirkside found it more difficult than most i picked up a towel from a basin in the corner of the room removed the worst of the moisture and dirt from head and face combed my hair into some semblance of order and gave my kindly reassuring smile a tryout in the mirror i looked like someone from the pages of the police gazette it took almost two minutes to shake her awake or at least to pull her up from the dark depths of oblivion to a state of semiawareness full consciousness took another minute and it was probably this that saved me from a screaming match she had time to adjust herself to the slow realisation of the presence of a stranger in the middle of the night mind you i had my kindly smile going full blast till my face ached but i dont think it helped much who are you who are you her voice was shaking the blue eyes still misted with sieep wide open and scared dont you touch me dont you ill scream for help ill i took her hands just to show her that there was touching and touching i wont touch you sue kirkside and a fat lot of good screaming for help would do around these parts dont scream theres a good girl in fact dont even talk above a whisper i dont think it would be very wise or safe do you she stared at me for a few seconds her lips moving as if she were about to speak but the fear slowly leaving her eyes suddenly she sat bolt upright youre mr johnson the man from the helicopter you should be more careful i said reproachfully theyd have you arrested for that in the foliesbergere her free hand hauled the blankets up to her chin and i went on my name is calvert i work for the government im a friend i think you need a friend dont you susan you and your old man lord kirkside that is what do you want she whispered what are you doing here im here to end your troubles i said im here to cadge an invitation to your wedding to the honourable john rollinson make it about the end of next month will you im due some leave then go away from here her voice was low and desperate go away from here or youll ruin everything please please please go away im begging you im begging you go away if youre a friend go away please oh please go away it seemed that she wanted me to leave i said it appears that they have you pretty well brainwashed if you believe their promise youll believe anything in the world they wont let you go they darent let you go theyll destroy every shred and trace of evidence that might ever point a finger at them that includes anyone who has ever had anything to do with them they wont they wont i was with mr lavorski when be promised daddy that no one would come to any harm he said they were businessmen and killing was no part of business he meant it lavorski is it it had to be i looked at the earnest scared face he may have meant it when he said it he wouldnt have mentioned that theyve murdered four people in the last three days or that they have tried to murder me four times inthe last three days youre lying youre making this up things like that things like that dont happen any more for pitys sake leave us alone there speaks the true daughter of the old scottish clan chieftain i said roughly youre no good to me wheres your father i dont know mr lavorski and captain imrie hes another of them came for him at eleven tonight daddy didnt say where he was going he tells me nothing she paused and snatched her hands away faint red patches stained her cheeks what do you mean im no good to you did he say when he would be back what do you mean im no good to you because youre young and not very clever and you dont know too much about this world and youll believe anything a hardened criminal will tell you but most especially because you wont believe me you wont believe the one person who can save you all youre a stupid and pigheaded young fool miss kirkside if it wasnt that he was jumping from the fryingpan into the fire id say the honourable rollinson has had a lucky escape what do you mean it is hard for a mobile young face to be expressionless but hers was then he cant marry you when he is dead i said brutally and he is going to dk hes going to die because sue kirkside let him die because she was too blind to know truth when she saw it i had what was for me an inspiration i turned down my collar and pulled my scarf away life it i asked she didnt like it at all the red faded from her cheeks i could see myself in her dressingtable mirror and i didnt like it either quinns handiwork was in full bloom the kaleidoscope of colour now made a complete ring round my neck quinn she whispered you know his name you know him i know them all most of them anyway cook said that one night after hed too much to drink hed been boasting in the kitchen about how hed once been the strong man in a stage act hed an argument one night with his partner about a woman he killed his partner that way she had to make a physical effort to turn her eyes away from my neck i thought i thought it was just talk and do you still think our pals are unpaid missionaries for the society for the propagation of christian knowledge i sneered do you know jacques and kramer she nodded i killed them both tonight after they had killed a friend of mine they broke his neck then they tried to kill my boss and myself and i killed another he came out of the dark to murder us i think his name was henry do you believe me now or do you still think were all dancing round the old maypole on the village green singing ringaringoroses as we go the shock treatment worked almost too well her face wasnt pale now it was ashen she said i think pm going to be sick later i said coldly what little selfregard i had was down among my shoelaces what i would have liked to do was to take her in my arms and say there there now dont you worry your pretty head just you leave everything to your old uncle philip and all will be well at the end of the day in fact it was damned hard not to do it instead what i said still in the same nasty voice was weve no time for those little folderols you want to get married dont you did your father say when he would be back she looked at the washbasin in the corner of the room as if she were still making up her mind whether to be sick or not then pulled her eyes back to me and whispered youre just as bad as they are youre a terrible man youre a killer i caught her shoulders and shook them i said savagely did he say when he would be back no her eyes were sick with revulsion it was a long time since any woman had looked at me like that i dropped my hands do you know what those men are doing here no i believed her her old man would know but he wouldnt have told her lord kirkside was too astute to believe that their uninvited guests would just up and leave them unharmed maybe he was just desperately gambling that if he told his daughter nothing and if he could swear she knew nothing then they would leave her be if that was what he thought he was in urgent need of an alienist but that was being unjust if i stood in his shoes or more accurately was swimming in the murky waters he was in id have grabbed at any straw its obvious that you know that your fiancé is still alive i went on and your elder brother and others theyre being held here arent they she nodded silently i wished she wouldnt look at me like that do you know how many a dozen more than that and i know there are children there three boys and a girl that would be right sergeant macdonalds two sons and the boy and the girl that had been aboard the converted lifeboat that had disappeared after setting off on the night cruise from torbay i didnt believe a word that lavorski had said to susan about their reverence for human life but i wasnt surprised that the people in the boats who had accidentally stumbled across his illegal operations were still alive there was a very good reason for this do you know where they are kept there should be any amount of handy dungeons in dubh sgeir castle there are cellars deep underground ive never been allowed to go near them in the past four months this is your big chance come at last get your clothes on and take me there go down to the cellars aghast was the word for her expression are you mad daddy tells me there are at least three men on guard duty all night long there were only two men now but her opinion of me was low enough already so i kept quiet theyre armed you must be mad im not going i didnt think you would youll let your boy friend die just because youre a contemptible little coward i could almost taste the selfloathing in my mouth lord kirkside and the honourable rollinson what a lucky father what a fortunate fiance she hit me and i knew i had won i said without touching my face dont do that youll waken up the guard get your clothes on i rose sat on the footboard of the bed and contemplated the door and higher things while she changed i was becoming tired of women telling me what a horrible character i was im ready she said she was back in her uniform of pirates jersey and the denims shed outgrown when she was about fifteen thirty seconds flat and nary a sound of a portable sewing machine baffling thats what it was nine thursday am dawn we went down the stairs hand in hand i may have been the last man in the world she would have elected to be alone with on a desert island but she clung on pretty tightly all the same at the foot of the steps we turned right i flicked on the torch every few yards but it wasnt really necessary susan knew every yard of the way at the end of the hall we turned left along the eastern wing eight yards and we stopped at a door on the righthand side the pantry she whispered the kitchen is beyond that i stooped and looked through the keyhole beyond was darkness we passed through the doorway then into an archway giving on to the kitchen i flashed the tiny beam around the room empty there were three guards susan had said the outside man for whom i had accounted the lad who patrolled the battlements no she didnt know what he did but it was a good guess that he wasnt studying astronomy or guarding against parachutists hed have night glasses to his eyes and hed be watching for fishing vessels naval craft or fishery cruisers that might happen by and interrupt honest men at their work he wouldnt see much on a night like this and the third man she said guarded the back kitchen premises the only entrance to the castle apart from the main gate and the unfortunates in their cellars down below he wasnt in the kitchen premises so he would be in the cellars down below a flight of steps led from the scullery beyond the kitchen down to a stoneflagged floor to the right of this floor i could see the loom of light susan raised a finger to her lips and we made our way soundlessly down to the foot of the steps i slid a cautious eye round the corner of this passageway it wasnt passageway it was the damnedest flight of steps id ever come across they were lit by two or three farspaced and very weak electric bulbs the walls coming together towards the foot like a pair of railway lines disappearing into the distance maybe fifty feet or seventy steps down where the first light was another passageway branched off to the right there was a stool at the corner of the small stone landing there and sitting on the stool a man across his knees lay a rifle they certainly went in for the heavy artillery i drew back i murmured to susan where in hells name do those steps lead to the boathouse of course a surprised whisper where else where else indeed brilliant work calvert brilliant work youd skirted the south side of the dubh sgeir in the helicopter youd seen the castle youd seen the boathouse youd seen nary a handhold on the sheer cliff separating them and youd never raised an eyebrow at the glaring obviousness of the fact that neer the twain did meet those are the cellars in that passage going off to the right she nodded why so far down its a long walk to collect the bubbly theyre not really winecellars they used to be used as water reservoirs no other way of getting down there no only this way and if we take five steps down this way he shoots us full of holes with his lee enfield know who it is harry i dont know his other name hes an armenian daddy says people cant pronounce his real name hes young and smooth and greasy and detestable he had the effrontery to make a pass at the chieftains daughter yes it was horrible she touched her lips with the back of her hand he stank of garlic i dont blame him id do it myself if i didnt feel my pension creeping up on me call him up and make amends what tell him youre sorry tell him you misjudged his noble character tell him your father is away and this is the first chance youve had of speaking to him tell him anything no sue hell never believe me she said wildly when he gets within two feet of you hell forget all about the reasoning why hes a man isnt he youre a man and youre only six inches away the eternal female illogic ive told you how it is if s my pension coming between us quickly she nodded reluctantly and i disappeared into the shadows of the nearest cellar reversed gun in hand she called and he came arunning his rifle at the ready when he saw who it was he forgot all about his rifle susan started to speak her lines but she might have saved her breath harry if nothing else was an impetuous young man that wild armenian blood i stepped forwards arm swinging and lowered him to the ground i tied him up and as id run out of handkerchiefs ripped away part of his shirtfront and used it as a gag susan giggled a giggle with a note of hysteria whats up tasked harry hes what they call a snappy dresser thats a silk shirt youre no respecter of persons mr calvert not persons like harry congratulations wasnt so bad was it it was still horrible again the hand to the mouth hes reeking of whisky youngsters have odd tastes i said kindly youll grow out of it at least it must have been an improvement on the garlic the boathouse wasnt really a boathouse at all it was a large vaulting cave formed in a cleft in a natural fault in the cliff strata at the inner end of the cave longitudinal tunnels stretched away on either side paralleling the coastline until they vanished beyond the reach of my torch from the air the boathouse in the small artificial harbour a structure of about twenty feet by twenty had seemed incapable of housing more than two or three fairsized rowing boats inside it was big enough to berth a boat the size of the firecrest and then leave room to spare mooring bollards four in number lined the eastern side of the boathouse there were signs of recent work where the inner end of the cave had been lengthened in the direction of the longitudinal tunnels to increase the berthing space and provide a bigger working platform but otherwise it was as it must have been for hundreds of years i picked up a boathook and tried to test the depth but couldnt find bottom any vessel small enough to be accommodated inside could enter and leave at any state of the tide the two big doors looked solid but not too solid there was a small dryland doorway on the eastern side the berth was empty as i had expected to find it our friends were apprehensive and on piecework rates it wasnt difficult to guess what they were working at the working platform was liberally stacked with the tools of their trade an oil enginedriven air compressor with a steel reservoir with outlet valves a manuallyoperated twocylinder doubleacting air pump with two outlets two helmets with attached corselets flexible noncollapsible air tubes with metal couplings weighted boots diving dresses lifecumtelephone lines lead weights and scuba equipment such as i had myself with a stack of compressed air cylinders at the ready i felt neither surprise nor elation id known this must exist for the past fortyeight hours although id become certain of the location only that night i was faintly surprised perhaps to see all this equipment here for this would surely be only the spares but i shouldnt have been even vaguely surprised whatever this bunch lacked it wasnt a genius for organisation i didnt see that night nor did i ever see the cellars where the prisoners were housed after id huffed and puffed threequarters of the way up that interminable flight of steps i turned left along the passageway where wed first seen harry taking his ease after a few yards the passageway broadened out into a low damp chamber containing a table made of beercases some seats of die same and in one comer some furniture that hadnt yet been drunk a bottle of whisky nearly full stood on the table harrys remedy for garlic halitosis beyond this chamber was a massive wooden door secured by an equally massivelooking lock with me key missing all the celluloid in the world wouldnt open this lot but a beehive plastic explosive would do a very efficient job indeed i made another of the many mental notes id made that night and went up the stairs to rejoin susan harry had come to he was saying something in has throat which fortunately couldnt get past his silkshirted gag to the delicate ears of the chieftains young daughter his eyes to mint a phrase spoke volumes and he was trying as best he could to do a houdini with the ropes round his legs and arms susan kirkside was pointing a rifle in his general direction and looking very apprehensive she neednt have bothered harry was trussed like a turkey these people down in the cellars i said theyve been there for weeks some for months theyll be blind as bats and weak as kittens by the time they get out she shook her head i think theyll be all right theyre taken out on the landing strip there for an hour and a half every morning under guard they cant be seen from the sea were not allowed to watch or not supposed to ive seen them often daddy insisted on it and sir anthony well good old daddy i stared at her old man skouras he comes here of course she seemed surprised at my surprise hes one of them lavorski and this man dollmann the men that do all the arranging they work for sir anthony didnt you know daddy and sir anthony are friends were friends before this ive been in sir anthonys london home often but theyre not friends now i probed keenly sir anthony has gone off his head since his wife died susan said confidently i looked at her in wonder and tried to remember when id last been so authoritatively dogmatic on subjects i knew nothing about i couldnt remember he married again you know some french actress or other that wouldnt have helped shes no good she caught him on the rebound susan i said reverently youre really wonderful i dont believe youll ever understand what i mean by my pension coming between us you know her well ive never met her you didnt have to tell me and poor old sir anthony he doesnt know what hes doing is that it hes all mixed up she said defensively hes sweet really he is or was all mixed up with the deaths of four men not to mention three of his own i said sergeant macdonald thought him a good man susan thought him sweet i wondered what she would say if she saw charlotte skouras back how do the prisoners do for food we have two cooks they do it all the food is brought down to than what other staff no other staff daddy was made to sack them all four months ago that accounted for the state of the watchmans bathroom i said my arrival in the helicopter here yesterday afternoon was duly reported by radio to the shangrila a man with a badly scarred face wheres the radio transmitter you know everything dont you knowall calvert where is it off the hall in the room behind the stairs its locked i have keys thatll open the bank of england wait a minute i went down to the guards room outside the prisoners cellar brought the whisky bottle back up to where susan was standing and handed it to her hang on to this she looked at me steadily do you really need this oh my god sweet youth i said nastily sure i need it im an alcoholic i untied the rope round harrys ankles and helped him to his feet he repaid this samaritan gesture by swinging at me with his right foot but fifteen minutes on the floor hadnt helped his circulation or reactions any and i forestalled him with the same manoeuvre when i helped him up the second time there was no fight left in him did you did you really have to do that the revulsion was back in her eyes did i did you see what he tried to do to me j demanded you men are all the same she said oh shut up i snarled i was old and sick and tired and id run right out of the last of my witty ripostes the transceiver was a beauty a big gleaming metallic rca the latest model as used in the naval vessels of a dozen nationalities i didnt waste any time wondering where they had obtained it that lot were fit for anything i sat down and started tuning the set then looked up at susan go and fetch me one of your fathers razor blades you dont want me to hear is that it think what you like just get it if shed been wearing a skirt shed have flounced out of the room with what she was wearing flouncing was out of the question the set covered every transmission frequency from the bottom of the long wave to the top of the vhf it took only two minutes to raise spfx it was manned night and day the year round it really was most considerate of the ungodly to provide me with such a magnificent instrument sue kirkside was back before i started speaking i was ten minutes on the microphone altogether apart from codenames and map references i used plain english throughout i had to id no book and time was too short anyway i spoke slowly and clearly giving precise instructions about the movements of men the alignment of radio frequencies the minutest details of the layout of dubh sgeir castle and asking allimportant questions about recent happenings on the riviera i didnt repeat myself once and i asked for nothing to be repeated to me because every word was being recorded before i was halfway through susans eyebrows had disappeared up under the blonde fringe and harry was looking as if he had been sandbagged i signed off reset the tuning band to its original position and stood up thats it i said im off youre what the greyblue eyes were wide the eyebrows still up under the fringe but with alarm this time not astonishment youre leaving youre leaving me here im leaving if you think id stay a minute longer in this damned castle than i have to you must be nuts ive played my hand far enough already do you think i want to be around here when the guards change over or when the toilers on the deep get back here toilers on the deep what do you mean skip it id forgotten she knew nothing about what our friends were doing its calvert for home youve got a gun she said wildly you could you could capture them couldnt you capture who the hell with the grammar the guards theyre on the second floor theyll be asleep how many eight or nine im not sure eight or nine shes not sure who do you think i am superman stand aside do you want me to get killed and susan tell nothing to anybody not even daddy not if you want to see johnnyboy walk down that aisle you understand she put a hand on my arm and said quietly but with the fear still in her face you could take me with you i could i could take you with me and ruin everything if i as much as fired a single shot at any of the sleeping warriors up top id ruin everything everything depends on their never knowing that anybody was here tonight if they suspected that just had a hint of a suspicion of that theyd pack their bags and take off into the night tonight and i cant possibly do anything until tomorrow night you understand of course that they wouldnt leave until after they had killed everyone in the cellar and your father of course and theyd stop off at torbay and make sure that sergeant macdonald would never give evidence against them do you want that susan god knows id love to take you out of here im not made of portland cement but if i take you the alarm bells will ring and then theyll pull the plug cant you see that if they come back and find you gone theyll have one thought and one thought only in their minds our little sue has left the island with of course one thought in mind you must not be missing all right she was calm now but youve overlooking something im a great old overlooker what harry hell be missing hell have to be you cant leave him to talk hell be missing so will the keeper of the gate i clobbered him on the way in she started to get all wideeyed again but i held up my hand stripped off coat and windbreaker unwrapped the razor shed brought me and nicked my forearm not too deeply the way i felt i needed all the blood i had but enough to let me smear the bottom three inches of the bayonet on both sides i handed her the tin of elastoplast and without a word she stuck a strip across the incision i dressed again and we left susan with the whisky bottle and torch myself with the rifle shepherding harry in front of me once in the hall i relocked the door with the skeleton key id used to open it the rain had stopped and there was hardly any wind but the mist was thicker than ever and the night had turned bitterly cold the highland indian summer was in full swing we made our way through the courtyard across to where id left the bayonet lying on the cliff edge using the torch now with the elastoplast removed from its face quite freely but keeping our voices low the lad maintaining his ceaseless vigil on the battlements couldnt have seen us five yards away with the finest nightglasses in the world but sound in heavy mist has unpredictable qualities it can be muffled it can be distorted or it can occasionally be heard with surprising clarity and it was now too late in the day to take chances i located the bayonet and told harry to lie face down in the grass if id left him standing he just might have been tempted to kick me over the edge i gouged the grass in assorted places with heel and toe made a few more scores with the butt of a bayonet stuck the blade of the gatekeepers bayonet in the ground at a slight angle so that the rifle was just clear of the ground kid harry down so that the bloodstained bayonet tip was also just dear of the ground so preventing the blood from running off among the wet grass scattered most of the contents of the whisky bottle around and carefully placed the bottle about a quarter full now close to one of the bayonets i said to susan and what happened here do you think its obvious they had a drunken fight and both of them slipped on the wet grass over the edge of the cliff and what did you hear oh i heard the sound of two men shouting in the hall i went on to the landing and i heard them shouting at the tops of their voices i heard the one tell harry to get back to his post and harry saying no by god he was going to settle it now ill say both men were drunk and i wont repeat the kind of language they were using the last i heard they were crossing the courtyard together still arguing good girl thats exactly what you heard she came with us as far as the place where id left the gatekeeper he was still breathing i used most of what rope id left to tie them together at the waist a few feet apart and wrapped the end of it in my hand with their arms lashed behind their backs they werent going to have much balancing power and no holding power at all on the way down that steep and crumbling path to the landing stage if either slipped or stumbled i might be able to pull them back to safety with a sharp tug there was going to be none of this alpine stuff with the rope around my waist also if they were going to step out into the darkness they were going to do it without me i said thank you susan you have been a great help dont take any more of those nembutal tablets tonight theyd think it damn funny if you were still asleep at midday tomorrow i wish it were midday the next day i wont let you down mr calvert everything is going to be all right isnt it of course there was a pause then she said you could have pushed these two over the edge if you wanted to couldnt you but you didnt you could have cut harrys arm but you cut your own im sorry for what i said mr calvert about you being horrible and terrible you do what you have to do another pause i think youre rather wonderful they all come round in the end i said but i was talking to myself shed vanished into the mist i wished drearily that i could have agreed with her sentiments i didnt feel wonderful at all i just felt dead tired and worried stiff for with all the best planning in the world there were too many imponderables and i wouldnt have bet a brass farthing on the next twentyfour hours i got some of the worry and frustration out of my system by kicking the two prisoners to their feet we went slowly down that crumbling treacherous path in single file myself last torch in my left hand rope tightly but not too tightly in my right hand i wondered vaguely as we went why i hadnt nicked harry instead of myself it would have been so much more fitting harrys blood on harrys bayonet you had a pleasant outing i trust hutchinson asked courteously it wasnt dull you would have enjoyed it i watched hutchinson as he pushed the firecrest into the fog and the darkness let me into a professional secret how in the world did you find your way back into this pier tonight the mist is twice as bad as when i left you cruise up and down for hours impossible to take any bearings theres the waves tide fog currents and yet there you are right on the nose to the minute it cant be done it was an extraordinary feat of navigation hutchinson said solemnly there are such things as charts calvert and if you look at that largescale one for this area youll see an eight fathom bank maybe a cable in length lying a cable and a half out to the west of the old pier there i just steamed out straight into wind and tide waited till the depthsounder showed i was over the bank and dropped the old hook at the appointed hour the great navigator lifts his hook and lets wind and tide drift him ashore again not many men could have done it im bitterly disappointed i said ill never think the same of you again i suppose you used the same technique on the way in more or less only i used a series of five banks and patches my secrets are gone for ever where now didnt uncle arthur say you misjudge uncle arthur he says he never interferes with you in what was it the execution of a field operation i plan he said i coordinate calvert finishes the job he has his decent moments i admitted he told me a few stories about you in the past hour i guess its a privilege to be along apart from the four hundred thousand quid or whatever apart as you say from the green men where to calvert home if you can find it in this lot craigmore i can find it he puffed at his cigar and held the end close to his eyes i think i should put this out its getting so i cant even see the length of the wheelhouse windows far less beyond them uncle arthurs taking his time isnt he uncle arthur is interrogating the prisoners i wouldnt say hed get much out of that lot neither would i theyre not too happy well it teas a nasty jump from the pier to the foredeck especially with the bows plunging up and down as they were and more especially with their arms tied behind their backs one broken ankle and one broken forearm i said it could have been worse they could have missed the foredeck altogether you have a point hutchinson agreed he stuck his head out the side window and withdrew it again if s not the cigar he announced no need to quit smoking visibility is zero and i mean zero were flying blind on instruments you may as well switch on the wheelhouse lights makes it all that easier to read the charts depthsounder and compass and doesnt affect the radar worth a damn he stared at me as the light came on what the hell arc you doing in that flaming awful outfit this is a dressinggown i explained ive three suits and all three are soaked and ruined any luck sir uncle arthur had just come in to the wheelhouse one of them passed out uncle arthur wasnt looking very pleased with himself the other kept moaning so loudly that i couldnt make myself heard well calvert the story the story air i was just going to bed ive told you the story half a dozen quick sentences that i couldnt hear above their damned caterwauling he said coldly the whole story calvert im feeling weak sir ive rarely known a time when you werent feeling weak calvert you know where the whisky is hutchinson coughed respectfully i wonder if the admiral would permit certainty certainly uncle arthur said in a quite different tone of course my boy the boy was a clear foot taller than uncle arthur and while youre at it calvert you might bring one for me too a normalsized one he had his nasty side to him had uncle arthur i said good nightfive minutes later uncle arthur wasnt too pleased id the feeling he thought id missed out on the suspense and fancy descriptions but i was as tired as the old man with the scythe after hiroshima i looked in on charlotte skouras she was sleeping like the dead i wondered about that chemist back in torbay hed been three parts asleep myopic as a barn owl and crowding eighty he could have made a mistake he could have had only a minimal experience in the prescribing of steepinducing drugs for those who lived in the land of the hebridean prayer would that the peats might cut themselves and the fish jump on the shore that i upon my bed might lie and sleep for ever more but id done the old boy an injustice after what was to me our miraculous arrival in craigmores apology for a harbour it had taken me no more than a minute to shake charlotte into something resembling wakefulness i told her to get dressed a cunning move this to make her think i didnt know she was still dressed and come ashore fifteen minutes after that we were alt inside hutchinsons house and fifteen minutes still later when uncle arthur and i had roughly splinted the prisoners fractures and locked them in a room illuminated only by a skylight that would have taken houdini all his time to wriggle through i was in bed in another tiny boxroom that was obviously the sleepingquarters of the chairman of the craigmores an gallery selection committee for hed kept all the best exhibits to himself i was just dropping off to sleep thinking that if the universities ever got around to awarding phds to house agents the first degree would surely go to the first man who sold a hebridean hut within sniffing distance of a flensing shed when the door opened and the lights came on i blinked open exhausted eyes and saw charlotte skouras softly closing the door behind her go away i said im sleeping may i come in she asked she gazed around the art gallery and her lips moved in what could have been the beginnings of a smile i would have thought you would have gone to sleep with the lights on tonight you should see the ones behind the wardrobe doors i boasted i slowly opened my eyes as far as i could without mechanical aid sorry im tired what can i do im not at my best receiving lady callers in the middle of the night uncle arthurs next door you can always scream for help if you want to she looked at a motheaten armchair may i sit down she sat down she still wore that uncrushable white dress and her hair was neatly combed but that was about all you could say for her attempts at humour there might have been in her voice but there was none in her face and none in her eyes those brown wise knowing eyes eyes that knew all about living and loving and laughter the eyes that had once made her the most soughtafter actress of her time now held only sadness and despair and fear now that she had escaped from her husband and his accomplices there should have been no need for fear but it was there halfburied in the tired brown eyes but there fear was an expression i knew the lines round the eyes and mouth that looked so right so inevitable when she smiled or laughed in the days when she had smiled and laughed looked as if they had been etched by time and suffering and sorrow and despair into a face that had never known laughter and lovecharlotte skourass face without the charlotte meiner of old behind it no longer looked as if it belonged to her a worn a weary and an alien face she must have been about thirtyfive i guessed but she looked a deal older and yet when she sat in that chair almost huddled in that chair the craigmore art gallery no longer existed she said flatly you dont trust me philip what on earth makes you say that why shouldnt i you tell me you are evasive you will not answer questions no that is wrong you will and you do answer questions but i know enough of men to know that the answers you give me are the ones you want to give me and not the ones i should hear why should this be philip what have i done that you should not trust me so the truth is not in me well i suppose i do stretch it a bit at times i may even occasionally tell a lie strictly in the line of business of course i wouldnt lie to a person like you i meant it and intended not to unless i had to do it for her sake which was different why should you not lie to a person like me i dont know how to say it i could say i dont usually lie to lovely and attractive women for whom i have a high regard and then youd cynically say i was stretching the truth till it snapped and youd be wrong because it is the truth if truth lies in the eye of the beholder i dont know if that sounds like an insult its never meant to be i could say its because i hate to see you sitting there all washed up and with no place to go and no one to turn to at the one time hi your life you need some place to go and someone to turn to but i suppose again that might sound like an insult i could say i dont lie to my friends but that again would be an insult the charlotte skourases of this world dont make friends with government hirelings who kill for their wages its no good i dont know what to say charlotte except that it doesnt matter whether you believe me or not as long as you believe that no harm will come to you from me and as long as fm near you no harm will come to you from anyone else either maybe you dont believe that either maybe your feminine intuition has stopped working it is working what you say overtime very hard indeed the brown eyes were still and the face without expression i do think i could place my life in your hands you might not get it back again if s not worth all that much i might not want ft back she looked at me for a long moment when there was no fear in her eyes then stated down at her folded hands she gazed at them so long that i finally looked in the same direction myself but there was nothing wrong with her hands that i could see finally she looked up with an almost timid halfsmile that didnt belong to her at all you are wondering why i came she asked no youve told me you want me to tell you a story especially the beginning and end of the story she nodded when i began as a stage actress i played very small parts but i knew what the play was all about in this reallife play im still playing a very small part only i no longer know what the play is all about i come on for three minutes in act but i have no idea what has gone before im back for another minute in act but ive no idea in the world whats happened between acts and and i cannot begin to imagine how it will all end she halflifted her arms turning the palms upwards you cannot imagine how frustrating this can be for a woman you really know nothing of what has gone before this i ask you to believe me i believed her i believed her because i knew it to be true go to the front room and bring me as they say in these parts a refreshment i said i grow weaker by the hour so she rose obediently and went to the front room and brought me the refreshment which gave me just enough strength to tell her what she wanted to know they were a triumvirate i said which if not strictly accurate was close enough to the truth for my explanation sir anthony lavorski who i gather was not only his public and private accountant but his overall financial director as well and john dollmann the managing director of the shipping companies they were split up for tax reasons associated with your husbands oil companies i thought that maccallum the scots lawyer and jules biscarte the lad with the beard who owns one of the biggest merchant banks in paris was in with them too but they werent at least not biscarte i think he was invited aboard ostensibly to discuss business but actually to provide our triumvirate with information that would have given them the basis for next coup but he didnt like the way the wind was blowing and shied off i know nothing about maccallum i know nothing about biscarte charlotte said neither he nor mr maccallum stayed aboard the shangrila they were at the columba hotel for a few days and were invited out twice for dinner they havent been aboard since the night you were there among other things they didnt care for your husbands treatment of you i didnt care for it myself i know what mr maccallmn was doing aboard my husband was planning to build a refinery in the clyde estuary this coming winter and maccallum was negotiating the lease for him my husband said that by the end of the year he expected to have a large account of uncommitted capital for investment ill bet he did thats as neat a phrase for the proceeds of grand larceny as ever ive come across lavorski i think well find was the instigator and guiding brain behind all this lavorski it would have been who discovered that the skouras empire was badly in need of some new lifeblood in the way of hard cash and saw the way of putting matters right by using means they already had close to hand but but my husband was never short of money charlotte objected he had the best of everything yachts cars houses he was never short in that sense neither were half the millionaires who jumped off the new york skyscrapers at the time of the stock market crash do be quiet theres a good girl you know nothing about high finance coming from a character who eked out a bare living from an inadequate salary i reflected that was very good indeed lavorski struck upon the happy idea of piracy on a grand scale vessels carrying not less than a million pounds worth of specie at a time she stared at me her lips parted i wished i had teeth like that instead of having had half of them knocked out by uncle arthurs enemies over the years uncle arthur i mused bitterly was twentyfive years older than i was and was frequently heard to boast that hed still to lose his first tooth she whispered youre making all this up lavorski made it all up fm just telling you i wouldnt have die brains to think of something like that having thought up this splendid scheme for making money they found themselves with three problems to solve how to discover when and where large quantities of specie were being shipped how to seize those ships and how to hide them while they opened the strongroom a process which in ships fitted with the most modern strongrooms can take anything up to a day and removed said specie problem number one was easy i have no doubt that they may have suborned highranking banking officials the fact that they tried it on with biscarte is proof of that but i dont think it will ever be possible to bring those men to justice but it will be possible to arrest and very successfully indict their ace informant their trump card our good friend the belted broker lord charnley to make a real goodgoing success of piracy you require the cooperation of lloyds well thats an actionable statement the cooperation of someone in lloyds someone like lord charnley he is by profession marine underwriter at lloyds stop staring at me like that youre putting me off a large proportion of valuable marine cargoes are insured at lloyds charnley would know of at least a number of those he would know the amount the firm or bank of dispatch and possibly the date of dispatch and vessel but lord charnley is a wealthy man she said lord charnley gives the appearance of being a wealthy man i corrected granted he had to prove that he was a man of substance to gain admission to the old club but he may have backed the wrong insurance horses or played the stock market he either needed money or wanted money he may have plenty but money is like alcohol some people can take it and some cant and with those who cant the more money they have the more they require dollmann solved problem two the hijacking of the specie i shouldnt imagine this strained his resources too far your husband ships his oil into some very odd and very tough places indeed and it goes without saying that he employs some very odd and very tough people to do it dollmann wouldnt have recruited the hijacking crew himself he probably singled out our good friend captain imrie who will prove to have a very interesting history and gave him the authority to go through the skouras fleets and handpick suitable men for the job once the hijacking crew was assembled and ready messrs skouras lavorski and dollmann waited till the victim was on the high seas dumped you and the stewardess in a hotel embarked the lads on the shangrila intercepted die speciecarrying vessel and by one of a series of ruses ill tell you about later succeeded in boarding it and taking over then the shangrila landed the captured crew under guard while the prize crew sailed the hijacked vessel to the appointed hidingplace it cant be true it cant be true she murmured it was a long time since id seen any woman wringing her hands but charlotte skouras was doing it then her face was quite drained of colour she knew that what i was saying was true and shed never heard of any of it before hiding place philip what hiding place where would you hide a ship charlotte how should i know she shrugged tiredly my mind is not very clear tonight up in the arctic perhaps or in a lonely norwegian fjord or some desert island i cant think any more philip there cannot be many places a ship is a big thing there are millions of places you can hide a ship practically anywhere in the world all you have to do is to open the bilgevalves and engineroom nonreturn valves to the bilges and detonate a couple of scuttling charges you mean you mean that i mean just that you send it to the bottom the west side of the sound to the east of dubh sgeir island a cheery stretch of water rejoicing in the name of beul nan uamh the mouth of the grave must be the most densely packed marine graveyard in europe today at dead slack water the valves were opened at a very carefully selected spot in the beul nan uamh and down they went all five of them gurgle gurgle gurgle tide tables show that coincidentally most of them were sunk at or near midnight cease upon the midnight as the poet says only in this case with a very great deal of pain at least for the underwriters involved beul nan uamh odd i never thought of it before a very apt name indeed the mouth of the grave damn place is printed far too large in the chart it doesnt have to be very obvious to be too obvious for calvert she hadnt been listening to my meanderings she said dubh sgeir but but thats the home of lord kirkside its not but its because the hiding place was picked either by your husband or if someone else then the arrangement was made through your husband i never knew until recently that your husband was an old drinking pal of lord kirkside i saw him yesterday but he wouldnt talk nor would his charming daughter you do move around ive never met the daughter you should she thinks youre an old golddigging hag a nice kid really but terrified terrified for her life aod those of others why on earth should she be how do you think our triumvirate got lord kirkside to agree to their goingson money bribery i shook my head lord kirkside is a highlander and a gentleman its a pretty fierce combination old skouras could never lay hands on enough money to bribe lord kirkside to pass the uncollected fares box on a bus if he hadnt paid a poor illustration lord kirkside wouldnt recognise a bus even if it ran over him but what i mean is the old boy is incorruptive so your charming friends kidnapped old kirksides elder son the younger lives in australia and just to make sure that susan kirkside wouldnt be tempted to do anything silly they kidnapped her fiancé a guess but a damned good one theyre supposed to be dead no no she whispered her hand was to her mouth and her voice was shaking my god no my god yes its logical and tremendously effective they also kidnapped sergeant macdonalds sons and donald maceacherns wife for the same reason to buy silence and cooperation but but people just cant disappear like that were not dealing with street comer boys were dealing with criminal masterminds disappearances are rigged to look like accidental death a few other people have disappeared also people who had the misfortune to be hanging around in small private boats while our friends were waiting for the tide to be exactly right before opening the seacocks on the hijacked ships didnt it arouse police suspicion having so many small boats disappear in the same place they sailed or towed two of those boats fifty or more miles away and ran them on the rocks another could have disappeared anywhere the fourth did set sail from torbay and disappeared but the disappearance of one boat is not enough to arouse suspicion it must be true i know it must be true she shook her head as if she didnt believe it was true at all it all fits so well it explains so many things and explains them perfectly but but whats the good of knowing all this now theyre on to you they know you know that something is far wrong and that that something is in loch houron theyll leave how do they know we suspect loch houron uncle arthur told me in the wheelhouse last night surprise in her voice dont you remember i hadnt remembered i did now i was halfdead from lack of sleep a stupid remark perhaps even a giveaway remark i was glad uncle arthur hadnt heard that one calvert nears the sunset of his days i said my minds going sure theyll leave but not for fortyeight hours yet they will think they have plenty of time its less than eight hours since we instructed sergeant macdonald to tell them hat we were going to the mainland for help i see she said dully and what did you do on dubh sgeir tonight philip not much but enough another little white lie enough to confirm my every last suspicion i swam ashore to the link harbour and picked the side door of the boathouse its quite a boathouse not only is it three times as big on the inside as it is from the outside but its stacked with diving equipment diving equipment heaven help us all youre almost as stupid as i am how on earth do you think they recover the stuff from the sunken vessels they use a divingboat and the dubh sgeir boathouse is its home was was that all you found out there was nothing more to find out i had intended taking a look round the castle theres a long flight of steps leading up to it from the boatyard inside the cuff itself but there was some character sitting about three parts of the way up with a rifle in his hand a guard of some sort he was drinking out of some son of bottle but he was doing his job for all that i wouldnt have got within a hundred steps of him without being riddled i left dear god she murmured what a mess what a terrible mess and youve no radio were cut off from help what are we going to do what are you going to do philip im going there in the firecrest this coming night thats what im going to do i have a machinegun under the settee of the saloon in the firecrest and uncle arthur and tim hutchinson will have a gun apiece well reconnoiter their time is running short and theyll want to be gone tomorrow at the latest the boathouse doors are illfitting and if theres no light showing that will mean they still havent finished their diving so we wait till they have finished and come in well see the light two miles away when they open the door to let the divingboat in to load up all the stuff theyve cached fromthe four other sunken ships the front doors of the boathouse will be closed of course while they load up so we go in through the front doors on the deck of the firecrest the doors dont look all that strong to me surprise is everything well catch them napping a submachinegun in a small enclosed space is a deadly weapon youll be killed youll be killed she crossed to and sat on the bedside her eyes wide and scared please philip please please dont youll be killed i tell you i beg of you dont do it she seemed very sure that i would be killed i have to charlotte time has run out theres no other way please the brown eyes were full of unshed tears this i couldnt believe please philip for my sake no a teardrop fell at the corner of my mouth it tasted as salt as the sea anything else in the world but not this she rose slowly to her feet and stood there arms hanging limply by her side tears trickling down her cheeks she said dully its the maddest plan ive ever heard in my life turned and left the room switching off the light as she went i lay there staring jnto the darkness there was sense in what the lady said it was i thought the maddest plan tv ever heard in my life i was damned glad i didnt have to use it ten thursday noon friday dawn let me sleep i said i kept my eyes shut im a dead man come on come on another violent shake a hand like a power shovel up oh god i opened the corner of one eye whats the time just after noon i couldnt let you sleep any more noon i asked to be shaken at five do you know come here he moved to the window and i swung my legs stiffly out of bed and followed him id been operated on during my sleep no anaesthetic required in the condition i was in and someone had removed the bones from my legs i felt awful hutchinson nodded towards the window what do you think of that i peered out into the grey opaque world i said irritably what do you expect me to sec in that damn fog the fog i see i said stupidly the fog the two am shipping forecast hutchinson said he gave the impression of exercising a very great deal of patience it said the fog would clear away in the early morning well the goddamned fog hasnt cleared away in the early morning the fog cleared away from my befuddled brain i swore and jumped for my least sodden suit of clothing it was damp and clammy and cold but i hardly noticed these things except subconsciously my conscious mind was frantically busy with something else on monday night theyd sunk the nantesville at slack water but there wasnt a chance in a thousand that they would have been able to get something done that night or the tuesday night the weather had been bad enough in sheltered torbay harbour god alone knew what it would have been like in beul nan uamh but they could have started last night they had started last night for there had been no divingboat in the dubh sgeir boathouse and reports from the nantesvilles owners had indicated that the strongroom was a fairly antiquated one not of hardened steel that could be cut open in a couple of hours with the proper equipment lavorski and company would have the proper equipment the rest of last night even had they three divers and reliefs working all the time they could have brought up a fair proportion of the bullion but id been damn sure they couldnt possibly bring up all eighteen tons of it marine salvage had been my business before uncle arthur had taken me away they would have required another night or at least a good part of the night because they only dared work when the sun was down when no one could see them but no one could see them in dense fog like this this was as good as another night thrown in for free give uncle arthur a shake tell him were on our way in the firecrest hell want to come hell have to stay hell know damn well hell have to stay beul nan uamh tell him not dubh sgeir not the boathouse you know damn well we cant move in against that until midnight id forgotten hutchinson said slowly we cant move in against it until midnight the beul nan uamh wasnt jiving up to hs fearsome reputation at that time in the afternoon it was dead slack water and there was only the gentlest of swells running up from the southwest we crossed over from ballara to the extreme north of the eastern shore of dubh sgeir and inched our way southward with bare steerage way on wed cut the bypass valve into the underwater exhaust and even in the wheelhouse we could barely hear the throb of the diesel even with both wheelhouse doors wide open we could just hear it and no more but we hadnt the wheelhouse doors open for the purpose of hearing our own engine by this time we were almost halfway down the eastern patch of miraculously calm water that bordered the normal millrace of beul nan uamh the one that williams and i had observed from the helicopter the previous afternoon for the first time hutchinson was showing something approaching worry he never spared a glance through the wheelhouse windows and only a very occasional one for the compass he was navigating almost entirely by chart and depthsounder are you sure itll be this fourteenfathom ledge calvert it has to be it damn well has to be out to the seven fathom mark there the seabottom is pretty flat but theres not enough depth to hide superstructure and masts at low tide from there to fourteen ifs practically a cliff and beyond the fourteen fathom ledge it goes down to thirtyfive fathom steep enough to roll a ship down there you cant operate at those depths without very special equipment indeed its a damn narrow ledge he grumbled less than a cable how could they be sure the scuttled ship would fetch up where they wanted it to they could be sure in dead slack water you can always be sure hutchinson put the engine in neutral and went outside we drifted on quietly through the greyly opaque world visibility didnt extend beyond our bows the muffled beat of the diesel served only to enhance the quality of ghostly silence hutchinson came back into the wheelhouse his vast bulk moving as unhurriedly as always fm afraid youre right i hear an engine i listened then i could hear it too the unmistakable thudding of an air compressor i said what do you mean afraid you know damn wellhe touched the throttle gave the wheel a quarter turn to port and we began to move out gently into deeper water youre going to go down do you think im a nut case do you think i want to go down i bloody well dont want to go down and you bloody well know that i have to go down and you know why you want them to finish up here load up in dubh sgeir and the whole lot to be hell and gone before midnight half calvert take half of our share god man we do nothing ill settle for a pint in the columba hotel in torbay you just concentrate on putting this tub exactly where she ought to be i dont want to spend the rest of my life swimming about the atlantic when i come back up from the nantesville he looked at me the expression in his eyes saying if not when but kept quiet he circled round to the south of the divingboat we could faintly hear the compressor all the way then slightly to thewest he turned the firecrest towards the source of the sound manoeuvring with delicacy and precision he said about a cable length about that hard to judge in fog north twentytwo east true let go the anchor i let go the anchor not the normal heavy admiralty type on the chain but a smaller cqr on the end of forty fathoms of rope it disappeared silently over the side and the terylene as silently slid down after it i let out all forty fathoms and made fast i went back to the wheelhouse and strapped the cylinders on my back you wont forget now hutchinson said when you come up just let yourself drift the ebbs just setting in from the nornoreast and will carry you back here ill keep the diesel ticking youll be able to hear the underwater exhaust twenty yards away j hope to hell the mist doesnt clear youll just have to swim for dubh sgeir that will be ducky what happens to you if it clears ill cut the anchor rope and take oft and if they come after you come after me just like that and leave two or three dead divers down inside the nantesville i wish to god i said irritably that you wouldnt talk about dead divers inside the nantesville there were three divers aboard the nantesvilte not dead but all working furiously or as furiously as one can work in the pressurised slowmotion world of the undersea getting down there had been no trouble id swum on the surface towards the divingboat the compressor giving me a clear bearing all the time and dived when only three yards away my bands touched cables lifelines and finally an unmistakable wire hawser the wire hawser was the one for me i stopped my descent on the wire when i saw the dim glow of light beneath me i swam some distance to one side then down until my feet touched something solid the deck of the nantesville i moved cautiously towards the source of the light there were two of them standing in their weighted boots at the edge of an open hatchway as id expected they were wearing not my selfcontained apparatus but regular helmet and corselet diving gear with airlines and lifelines the lifelines almost certainly with telephone wires imbedded inside them selfcontained diving equipment wouldnt have been much use down here it was too eep for oxygen and compressedair stores too limited with those suits they could stay down an hour and a half at least although theyd have to spend thirty to forty minutes on decompression stops on the way up i wanted to be gone in less than that i wanted to be gone that very moment my heart was banging away against my chest wall like a demented pop drummer with the ague but it was only the pressure of the water i told myself it couldnt be fear i was far too brave for that the wire rope id used to guide me down to the nantesville terminated in a metal ring from which splayed out four chains to the corners of a rectangular steel mesh basket the two divers were loading this basket with wire and woodhandled steel boxes that they were hauling up from the hold at the rate of i guessed about one every minute the steel boxes were small but obviously heavy each held four lb ingots of gold each box held a fortune there were three hundred and sixty such fortunes aboard the nantesville i tried to calculate the overall rate of unloading the steel basket held sixteen boxes sixteen minutes to load another ten minutes to winch up to the divingboat unload and lower again say forty an hour in a ninetyminute stretch about sixty but after ninety minutes they would have to change divers forty minutes including two decompression stops of say twelve and twentyfour minutes to get to the surface then twenty minutes to change over and get other divers down an hour at least so in effect they were clearing sixty boxes every two and a half hours or twentyfour an hour the only remaining question was how many boxes were left in the nantesvilles strongroom i had to find out and i had to find out at once id had only the two compressed aircylinders aboard the firecrest and already their two hundred atmospheres were seriously depleted the wire hawser jerked and the full basket started to rise the divers guiding it clear of the superstructure with a trailing guide rope i moved forward from the corner of the partially opened hatch remote from where they were standing and cautiously wriggled over and down with excessive caution i supposed then lamp cast only a small pool of light and they couldnt possibly have seen me from where i was standing i felt my hands already puffed and numbed by the icy water touch a lifeline and airline and quickly withdrew them below and to my right i could see another faint pool of light a few cautious strokes and i could see the source of the light the light was moving it was moving because it was attached to the helmet of a diver angled so as to point down at an angle of fortyfive degrees the diver was inside the a strongroom they hadnt opened that strongroom with any yale key theyd opened it with underwater torches cutting out a roughly rectangular section in the strongrooms side maybe six feet by four i moved up to this opening and pushed my bead round the side beyond the now stooping diver was another light suspended from the deckhead the bullion boxes were neatly stacked in racks round the side and it was a fivesecond job to estimate their number of the three hundred and sixty bullion boxes there were about one hundred and twenty left something brushed my arm pulled past my arm i glanced down and saw that it was a rope a nylon line that the diver was pulling in to attach to the handle of one of the boxes i moved my arm quickly out of the way his back was towards me he was having difficulty in fastening the rope but finally secured it with two half hitches straightened and pulled a knife from his waist sheath i wondered what the knife was for i found out what the knife was for the knife was for me stooped over as he had been he could just possibly have caught a glimpse of me from the corner of his eye or he might have felt the sudden pressure then release of pressure on the nylon rope or his sixth sense was in better working condition than mine i wont say he whirled round for in a heavy diving suit at that depth the tempo of movement becomes slowed down to that of a slowmotion film but he moved too quickly for me it wasnt my body that was slowing down as much as my mind he was completely round and facing me not four feet away and i was still where id been when hed first moved still displaying all the lightning reactions and coordinated activity of a bag of cement the sixinchbladed knife was held in his lowered hand with thumb and forefinger towards me which is the way that only nasty people with lethal matters on their minds hold knives and i could see his face dearly god knows what he wanted the knife for it must have been a reflex action he didnt require a knife to deal with me he wouldnt have required a knife to deal with two of me it was quinn i watched his face with a strangely paralysed intentness i watched his face to see if the head would jerk down to press the telephone callup buzzer with his chin but his head didnt move quinn had never required any help in his life and he didnt require any now instead his lips parted in a smile of almost beatific joy my mask made it almost impossible for my face to be recognised but he knew whom he had he knew whom he had without any doubt in the world he had the face of a man in the moment of supreme religious ecstasy he fell slowly forwards his knees bending till he was at an angle of almost fortyfive degrees and launched himself forward his right arm already swinging far behind his back the moment of thrall ended i thrust off backwards from the strongrooms outer wall with my left foot saw the airhose come looping down towards me as quinn came through the jagged hole caught it and jerked down with all ray strength to pull him offbalance a sharp stinging pain burned its way upwards from my lower ribs to my right shoulders felt a sudden jerk in my right hand i fell backwards on to the floor of the hold and then i couldnt see quinn any more not because the fall had dazed me nor because quinn had moved but because he had vanished in the heart of an opaque boiling mushrooming cloud of dense airbubbles a noncollapsible airhose can and often has to stand up to some pretty savage treatment but it cant stand up to the wickedly slicing power of a razorsharp knife in the hands of the strongest man id ever known quinn had cut his own airhose had slashed it cleanly in two no power on earth could save quinn now with a pressure of forty pounds to the square inch on that severed airline he would be drowning already his suit filling up with water and weighting him down so that he could never rise again almost without realising what i was doing i advanced with the nylon rope still in my hands and coiled it any old way round the madly threshing legs taking great care indeed to keep clear of those flailing arms for quinn could still have taken me with him could have snapped my neck like a rotten stick at the back of my mind i had the vague hope that when his comrades investigated as they were bound to do immediately those great clouds of bubbles must have already passed out through the hold on their way to the surface they would think hed become entangled and tried to cut himself free i did not think it a callous action then nor do i now i had no qualms about doing this to a dying man and no compunction he was doomed anyway he was a psychopathic monster who killed for the love of it and most of all i had to think of the living who might die the prisoners in the cellars of the dubh sgeir castle i left him threshing there dying there and swam up and hid under the deckhead of the hold the two men who had been on deck were already on their way down being slowly lowered on their lifelines as soon as their helmets sunk below my level i came up through the hatchway located the wire hawser and made my way up id been down for just under ten minutes so when my wrist depthgauge showed a depth of two fathoms i stopped for a threeminute decompression period by now quinn would be dead i did as hutchinson had told me drifted my way back to the firecrest there was no hurry now and located it without difficulty hutchinson was there to help me out of the water and i was glad of his help am i glad to see you brother he said never thought the day would come when tim hutchinson would die a thousand deaths but die a thousand deaths he did how did h go all right weve time five or six hours yet ill get the hook up three minutes later we were on our way and three minutes after that we were out near enough in the midchannel of the beul nan uamh heading northnortheast against the gathering ebb i could hear the helm going on autopilot and then hutchinson came through the door into the lit saloon curtains tightly if in that fog unnecessarily drawn where i was rendering some first aid to myself just beginning to tape up a patch of gauze over the ugly gash that stretched all the way from lowest rib to shoulder i couldnt see the expression behind the darklyluxuriant foliage of that beard but his sudden immobility was expression enough he said quietly what happened calvert quinn i met him in the strongroom of the nantesville he moved forward and in silence helped me to tape up the gauze when it was finished and not until then he said quinn is dead it wasnt a question quinn is dead he cut his own airhose i told him what had happened and he said nothing he didnt exchange a dozen words all the way back to craigmore i knew he didnt believe me i knew be never would neither did uncle arthur hed never believe me till the day he died but his reaction was quite different it was one of profound satisfaction uncle arthur was in his own avuncular fashion possessed of an absolute ruthlessness indeed be seemed to take half the credit for the alleged execution its not twentyfour hours hed announced atthe teatable since i told calvert to seek out and destroy this man by whatever means that came to hand i must confess that i never thought the means would consist of the blade of a sharp knife against an airhose a neat touch my boy a very neat touch indeed charlotte skouras believed me i dont know why but she believed me while she was stripping off my makeshift bandage cleaning the wound and rebandaging it very efficiently a process i suffered with unflinching fortitude because i didnt want to destroy her image of a secret service agent by bellowing out loud at the top of my voice i told her what had happened and there was no doubt that she believed me without question i thanked her for bandage and belief and she smiled six hours later twenty minutes before our eleven pm deadline for taking off in the firecrest she was no longer smiling she was looking at me the way women usually look at you when they have their minds set on something and can see that they are not going to gettheir own way a rather less than affectionate look im sorry charlotte i said im genuinely sorry but its not on you are not coming with us and thats that she was dressed in dark slacks and sweater like one who had or had had every intention of coming with us on a midnight jaunt were not going picnicking on the thames remember what you said yourself this morning there will be shooting do you think i want to see you killed ill stay below she pleaded ill stay out of harms way please philip let me come no you said youd do anything in the world for me remember thats unfair and you know it anything to help you i meant not anything to get you killed not you of all people of all people you think so much of me i nodded i mean so much to you i nodded again she looted at me for a long time her eyes wide and questioning her lips moving as if about to speak and yet not speaking then took a step forward latched her arms around my neck and tried to break it at least that was the way it felt the dead quinns handiwork was still with me but it wasnt that at all she was clinging to me as she might cling to a person who she knew she would never see again maybe she was fey maybe she had second sight maybe she could see old calvert floating face down in the murky waters of the dubh sgeir boathouse when i thought about it i could see it myself and it wasnt an attractive sight at all i was beginning to have some difficulty with my breathing when she suddenly let me go halfled halfpushed me from the room and closed the door behind me i heard the key turn in the lock our friends arc at home tim hutchinson said wed circled far to the south of dubh sgeir close in to the southern shore of loch houron and were now drifting quickly on the flood tide engines stopped in an east by northerly direction past the little manmade harbour of dubh sgeir you were right calvert theyre getting alt ready for their moonlit flitting calvert is usually right uncle arthur said in his best trainedhimmyself voice and now my boy the mist had thinned now giving maybe a hundred yards visibility i looked at the tshaped crack of light showing where the boathouse doors didnt quite meet each other in the middle and where the tops of the doors sagged away from the main structure now it is i said i turned to hutchinson weve all of a fifteen foot beam that entrance is not more than twenty wide theres not a beacon or a mark on it theres a four knot tide running you really think it can be done taking her through that entrance at four or five knots fast enough to smash open those doors without piling ourselves up an the rocks on the way in theres only one way to find out he pressed the starter button and the warm diesel caught fire at once its underpass exhaust barely audible he swung her round to the south on minimum revs continued on this course for two cables westwards for the same distance curved round to the north pushed the throttle wide open and lit a cigar tim hutchinson preparing for action in the flare of the match the dark face was quiet and thoughtful no more for just over a minute there was nothing to be seen just the darkness and patches of grey mist swirling past our bows hutchinson was heading a few degrees west of north making allowance for the set of the tide all at once we could see it slightly off the starboard bow as it had to be to correct for the tide that big tshaped light in the darkness fairly jumping at us i picked up the submachineguns opened and latched back the port wheelhouse door and stood there gun in left hand doorjamb in right with one foot on the outside deck and the other still in the wheelhouse uncle arthur i knewa was similarly positioned on the starboard side we were as firmly braced as it was possible to be when the firecrest stopped it would stop very suddenly indeed forty yards away hutchinson eased the throttle and gave the wheel a touch to port that bright t was even farther round on our starboard side now but directly in line with us and the patch of dark water to the west of the almost phosphorescently foaming whiteness that marked the point where the flood tide ripped past the outer end of the eastern breakwater twenty yards away he pushed the throttle open again we were heading straight for where the unseen west breakwater must be we were far too far over to port it was impossible now that we could avoid smashing bow first into it then suddenly hutchinson had the wheel spinning to starboard the tide pushing him the same way and we were through and not an inch of uncle arthurs precious paintwork had been removed hutchinson had the engine in neutral i wondered briefly whether if i practised for the rest of my life i could effect a manoeuvre like that i knew damned well that i couldnt id told hutchinson that the bollards were on the starboard side of the boathouse so that the divingboat would be tied up on that side he angled the boat across the tiny harbour towards the righthand crack of light spun the wheel to port till we were angling in towards the central crack of light and put the engine full astern it was no part of the plan to telescope the firecrests bows against the wall of the boathouse and send it and us to the bottom as an entrance it erred if anything on the spectacular side the doors instead of bursting open at their central hasps broke off at the hinges and we carried the whole lot before us with a thunderous crash this took a good knot off our speed the aluminium foremast with uncle arthurs fancy telescopic aerial inside almost tore the tabernacle clear of the deck before it sheared off just above wheelhouse level with a most unpleasant metallic shrieking that took another knot off the screws biting deep in maximum revs astern took off yet another knot but we still had a fair way on when amid a crackling splintering of wood partly of our planking but mainly of the doors and the screeching of the rubber tyres on our welltendered bows we stopped short with a jarring shock firmly wedged between the port quarter of the divingboat and the port wall of the boathouse uncle arthurs feelings must have been almost as bruised and lacerated as the planking of his beloved firecrest hutchinson moved the throttle to slow ahead to keep us wedged in position and switched on the fiveinch searchlight less to illuminate the already sufficiently welllit shed than to dazzle bystanders ashore i stepped out on the deck with the machinepistol in my hands we were confronted as the travel books put it with a scene of bustling activity or more precisely what had been a scene of bustling activity before our entrance had apparently paralysed them all in whatever positions they had been at the time on the extreme right three faces stared at us over the edge of the hold of the divingboat a typical fortyfivefoot mfv about the same size as the charmaine two men on deck were frozen in the act of lifting a box across to the hold another two were standing upright one with his hands stretched above his head waiting for another box swinging gently from a rope suspended from a loading boom that box was the only moving thing in the boathouse the winchman himself who bore an uncommon resemblance to thomas the bogus customs officer one lever against his chest and another held in his outstretched right hand looked as if the lavas of vesuvius had washed over him twenty centuries ago and left him frozen for ever the others backs bent were standing on the wall at the head of the boathouse holding a rope attached to a very large box which two frogmen were helping to lift clear of the water when it came to hiding specie they had onetrack minds on the extreme left stood captain imrie presumably there to supervise operations and beside him his patrons lavorski and dofimann this was the big day this was the culmination of all their dreams and they werent going to miss a moment of it imrie lavorski and dollmann were the ones for me i moved forward until i could see the barrel of the machinegun and until they could also see that it was pointing at them come close i said yes you three captain imrie speak to your men tell them that if they move if they try anything at all ill kill all three of you ive killed four of you already if i double the number what then under the new laws you get only fifteen years for murderous vermin that is not enough id rather you died here do you believe me captain imrie i believe you the guttural voice was deep and sombre you killed quinu this afternoon he deserved to die he should have killed you that night on the nantesville imrie said then none of this would have happened you will come aboard our boat one at a time i said in this situation captain imrie you are without question the most dangerous man after you lavorski then please keep very still terribly still the voice behind me was totally lacking in inflection hut the gun pressed hard against my spine carried its own message one not easily misunderstood good take a pace forward and take your right hand away from the gun i took a pace forward and removed my right hand this left me holding the machinepistol by the barrel lay the gun on the deck it obviously wasnt going to be much use to me as a club so i laid it on the deck id been caught like this before once or twice and just to show that i was a true professional i raised my hands high and turned slowly round why charlotte skouras i said again i knew what to do how to act the correcttone for die circumvented agent bantering but bitter fancy meeting you here thank you very much my dear she was still dressed in the dark sweater and slacks only they werent quite as spruce as the last time id seen them they were soaking wet her face was dead white and without expression the brown eyes were very still and how in gods name did you get here i escaped through the bedroom window and swam out i hid in the after cabin did you indeed why dont you change out of those wet clothes she ignored me she said to hutchinson turn offthat searchlight do as the lady says i advised he did as the lady said the light went out and we were all now in full view of the men ashore imrie said throw that gun over the side admiral do as the gentleman says i advised uncle arthur threw the gun over the side captain imrie and lavorski came walking confidently towards us they could afford to walk confidently thethree men in the hold the two men who had suddenly appeared from behind the divingboats wheelhouse and the winchdriver a nice round total of six had suddenly sprouted guns i looked over this show of armed strength and said slowly you were waiting for us certainly we were waking for you lavorski said jovially our dear charlotte announced the exact rime of your arrival havent you guessed that yet calvert how do you know my name charlotte you fool by heavens i believe we have been grievously guilty of overestimating you mrs skouras was a plant i said a bait lavorski said cheerfully i wasnt fooled by his cheerfulness hed have gone into hysterics of laughter when i came apart on the rack swallowed hook line and sinker a bait with a highly effective if tiny transmitter and a gun in a polythene bag we found the transmitter in your starboard engine he laughed again until he seemed in danger of going into convulsions weve known of every move youve made since you left torbay and how do you like that mr secret agent calvert i dont like it at all what are you going to do with us dont be childish what are you going to do with us asks he naively im afraid you know all too well how did you locate this place i dont talk to executioners i think well shootthe admiral through the foot to begin with lavorski beamed a minute afterwards through the aim then the thigh ail right we had a radiotransmitter aboard the nantesville we know that how did you pinpoint dubh sgeir the boat belonging to the oxford geological expedition it is moored fore and aft in a little natural harbour south of here its well clear of any rock yet its badly holed its impossible that it would be holed naturally where it lay it was holed unnaturally shall we say any other boat you could have seen coming from a long way off but that boat had only to move out to be in full sight of the boathouse and the anchored divingboat it was very clumsy lavorski looked at imrie who nodded he would notice that i advised against it at the time was there more calvert donald maceachern on eilean oran you should have taken him not his wife susan kirkside you shouldnt have allowed her out and about when did you last see a fit youngtwentyoneyearold with blue shadows that size under her eyes a fit young twentyoneyearold with nothing in the world to worry about that is and you should have disguised that mark made by the tail fuselage of the beechcraft belonging to lord kirksides elder son when you ran it over the edge of the north cliff i saw it from the helicopter thats all lavorski asked i nodded and he looked again at imrie i believe him imrie said no one talked thats all we need to know calvert first mr lavorski they were certainly a brisk and businesslike outfit i said quickly two questions the courtesy of two answers im a professional id like to know i dont know if you understand and two minutes lavorski smiled make it quick we have business on hand where is sir anthony skouras he should be here he is hes up in the castle with lord kirkside and lord charnley the shangrilas tied up at the west landing stage is it true that you and dollnann engineered the whole plan that you bribed charnley to betray insurance secrets that you or dollmann rather selected captain imrie to pick his crew of cutthroats and that you were responsible for the capture and sinking of the ships and the subsequent salvaging of the cargoes and incidentally the deaths directly or indirectly of our men its late in the day to deny the obvious again lavorskis booming laugh we think we did rather well eh john very well indeed dollmann said coldly were wasting time i turned to charlotte skouras the gun was still pointing at me i said i have to be killed it seems as you will be responsible for my death you might as well finish the job i reached down caught the hand with the gun in it and placed it against my chest letting my own hand fall away please do it quickly there was no sound to be heard other than the soft throb of the firecrests diesel every pair of eyes in that boatshed was on us my back was to them all but i knew it beyond any question i wanted every pair of eyes in that boatshed on us uncle arthur took a step inside the starboard door and said urgently are you mad calvert shell kill you shes one of them the brown eyes were stricken there was no other expression for h the eyes of one who knows her world is coming to an end the finger came off the trigger the hand opened slowly and the gun fell to the deck with a clatter that seemed to echo through the boatshed and the tunnels leading off on either side i took her left arm and said it seems mrs skouras dosnt feel quite up to it im afraid youll have to find someone else to charlotte skouras cried out in sharp pain as her legs caught the wheelhouae sill and maybe i did shove her through that doorway with unnecessary force but it was too late in the day to take chances now hutchinson had been waiting and caught her as she fell dropping to his knees at the same time i went through that door after her like an international rugby threequarter diving for the line with a dozen hands reaching out for him but even so uncle arthur beat me to it uncle arthur had a lively sense of selfpreservation even as i fell my hand reached out for the loudhailer that had been placed in position on the wheelhouse deck dont fire the amplified voice boomed cavernously against the rockfaces and the wooden walls of the boatshed if you shoot youll die one shot and you may all die theres a machinegun lined up on the back of every man in this boathouse just turn round very very slowly and sec for yourselves i half rose to my feet hoisted a wary eye over the lower edge of a wheelhouse window got the rest of the way to my feet went outside and picked up the machinegun on the deck picking up that machinegun was the most superfluous and unnecessary action i had performed for many a long day if there was one thing that boathouse was suffering from at the moment it was a plethora of machineguns there were twelve of them in all shoulderslung machinepistols in twelve of the most remarkably steady pairs of hands pd ever seen the twelve men were ranged in a rough semicircle round the inner end of the boathouse big quiet purposefullooking men dressed in woollen caps greyandblack camouflaged smocks and trousers and rubber boots their hands and faces were the colour of coal their eyes gleamed whitely like performers in the black and white minstrel show but with that every hint of light entertainment ended lower your hands to your sides and let your guns fall the order came from a figure in the middle of the group a man indistinguishable from the others do please be very careful slowly down drop the guns utter stillness my men are very highly trained commandos they have been trained to shoot on suspicion they know only how to kill they have not been trained to wound or cripple they believed him i believed him they dropped their guns and stood very still indeed now clasp your hands behind your necks they did all but one lavorski he wasnt smiling any more and his language had little to recommend it that they were highly trained i could believe no word or signal passed the commando nearest lavorski walked towards him on soundless soles machinepistol across his chest the butt seemed to move no more than three inches when lavorski picked himself up the lower part of his face was covered in blood and i could see the hole where tome teeth had been he clasped his hands behind his neck mr culvert the officer asked me i said captain rawley sir royal marine commandos the castle captain in our hands the in our hands the prisoners two men are ontheir way up afr i said to imrie haw many guards he spat and said nothing the commando who had dealt with lavorski moved forward machinepistol high imrie said two i said to rawley two men enough i hope sir that the guards will not be so foolish as to offer resistance even as he finished speaking the flat rapidfire chatter of a submachinegun came echoing down the long flight of stone steps rawley shrugged theyll never learn to be wise now robinson this to a man with a waterproof bag over his shoulder go up and open the cellar door sergeant evans line them up in two rows against the wall there one standing one sitting sergeant evans did now that there was no danger of being caught in crossfire we landed and i introduced uncle arthur full military honours and all to captain rawley captain rawleys salute was something to see uncle arthur beamed uncle arthur took over capitally done my boy he said to rawley capitally therell be a little something for you in this new years list ah here come some friends they werent all exactly friends this group that appeared at the bottom of the steps there were four tough but dispirited looking characters whom im never seen before but unquestionably tunics men closely followed by sir anthony skouras and lord charnley they in their turn were closely followed by four commandos with the very steady hands that were a hallmark of rawleys men behind them came lord kirkside and his daughter it was impossible to tell what the blackfaced commandos were thinking but the other eight had the same expression on their faces dazed and utter bewilderment my dear kirkside my dear fellow uncle arthur hurried forward and shook him by the hand id quite forgotten that they knew one another delighted to see you safe and sound my dear chap absolutely delighted its all over now what in gods name is happening lord kirkside asked you youve got them you have them all where is my boy where is rollinson what an explosive crack curiously muffled came down the sight of steps uncle arthur looked at rawley who nodded plastic explosive sir excellent excellent uncle arthur beamed youll see them any minute kirkside he crossed over to where old skouras was lined up against the wall hands clasped behind his neck reached up both his own pulled skourass arms down and shook his right hand as if he were attempting to tear it off youre lined up with the wrong team tony my boy this was one of the great moments of uncle arthurs life he led him across to where lord kirkside was standing its been a frightful nightmare my boy a frightful nightmare but its all over now why did you do it skouras said dully why did you do it god oh god you dont know what youve done mrs skouras the reed mrs skouras there is the ham actor in all of us but more than most in uncle arthur he pushed back his sleeve and studied his watch carefully she arrived in london by air from nice just over three hours ago she is in the london clinic what in gods name do you mean you dont know what you are saying my wife your wife is in london charlotte here is charlotte meiner and always was i looked at charlotte a total incomprehension and the tentative beginnings of a dazed hope earlier this year blazing the trail for many kidnappings that were to follow your friends lavorski and dollmann had your wife seized and hidden away to force you to act with them to put your resources at their disposal i think they felt aggrieved tony that you should be a millionaire while they were executives they had it all worked out even to having the effrontery of intending to invest the proceeds in your empire however your wife managed to escape so they seized her cousin and best friend charlotte a friend upon whom shall we say your wife was emotionally very dependent and threatened to kill her unless they got mrs skouras back again mrs skouras surrendered immediately this gave them the bright idea of having two swords of damocles hanging over your head so being men of honour they decided to keep charlotte as well as your imprisoned wife then they knew you would do exactly as they wanted when and as they wanted to have a good excuse to keep both you and charlotte under their surveillance at the same time and to reinforce the idea that your wife was well and truly dead they gave out that you had been secretly married uncle arthur was a kind man no mention of the fact that h was common knowledge that at the time of her alleged death brain injuries sustained by mrs skouras in a car crash two years previously had become steadily worse and it was known that she would never leave hospital again how on earth did you guess that lord kirkside asked no guess must give my lieutenants their due uncle arthur said in his best magnanimous taughtemalliknow voice hunslett radioed me at midnight on tuesday he gave me a list of names of people about whom calvert wanted immediate and exhaustive inquiries made that call was tapped by the shangrila but they didnt know what hunslett was talking about because in our radio transmissions all proper names are invariably coded calvert told me later that when hed seen sir anthony on tuesday night he thought sir anthony was putting on a bit of an act he said it wasnt all act he said sir anthony was completely broken and desolated by the thought of his dead wife he said he believed the original mrs skouras was still alive that it was totally inconceivable that a man who so patently cherished the memory of his wife should have marrkd again two or three months later that he could only have pretended to marry again for the sake of the one person whom he ever and so obviously loved i radioed france riviera police dug up the grave in beaulieu where she had been buried near the nursing home where shed died they found a coffin full of logs you knew this tony old skouras nodded he was a man in a dream it took them half an hour to find out who had signed the death certificate and most of the rest of the day to find the doctor himself they charged him with murder this can be done in prance on the basis of a missing body the doctor wasted no time at all in taking them to his own private nursing home where mrs skouras was in a locked room the doctor matron and a few others are in custody now why in gods name didnt you come to us before they had charlotte and they said they would kill my wife out of hand what what would you have done god knows uncle arthur said frankly shes in fair health tony calvert got radio confirmation at five am uncle arthur jerked a thumb upwards on lavorskis big transceiver in the castle both skouras and lord kirkside had their mouths open lavorski blood still sowing from his mouth and dollmann looked as if they had been sandbagged charlottes eyes were the widest wide id ever seen she was looking at me in a very peculiar way its true susan kirkside said i was with him he told me to tell nobody she crossed to take my arm and smiled up at me im sorry again for what i said last night i think youre the most wonderful man ive ever known except rolly of course she turned round at the sound of footsteps coming down the stairs and promptly forgot all about the second most wonderful man shed ever known rolly she cried rolly i could see rolly bracing himself they were all there i counted them kirksides son the hon rollinson the policemans sons the missing members of the small boats and behind them all a small brownfaced old woman in a long dark dress with a black shawl over her head i went forward and took her arm mrs maceachern i said til take you home soon your husband is waiting thank you young man she said calmly that will be very nice she lifted her arm and held mine in a proprietorial fashion charlotte skouras came and held my other arm not in quite so proprietarial a fashion but there for everyone to see i didnt mind she said you were on to me you were on to me all the time he was uncle arthur said thoughtfully he just said he knew you never quite got round to explaining that bit calvert it wasnt difficult sir if you know all the facts that is i added hastily sir anthony put me on to you that visit he paid me on the firecrest to allay any suspicion we might have had about our smashed radio set only served im afraid to mate me suspicious you wouldnt have normally come to me youd have gone ashore immediately to the police or to a phone sir then in order to get me talking about the cut telephone wires you wondered if the radiowrecker to complete our isolation from the mainland had smashed the two public call boxes from a man of your intelligence such a suggestion was fatuous there must be scores of houses in torbay with their private phone but you thought it might sound suspicious if you suggested cut lines so you didnt then sergeant macdonald gave me a glowing report about you said you were the most respected man in torbay and your public reputation contrasted so sharply with your private behaviour in the shangrila on tuesday night well i just couldnt buy it that nineteenthcentury late victorian melodrama act that you and charlotte put on in the saloon that night had me fooled for all of five seconds it was inconceivable that any man so devoted to his wife could be vicious towards another obviously nice woman thank you kindly sir charlotte murmured it was inconceivable that he send her for his wifes photograph unless he had been ordered to do so and you had been ordered to do so by lavorski and dollmann and it was inconceivable that she would have gone the charlotte meiner i knew would have clobbered you over the head with a marline spike ergo if you werent what you appeared to be neither were you charlotte the villains they thought were laying a foundation for an excellent reason for your flight from the wicked baron to the firecrest where you could become their eyes and ears and keep them informed of all our plans and moves because theyd no idea how long their secret little transmitter in the engineroom would remain undetected after they knew wed found hunslett theyd removed the transmitter by that time it was inevitable that they would try to get you aboard the firecrest so they laid a little more groundwork by giving you a bruised eye the dye is nearly off already and some wicked weals across your back and dumped you into the water with your little polythene kitbag with the microtransmitter and gun inside it do this they said or mrs skouras will get it she nodded they said that i have twentytwenty eyesight sir arthur hasnt his eyes were badly damaged in the war i had a close look at those weak on your back genuine weals also genuine pinpricks where the hypodermic with the anasthetic had been inserted before the lashes were inflicted to that degree at least someone was humane i could stand most things skouras said heavily i couldnt stand the thought of the thought of i guessed you had insisted on the anaesthetic sir no i knew the same way that i knew that you had insisted that the crews of all those small yachts be kept alive or the hell with the consequences charlotte i ran a fingernail down one of those weals you should have jumped through the saloon roof you never batted an eyelid after submersion in salt water after that i knew i have devious reasons for the things i do you told us that you had come to warn us of our deadly danger as if we didnt know i told you we were leaving torbay within the hour so off you trotted to your little cabin and told them we were going to leave within the hour so quinn jacques and kramer came paddling across well in advance of the time youd told us they would be corning trusting we would have been lulled into a sense of false security you must love mrs skouras very much charlotte a clearcut choice she or us and you made your choice but i was waiting for them so jacques and kramer died i told you we were going to eilean oran and craigmore so off you trotted down to your little cabin and told them we were going to eilean oran and craigmore which wouldnt have worried them at all later on i told you we were going to dubh sgeir so off you trotted down to your little cabin again but before you could tell them anything you passed out on your cabin deck possibly as a result of a little nightcap id put in your coffee i couldnt have you telling your friends here that i was going to dubh sgeir could i now they would have had a reception committee all nicely organised you you were in my cabin you said i was on the floor don juan has nothing on me i flit in and out of ladies bedrooms like anything ask susan kirkside you were on the floor i put you to bed i looked at your arms incidentally and the rope marks were gone theyd used rubber bands twisted pretty tightly just before hunslett and i had arrived she nodded she looked dazed i also of course found the transmitter and gun then back in craigmore you came and pumped back for some more information and you did try to warn me you were about torn in half by that time i gave you that information it wasnt the whole truth i regret but it was what i wanted you to tell lavorski and company which i said approvingly like a good little girl you did off you trotted to your little whitewashed bedroom philip calvert she said slowly you are the nastiest sneakingest most lowdown doublecrossing there are some of lavorskis men aboard the shangrila old skouras interrupted excitedly he had rejoined the human race theyll get away theyll get life i said theyre in irons or whatever captain rawleys men here are in the habit of using but how did you how did you know where the shangria was in the darkness in the mist its impossible hows the shangrilas tender working i asked the what the shangrila what the devil he calmed down its not working engines out of order demerara sugar has that effect upon them i explained any sugar has in fact when dumped in the petrol tanks but demerara was all i could lay hands on that wednesday night after sir arthur and i had left you but before we took the firecrest in to the pier i went aboard the tender with a couple of pounds of the stuff im afraid youll find the valves are ruined i also took with me a homing signal transmitter a transistorised batterypowered job which i attached to the inner after bulkhead of the anchor locker a place thats not looked at once a year so when you hauled the incapacitated tender aboard the shangrila well we knew where the shangrila was im afraid i dont follow calvert look at messrs dollmann lavorski and imrie they follow all right i know the exact frequency that transmitter sends on after all it was my transmitter one of mr hutchinsons skippers was given this frequency and tuned in to it like all mfvs it has a loop aerial for direction finding he just had to keep turning the loop till the signal was at full strength he couldnt miss he didnt miss mr hutchinsons skippers skouras said carefully mfvs you said it was as well i reflected that i wasnt overly troubled with selfconsciousness what with mrs maceachern on one hand charlotte on the other and every eye a large proportion of them hostile to a degree bent upon me it could have been embarrassing to a degree mr hutchinson has two sharkfishing boats before i came to dubh sgeir last night i radioed from one of his boats asking for help the gentlemen you see here they said they couldnt send boats or helicopters in this weather in almost zero visibility i told them the last thing i wanted was their damned noisy helicopters secrecy was everything and not to worry about the sea transport i knew some men for whom the phrase zero visibility was only a joke mr hutchinsons skippers they went to the mainland and brought captain rawley and his men back here i didnt think theyd arrive until late at night thats why sir arthur and i were afraid to move before midnight what time did you get here captain rawley ninethirty so early i must admit it was a bit awkward without a radio then ashore in your little rubber boats through the side door waited until the divingboat came back and waited and waited we were getting pretty stiff sir lord kirkside cleared his throat maybe he was thinking of my nocturnal assignation with his daughter tell me this mr calvert if you radioed from mr hutchinsons boat in craigmore why did you have to radio again from here later that night if i didnt youd be down among the dead men by this time i spent the best part of fifteen minutes giving highly detailed descriptions of dubh sgeir externally and of the castle and boathouse layout internally everything that captain rawley and his men have done had to be done in total darkness youll keep an eye on our friends captain rawley a fishery cruiser will be off dubh sgeir shortly after dawn the marines herded them off into the lefthand cave set three powerful lights shining into the prisoners faces and mounted a fourman guard with machinepistols at the ready our friends would undoubtedly keep until the fishery cruiser came in the morning charlotte said slowly that was why sir arthur remained behind this afternoon when you and mr hutchinson went to the nantesville to see that i didnt talk to the guards and find out the truth why else she took her arm away and looked at me without affection so you put me through the hoop she said quietly you let me suffer like this for thirty hours while you knew all the time fairs fair you were doing me down i was doing you down im very grateful to you she said bitterly if you arent you damn well ought to be uncle arthur said coldly this was one for the books uncle arthur talking to the aristocracy even if only the aristocracy by marriage in this waspish tone if calvert wont speak for himself i will point one if you hadnt kept on sending your little radio messages lavorski would have thought that there was something damned fishy going on and might well have left the last ton or two of gold in the nantesville and taken off before we got here people like lavorski have a highly attuned sixth sense of danger point two they wouldnt have confessed to their crimes unless they thought we were finished point three calvert wanted to engineer a situation where all attention was on the firecrest so that captain rawley and his men could move into position and so eliminate all fear of unnecessary bloodshed maybe your blood my dear charlotte point four and more important if you hadnt been in constant radio contact with them advising them of our impending arrival right up to the moment we came through those doors wed even left the saloon door open so that you could clearly overhear us and know all we were doing there would have been a pitched battle guns firing as soon as those doors were breached and who knows how many lives would have been lost but they knew they were in control they knew the trap was set they knew you were aboard with that gun to spring the trap point five and most important of all captain rawley here was hidden almost a hundred yards away along the cross runnel and the detachment up above were concealed in a storeroom in the castle how do you think they knew when to move in and move in simultaneously because like all commandos they had portable radio sets and were listening in to every word of your running commentary dont forget your transmitter was stolen from the firecrest it was calverts transmitter my dear he knew the transmitting frequency to the mainland last night that was after he had urn given you a little something to drink and checked your transmitter before using the one up in the castle last night charlotte said to me i think you are the most devious and detestable and untrustworthy man ive ever met her eyes were shining whether from tears or whatever i didnt know i felt acutely embarrassed and uncomfortable she put her hand on my arm and said in a low voice you fool oh you fool that gun might have gone off i i might have killed you philip i patted her hand and said you dont even begin to believe that yourself in the circumstances i thought it better not to say if that gun had gone off id never have trusted a threecornered file again the grey mist was slowly clearing away and the dawn coming up on the quiet dark sea when tim hutchinson eased the firecrest in towards eilean oran there were only four of us on the boat hutchinson myself mrs maceachern and charlotte id told charlotte to find a bed in dubh sgeir castle for the night but shed simply ignored me helped mrs maceachern on to the firecrest and had made no move to go ashore again very selfwilled she was and i could see that this was going to cause a lot of trouble in the years to come uncle arthur wasnt with us a team of wild horses couldnt have dragged uncle arthur aboard the firecrest that night uncle arthur was having his foretaste of paradise sitting hi front of a log fire in the dubh sgeir castle drawingroom knocking back old kirksides superlative whisky and retailing his exploits to a breathless and spellbound aristocracy if i were lucky maybe hed mention my name a couple of times in the course of his recounting of the epic on die other hand maybe he wouldnt mrs maceachern wasnt having her foretaste of paradise she was there already a calm dark old lady with a wrinkled brown face who smiled and smiled and smiled alt the way to her home on eilean oran i hoped to god old donald maceachern had remembered to change his shirt
