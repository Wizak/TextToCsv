 chapter one a bad dream somewhere a telephone was ringing howard could hear it in his dream but it didnt wake him up it was dark in his dream dark and terrible he was running but it was like running through deep water there were trees all around him trees which tried to stop him they reached out with their branches and it was behind him it was coming nearer he wanted to shout for help he was opening his mouth wide but there was no sound he could hear the noise it was making behind him the heavy feet the heavy breathing he was terrified he looked behind he could see it he could see the burning eyes the yellow teeth oh no it was coming nearer a few more steps and then the telephone was still ringing dont answer it howard shouted suddenly he was awake his body was hot and wet the bedclothes were nearly off the bed he was awake and safe it was only a dream he tried to pull the bedclothes back onto the bed but something was wrong his arm felt strange he lifted his head and looked beside his bed there was a metal pole there was a tube coming from it his arm was tied to it he let his head fall back on the bed then he knew what it was he was in hospital but why he was probably a patient he was ill or hurt maybe he had been in an accident he tried to think but he couldnt remember this happened sometimes after accidents people said you forgot what had happened just before but howard felt cold around his heart he couldnt remember anything not the accident but was it an accident not the hospital not his home or family did he have a family he couldnt even remember his name who was he he didnt know he lifted his head again and looked to the right he was in a hospital ward a long room full of beds and other patients men who were sleeping or reading at one end he could see a nurse she was speaking into a telephone was that the telephone he had heard he looked to the left and he became still with fear a man was sitting on a chair just by his bed there was something in his hand a magazine or a book his head had fallen forward and he was asleep who was he what was he doing here beside howards bed was he a guard the man seemed to feel howards eyes on him because he lifted his head stood up and looked down at howard so youre awake mr blake he said and his voice was ugly have you had a good sleep hows your head is it still hurting who are you said howard his voice was very quiet what am i doing here youve had a little accident the man said theres someone here who wants to speak to you howard closed his eyes yes his head did hurt but it hurt inside more than outside why couldnt he remember what was happening he didnt understand when he opened his eyes two people were standing by his bed his guard and another older person it was a woman with brown hair and cold grey eyes wearing a dark blue suit they were both looking serious almost angry but why were they angry were they angry with him they closed the curtains around his bed and came inside the inspector wants to speak to you mr blake said the guard the inspector then these two were police officers had he been in a road accident no howard knew this wasnt right police inspectors didnt worry about road accidents they were too important then it was a crime perhaps perhaps he had been attacked by a thief now mr blake the inspector began her voice was pleasant but it sounded cold why do you call me blake said howard he had suddenly felt this was wrong my name isnt blake its its come on mr blake the inspector said angrily we know all about you why dont you just answer our questions youll have to in the end howard was feeling more and more worried he wanted to answer their questions but he could remember nothing what do you want to know he said weakly what time did you arrive at the house in primrose avenue the inspector said her voice was now hard and quick how did you climb to the window what weapon did you use to hit the old lady what were you going to do with the green dragon stop stop cried howard he felt sick he couldnt breathe he could only hear those last words the green dragon the green dragon howard groaned the green dragon those eyes those burning red eyes and then he remembered more red eyes red blood a pool of blood on a chinese rug but he was the one who was hurt he was the one who had been attacked violently the detectives of course they were detectives began to ask their questions again they were hard questions they were impossible to answer i cant i cant said howard its no use i cant remember he felt like a little boy he wanted to cry you climbed into the old ladys house in the dark she heard you and went to look you hit her when she got to the stairs the guard said and then the nurse was standing beside them thats enough she said angrily hes too ill to answer any more questions youll have to leave she did something to howards arm he felt himself sinking into sleep the green dragon the telephone the pool of blood the old lady what had happened he didnt know but he was certain about one thing my names not blake he said loudly and clearly then he slept chapter two escape howard was still afraid when he woke up it was night and the long ward was silent yes he was still afraid but he was stronger much stronger something was going round and round in his head it was something the detective had said just before the nurse came he looked around the room everyone was sleeping he could see the moonlight on their beds moonlight that was it the guard had said in the dark but he was wrong it wasnt dark it was moonlight bright moonlight howard sat up in his bed he suddenly felt excited was he remembering at last but his thoughts were gone before he could catch them he wanted to shout with anger but he had seen something his arm was free the pole and tube had gone and the curtains were open then he noticed something else the guard was not there howard tried to control his thoughts what did he know so far an old lady had been killed an old lady who lived in primrose avenue and the police thought he had killed her that name primrose avenue hed heard it before was the answer there could he find the address if he was free free he had to get free he had to escape from the hospital he had to discover what had really happened because he was certain he had not killed anyone he hadnt he hadnt done that terrible thing then he lay back on the bed he was feeling weak how could he escape they had taken away all his clothes suddenly howard heard voices outside the ward he shut his eyes quickly and lay very still he could hear the voices of his guard and the nurses the big doors opened and they came in quickly they were pushing a stretcher a man was lying on it he was groaning it was just outside the hospital the nurse was saying he walked in front of a bus they put the new patient on the bed next to howards doctors and nurses were all around him then one of the doctors said well have to operate and the man was taken away again on his stretcher ill go and phone his wife said the guard and left the ward then it was quiet again howard didnt move for a very long time then slowly he opened his eyes the ward was quiet the other patients were sleeping again he lifted his head and looked at the next bed the mans clothes were still on the chair by his bed they had forgotten to take them away he wanted to laugh howard got out of bed and stood up carefully for a moment he thought he was going to fall he shook his head then he felt all right he smiled to himself he felt strong he could do it now he knew he could do it he could escape he dressed in the bathroom the mans clothes were a little too small but he could get them on he looked at himself in the mirror now for the difficult part chapter three inside the old house but he was lucky he saw nobody and nobody saw him he walked quickly out of the ward and out of the hospital outside he saw that one of the nurses had left her bicycle against the wall howard stared at it he had a strange feeling that he had done all this before somehow a bicycle was important but why he couldnt remember but he knew he could ride a bicycle he shook himself got on the bicycle and rode away quickly somehow he knew the way it was like having a map in his head there was primrose avenue and there yes there was the big old house it was hidden behind trees howard started to walk up the drive it was like the dream he knew the way exactly he was certain the answers were here the answers to all of his questions suddenly he jumped into the shadow of the trees and stood very still under the branches he could hear voices he looked out slowly and saw a van a white van it was parked outside the house two people were standing by it they were talking they were wearing dark uniforms then he saw who they were the police of course a woman had been murdered in this house and the police were guarding it he had to be more careful he had to go round to the back of the house nobody would be able to see him there he crept through the trees silently he stayed in the shadows again he knew the way here was the back of the house and here was the drainpipe beside the balcony he climbed up easily and opened the window somehow he knew it wasnt locked he climbed in and stood in the dark he was breathing deeply but he wasnt afraid the house felt warm and friendly he felt his way across the upstairs hall with his hands then he started down the stairs step by step slowly and carefully suddenly he felt afraid very afraid but why the house didnt feel friendly any more something was waiting for him downstairs something evil and cruel and howard cried out he was terrified someone was lying on the floor below he could see a white shape with the arms out at the sides then the moon appeared from behind a cloud and shone through the window howards legs felt weak the body he had seen on the floor had seemed real was he remembering something or was he just dreaming it he could see clearly now it wasnt a body on the rug below it was only some white marks the police had made white marks on the floor they had wanted to show the place the place where the body had been there was nothing to be afraid of but had he remembered something else he looked again nearer and nearer then he turned away he was feeling sick beside the shape of the head the rug was dark dark with blood howard almost fell down the last steps he ran across the hall he crashed into tables chairs and a large heavy wooden box the moonlight shone on its top it was covered with chinese dragons he turned away he couldnt breathe he had to get outside he had to get into the cold night air suddenly he stopped voices he heard the sound of a key in the lock he looked around wildly he had to hide but where where the chinese box no not there not with those dragons but he had to there was nowhere else he climbed in the voices came nearer and stopped just by the box it was the two police officers howard had seen outside in the box he tried to breathe quietly the voices were clear i want you to have a look around one was saying you havent been here before have you what happened exactly the other said the old lady was murdered and howard thought about the police officer was he pointing to the shape at the bottom of the stairs pointing to the dry blood but now he was speaking again weve got the man that did it you know that dont you he wanted to steal that dragon we think the old lady heard something maybe she was watching television she came to the bottom of the stairs he was coming down silently and when he saw her crash he hit her we dont know what he hit her with he just hit wildly in the dark and ran back upstairs and got out through the window but this time he made a mistake he slipped and fell in the box howard was listening very carefully to every word was he hearing the true story now he thought carefully why couldnt he remember in the dark the police officer had said no that was wrong it wasnt dark but how did he know this why was it important the cleaner found him the next morning he was unconscious under the balcony he was sleeping like a baby but hed hurt his head the dragon was on the ground beside him their voices were getting weaker they were going away howard waited fifteen minutes twenty minutes then he opened the top of the box a little everything was still outside still and dark the moon was hidden again he climbed out he tried to be very quiet the room was very dark and he couldnt see anything he held his hands in front of him and moved one foot slowly then the other if he could switch on the light just for a minute he would be able to see the shape of the room and the doors his hands touched something hard the wall good if he followed the wall he would find the door yes here it was and here was the handle howard suddenly felt light and happy in a second he was going to be in the fresh air and he was going to be free from the heavy walls of this house they seemed like a prison to him now he had to go to the police he had to tell them they were wrong terribly wrong about him he opened the door and stepped quickly through the doorway chapter four the green dragon when howard became conscious again he was lying on a hard and dirty floor and every bone in his body ached he tried to move but the pain was too much what had happened this place was darker than upstairs upstairs then he remembered he had opened a door and suddenly he was falling crashing from step to step until he reached the bottom and blackness just like the last time howard thought then he sat up the last time yes now he remembered he had been to this house before he had seen the old lady she was lying on the floor in a pool of blood but did he kill her it had been about six oclock when freddy came howard was just finishing his tea he groaned when he saw freddy freddy was his brotherinlaw and he had been married to howards sister helen for nine years but howard didnt like him he had never liked him he had always been suspicious of freddy he thought that freddy wasnt really honest he didnt know why he thought that but he did it was just something about freddy he didnt seem to have a job but he always had a big car and expensive clothes helen and the two children seemed to have everything they needed but howard got up when freddy came into the room freddy was white and nervous he went quickly to the window and looked out did he think someone else was coming youve got to help me howard he said im in trouble bad trouble howard put down his teacup what can i do he said carefully you had to be careful with freddy freddys hands were shaking when he lit his cigarette i need money a lot of money howard started to speak but freddy continued quickly i know i know you havent got any money but you can help me he was looking at howard nervously how said howard angrily if this is one of your wild plans the answer is no im not going to help you in any crime its only a little thing freddy said he put out his cigarette one phone call thats all there are some men he looked nervously out of the window again what men said howard criminals you mean its better if you dont know freddy said quickly theyre not gentlemen the word sounded strange when freddy said it when theyre angry theyre dangerous very dangerous theyre going to suddenly freddy covered his face with his hands howard saw that he was shaking and jumped to his feet he put his hand on freddys arm maybe he didnt like freddy but he was his brotherinlaw freddy looked up he was terrified youve got to save me howard he said his voice was shaking youre the only friend ive got if they dont get their money soon theyll theyll kill me for a few minutes he could not continue he was too frightened if im killed what will happen to helen and the children he whispered he knew just how to hurt howard no husband no father soon therell be no house no money theyll be out on the street his voice was getting louder and louder all right all right said howard he was trying to stay calm what do you want me to do freddys plan was easy and it didnt seem dangerous for howard theres an old lady he began her name was miss blake and she lived in a big old house on the north side of the town the house was hidden behind tall trees she had lived in the far east for many years and when she came back she was a rich woman her house was full of valuable things most of them were too heavy to move but then there was the green dragon dragon howard said he laughed what dragon it was made of green jade and gold freddy had told him with red jewel eyes and diamonds on its tail it stood in a special place in her bedroom and it was lit by bright lights he knew all about it because he had been talking to her cleaner at the pub its worth thousands of pounds freddy said he was excited now he was enjoying this maybe hundreds of thousands and its light enough to carry and small enough to hide he wanted howard to do one thing just one thing you phone the old lady freddy explained you tell her that a packet has arrived at your address primrose road but this isnt pr howard began i know i know you just say its primrose road freddy said quickly her address is primrose avenue its nearly the same isnt it you say your name is blake the same as hers you say that the stamp on the packet says singapore and inside it there is some special tea you think there has been a mistake you find her name in the phone book and decide the packet has come to the wrong address he looked at howard do you understand he asked yes yes go on said howard he wanted to hear the end well its easy freddy continued you tell her you would like to bring the packet round to her house but you cant walk youre in a wheelchair and you are just going away on three weeks holiday in fact your daughter is coming soon to take you to the airport then you ask miss blake would she like to wait three weeks or would she like to call round at your house immediately and get the packet herself but maybe shell wait three weeks howard said he didnt like the sound of freddys plan but he was interested now she wont said freddy shell want her packet shell leave the house immediately because shell want to catch you before you go and ill be outside her house as soon as she leaves ill get into the house ill get the green dragon and ill get out ifll be easy ifll be like taking sweets from a baby howard felt unhappy but what could he do ill bring the dragon back to you freddy was saying now you can hide it here here howard cried he was frightened why here whats wrong with your house the children freddy said he looked away from howards eyes they may find it also i want to hide it from those men they wont look here freddys plan worked perfectly howard was terrified when he heard the old ladys voice on the phone he had hoped she would not answer but she did one hour later the green dragon was on his dining table it was staring at him with those hot red eyes he hated it from the moment he saw it howard had sat and studied the dragon for hours he was drinking coffee black coffee and smoking cigarette after cigarette at dinner time he couldnt eat when he thought about food he felt sick strange things were happening to his head once with a shaking hand he had touched the dragon again but he pulled his hand away quickly it had seemed redhot im going crazy he thought i will go crazy if i have to keep that thing much longer he lit another cigarette nervously had someone seen freddy someone who knew him had those men those dangerous criminals been following freddy had they seen him at howards house the police had probably interviewed everybody who had worked for miss blake had the cleaner told them that she had talked to freddy the questions went round and round in his head i was stupid he told himself why didnt i throw freddy and his crazy ideas out of the house suddenly he jumped to his feet this had to stop there was only one answer he had to take the dragon back chapter five a body in the moonlight howard lay alone in the cellar below the house he felt tired but he felt better because he could remember the true story it was like living through the story again the fears the terrible moments like the moment when the police stopped him yes he thought i remember very late that night he had taken the dragon back to miss blakes house he had put it into his bicycle bag and had started to ride through the silent streets in the moonlight moonlight that was unlucky it had been dark earlier well he couldnt do anything about that he had turned into primrose avenue and there was a police car the two officers in the car were immediately suspicious of this lonely cyclist in the early hours of the morning they stopped him and asked what he was doing im going to my mothers said howard he was shaking inside they phoned me and said she was ill the police officer wanted to help leave your bicycle she said well drive you there no no said howard he was feeling hot and uncomfortable shes my mothers house is just here around the corner but thank you thank you very much he got on his bicycle and rode away he heard the police cars engine he didnt look back the sound of the police car moved away howard breathed normally again a few minutes later he found miss blakes house it looked strange and frightening in the moonlight it seemed to be waiting for him was it a trap for a moment howard wanted to turn back but he told himself not to be silly it was late the old lady was asleep he didnt need to be afraid freddy had told him that he had dressed like a window cleaner and had climbed up his ladder to a balcony the balcony led to the upstairs hall he had planned to break a window but he found the window was open now howard saw the same window he had no ladder but there was a drainpipe he could climb it soon he was inside and he was standing at the top of the stairs in the moonlight he was looking down he mustnt wake miss blake he must leave the dragon somewhere perhaps on the table in the hall he could see it below him then his heart froze in his body there was someone lying at the bottom of the stairs a body a real body and the moonlight was shining on the pool of blood and then he had run back to the open window to the drainpipe the dragon was still in his hand he started to throw it away with a wild cry he slipped the air was rushing past the dragon was falling with him its eyes were staring its mouth was open and its teeth were shining was it screaming like him chapter six guilty or not guilty it wasnt a dream howard told himself now in the cellar it really had happened he had seen miss blakes body but he hadnt killed her she was already dead when he first saw her he thought about the dragon again he could almost see those red eyes shining in the dark then howard went cold inside there were eyes shining in the dark here in this cellar they were watching him dragons eyes no rats he was terrified of rats he felt around with his hands and found some pieces of wood he threw them at the shining eyes and shouted as loudly as he could suddenly a voice came from above whos that whats happening down there it was a police officer help me howard said weakly please help me iater the inspector was sitting beside his bed she looked serious but happier howard was in hospital again and he was clean and warm and comfortable he was glad that it was all finished they knew who he really was howard thomson they werent calling him blake any more howard told them everything well nearly everything he couldnt say anything about freddy he was thinking of his sister helen and the children he didnt want to hurt them yes i stole the green dragon howard told the inspector i tricked the old lady with my story about a packet of tea and she left the house oh yes said the inspector and stared at him we found a note miss blake left it by the telephone it said mr blake primrose road your story isnt quite true is it you tricked the old lady yes but she let you into the house that evening she didnt leave the house and when she tried to stop you from taking the dragon you no no thats not true it was afternoon not evening howard had to stay calm he had to say he was the thief not freddy he spoke slowly carefully she left the house in the middle of the afternoon i went in and stole the dragon thats what happened inspector i didnt kill her i couldnt kill anyone she was already dead when i saw her for the first time already dead the inspector said quickly yes i howard saw that he had made a mistake he had to explain i went back that night he said you went back the inspector didnt believe him why did you do that i wanted to return the dragon inspector the words sounded weak and stupid i was afraid of it i dont know why but it terrified me oh yes said the inspector again and looked hard at howard with her cold grey eyes she was silent for a long time howard tried to think of something what could he say he had to show the inspector that he was not guilty of murder but he could not find the right words i suppose its just possible the inspector said perhaps the old lady went upstairs that evening and found the dragon was missing then perhaps she rushed to the telephone for help and fell down the stairs and hit her head on the hall table at the bottom yes yes said howard thats it she was killed by her fall dont you see inspector i didnt kill her the inspector was still looking at him suspiciously howard thought hard somewhere there was an answer but you were there the inspector was saying you say you went back to the house that evening you were in the right place at the right time werent you time howard sat up and smiled what time inspector he said he was excited now what time did miss blake die the doctor says it was about eight oclock in the evening said the inspector when it was dark said howard when it was still dark before the moon had risen but i was seen near her house in the moonlight at two oclock in the morning if i was a murderer i wouldnt go back there would i inspector who saw you said the inspector still suspicious friends of yours i dont think im going to believe any friends of youll believe these people inspector said howard quickly two police officers in a police car saw me in primrose avenue right place right time inspector howard felt pleased with himself he lay back on the hospital bed and smiled but the inspector hadnt finished ive got something here i want you to see it she said she opened a box beside her chair and lifted something out howards face went white the inspector was holding the green dragon in her hands it doesnt look very important does it she said the inspector was right howard stared at the dragon it didnt look important in the daylight it looked cheap and ugly its not real you know the inspector was saying what what do you mean said howard he felt cold inside the old lady sold the real one years ago she wasnt as rich as people said she needed the money but the green dragon had some special magic for her and she had this copy made you mean yes its not jade and jewels its just plastic and bits of glass youd be able to sell it for pounds pounds if you were lucky she smiled it was a very cold smile howard thought its not much money not for five years in prison the inspector added five years howard said his voice sounded weak and frightened five years in prison and freddy was going to be free well four then said the inspector she smiled her terrible smile again if youre lucky the end
