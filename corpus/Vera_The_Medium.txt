vera the medium vera the medium by richard harding davis part i happy in the hope that the news was exclusive the despatch had thrown the name of stephen hallowell his portrait a picture of his house and the words at point of death across three columns the announcement was heavy lachrymose bristling with the melancholy selfimportance of the man who saw the deceased just two minutes before the train hit him but the effect of the news fell short of the effort save that city editors were irritated that the presidents of certain railroads figured hastily on slips of paper the fact that an old man and his millions would soon be parted left new york undisturbed in the early s this would not have been so then in the uplifting of the far west stephen hallowell was a national figure in the manoeuvres of the eastern stock market an active alert power in those days when a man with a few millions was still listed as rich his fortune was considered colossal a patent couplingpin the invention of his brotherinlaw had given him his start and in introducing it and in his efforts to force it upon the new railroads of the west he had obtained a knowledge of their affairs from that knowledge came his wealth that was twenty years ago since then giants had arisen in the land men whose wealth made the fortune of stephen hallowell appear a comfortable competence his schemes and stratagems which in their day had bewildered wall street as simple as the trading across the counter of a crossroads store for years he had been out of it he had lost count disuse and ill health had rendered his mind feeble made him at times suspicious at times childishly credulous without friends along with his physician and the butler who was also his nurse he lived in the house that in in a burst of vanity he had built on fifth avenue then the house was a mansion and its front of brown sandstone the outward sign of wealth and fashion now on one side it rubbed shoulders with the shop of a man milliner and across the street the houses had been torn down and replaced by a department store now instead of a sombre jaillike facade his outlook was a row of waxen ladies who before each change of season appeared in new and gorgeous raiment and across the avenue for his approval smiled continually it is time you moved stephen urged his friend and lawyer judge henry gaylor i can get you twice as much for this lot as you paid for both it and the house but mr hallowell always shook his head where would i go henry he would ask what would i do with the money no i will live in this house until i am carried out of it with distaste the irritated city editors followed up the threecolumn story of the despatch find out if theres any truth in that they commanded the old man wont see you but get a talk out of rainey and see judge gaylor hes close to hallowell find out from him if that story didnt start as a bear yarn in wall street so when walsh of the despatch was conducted by garrett the butler of mr hallowell upstairs to that gentlemens library he found a group of reporters already entrenched at the door that opened from the library to the bedroom the butler paused what paper shall i say he asked the despatch walsh told him the servant turned quickly and stared at walsh he appeared the typical butler an englishman of over forty heavily built softmoving with ruddy smoothshaven cheeks and prematurely gray hair but now from his face the look of perfunctory politeness had fallen the subdued voice had changed to a snarl that carried with it the accents of the tenderloin so youre the one are you the man muttered for a moment he stood scowling insolent almost threatening and then once more the servant opened the door and noiselessly closed it behind him the transition had been so abrupt the revelation so unexpected that the men laughed i dont blame him said young irving i couldnt find a single fact in the whole story howd your people get it pretty straight seemed straight to us said walsh well you didnt handle it that way returned the other why didnt you quote rainey or gaylor it seems to me if a mans on the point of death he lowered his voice and glanced toward the closed door that his private doctor and his lawyer might know something about it standing alone with his back to the window was a reporter who had greeted no one and to whom no one had spoken had he held himself erect he would have been tall but he stood slouching lazily his shoulders bent his hands in his pockets when he spoke his voice was in keeping with the indolence of his bearing it was soft hesitating carrying with it the courteous deference of the south only his eyes showed that to what was going forward he was alert and attentive is dr rainey mr hallowells family doctor he asked irving surveyed him in amused superiority he is he answered you been long in new york he asked upon the stranger the sarcasm was lost or he chose to ignore it for he answered simply no im a new orleans boy ive just been taken on the republic welcome to our city said irving what do you think of our main street from the hall a tall portly man entered the room with the assurance of one much at home here and with an exclamation irving fell upon him good morning judge he called he waved at him the clipping from the despatch have you seen this judge gaylor accepted the slip of paper gingerly and in turn moved his fine head pompously toward each of the young men most of them were known to him but for the moment he preferred to appear too deeply concerned to greet them with an expression of shocked indignation he recognized only walsh yes i have seen it he said and there is not a word of truth in it mr walsh i am surprised you of all people we got it on very good authority said the reporter but why not call me up and get the facts demanded the judge i was here until twelve oclock and here interrupted irving then he did have a collapse judge gaylor swung upon his heel certainly not he retorted angrily i was here on business and i have never known his mind more capable more alert he lifted his hands with an enthusiastic gesture i wish you could have seen him well urged irving how about our seeing him now for a moment judge gaylor permitted his annoyance to appear but he at once recovered and murmuring cheerfully certainly certainly ill try to arrange it turned to the butler who had reentered the room garett he inquired is mr hallowell awake yet as he asked the question his eyebrows rose with an almost imperceptible shake of the head he signaled for an answer in the negative well there you are the judge exclaimed heartily i cant wake him even to oblige you in a word gentlemen stephen hallowell has never been in better health mentally and bodily you can say that from me and thats all there is to say then we can say persisted irving that you say that walshs story is a fake you can say it is not true corrected gaylor thats all gentlemen the audience was at an end the young men moved toward the hall and judge gaylor turned to the bedroom as he did so he found that the new man on the republic still held his ground could i have a word with you sir the stranger asked the reporters halted jealously again gaylor showed his impatience about mr hallowells health he demanded theres nothing more to say no its not about his health ventured the reporter well not now i am very late this morning the judge again moved to the bedroom and the reporter as though accepting the verdict started to follow the others as he did so as though in explanation or as a warning he added you said to always come to you for the facts the lawyer halted hesitated what facts do you want he asked the reporter bowed and waved his broad felt hat toward the listening men in polite embarrassment he explained what he had to say could not be spoken in their presence something in the manner of the stranger led judge gaylor to pause he directed garrett to accompany the reporters from the room then with mock politeness he turned to the one who remained i take it you are a new comer in new york journalism what is your name he asked my name is homer lee said the southerner i am a new orleans boy ive been only a month in your city judge he began earnestly but in a voice which still held the drawl of the south i met a man from home last week on broadway he belonged to that spiritualistic school on carondelet street he knows all thats going on in the spook world and he tells me the ghost raisers have got their hooks into the old man pretty deep is that so the bewilderment of judge gaylor was complete and without question genuine i dont know what you mean he said my informant tells me continued the reporter that mr hallowell has embraced if thats what you call it spiritualism gaylor started forward what he roared unmoved the other regarded the judge keenly spiritualism he repeated and that a bunch of these mediums have got him so hypnotized he cant call his soul his own or his money either is that true judge gaylors outburst was overwhelming that it was genuine mr lee observing him closely was convinced of all the outrageous ridiculous the judge halted gasping for words and libelous statements he went on if you print that he thundered mr hallowell will sue your paper for half a million dollars cant you see the damage you would do cant your people see that if the idea got about that he was unable to direct his own affairs that he was in the hands of mediums it would invalidate everything he does after his death every act of his at this time every paper he had signed would be suspected and and stammered the judge as his imagination pictured what might follow they might even attack his will he advanced truculently do you mean to publish this libel lee moved his shoulders in deprecation im afraid we must he said you must demanded gaylor after what ive told you do you think im lying to you no said the reporter i dont think you are looks more like you didnt know not know i gaylor laughed hysterically i am his lawyer i am his best friend who will you believe he stepped to the table and pressed an electric button and garrett appeared in the hall tell dr rainey i want to see him gaylor commanded and return with him as they waited judge gaylor paced quickly to and fro ive had to deny some pretty silly stories about mr hallowell he said but of all the absurd malicioustheres some enemy back of this some one in wall street is doing this but ill find him ill he was interrupted by the entrance of the butler and dr rainey mr hallowells personal physician rainey was a young man with a weak face and knowing shifting eyes that blinked behind a pair of eyeglasses to conceal an indecision of character of which he was quite conscious he assumed a manner that according to whom he addressed was familiar or condescending at one of the big hospitals he had been an ambulance surgeon and resident physician later he had started upon a somewhat doubtful career as a medical expert only two years had passed since the police and the reporters of the tenderloin had ceased calling him doc in a celebrated criminal case in which gaylor had acted as chief counsel he had found rainey complaisant and apparently totally without the moral sense and when in garrett he had discovered for mr hallowell a model servant he had also urged upon his friend for his resident physician his protege rainey still at white heat the older man began abruptly this gentleman is from the republic he is going to publish a story that mr hallowell has fallen under the influence of mediums clairvoyants that everything he does is on advice from the spirit world he turned sharply upon lee is that right the reporter nodded you can see the effect of such a story it would invalidate every act of mr hallowells dr rainey laughed offensively it might he said but whod believe it he believes it cried gaylor or he pretends to believe it tell him he commanded he wont believe me does mr hallowell associate with mediums and spirits and spooks again the young doctor laughed of course not he exclaimed its not worth answering judge you ought to treat it with silent contempt from behind his glasses he winked at the reporter with a jocular intimate smile he was adapting himself to what he imagined was his company where did you pick up that pipe dream he asked without answering the southerner regarded him steadily with inquiring interested eyes the doctor coughed nervously and turned to judge gaylor in the manner of a crossexamination gaylor called up his next witness garrett does any one visit mr hallowell without your knowledge he asked you may not open the door for him but you know every one who gets in to see mr hallowell do you not every one sir do you admit any mediums palmreaders or people of that sort certainly not returned the butler dr rainey he added would not permit it sir gaylor stamped his foot with impatience do you admit any one he demanded without dr raineys permission no sir the reply could not have rung with greater emphasis triumphantly gaylor with a wave of the hand as though saying take the witness turned to lee there you are he cried now are you satisfied the reporter moved slowly toward the door i am satisfied he said that the man doesnt admit any one without dr raineys permission indignantly as though to intercept him judge gaylor stepped forward both rainey and himself spoke together what do you mean by that rainey demanded are you trying to be insolent sir cried the judge lee smiled pleasantly i had no intention of being insolent he said we have the facts i only came to give you a chance to explain them gaylor lost all patience what facts he shouted what facts that mediums come here yes said lee when gaylor cried tell me that when lee regarded the older man thoughtfully well today is thursday he said they were here monday morning and tuesday morning and the one they call vera will be here in half an hour rainey ran across the room stretching out eager detaining hands see here he begged we can fix this fix it said the reporter not with me you cant he turned to the door and found garrett barring his exit he halted fell back on his heels and straightened his shoulders for the first time they saw how tall he was get out of my way he said the butler hesitated and fell back lee walked into the hall ill leave you gentlemen to fight it out among you he said its a better story than i thought as he descended to the floor below the men remained motionless the face of judge gaylor seemed to have grown older when the front door closed he turned and searched the countenance of each of his companions the butler had dropped into a chair muttering and beating his fist into his open palm gaylors voice was hardly louder than a whisper is this true he asked like a cur dog pinned in a corner and forced to fight rainey snarled at him evilly of course its true he said youve let these people see him cried gaylor after i forbade it after i told you what would happen he would see them rainey answered hotly twas better i chose them than gaylor raised his clenched hands and took a sudden step forward the doctor backed hastily against the library table dont you come near me he stammered dont you touch me and youve lied to me cried gaylor youve deceived me you you jailbirds you idiots his voice rose hysterically and do you think he demanded fiercely ill help you now no said the butler the word caught the judge in the full rush of his anger he turned stupidly as though he had not heard aright what he asked from the easy chair the butler regarded him with sullen hostile eyes no he repeated we dont think youll help us you never meant to help us youve never thought of any one but yourself the face of the older man was filled with reproach jim he protested dont do that commanded the butler sharply ive told you not to do that the judge moved his head slowly in amazement the tone of reproach was still in his voice i thought you could understand he said it doesnt matter about him but you you should have seen what i was doing i saw what you were doing the butler replied buying stocks buying a country place you didnt wait for him to die what were we getting with returning courage rainey nodded vigorously thats right all right he protested what were we getting what were you getting demanded gaylor eagerly if youd only left him to me till he signed the new will youd have had everything it only needs his signature yes interrupted garrett contemptuously thats all it needs oh hed have signed it cried gaylor but whats it worth now nothing thanks to you two nothing theyll claim undue influence theyll claim he signed it under the influence of mediums of ghosts his voice shook with anger and distress youve ruined me he cried youve ruined me he turned and paced from them his fingers interlacing his teeth biting upon his lower lip the two other men glanced at each other uncomfortably their silence seemed to assure gaylor that already they regretted what they had done he stood over garrett and for an instant laid his hand upon his shoulder his voice now was sane and cold ive worked three years for this he said and for you too jim you know that ive worked on his vanity on his fear of death on his damn superstition when he talked of restitution of giving the money to his niece i asked why i said leave it for a great monument to your memory isnt it better that ten million dollars should be spent in good works in your name than that it should go to a chit of a child to be wasted by some fortune hunter and then i evolved the hallowell institute university hospital library all under one roof all under one direction and i would have been the director we should have handled ten millions of dollars id have made you both so rich he cried savagely that in two years youd have drunk yourselves into a madhouse and you couldnt trust me youve filled this house with fakes and palmreaders and now every one will know just what he is a senile halfwitted old man who was clay in my hands clay in my hands and youve robbed me of him youve robbed me of him his voice broken with anger and disappointment rose in an hysterical wail as though to meet it a bell rang shrilly gaylor started and stood with eyes fixed on the door of the bedroom the three men eyed each other guiltily the butler was the first to recover with masklike face he hastened noiselessly across the room in his tones of usual authority gaylor stopped him tell mr hallowell he directed that his niece and district attorney winthrop will be here any moment ask him if he wishes me to see them or if he will talk to them himself when the faithful servant had entered the bedroom gaylor turned to rainey when do these mediums come today he asked rainey stared sulkily at the floor i think theyre here now downstairs he answered garrett generally hides them there till youre out of the house indeed commented gaylor dryly after winthrop and miss coates have gone i want to talk with your friends now see here judge whined rainey dont make trouble it isnt as bad as you think the old mans only investigating hush commanded the judge from the bedroom leaning on the butlers arm stephen hallowell came stumbling toward them and with a sigh sank into an invalids chair that was placed for him between the fire and the long library table he was a very feeble very old man with a white face and thin white hair but with a mouth and lower jaw as hard and uncompromising as those of a skull his eyes which were strangely brilliant and younglooking peered suspiciously from under ragged white eyebrows but when they fell upon the doctor the eyes became suddenly credulous pleading filled with selfpity im a very sick man doctor said mr hallowell judge gaylor bustled forward cheerily nonsense stephen nonsense he cried you look a different man this morning doesnt he doctor sure he does assented rainey little sleep was all he needed mr hallowell shook his head petulantly not at all he protested that was a very serious attack this morning my head hurts hurts me to think perhaps said gaylor youd prefer that i talked to your niece no exclaimed the invalid excitedly i want to see her myself i want to tell her once and for all he checked himself and frowned at the doctor you neednt wait he said and doctor he added meaningly after these people go you come back with a conscious glance at the judge rainey nodded and left them no continued the old man i want to talk to my niece myself but i dont want to talk to winthrop hes too clever a young man winthrop in the merger case you remember had me on the stand for three hours made me talk too the mind of the old man suddenly veered at a tangent how the devil can helen retain him he demanded peevishly she cant retain him she hasnt any money and hes district attorney too its against the law is he doing it as a speculation does he want to marry her judge gaylor laughed soothingly heavens no he said shes in his office thats all when she took this craze to be independent of you he gave her a position as secretary or as stenographer or something shes probably told him her story her side of it and hes helping her out of charity the judge smiled tolerantly he does that sort of thing i believe the old man struck the library table with his palm i wish hed mind his own business he cried its my money she has no claim to it never had any claim the judge interrupted quickly thats all right stephen thats all right he said dont excite yourself just get what youre to say straight in your mind and stick to it remember he went on as though coaching a child in a task already learned there never was a written agreement no muttered hallowell never was repeat this to yourself commanded the judge the understanding between you and your brotherinlaw was that if you placed his patent on the market for the first five years you would share the profits equally after the five years all rights in the patent became yours it was unfortunate commented the judge dryly that your brotherinlaw and your sister died before the five years were up especially as the patent did not begin to make money until after five years remember until after five years until after five years echoed mr hallowell it was over six years he went on excitedly before it made a cent and then it was my money and anything i give my niece is charity shes not entitled garrett appeared at the door miss coates he announced and mr winthrop judge gaylor raised a hand for silence and as mr hallowell sank back in his chair helen coates the only child of catherine coates his sister and the young district attorney of new york came into the library miss coates was a woman of between twentyfive and thirty capable and selfreliant she had a certain beauty of a severe type but an harassed expression about her eyes made her appear to be always frowning at times in a hardening of the lower part of her face she showed a likeness to her uncle like him in speaking also her manner was positive and decided in age the young man who accompanied her was ten years her senior but where her difficulties had made her appear older than she really was the enthusiasm with which he had thrown himself against those of his own life had left him young the rise of winthrop had been swift and spectacular almost as soon as he graduated from the college in the little upstate town where he had been educated and his family had always lived he became the prosecuting attorney of that town and later at albany represented the district in the assembly from albany he entered a law office in new york city and in the cause of reform had fought so many good fights that on an independent ticket much to his surprise he had been lifted to the high position he now held no more in his manner than in his appearance did winthrop suggest the popular conception of his role he was not professional not mysterious instead he was sane cheerful tolerant it was his philosophy to believe that the world was innocent until it was proved guilty he was a bachelor and except for two sisters who had married men of prominence in new york and who moved in a world of fashion into which he had not penetrated he was alone when the visitors entered mr hallowell without rising greeted his niece cordially ah helen i am glad to see you he called and added reproachfully at last how do you do sir returned miss helen stiffly with marked disapproval she bowed to judge gaylor and our district attorney cried mr hallowell pardon my not rising wont you i havent seen you sir since you tried to get the grand jury to indict me he chucked delightedly you didnt succeed he taunted winthrop shook hands with him smiling dont blame me he said i did my best im glad to see you in such good spirits mr hallowell i feared by the despatch lies lies interrupted hallowell curtly you know judge gaylor as he shook hands winthrop answered that the judge and he were old friends that they knew each other well know each other so well returned the judge that we ought to be old enemies the younger man nodded appreciatively thats true he laughed only i didnt think youd admit it with light sarcasm mr hallowell inquired whether winthrop was with them in his official capacity oh dont suggest that begged winthrop youll be having me indicted next no sir i am here without any excuse whatsoever i am just interfering as a friend of this young lady good commented hallowell id be sorry to have my niece array counsel against me especially such distinguished counsel sit down helen miss coates balanced herself on the edge of a chair and spoke in cool businesslike tones mr hallowell she began i came mr hallowell objected her uncle uncle stephen miss coates again began i wish to be as brief as possible i asked you to see me today because i hoped that by talking things over we might avoid lawsuits and litigation mr hallowell nodded his approval yes he said encouragingly i have told mr winthrop what the trouble is miss coates went on and he agrees with me that i have been very unjustly treated by whom interrupted hallowell by you said his niece wait helen commanded the old man have you also told mr winthrop he demanded that i have made a will in your favor that were i to die tonight you would inherit ten millions of dollars is that the injustice of which you complain judge gaylor gave an exclamation of pleasure good he applauded excellent hallowell turned indignantly to winthrop and did she tell you also he demanded that for three years i have urged her to make a home in this house that i have offered her an income as large as i would give my own daughter and that she has refused both offers and whats more in his excitement his voice rose hysterically by working publicly for her living she has made me appear mean and uncharitable and thats just it interrupted miss coates it isnt a question of charity will you allow me said winthrop soothingly your niece contends sir he explained that this money you offered her is not yours to offer she claims it belongs to her that its what should have been her fathers share of the profits on the coateshallowell coupling pin but as you have willed your niece so much money although half of it is hers already i advised her not to fight going to law is an expensive business but she has found out and thats what brings me uptown this morning that you intend to make a new will and leave all her money and your own to establish the hallowell institute now winthrop continued with a propitiating smile miss coates also would like to be a philanthropist in her own way with her own money and she wishes to warn you that unless you deliver up what is due her she will proceed against you judge gaylor was the first to answer mr winthrop he said impressively i give you my word there is not one dollar due miss coates except what mr hallowell pleases to give her miss coates contradicted him sharply that is not so she said she turned to her uncle you and my father she declared agreed in writing you would share the profits always mr hallowell looked from his niece to his lawyer the lawyer eyeing him apprehensively nodded with the patient voice of one who tried to reason with an unreasonable child mr hallowell began helen he said i have told you many times there never was such an agreement there was a verbal and i repeat i saw it said miss coates when asked hallowell i saw it first when i was fifteen answered the young woman steadily and two years later before mother died she showed it to me again it was with fathers papers miss coates asked the judge where is this agreement now for a moment miss coates hesitated her dislike for gaylor was so evident that to make it less apparent she lowered her eyes my uncle should be able to tell you she said evenly he was my fathers executor but when he returned my fathers papers she paused and then although her voice fell to almost a whisper continued defiantly the agreement was not with them there was a moments silence to assure himself the others had heard as he did mr hallowell glanced quickly from winthrop to gaylor he half rose from his chair and leaned across the table what he demanded his niece looked at him steadily you heard what i said she answered the old man leaned farther forward so he cried so i am not only doing you an injustice but i am a thief mr winthrop he cried appealingly do you appreciate the seriousness of this winthrop nodded cheerfully its certainly pretty serious he assented it is so serious cried mr hallowell that i welcome you into this matter now we will settle it once and forever he turned to his niece i have tried to be generous he cried i have tried to be kind and you insult me in my own house he pressed the button that summoned the butler from the floor below gentlemen this interview is at an end from now on this matter is in the hands of my lawyer we will settle this in the courts with an exclamation of pleasure that was an acceptance of his challenge miss coates rose that is satisfactory to me she said winthrop turned to mr hallowell could i have a few minutes talk with judge gaylor now he asked not as anybodys counsel he explained just as an old enemy of his well not here protested the old man querulously im im expecting some friends here judge take mr winthrop to the drawing room downstairs he turned to garrett who had appeared in answer to his summons and told him to bring dr rainey to the library the butler left the room and as gaylor and winthrop followed the latter asked miss coates if he might expect to see her at the office she told him that she was now on her way there without acknowledging the presence of her uncle she had started to follow the others when mr hallowell stopped her after they were alone for a moment he sat staring at her his eyes filled with dislike and with a suggestion of childish spite i might as well tell you he began that after what you said this morning i will never give you a single dollar of my money the tone in which his niece replied to him was no more conciliatory than his own you cannot give it to me she answered because it is not yours to give as though to add impressiveness to what she was about to say or to prevent his interrupting her she raised her hand so interested in each other were the old man and the girl that neither noticed the appearance in the door of dr rainey and the butler who halted hesitating waiting permission to enter that money belongs to me said miss coates slowly and as sure as my mother is in heaven and her spirit is guiding me that money will be given me in the pause that followed a swift and singular change came over the face of mr hallowell he stared at his niece as though fascinated his lower lip dropped in awe the look of hostility gave way to one of intense interest his voice was hardly louder than a whisper what do you mean he demanded the girl looked at him uncomprehending what do i mean she repeated when you said he stammered eagerly that the spirit of your mother was guiding you what did you mean in the doorway rainey and the butler started each threw the other a quick glance of concern why exclaimed the girl impatiently her influence her example what she taught me oh exclaimed the old man he leaned back with an air almost of disappointment when she was alive he said of course answered the girl of course repeated the uncle i thought you meant he looked suspiciously at her and shook his head never mind he added well he went on cynically striving to cover up the embarrassment of the moment your mothers spirit will probably feel as deep an interest in her brother as in her daughter we shall see we shall see which of us two she is going to help he turned to garrett and rainey in the hall take my niece to the door garrett he directed as soon as miss coates had disappeared hallowell turned to rainey his face lit with pleased and childish anticipation well he whispered eagerly is she here rainey nodded and glanced in the direction opposite to the one miss coates had taken shes been waiting half an hour and the professor too bring them at once commanded mr hallowell excitedly and then shut the door and and tell the judge i cant see him tell him im too tired to see him understand rainey peered cautiously over the railing of the stairs to the first floor and then beckoned to some one who apparently was waiting at the end of the hall miss vera sir he announced and professor vance although but lately established in new york the persons dr rainey introduced had already made themselves comparatively wellknown for the last six weeks as headliners at one of the vaudeville theatres and as entertainers at private houses under the firm name of the vances they had been giving an exhibition of code and cipher signaling they called it mind reading during the day at the house of vance and his wife the girl as vera the medium furnished to all comers memories of the past or news of the future in their profession in all of its branches the man and the girl were past masters they knew it from the a b c of the dream book to the postgraduate work of projecting from a cabinet the spirits of the dead as the occasion offered and paid best they were mind readers clairvoyants materializing mediums test mediums from them a pack of cards a crystal globe the lines of the human hand held no secrets they found lost articles cast horoscopes gave advice in affairs of the heart of business and speculation uttered warnings of journeys over seas and against a smoothshaven stranger they even stooped to foretell earthquakes or caused to drop fluttering from the ceiling a letter straight from the himalayas among those who are the gypsies of the cities they were the aristocrats of their calling and to them that calling was as legitimate a business as is to the roadside gypsy the swapping of horses the foreparents of each had followed that same calling and to the children it was commonplace and matteroffact it held no adventure no moral obloquy prof paul vance was a young man of under forty years he looked like a fox he had red eyes alert and cunning a long sharppointed nose a pointed red beard and red eyebrows that slanted upward his hair standing erect in a pompadour and his uplifted eyebrows gave him the watchful look of the fox when he hears suddenly the hound baying in pursuit but no one had ever successfully pursued vance no one had ever driven him into a corner from which either pleasantly or with raging indignation he was not able to free himself seven years before he had disloyally married out of the profession and for no other reason than that he was in love with the woman he married she had come to seek advice from the spirit world in regard to taking a second husband after several visits the spirit world had advised vance to advise her to marry vance she did so and though the man was still in love with his wife he had not found her in his work the assistance he had hoped she might be she still was a believer in the technical vernacular of her husband a dope not even the intimate knowledge she had gained behind the scenes could persuade her that paul her husband was not in constant communication with the spirit world or that if he wished he could not read the thoughts that moved slowly through her pretty head at the time of his marriage the girl vera then a child of fourteen had written to vance for help she was ill without money and asked for work to him she was known as the last of a long line of people who had always been professional mediums and spiritualists and out of charity and from a sense of noblesse oblige to one of the elect of the profession vance had made her his assistant he had never regretted having done so the bread cast upon the waters was returned a thousandfold from the first the girl brought in money and his wife the older of the two had welcomed her as a companion after a fashion the vances had adopted her in the advertisements she was described as their ward vera now was twentyone tall wonderfully graceful and of the most enchanting loveliness her education had been cosmopolitan in the largest cities of america she had met persons of every class young women old women mothers with married sons and daughters women of society as it is exploited in the sunday supplements school girls shop girls factory girls all had told her their troubles and men of every condition had come to scoff and had remained to express more or less offensively their admiration some of the younger of these after a first visit returned the day following and each begged the beautiful priestess of the occult to fly with him to live with him to marry him when this happened vera would touch a button and mannie day who admitted visitors and later in the hall searched their hats and umbrellas for initials came on the run and threw the infatuated one out upon a cold and unfeeling sidewalk so vera had seen both the seamy side of life and in the drawing rooms where vance and she exhibited their mind reading tricks had been made much of by great ladies and for an hour as brief as cinderellas had looked upon a world of kind and wellbred people since she was fourteen for seven years this had been her life a life as open to the public as the life of an actress as easy of access as that of the stenographer in the hotel lobby as a result the girl had encased herself in a defensive armor of hardness and distrust a protection which was rendered futile by the loveliness of her face by the softness of her voice by the deep brooding eyes and the fine forehead on which like a crown rested the black waves of her hair in her work vera accepted without question the parts to which vance assigned her when in their mummeries they were successful she neither enjoyed the credulity of those they had tricked nor was sobered with remorse in the world vance found a certain number of people with money who demanded to be fooled it was his business and hers to meet that demand if ever the conscience of either stirred restlessly vance soothed it by the easy answer that if they did not take the money some one else would it was all in the days work it was her profession as she entered the library of mr hallowell which with vance she already had visited several times she looked like a child masquerading in her mothers finery she suggested an ingenue who had been suddenly sent on in the role of the russian adventuress her slight girls figure was draped in black lace her face was shaded by a large picture hat heavy with drooping ostrich feathers around her shoulders was a necklace of jade and on her wrists many bracelets of silver gilt when she moved they rattled as the girl advanced smiling to greet mr hallowell she suddenly stopped shivered slightly and threw her right arm across her eyes her left arm she stretched over the table give me your hand she commanded dubiously with a watchful glance at vance mr hallowell leaned forward and took her hand you have been ill cried the girl very ill i see you i see you in a kind of faint very lately her voice rose excitedly yes last night mr hallowell protested with indignation you read that in the morning paper he said vera lowered her arm from her eyes and turned them reproachfully on him i dont read the despatch she answered mr hallowell drew back suspiciously i didnt say it was the despatch he returned vance quickly interposed you dont have to say it he explained with glibness you thought it and vera read your thoughts you were thinking of the despatch werent you well there you are its wonderful wonderful nonsense mocked mr hallowell she did read it in the paper or rainey told her the girl shrugged her shoulders patiently if you would rather find out you were ill from the newspapers than from the spirit world she inquired why do you ask me here i ask you here young woman exclaimed hallowell sinking back in his chair because i hoped you would tell me something i cant learn from the newspapers but you havent been able to do it yet my dear young lady exclaimed the old man wistfully i want to believe but i must be convinced no tricks with me i can explain how you might have found out everything you have told me give me a sign he beat the flat of his hand upon the table show me something i cant explain mr hallowell is quite right vera said vance he is entering what is to him a new world full of mysteries and that caution which in this world has made him so successful with an exclamation hallowell cut short the patter of the showman yes yes he interrupted petulantly i tell you i want to believe convince me considering the situation with pursed lips and thoughtful eyes vera gazed at the old man frowning finally she asked have you witnessed out demonstrations of mind reading mr hallowell snorted certainly not he replied its a trick a trick cried the girl indignantly to read a mans mind to see right through your forehead through your skull into your brain is that a trick she turned sharply to vance show him she commanded show him she crossed rapidly to the window and stood looking down into the street with her back to the room vance with his back turned to vera stood close to the table on the other side of which hallowell was reclining in his arm chair vance picked up a pen holder think of what i have in my hand please he said what is this vera he asked the girl gazing from the window at the traffic in the avenue below her answered with indifference a pen holder yes what about it snapped vance gold pen holder vera answered more rapidly much engraving initials s h mr hallowells initials there is a date too can you december vera hesitated go on commanded vance twentyfive one eight eight six one thousand eight hundred and eightysix she moved her shoulders impatiently oh tell him to think of something difficult she said from behind mr hallowells chair rainey signaled to vance to take from the table a photograph frame of silver which held the picture of a woman vance picked it up holding it close to him what have i here vera he asked hallowell seeing what vance held in his hand leaned forward put that down he commanded but vera had already begun to answer a picture a picture of a young woman ask him to think of who it is and i will tell him at the words mr hallowell hesitated frowned and then nodded it is his sister called vera her name was i seem to get a catherine yes thats it catherine coates she is no longer with us she passed into the spirit world three years ago the girl turned suddenly and approached the table holding her head high as though offended how do you explain that trick she demanded mr hallowell moved uneasily in his chair oh the pictures been on my desk each time youve been here he answered dubiously rainey could have told you as a matter of fact i didnt said rainey hallowells eyes lightened with interest didnt you he asked he turned to vera if you can read my mind he challenged you he added pointing at vance keep out of this now tell me of what i am thinking as vance drew back rainey and himself exchanged a quick glance of apprehension but the girl promptly closed her eyes and at once in a dull measured tone began to speak you were thinking you would like to ask a question of some one in the spirit she recited but you are afraid you do not trust me you will wait until i give you a sign then you will ask that question of some one dear to you who has passed beyond and she will answer and your troubles will be at an end she opened her eyes and stared at mr hallowell like one coming out of a dream what did i say she asked was i right hallowell slank back in his chair shaking his head yes he began grudgingly but with an eagerness hardly concealed vance interrupted what is the question you wish to ask he begged with a frown of suspicion hallowell turned from him to rainey i dont think i ought to let them know he questioned do you but his attention was sharply diverted vera in a hushed and solemn voice called for silence my control she explained her tone was deep and awestruck is trying to communicate with me vance gave an exclamation of concern the prospect of the phenomena vera promised seemed to fill him with delightful expectations be very quiet he cautioned do not disturb her deeply impressed mr hallowell struggled from his chair unaided he moved to below the table and leaning against it looked with unwilling but fascinated interest at veras uplifted face some one in the spirit vera chanted in an unemotional drugged voice wishes to speak to mr hallowell give me your hand quick directed vance give her your hand take her hand yes he is here vera continued a woman has a message for you she is standing close beside you she is holding out her arms and she is trying so hard to tell you something what is it the girl questioned oh what is it tell me she begged cant you tell me hallowell eyed her greedily waiting almost without breathing for her words the hand with which he held hers crushed her rings into her fingers what sort whispered the old man what sort of a woman with eyes still closed swaying slightly and with abrupt shudders running down her body the girl continued in dull fateful tones she is a fair woman about fortyfive she is speaking she calls to you brother brother veras voice rose excitedly it is the woman in the picture your sister catherine i see it written above her head catherine in letters of light she turned suddenly and fiercely ask her your question she commanded ask her your question now by the sudden swaying forward of vance and rainey in the intent look in their eyes it was evident that a crisis had approached but mr hallowell terrified and trembling shrank back his voice broke hysterically no no he pleaded both anger and disappointment showed in the face of vance and rainey but the girl as though detached from any human concerns continued unmoved i see another figure she recited a young girl but she is of this world i seem to get an h yes helen in letters of fire my niece helen hallowell whispered hoarsely yes your niece chanted the girl her voice rose and thrilled and i see much gold she cried between the two women heaps of gold everywhere i look i see gold and now the other woman your sister is trying to speak to you listen she calls to you brother so centered was the interest of those in the room so compelling the sound of the girls voice that unnoticed the sliding doors to the library were slipped apart unobserved judge gaylor and winthrop halted in the doorway to the judge the meaning of the scene was instantly apparent his face flushed furiously winthrop uncomprehending gazed unconcerned over gaylors shoulder the voice of vera rose hysterically to her climax she bids me tell you vera cried tell my brother gaylor swept toward her what damned farce is this he shouted the effect of the interruption was instant and startling mr hallowell who in the last few minutes had believed he was listening to a voice from the dead collapsed upon the shoulder of rainey who sprang to support him like a somnambulist wrenched from sleep vera gave a scream of fright half genuine half assumed and swayed as though about to fall vance caught her in his arms he turned on gaylor his cunning red eyes flashing evilly you brute he cried you might have killed her between her sobs vera her head upon the shoulder of vance whispered a question as quickly under cover of muttered sympathy vance answered gaylor the judge still slightly swaying vera stood upright she passed her hand vaguely before her eyes where am i she asked feebly where am i gaylor shook his fist at the girl you know where you are he thundered and you know where youre going youre going to jail in the hush that followed vera drew herself to her full height she regarded gaylor wonderingly haughtily as though he were some drunken intruder from the street are you speaking to me she asked yes to you shouted the lawyer youre an imposter and a swindler and and winthrop pushed between them yes and shes a woman he said briskly if you want a row talk to the man to this point the scene had brought to vera no emotion save the excitement that is felt by the one who is struggling to escape the appearance of a champion added a new interest through no fault of her own she had learned by experience that to the one man who annoyed her there always were six to spring to her protection so the glance she covertly turned upon winthrop was one less of gratitude than curiosity but at the first sight of him the girl started her eyes lit with recognition her face flushed and then although the man was in no way regarding her her eyes filled and in mortification and dismay she blushed crimson his anger still unsatisfied gaylor turned upon vance and you he cried youre going to jail too ill drive the voice of mr hallowell shaken with pain and distress rose feebly beseechingly henry he begged i cant stand it judge gaylor thundered rainey i wont be responsible if you keep this up with an exclamation of remorse vera ran to the side of the old man with rainey on his other hand she raised him upright upon his feet lean on me begged the girl breathlessly im very strong lean on me mr hallowell shook his head no child he protested not you he turned to his old friend you help me henry he begged with the authority of the medical man rainey waved vance into the bedroom close those windows he ordered you help me he commanded of gaylor put your arm under him mr hallowell protesting feebly and leaning heavily upon the two men stumbled into the bedroom and the door was shut behind him for a moment the girl and the man stood in silence and then as though suddenly conscious of her presence winthrop turned and smiled the girl did not answer his smile from under the shadow of the picture hat and the ostrich feathers her eyes regarded him searchingly watchfully for the first time winthrop had the chance to observe her he saw that she was very young that her clothes cruelly disguised her that she was only a child masquerading as a brigand that her face was distractingly lovely having noted this the fact that she had driven several grown men to abuse and vituperation struck him as being extremely humorous nor did he try to conceal his amusement but the watchfulness in the eyes of the girl did not relax im afraid i interfered with your seance said the district attorney the girl regarded him warily like a fencer fixing her eyes on those of her opponent there was a pause which lasted so long that had the silence continued it would have been rude well the girl returned at last timidly thats what the city expects you to do is it not winthrop laughed how did you know who i was he asked and then added quickly of course youre a mind reader for the first time the girl smiled winthrop found it a charming smile wistful and confiding i dont have to ask the spirit world she said to tell me who is district attorney of new york yes said the district attorney yes i suppose you have to be pretty well acquainted with some of the laws those about mediums if you knew as much about other laws began vera as i do about the law she broke off and again smiled upon him then you probably know said winthrop that what our excited friend said to you just now is legally quite true the smile passed from the face of the girl she looked at the young man with fine disdain as a great lady might reprove with a glance the man who snapped a camera at her yes she asked well what are you going to do about it arrest me mocking him in a burlesque of melodrama she held out her arms dont put the handcuffs on me she begged winthrop found her impudence amusing and with the charm of her novelty he was conscious of a growing conviction that somewhere they had met before that already at a crisis she had come into his life i wont arrest you he said with a puzzled smile on one condition ah mocked vera he is generous and the condition is winthrop went on seriously that you tell me where we met before the girls expression became instantly masklike to learn if he suspected where it was that they had met she searched his face quickly she was reassured that of the event he had no real recollection thats rather difficult isnt it she continued lightly when you consider ive been giving exhibitions of mind readings for the last six weeks on broadway and in the homes of people you probably know no winthrop exclaimed eagerly it wasnt in a theatre and it wasnt in a private house it was he shook his head helplessly and looked at her for assistance you dont know do you the girl regarded him steadily how should i she said and then as though decided upon a course of action of the wisdom of which she was uncertain she laughed uneasily but the spirits would know she said i might ask them do cried winthrop delightedly how much would that be as though to reprove his flippancy the girl frowned with a nervous tremor which this time seemed genuine enough she threw back her head closed her eyes and laid her arm across her forehead winthrop unobserved watched her with a smile partly of amusement partly on account of her beauty of admiration i see a court room said the girl it is very mean and bare it is somewhere up the state in a small town outside there are trees and the sun is shining and people are walking in a public park inside in the prisoners dock there is a girl she has been arrested for theft she has pleaded guilty and i see that she has been very ill that she is faint from shame and fear and lack of food and there is a young lawyer he is defending her he is asking the judge to be merciful because this is her first offence because she stole the cloak to get money to take her where she had been promised work because this is his first case winthrop gave a gasp of disbelief you dont mean to tell me he cried hush commanded the girl and he persuades the judge to let her go she continued quickly her voice shaking and he and the girl walk out of the court house together and he talks to her kindly and gives her money to pay her way to the people who have promised her work vera dropped her arm and stepping back faced winthrop through her tears her eyes were flashing proudly gratefully the feeling that shook her made her voice vibrate the girl seemed proud of her tears proud of her debt of gratitude and ive never forgotten you she said her voice eager and trembling and what you did for me and ive watched you come to this city and fight it and fight it until you made them put you where you are she stopped to control her voice and smiled at him and thats why i knew you were district attorney she said and please she fumbled in the mesh purse at her waist and taking a bill from it threw it upon the table and please theres the money i owe you and and i thank you and goodbye she turned and almost ran from him toward the door to the hall stop cried winthrop poised for flight the girl halted and looked back when can i see you again said the man the tone made it less a question than a command in a manner as determined as his own the girl shook her head no she said i must returned the man again the girl shook her head definitely finally it wont help you in your work she pleaded to come to see me i must repeated winthrop simply the eyes of the girl met his appealingly defiantly youll be sorry said the girl winthrop laughed an eager boyish laugh when he spoke the tenseness in his voice had gone his tone was confident bantering then i will not come to see you he said uncertain puzzled vera looked at him in distress she thought he was mocking her no she questioned ill come to see vera the medium he explained vera frowned and then in happy embarrassment smiled wistfully oh well she stammered of course if youre coming to consult me professionally my hours are from four to six ill be there cried the district attorney vera leaned forward eagerly what day will you come she demanded what day exclaimed the young man indignantly why this day vera gave a guilty frightened laugh oh will you she exclaimed delightedly she clasped her fingers in a gesture of dismay oh i hope you wont be sorry she cried for some moments the district attorney of new york stood looking at the door through which she had disappeared part ii the home of the vances was in thirtyfifth street nearly opposite the garrick theatre it was one of a row of oldfashioned brick houses with high steps as the seeker after truth entered the front hall he saw before him the stairs to the second story on his right the folding doors of the front parlor and at the far end of the hall a single door that led to what was in the old days before this row of houses had been converted into offices the family dining room to vera the vances had given the use of this room as a reception parlor the visitor first entered the room on his right from it passed through another pair of folding doors to the reception parlor and then when his audience was at an end departed by the single door to the hall and so to the street the reception parlor bore but little likeness to a cave of mystery there were no shaded lights no stuffed alligator no indian draperies no black cat on a table in the centre under a heavy and hideous chandelier with bronze gas jets was a green velvet cushion on this nestled an innocent ball of crystal beside it lay the ivory knitting needle with which vera pointed out in the hand of the visitor those lines that showed he would be twice married was of an ambitious temperament and would make a success upon the stage in a corner stood a wooden cabinet that resembled a sentry box on wheels it was from this on certain evenings before a select circle of spiritualists that vera projected the ghosts of the departed hanging inside the cabinet was a silvergilt crown and a cloak of black velvet lined with purple silk and covered in gold thread with signs of the zodiac save that these stage properties illustrated the taste of mabel vance the room was of no interest it held a rubber plant a red velvet rocking chair across the back of which mrs vance had draped a neapolitan scarf an upright piano upon which emmanuel day or as he was known to the crossroads of broadway and fortysecond street mannie day provoked the most marvelous ragtime an enlarged photograph in crayon of professor vance in a frock coat and lawn tie a china bull dog coquettishly decorated with a blue bow and on the mantel piece two tall beer steins and a hand telephone from the long windows one obtained a view of the iron shutters of the new department store in thirtyfourth street and of a garden just large enough to contain a sumach tree a refrigerator and the packingcase in which the piano had arrived after leaving winthrop without waiting for vance vera had returned directly to the house in thirtyfifth street and locked herself in her room and although mannie day had already ushered two visitors into the front room vera had not yet come downstairs in consequence mabel vance was in possession of the reception parlor mrs vance was plump pinkandblonde credulous and vulgar but at all times of the utmost good humor her admiration for vera was equaled only by her awe of her on this particular afternoon although it already was after five oclock mrs vance still wore a short dressing sack open at the throat and heavy with somewhat soiled lace but her blonde hair was freshly marcelled and her nails pink and shining in the absence of vera she was making a surreptitious and guilty use of the telephone from the fact that in her left hand she held the morning telegraph open at the previous performances of the horses and that the page had been cruelly lacerated by a hat pin it was fair to suppose that whoever was at the other end of the wire was tempting her with the closing odds at the races in her speculations she was interrupted by mannie day who entered softy through the door from the hall mannie day was a youth of twentyfour it was his hearts desire to be a broadwayard he wanted to know all of those and to be known only by those who moved between the giant pillars that new york threw into the sky to mark her progress north he knew the soiled white way as the oldest inhabitant knows the single street of the village he knew it from the rathskellers underground to the roof gardens in the sky in his firmament the stars were the electric advertisements over long acre square his mother earth was asphalt the breath of his nostrils gasolene the telegraph was his bible his grief was that no one in the tenderloin would take him seriously would believe him wicked wise predatory they might love him they might laugh with him they might clamor for his company in no flat that could boast a piano was he not on his entrance greeted with a shout but the real knights of the highway treated him always as the questioning wideeyed child in spite of his aftermidnight pallor in spite of his honorable scars of dissipation it was his misfortune to be cursed with a smile that was a perpetual plea of not guilty what can you expect an outspoken friend who made a living as a wireless wire tapper had once pointed out to him that smile of yours could open a safe it could make a show girl give up money its an alibi for everything from overspeeding to murder mannie as he listened flushed with mortification from that moment he determined that his life should be devoted to giving the lie to that smile to that outward and visible sign of kindness good will and innate innocence as yet he had not succeeded he interrupted mabel at the telephone to inquire the whereabouts of vera theres two girls in there now he said waiting to have their fortunes doped letem wait exclaimed mabel veras upstairs dressing in her eyes was the baleful glare of the plunger what was that you give me in the third race at the first touch of the ruling passion what interest mannie may have felt for the impatient visitors vanished not in the third he corrected briskly keene entry win the third mabel appealed breathlessly to the telephone what price the keene entry in the third she turned to mannie with reproachful eyes even money she complained thats what i told you retorted mannie he lowered his voice and gazed apprehensively toward the front parlor if you want a really good thing he whispered hoarsely ask joe what pompadour is in the fifth mabel laughed scornfully disappointedly pompadour she mocked thats right cried the expert thats the one daily hint from paris today joe will give you thirty to one upon the defenseless woman he turned the full force of his accursed smile put five on for me mabel he begged with unexpected determination of character mabel declared sharply that she would do nothing of the sort two then entreated the boy where demanded mabel unfeelingly is the twenty you owe me now the abruptness of this unsportsmanlike blow below the belt caused mannie to wince how do i know where it is he protested as long as you havent got it why do you care where it is he heard the door from the hall open and turning saw vera he appealed to her vera he cried youll loan me two dollars i stand to win sixty ill give you thirty vera looked inquiringly at mabel what is it mabel she asked a hand book mrs vance nodded guiltily mannie exclaimed vera gently but reproachfully i told you i wouldnt loan you any more money till you paid mabel what youve borrowed how can i pay mabel what i borrowed demanded mannie if i cant borrow the money from you to pay her only two dollars vera vera nodded to mabel mabel at the phone called two dollars on pompadour to win for mannie day and rang off that makes thirty for you exclaimed mannie enthusiastically and twenty i owe to mabel and that leaves me ten mrs vance no longer occupied in the whirlpool of speculation for the first time observed that vera had changed her matronly robe of black lace for a short white skirt and a white shirtwaist she noted also that there was a change in veras face and manner she gave an impression of nervous eagerness of unrest her smile seemed more appealing wistful girlish she looked like a child of fourteen but mabel was concerned more especially with the robe of virgin white for the month which was july the costume was appropriate but in the opinion of mabel in no way suited to the priestess of the occult and the mysterious why vera exclaimed mrs vance whatever have you got on aint you going to receive visitors theres ten dollars waiting in there now in sudden apprehension vera looked down at her spotless garments dont i look nice she begged of course you look nice dearie mabel assured her but you dont look like no fortune teller if you want to know what you look like said mannie sternly you look like one of the waiter girls at childss thats what you look like and your crown exclaimed mabel and your kimono aint you going to wear your kimono she hastened to the cabinet and produced the cloak of black velvet and spangles and the silvergilt crown no i am not declared vera she wore the frightened look of a mutinous child i i look so foolish in them such heresy caused mannie to gasp aloud you look grand in them he protested dont she mabel sure she does assented that lady and your junk demanded mannie referring to the jade necklace and the goldplated bracelets his eyes opened in sympathy you havent pawned them have you pawned them laughed vera i couldnt get anything on them as the only masculine point of view available she appealed to mannie wistfully dont you like me better this way mannie she begged but that critic protested violently not a bit like it he cried now in the gold tiara and the spangled opera cloak he differentiated you look like a picture postal card you got lotta fausts blue skirt back to leveys but not in the white goods he shook his head sadly firmly you look now like you was made up for a mayday picnic in the bronx and theyd picked on you to be queen of the may mabel carried the muchadmired opera cloak to vera and held it out tempting her youll wear it just to please me and mannie wont you dearie she begged vera retreated before it as though it held the germs of contagion i will not she rebelled i hate it when i have that on i feel mean i feel as mean as though i were picking pennies out of a blind mans hat mannie roared with delight gee he shouted but thats a hot one besides said vera consciously im im expecting some one the manner more than the words thrilled mabel with the most joyful expectations she exclaimed excitedly a gentleman friend vera she asked that vera shunned all young men had been to mabel a source of wonder and of pride even when the young men were the friends of her husband and of herself the preoccupied manner with which vera received them did not provoke in mabel any resentment it rather increased her approbation although horrified at the recklessness of the girl she had approved even when vera rejected an offer of marriage from a wine agent secretly for a proper alliance for her mabel read the society columns in search of eligible rich young men finding that they invariably married eligible rich young women she had lately determined that veras destiny must be an english duke still if as she hoped vera had chosen for herself mabel felt assured that the man would prove worthy and a good match a good match meant one who owned not only a runabout but a touring car its a man from home said vera home queried mannie from up the state explained vera from geneva its mr winthrop with an exclamation of alarm mannie started upright winthrop he cried then with a laugh of relief he sank back gee you give me a scare he cried i thought you meant the district attorney mabel laughed sympathetically i thought so too she admitted i do mean the district attorney said the girl vera cried mabel winthrop coming here demanded mannie i met him at mr hallowells this morning said vera didnt paul tell you paul aint back yet said mannie i wish he was his lower jaw dropped in dazed bewilderment winthrop coming here he repeated and theyre all coming here he exclaimed excitedly paul just phoned me theyve taken gaylor in with them and were all working together now on some game for tonight and winthrops coming here he shook his head decidedly importantly as the only man of the family present he felt he must meet this crisis paul wont stand for it he declared well paul will just have to stand for it retorted mrs vance with a murmur of sympathy she crossed to vera im not going to see our vera disappointed she announced she never sees no company vera if mr winthrop comes when that bunch is here ill show him into the front parlor vera sat down in front of the piano and let her fingers drop upon the keys the look of eagerness and anticipation had left her eyes oh i dont know she said that i want to see him now with complete misunderstanding mannie demanded truculently why not his loyalty to vera gave him courage in her behalf to face even a district attorney he doesnt think hes coming here to make trouble for you does he vera shook her head and bending over the piano struck a few detached chords oh no she said consciously just to see me professionally like everybody else mabel could no longer withhold her indignation at the obtuseness of the masculine intellect my gracious mannie she exclaimed cant you understand hes coming here to make a call on vera like a gentleman not like no district attorney mannie precipitately retreated from his position as champion sure i understand he protested with the joy that a matchmaking mother takes in the hunt mabel sank into the plush rocking chair and rocking violently turned upon vera an eager and excited smile think of our vera knowing mr winthrop socially she exclaimed its grand and they say his sisters are elegant ladies last winter i read about them at the opera and it always printed what they had on why didnt you tell me you knowed him vera she cried reproachfully i tell you everything i dont know him protested the girl i used to see him when he lived in the same town mabel inviting further confidences ceased rocking and nodded encouragingly up in geneva she prompted yes said vera i used to see him every afternoon then when he played ball on the college nine who demanded mannie incredulously winthrop said vera did he exclaimed mannie his tone suggested that he might still be persuaded that there was good in the man whatd he play he demanded suspiciously first said vera did he exclaimed mannie his tone now was of open approbation vera had raised her eyes and turned them toward the windows beyond the sootstained sumach tree the fire escapes of the department store she saw the sundrenched campus the buttressed chapel the ancient drooping elms and on a canvas bag poised like a winged mercury a tall straight figure in gray dusty flannels he was awfully goodlooking murmured the girl and awfully tall he could stop a ball as high as that she raised her arm in the air and then suddenly conscious flushed and turned to the piano go on tell us urged mabel so you first met him in geneva did you no corrected vera saw him there i only met him once mannie interrupted hilariously i only saw him once too he cried that was enough for me vera swiftly spun the piano stool so that she faced him her eyes were filled with concern you mannie she demanded anxiously what had you done done exclaimed mannie indignantly nothing whatd you think id done did you think i was a crook vera bowed her shoulders and shivered as though the boy had cursed at her she shook her head vehemently and again swung back to the piano stumbling awkwardly her fingers ran over the keys in a swift clatter of broken chords no she whispered no mannie no with a laugh of delighted recollection mannie turned to mabel he raided a poolroom i was working at he explained he picked me out as a sheet writer because i had my coat off see i told him i had it off because it was too hot for me and he says young man if you lie to me ill make i a damn sight hotter mannie threw back his head and shouted uproariously hes all right winthrop he declared mabel having already married winthrop to vera in grace church with herself in the front pew in a blue silk dress received this unexpected evidence of his rare wit with delight in ecstasy of appreciation she slapped her knees did he say that mannie she cried wasnt that quick of him did you hear what he said to mannie vera she demanded their mirth was interrupted by the opening and closing of the front door and in the hall the murmur of mens voices vance opened the door from the hall and entered followed by judge gaylor and rainey with evident pride in her appearance vance introduced the two men to his wife and then sent her and mannie from the room the latter with orders to dismiss the visitors in the front parlor and to admit no others at the door mrs vance turned to vera and nodded mysteriously if that party calls she said with significance ill put him in the front parlor with a look of dismay vera vehemently shook her head but to forestall any opposition mrs vance hastily slammed the door behind her in his most courteous manner judge gaylor offered the chair at the head of the centre table to vera and at the same table seated himself vance took a place on the piano stool rainey stood with his back to the mantel piece miss vera gaylor began impressively i desire to apologize for my language this morning as rainey no doubt has told you i have opposed you and professor vance but i i know when im beaten your influence with mr hallowell today is greater than mine it is paramount i congratulate you he smiled ingratiatingly and now he added we are all working in unison youve given up your idea of sending me to jail said vera vera exclaimed vance reprovingly judge gaylor has apologized were all in harmony now is that door locked asked gaylor vance told him save mrs vance mannie and themselves there was none in the house and that he might speak freely miss vera began the judge we left mr hallowell very much impressed with the message you gave him this morning the message from his dead sister he wants another message from her he wants her to decide how he shall dispose of a very large sum of money his entire fortune his entire fortune exclaimed vera do you imagine she asked that mr hallowell will take advice from the spirit world about that i dont i do gaylor answered stoutly i know i would you asked vera incredulously if i could believe my sister came from the dead to tell me what to do said the lawyer of course id do it id be afraid not to but i dont believe he does and he believes you can bring his sister herself before him he insists that tonight you hold a seance in his house and that you materialize the spirit of his dead sister so that he can see his sister and talk with his sister vance says you can do that can you from veras face the look of girlishness of happy anticipation had already disappeared it is my business to do that the girl answered she turned to vance and in a matteroffact voice inquired what does his sister look like that photograph we used this morning no vance answered ive a better one rainey gave me taken when she was older has white hair and a cap and a kerchief crossed so he drew his hands across his shoulders rainey show miss vera that picture not now gaylor commanded the important thing now is that miss vera understands the message mr hallowell is to receive from his sister the two other men nodded quickly in assent gaylor turned to vera he spoke slowly earnestly miss vera he said mr hallowells present will leaves his fortune to his niece he has made another will which he has not signed leaving his fortune to the hallowell institute he will ask his sister to which of these he should leave his money you will tell him he corrected himself instantly she will tell him to give it where it will be of the greatest good to the most people to the institute there was a pause do you understand he asked to the institute not to the niece vera answered gaylor nodded gravely what asked vera are the fewest words in which that message could be delivered i mean should she say you are to endow the hallowell institute or brother you are to give sign the new will with satisfaction the girl gave a sharp shake of her head and nodded to vance destroy the old will sign the new will that is the best she said thats it exactly gaylor exclaimed eagerly thats excellent then his face clouded i think he said in a troubled voice we should warn miss vera that to guard himself from any trickery mr hallowell insists on subjecting her to the most severe tests he that will be all right said the girl she turned to vance and in a lower tone but without interest asked what for instance vance merely laughed and shrugged his shoulders the girl smiled nettled and alarmed at what appeared to be their overconfidence gaylor objected warmly thats all very well he cried but for instance he insists that the entire time you are in the cabinet you hold a handful of flour in one hand and of shot in the other he illustrated with clenched fists which makes it impossible he protested for you to use your hands the face of the girl showed complete indifference not necessarily she said but you are to be tied hand and foot cried the judge and on top of that he burst forth indignantly pointing aggrievedly at vance he himself proposed this flourandshot test it was silly senseless bravado not necessarily repeated the girl he knew that i invented it rainey laughed gaylor gave an exclamation of enlightenment if it will be of any comfort to you judge said vance ill tell you one thing every test that ever was put to a medium was invented by a medium vera rose if there is nothing more she said i will go and get the things ready for this evening destroy the old will sign the new will she repeated she turned suddenly to vance her brow drawn in consideration i suppose by this new will she asked the girl gets nothing not at all exclaimed gaylor emphatically we dont want her to fight the will she gets a million a million dollars demanded vera for an instant as though trying to grasp the possibilities of such a sum she stood staring ahead of her with doubt in her eyes and shaking her head she turned to vance how can one woman spend a million dollars she protested well you see we dont intend to starve her exclaimed gaylor eagerly and at the same time the institute will be benefiting all humanity doing good to vera interrupted him with a sharp peremptory movement of the hand we wont go into that please she begged the judge inclined his head i only meant to point out he said stiffly that you are giving mr hallowell the best advice and doing great good for a moment the girl looked at him steadily on her lips was a faint smile of disdain but whether for him or for herself the judge could not determine i dont know that the girl said finally i dont ask she turned to rainey have you that photograph he gave her a photograph and after for an instant studying it in silence she returned it to him it will be quite easy she said to vance she walked to the door and instinctively the two men who were seated rose i will see you tonight at mr hallowells she said and with a nod left them well exclaimed rainey you didnt tell her i knowvance answered i decided wed be wiser to take advice from my wife she understands vera better than i do he opened the door to the hall and called mannie tell mabel oh mabel he corrected come here a minute he returned to his seat on the piano stool she can tell us he said in expectation of the arrival of winthrop mrs vance had arrayed herself in a light blue frock and as though she had just come in from the street in such a hat as she considered would do credit not only to vera but to herself mabel her husband began were up against a hard proposition hallowell insists that winthrop and miss coates must come to the seance tonight winthrop and miss coates cried mabel in astonishment she glanced from her husband to rainey and gaylor then its all off she exclaimed thats what i say growled rainey we want you to tell us continued vance unmoved whether vera should know that now or wait until tonight paul vance almost shrieked his wife do you mean to tell me youre thinking of giving a materialization in front of the district attorney youre crazy thats what i tell them chorused rainey gaylor raised his hand for silence no mrs vance he said wearily we are not crazy but he added bitterly we cant help ourselves you mediums have got mr hallowell in such a state that hell only do what his sisters spirit tells him he says if hes robbing his niece his sister will tell him so if hes to give the money to the institute his sister will tell him that he says if vance is fair and aboveboard he shouldnt be afraid to have his niece and any friends of hers present we cant help ourselves i helped a little said vance by insisting on having our own friends there told him the spirit could not materialize unless there were believers present did he stand for that asked mabel glad to have them her husband assured her they like to think there are others as foolish as they are and im going to place mr district attorney he broke out suddenly and fiercely between two mediums theyll hold his hands already frightened by the possible result of the plot rainey with a vehemence born of fear retorted sharply hold his hands howre you going to make him hold his tongue afterward gaylor turned upon him savagely my god man he cried were not trying to persuade the district attorney that hes seen a ghost if your friends can persuade stephen hallowell that hes seen one the district attorney can go to the devil well he wont returned rainey hell go to law let him cried gaylor defiantly get hallowell to sign that will and ill go into court with him his bravado was suddenly attacked from an unexpected source youll go into court with him all right declared mrs vance all of you and if you dont want him to catch you she cried youll clear out now hes coming here any minute whos coming here demanded her husband winthrop returned his wife to see vera to see vera cried vance eagerly what about about this morning no protested mabel to call on her hes an old friend in alarm rainey pushed into the group of now thoroughly excited people dont you believe it he cried if hes coming here hes coming to give her the third degree the door from the hall suddenly opened was as suddenly closed and mannie slipped into the room one hand he held up for silence with the other he pointed at the folding doors hush he warned them hes in there he says hes come to call on vera she says hes come professionally and i must bring him in here ive shut the door into the parlor and you can slip upstairs without his seeing you upstairs gasped rainey not for me he appealed to gaylor in accents of real alarm we must get away from this house he declared if he finds us here with a gesture of dismay he tossed his hands in the air gaylor nodded in silence all save mannie moved into the hall and halted between the outer and inner doors of the vestibule gaylor turned to vance are you going to tell her he asked that he is to be there tonight hell tell her himself now no corrected rainey he doesnt know yet theres to be a seance hallowell was writing the note when he left then instructed gaylor do not let her know until she arrives until it will be too late for her to back out vance nodded and waiting until from the back room he heard the voices of mannie and winthrop he opened the front door and the two men ran down the steps into the street while the conspirators were hidden in the vestibule mannie had opened the folding doors and invited winthrop to enter the reception parlor miss vera will be down in a minute he said if you want your hand read he added pointing you sit over there as winthrop approached the centre table mannie backed against the piano the presence of the district attorney at such short range aroused in him many emotions alternately he was torn with alarm with admiration with curiosity he regarded him apprehensively with a nervous and unhappy smile about the smile there was something that winthrop found familiar and with one almost as attractive he answered it i think weve met before havent we he asked pleasantly mannie nodded yes sir he answered promptly at sam hepners old place on west fortyfourth street why of course exclaimed the district attorney dont you dont you remember stammered mannie eagerly he was deeply concerned lest the distinguished crossexaminer should think that from him of his lurid past he could withhold anything i had my coat off and you said youd make it hot for me did i asked winthrop with an effort at recollection no you didnt mannie hastened to reassure him i mean you didnt make it hot for me winthrop laughed and seated himself comfortably beside the centre table well im glad of that he said so our relations are still pleasant then he asked sure exclaimed mannie heartily i mean yes sir winthrop mechanically reached for his cigarette case and then recollecting withdrew his hand and how are the ponies running he asked the interview was filling mannie with excitement and delight he chuckled with pleasure his fear of the great man was rapidly departing could this he asked himself be the terror to evildoers the man whose cruel questions drove witnesses to tears whose third degree sent veterans of the underworld staggering from his confessional box limp and gasping oh pretty well said the boy seems as if i couldnt keep away from them i got a good thing for today pompadour in the fifth i put all the money on her i could get together he announced importantly and then added frankly with a laugh two dollars the laugh was contagious and the district attorney laughed with him pompadour winthrop objected shes one of those winter track favorites i know but today declared mannie she win sure carried away by his enthusiasm and by the sympathy of his audience he rushed unheeding to his fate if youd like to put a little on he said i can tell you where you can do it the district attorney stared and laughed you mustnt tell me where you can do it he said mannie gave a terrified gasp and for an instant clapped his hands over his lips thats right he cried gee thats right im such a crank on all kinds of sport that i clean forgot he gazed at the muchdreaded district attorney with the awe of the newborn heroworshipper i guess you are too hey he protested admiringly vera was telling me you used to be a great ball tosser in the face of the district attorney there came a sudden interest his eyes lightened how did she she used to watch you in geneva said mannie playing with the college lads i i he added consciously was a ball player myself once used to pitch for the interstate league he stopped abruptly interstate said winthrop encouragingly you must have been good the enthusiasm had departed from the face of the boy yes he said but he smiled shamefacedly but i got taking coke and they he finished with a dramatic gesture of the hand as of a man tossing away a cigarette cocaine said the district attorney the boy nodded and for an instant the two men eyed each other the boy smiling ruefully the district attorney shook his head my young friend he said you can never beat that game mannie stared at him his eyes filled with surprise dont you suppose he said simply that i know that better than you do with a boys pride in his own incorrigibility he went on boastingly oh yes he said i used to be awful bad cocaine and all kinds of dope and cigarettes and whiskey i was nearly all in with morphine it was then till she took hold of me and stopped me she said winthrop vera said mannie she made me stop i had to stop she started taking it herself what cried winthrop oh exclaimed mannie hastily i dont mean what you mean i mean she started taking it to make me stop she says to me mannie youre killing yourself and you got to quit it and if you dont every time you take a grain ill take two and she did id come home and shed see what id been doing and shed up with her sleeves and in horrible pantomime the boy lifted the cuff of his shirt and pressed his right thumb against the wrist of his other arm at the memory of it he gave a shiver and with a blow roughly struck the cuff into place god he muttered i couldnt stand it i begged and begged her not i cried i used to get down in this room on my knees and each time shed get whiter and black under the eyes and and i had to stop didnt i winthrop moved his head and now cried the boy with a happy laugh im all right he appealed to the older man eagerly wistfully dont you think im looking better than i did the last time you saw me again without venturing to speak winthrop nodded mannie smiled with pride everybody tells me so he said well she did it thats what she did for me and i can tell you he said simply sincerely there aint anything i wouldnt do for her i guess thats right hey he added the eyes of the cruel crossexaminer veiled under halfclosed lids were regarding the boy with so curious an expression that under their scrutiny mannie in embarrassment moved uneasily i guess thats right he repeated to his surprise the district attorney rose from his comfortable position and leaning across the table held out his hand mannie took it awkwardly thats all right he said sure its all right said the district attorney from the hall there was the sound of light quick steps and mannie happy to escape from a situation he did not understand ran to the door shes coming he said he opened the door and as vera entered he slipped past her and closed it behind him vera walked directly to the chair at the top of the centre table she was nervous and she was conscious that that fact was evident to avoid shaking hands with her visitor she carried her own clasped in front of her with the fingers interlaced she tried to speak in her usual suave professional tone how do you do she said but winthrop would not be denied with a smile that showed his pleasure at again seeing her he advanced eagerly with his hand outstretched how are you he exclaimed arent you going to shake hands with me he demanded with an old friend vera gave him her hand quickly and then seating herself at the table picked up the ivory pointer i didnt know you were coming as an old friend she murmured embarrassedly you said you were coming to consult vera the medium but you said that was the only way i could come protested winthrop dont you remember you said vera interrupted him she spoke distantly formally what kind of a reading do you want she asked a hand reading or a crystal reading winthrop leaned forward in his chair frankly smiling at her he made no attempt to conceal the pleasure the sight of her gave him his manner was that of a very old and dear friend who for the first time had met her after a separation of years dont want any kind of a reading he declared i want a talking you dont seem to understand he objected that i am making an afternoon call his good humor was unassailable looking up with a perplexed frown vera met his eyes and saw that he was laughing at her she threw the ivory pointer down and leaning back in her chair smiled at him i dont believe she said doubtfully that i know much about afternoon calls what would i do if we were on fifth avenue would i give you tea she asked because she added hastily there isnt any tea in that case it is not etiquette to offer any said winthrop gravely then said vera im doing it right so far they both laughed vera because she still was in awe of him and winthrop because he was happy youre doing it charmingly winthrop assured her good exclaimed vera well now she inquired now we talk dont we yes assented winthrop promptly we talk about you no i i dont think we do declared vera in haste i think we talk about geneva she turned to him with real interest is the town much changed she asked as though preparing for a long talk winthrop dropped his hat to the floor and settled himself comfortably well it is and it isnt he answered havent you been back lately he asked vera looked quickly away from him i have never been back she answered there was a pause and when she again turned her eyes to his she was smiling but i always take the geneva times she said and i often read that youve been there youre a great man in geneva winthrop nodded gravely whenever i want to be a great man he said i go to geneva why yes exclaimed vera last june you delivered the oration to the graduating class she laughed on the college man in politics such an original subject and did you point to yourself she asked mockingly as the the bright example no protested winthrop i knew theyd see that much to her relief vera found that of winthrop she was no longer afraid oh she protested didnt you say twelve years ago a humble boy played ball for hobart college that boy now stands before you didnt you say that something like thatassented the district attorney oh he exclaimed that young man who showed me in here your confederate or fellowconspirator or lookout man or whatever he is told me you used to be a regular attendant at those games i never missed one vera cried she leaned forward her eyes shining her brows knit with the effort of recollection i used to tell aunt she said i had to drive in for the mail but that was only an excuse aunt had an old buggy and an old white horse called roscoe conkling i called him rocks he was blind in one eye and he would walk on the wrong side of the road you had to drive him on one rein the girl was speaking rapidly eagerly she had lost all fear of her visitor with satisfaction winthrop recognized this and unconsciously he was now frankly regarding the face of the girl with a smile of pleasure and admiration and i used to tie him to the fence just opposite first base vera went on excitedly and shout for you dont tell me interrupted winthrop in burlesque excitement that you were that very pretty little girl with short dresses and long legs who used to sit on the top rail and kick and cheer vera shook her head sternly i was she said but you never saw me oh yes we did protested winthrop we used to call you our mascot no that was some other little girl said vera firmly you never looked at me and i she laughed and then frowned at him reproachfully i thought you were magnificent i used to have your pictures in baseball clothes pinned all around my looking glass and whenever you made a base hit id shout and shout and youd never look at me and one day she stopped and as though appalled by the memory clasped her hands oh it was awful she exclaimed one day a foul ball hit the fence and i jumped down and threw it to you and you said thank you sis and i she cried thought i was a young lady oh i couldnt have said that protested winthrop maybe i said sister no declared vera energetically shaking her head not sister sis and you never did look at me and i used to drive past your house every day we lived only a mile below you where asked winthrop on the lake road from syracuse said vera dont you remember the farm a mile below yours the one with the red barn right on the road yes you do she insisted the cows were always looking over the fence right into the road of course exclaimed winthrop delightedly was that your house oh no protested vera ours was the little cottage on the other side with poplars round it demanded winthrop thats it cried vera triumphantly with poplars round it why i know that house well we boys used to call it the haunted house thats the one assented vera she smiled with satisfaction well thats where i lived until aunt died she said and then what asked winthrop for a moment the girl did not answer her face had grown grave and she sat motionless staring beyond her suddenly as though casting her thoughts from her she gave a sharp toss of her head then she said speaking quickly i went into the mills and was ill there and i wrote paul and mabel to ask if i could join them and they said i could but i was too ill and i had no money nothing and then she raised her eyes to his and regarded him steadily then i stole that cloak to get the money to join them and you you helped me to get away and and winthrop broke in hastily he disregarded both her manner and the nature of what she had said and how did you come to know the vances he asked after a pause of an instant the girl accepted the cue his manner gave her and answered as before through my aunt she said she was a medium too of course cried winthrop i remember now thats why we called it the haunted house my aunt said the girl regarding him steadily and with in her manner a certain defiance was a great medium all the spiritualists in that part of the state used to meet at our house ive witnessed some wonderful manifestations in that front parlor she turned to winthrop and smiled so you see she exclaimed i was born and brought up in this business i am the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter my grandmother was a medium my mother was a medium she worked with the fox sisters before they were exposed but my aunt she added thoughtfully judicially was the greatest medium i have ever seen she did certain things i couldnt understand and i know every trick in the trade unless she explained you believe the spirits helped her winthrop was observing the girl intently with a new interest and you dont believe that he asked quietly how can i vera said i was brought up with them she shook her head and smiled i used to play around the kitchen stove with pocahontas and alexander the great and martin luther lived in our china closet you see the neighbors wouldnt let their children come to our house so the only playmates i had were ghosts she laughed wistfully my she exclaimed i was a queer lonely little rat i used to hear voices and see visions i do still she added with her elbows on the arms of her chair she clasped her hands under her chin and leaned forward she turned her eyes to winthrop and nodded confidentially do you know she said sometimes i think people from the other world do speak to me but you said winthrop objected you didnt believe i know returned vera i cant her voice was perplexed impatient why i can sit in this chair she declared earnestly and fill this room with spirit voices and rappings and you sitting right there cant see how i do it and yet inspite of all the tricks sometimes i believe theres something in it she looked at winthrop her eyes open with inquiry he shook his head yes insisted the girl when these women come to me for advice i dont invent what i say to them its as though something told me what to say i have never met them before but as soon as i pass into the trance state i seem to know all their troubles and i seem to be half in this world and half in another world carrying messages between them maybe her voice had sunk to almost a whisper she continued as though speaking to herself i only think that i dont know i wonder there was a long pause i wish began winthrop earnestly i wish you were younger or i were older why asked vera because said the young man id like to talk to you like a father vera turned and smiled on him securely with frank friendliness go ahead she assented talk to me like a father winthrop smiled back at her and then frowned you shouldnt be in this business he said the girl regarded him steadily whats the matter with the business she asked winthrop felt she had put him upon the defensive but he did not hesitate well he said there may be some truth in it but we dont know that we do know that theres a lot of fraud and deceit in it now he declared warmly theres nothing deceitful about you youre fine he cried enthusiastically youre big that boy who was in here told me one story about you that showed vera stopped him sharply what do you know of me she asked bitterly the first time you ever saw me i was in a police court and this morning you heard that man threaten to put me in jail in turn by abruptly rising from his chair winthrop interrupted her he pushed the chair out of his way and shoving his hands into his trousers pockets began pacing with long quick strides up and down the room what do i care for that he cried contemptuously he tossed the words at her over his shoulder i put lots of people in jail myself that are better than i am only they wont play the game he halted and turned on her now youre not playing the game this is a mean business taking money from silly girls and old men youre too good for that he halted at the table and stood facing her ive got two sisters uptown he said he spoke commandingly peremptorily and tomorrow i am going to take you to see them and we fellow townsmen he smiled at her appealingly will talk this over and well make you come back to your own people for a moment the two regarded each other then the girl answered firmly but with a slight hoarseness in her voice and in a tone hardly louder than a whisper you know i cant do that i dont blustered winthrop why not because said the girl steadily of what i did in geneva as though the answer was the one he had feared the man exclaimed sharply rebelliously nonsense he cried you didnt know what you were doing no decent person would consider that they do said the girl they are the very ones who do and its been in the papers everybody in geneva knows it and here too and whenever i try to get away from this she stretched out her hands to include the room about her someone tells five times now she leaned forward appealingly not as though asking pity for herself but as wishing him to see her point of view i didnt choose this business she protested i was sort of born in it and she broke out loyally i hate to have you call it a mean business but i cant get into any other whenever i have some man says that girl in your front office is a thief the restraint she put upon herself the air of disdain which at all times she had found the most convenient defense fell from her its not fair she cried its not fair to her mortification the tears of selfpity sprang to her eyes and as she fiercely tried to brush them away to her greater anger continued to creep down her cheeks it was nine years ago she protested i was a child ive been punished enough she raised her face frankly to his speaking swiftly bitterly of course i want to get away she cried of course i want friends ive never had a friend ive always been alone im tired tired i hate this business i never know how much i hate it until the chance comes to get away and i cant she stopped but without lowering her head or moving her eyes from his this time said the man quietly youre going to get away from it i cant repeated the girl you cant help me winthrop smiled at her confidently im going to try he said no please begged the girl her voice was still shaken with tears she motioned with her head toward the room behind her these are my people she declared defiantly as though daring him to contradict her and they are good people theyve tried to be good friends to me and theyve been true to me winthrop came toward her and stood beside her so close that he could have placed his hand upon her shoulder he wondered whimsically if she knew how cruel she seemed in appealing with her tears her helplessness and loveliness to what was generous and chivalric in him and at the same time by her words treating him as an interloper and an enemy thats all right he said gently but that doesnt prevent my being a good friend to you too does it or he added his voice growing tense and conscious my being true to you my sisters will be here tomorrow he announced briskly vera had wearily dropped her arms upon the table and lowered her head upon them from a place down in the depths she murmured a protest no contradicted winthrop cheerfully this time you are going to win youll have back of you if i do say it two of the best women god ever made only now you must do as i say there was a pause will you he begged vera raised her head slowly holding her hand across her eyes there was a longer silence and then she looked up at him and smiled pathetically gratefully and nodded good cried winthrop no more spooks he laughed no more spirit rappings through her tears vera smiled up at him a wan broken smile she gave a shudder of distaste never she whispered i promise their eyes met the girls looking into his shyly gratefully the mans searching hers eagerly and suddenly they saw each other with a new and wonderful sympathy and understanding winthrop felt himself bending toward her he was conscious that the room had grown dark and that he could see only her eyes you must be just yourself he commanded but so gently so tenderly that though he did not know it each word carried with it the touch of a caress just your sweet fine noble self something he read in the girls uplifted eyes made him draw back with a shock of wonder of delight with an upbraiding conscience to pull himself together he glanced quickly about him the day had really grown dark he felt a sudden desire to get away to go where he could ask himself what had happened what it was that had filled this unknown tawdry room with beauty and given it the happiness of a home by jove he exclaimed nervously i had no idea id stayed so long youll not let me come again goodbye until tomorrow he turned holding out his hand and found that again the girl had dropped her face upon her arm and was sobbing quietly gently oh what is it cried winthrop what have i said the catch in the girls voice as she tried to check the sobs wrenched his heart oh please he begged ive said something wrong ive hurt you with her face still hidden in her arms the girl shook her head no no she sobbed her voice soft with tears was a melody of sweet and tender tones its only that ive been so lonely and youve made me happy happy the sobs broke out afresh but winthrop now knowing that they brought to the girl peace was no longer filled with dismay her head was bent upon her left arm her right hand lightly clasped the edge of the table with the intention of saying farewell winthrop took her hand in his the girl did not move to his presence she seemed utterly oblivious in the gathering dusk he could see the bent figure could hear the soft irregular breathing as the girl wept gently happily like a child sobbing itself to sleep the hand he held in his neither repelled nor invited and for an instant he stood motionless holding it uncertainly it was so delicate so helpless so appealing so altogether lovable it seemed to reach up and with warm clinging fingers clutch the tendrils of his heart winthrop bent his head suddenly and lifting the hand kissed it and then without again speaking walked quickly into the hall and shut the door in the room the dusk deepened through the open windows came the roar of the sixth avenue elevated the insistent clamor of an electric hansom the murmur of broadway at night the tears had suddenly ceased but the girl had not moved at last slowly stiffly she raised her head her eyes filled with wonder with amazement were fixed upon her hand she glanced cautiously about her assured she was alone with her other hand she lifted the one winthrop had kissed and held it pressed against her lips the folding doors were thrown open letting in a flood of light and mabel vance entering swiftly knelt at the table and bent her head close to vera that womans in the hall she whispered that niece of hallowells paul and mannie cant get rid of her now shes got hold of winthrop she says she will see you be careful vera rose that mabel might not see she had been weeping she walked to the piano covertly drying her eyes what she asked dully does she want with me about tonight answered mabel she exclaimed fiercely i told them thered be trouble with vance upon her heels helen coates came in quickly from the hall her face was flushed her eyes lit with indignation and excitement in her hand she held an open letter as though to protect vera both vance and his wife moved between her and their visitor but disregarding them miss coates at once singled out the girl as her opponent you are the young woman they call vera i believe she said i have a note here from mr hallowell telling me you are giving a seance tonight at his house that you propose to exhibit the spirit of my mother that is an insult to the memory of my mother and to me and i warn you if you attempt such a thing i will prevent it there was a pause when vera spoke it was in the tone of everyday politeness her voice was even and steady you have been misinformed she said there will be no seance tonight vance turned to vera and in a voice lower than her own but sufficiently loud to include miss coates said i dont think we told you that mr hallowell himself insists that this lady and her friends be present her presence makes no difference said vera quietly there will be no seance tonight i will tell you about it later paul she added she started toward the door but miss coates moved as though to intercept her if you think she cried eagerly you can give a seance to mr hallowell without my knowing it you are mistaken vera paused and made a slight inclination of her head that was not my idea she said she looked appealingly to vance is that not enough paul she asked quite enough exclaimed the man he turned to the visitor and made a curt movement of the hand toward the open door there will be a seance tonight he declared at mr hallowells if you wish to protest against it you can do so there this is my house if you have finished he repeated the gesture toward the open door i have not finished said miss coates sharply and if you take my advice you will follow her example with a nod of the head she signified vera when she sees shes in danger she knows enough to stop this is not a question of a few mediums tricks she cried contemptuously i know all that you planned to do and i intend that tomorrow every one in new york shall know it too like a cloak veras selfpossession fell from her in alarm she moved forward what do you mean she demanded i have had you people followed pretty closely said miss coates her tone was assured she was confident that of those before her she was the master and that of that fact they were aware i know she went on just how you tried to impose upon my uncle how you tried to rob me and tonight i have invited the reporters to my house to give them the facts with a cry vera ran to her no she begged you wont do that you must not do that let her talk growled vance let her talk shes funny no commanded vera her voice rang with the distress she cannot do that she turned to miss coates we havent hurt you she pleaded we havent taken your money i promise you she cried we will never see mr hallowell again i beg of you vance indignantly caught her by the arm and drew her back you dont beg nothing of her he cried i do vera answered wildly she caught vances hand in both of hers i have a chance paul she entreated dont force me through it again i cant stand the shame of it again once more she appealed to the visitor dont she begged dont shame me but the eyes of the older girl blind to everything save what as she saw it was her duty showed no consideration veras hands trembling on his arm drove vance to deeper anger he turned savagely upon miss coates you havent lost anything yet have you he demanded she hasnt hurt you has she if its revenge you want he cried insolently why dont you throw vitriol on the girl revenge exclaimed miss coates indignantly it is my duty my public duty im not alone in this i am acting with the district attorney it is our duty she turned suddenly and called mr winthrop mr winthrop for the first time vera saw under the gas jet at the farther end of the hall the figures of mannie and winthrop no no she protested i beg of you she cried hysterically ive got a chance if you print this thing tomorrow ill never have a chance again dont take it away from me impulsively her arms reached out in an eager final appeal im down she said simply give me a chance to get up when miss coates came to give battle to the vances she foresaw the interview might be unpleasant it was proving even more unpleasant than she had expected but her duty seemed none the less obvious you should have thought of that she said before you were found out for an instant vera stood motionless staring unconsciously holding the attitude of appeal but when by these last words she recognized that her humiliation could go no further with an inarticulate exclamation she turned away the public has the right to know declared miss coates the sort of people you are i have the record of each of you from the hall winthrop had entered quickly but disregarding him vance broke in upon the speaker savagely defiantly print em then he shouted print em i mean to declared miss coates yours and hers she winthrop placed himself in front of her shutting her off from the others he spoke in an earnest whisper dont he begged she has asked for a chance give her a chance miss coates scorned to speak in whispers she has had a chance she protested loudly shes had a chance for nine years and shes chosen to be a charlatan and a cheat and the angry woman hesitated and then flung the word and a thief in the silence that followed no one turned toward vera but as it continued unbroken each raised his eyes and looked at her they saw her drawn to her full height the color flown from her face her deep brooding eyes flashing she was like one by some religious fervor lifted out of herself exalted when she spoke her voice was low tense it vibrated with tremendous wondering indignation do you know who i am she asked she spoke like one in a trance do you know who you are threatening with your police and your laws i am a priestess i am a medium between the souls of this world and the next i am vera the truth and i mean the girl cried suddenly harshly flinging out her arm that you shall hear the truth tonight i will bring your mother from the grave to speak it to you with a swift sweeping gesture she pointed to the door take those people away she cried the eyes of winthrop were filled with pity vera he said vera for an instant against the tenderness and reproach in his voice the girl held herself motionless and then falling upon the shoulder of mrs vance burst into girlish heartbroken tears take them away she sobbed take them away mannie day and vance closed in upon the visitors and motioning them before them drove them from the room part iii the departure of the district attorney and miss coates left vera free to consider how serious if she carried out her threat the consequences might be but of this chance she did not avail herself instead with nervous zeal she began to prepare for her masquerade it was as though her promise to winthrop to abandon her old friends had filled her with remorse and that she now by an extravagance of loyalty was endeavoring to make amends at nine oclock with the vances she arrived at the house of mr hallowell already to the same place a wagon had carried the cabinet a parlor organ and a dozen of those camp chairs that are associated with house weddings and funerals and while in the library vance and mannie arranged these to their liking on the third floor vera with mrs vance waited for that moment to arrive when vance considered her entrance would be the most effective this entrance was to be made through the doorway that opened from the hall on the second story into the library to the right of this door in an angle of two walls was the cabinet and on the left the first of the camp chairs these had been placed in a semicircle that stretched across the room and ended at the parlor organ the door from mr hallowells bedroom opened directly upon the semicircle at the point most distant from the cabinet in the centre of the semicircle vance had placed the invalids arm chair vance in his manner as professional and undisturbed as a photographer focussing his camera and arranging his screens was explaining to judge gaylor the setting of his stage the judge was an unwilling audience unlike the showman for him the occasion held only terrors he was driven by misgivings swept by sudden panics he scowled at the cabinet intruding upon the privacy of the room where for years without the aid of accessories by his brains alone he had brought mr hallowell almost to the point of abject submission to his wishes he turned upon vance with bitter selfdisgust so ive got down as low as this have i he demanded vance heard him undisturbed i must ask you he said briskly to help me keep the people just as i seat them they will be in this halfcircle facing the cabinet and holding hands those we know are against us he explained will have one of my friends professor strombergk or mrs marsh or my wife on each side of him if there should be any attempt to rush the cabinet we must get there first i will be outside the cabinet working the rappings the floating music and the astral bodies at the sight of the expression these words brought to the face of gaylor vance permitted himself the shadow of a smile i can take care of myself he went on but remember vera must not be caught outside the cabinet when the lights go up she must be found with the ropes still tied gaylor turned from him with an exclamation of disgust pah he muttered its a hell of a business vance continued unmoved and another thing he said about these lights this switch throws them all off doesnt it he pressed a button on the left of the door and the electric lights in the walls and under a green shade on the library table faded and disappeared leaving the room save for the light from the hall in darkness thats the way we want it said the showman from the hall mannie appeared between the curtains that hung across the doorway what are you doing with the lights he demanded you want to break my neck all our people are downstairs he announced vance turned on the lights at the same moment rainey came from the bedroom into the library it was evident that to sustain his courage he had been drinking he made no effort to greet those in the room but stood glaring resentfully at the cabinet and the row of chairs well exclaimed vance cheerfully if our folks are all here were all right glancing behind him mannie took vance by the sleeve and led him to the centre of the room no were not all right said the boy that miss coates has brought a friend with her she says hallowell told her she could bring a friend she says this young fellow is her friend i think hes a pink what nonsense exclaimed gaylor in alarm no detective would force his way into this house she says continued mannie disregarding gaylor and still addressing vance hes a seeker after the truth ill bet declared the boy violently hes a seeker after the truth garrett came hastily and noiselessly into the room he nodded toward mannie has he told you he asked yes gaylor answered who is he the reporter who was here this morning garrett returned the one who threatened thatll do commanded gaylor in the face of this new complication he again became himself suavely and politely he turned to vance will you and your friend join miss vera he asked and tell her that we begin in a few minutes for the first time aggressively and offensively rainey broke his silence no we wont begin in a few minutes he announced not by a damned sight the explosion was so unexpected that for an instant while the eyes of all were fixed in astonishment upon the speaker there was complete silence gaylor still suave still polite looked toward vance and motioned him to the door will you kindly do as i ask he said with mannie at his side vance walked quickly from the room once in the hall the boy laid a detaining hand upon the arm of the older man if youll take my advice which you wont he said well all cut and run now while we got the chance in the library gaylor turned savagely upon his fellow conspirator well he demanded rainey frowned at him sulkily i wash my hands of the whole thing he cried gaylor dropped his voice to a whisper what are you afraid of now he demanded if youre not afraid of a district attorney why are you afraid of a reporter im not afraid of anybody returned rainey thickly but i dont mean to be a party to no murder he paused shaking his head portentously that man in there he whispered nodding toward the bedroom is in no condition to go through this after that shock this morning and last night itll kill him his hearts rotten i tell you rotten garrett snarled contemptuously how do you know he demanded how do i know returned rainey fiercely i was four years in a medical college when you were in jail you stop that cried gaylor glancing fearfully toward the open door he interposed between them dont take my advice then cried rainey go on kill him and he wont sign your will only dont say i didnt tell you have you told him demanded gaylor yes rainey answered stoutly told him if he didnt stop this he wouldnt live till morning are we forcing him to do this demanded gaylor no hes forcing it on us my god he exclaimed do you think i want this farce you say yourself you told him it would kill him and he will go on with it then why do you blame us can we help ourselves the butler had distinguished the sounds of footsteps in the hall he fell hastily to rearranging the camp chairs hush he warned look out gaylor and rainey had but time to move apart when winthrop entered he regarded the three men with a smile of understanding i beg pardon he exclaimed i am interrupting gaylor greeted him with exaggerated heartiness ah it is mr winthrop he cried have you come to help us find out the truth this evening i certainly hope not said winthrop brusquely i know the truth about too many people already he turned to garrett who unobtrusively was endeavoring to make his escape i want to see miss vera he said miss vera interposed gaylor im afraid thats not possible she especially asked not to be disturbed before the seance im sorry winthrops manner became suspiciously polite yes he inquired well nevertheless i think ill ask her tell miss vera please he said to garrett that mr winthrop would like a word with her here with significance he added in private in offended dignity judge gaylor moved toward the door dr rainey he said stiffly will you please inform mr hallowell that his guests are now here and that i have gone to bring them upstairs yes but you wont bring them upstairs please said winthrop until you hear from me gaylor flushed with anger and for a moment appeared upon the point of mutiny then as though refusing to consider himself responsible for the manners of the younger man he shrugged his shoulders and left the room with even less of consideration than he had shown to judge gaylor winthrop turned upon rainey hows your patient he asked shortly rainey was sufficiently influenced by the liquor he had taken to dare to resent winthrops peremptory tone his own in reply was designedly offensive my patient he inquired mr hallowell snapped winthrop hes sick isnt he oh i dont know returned the doctor you dont know demanded winthrop well i know i know if he goes through this thing tonight hell have another collapse i saw one this morning why dont you forbid it youre his medical adviser arent you rainey remained sullenly silent answer me insisted the district attorney you are arent you i am at last declared rainey well then commanded winthrop tell him to stop this tell him i advise it through his glasses rainey blinked violently at the district attorney and laughed i didnt know he said that you were a medical man winthrop looked at the doctor so steadily and for so long a time that the eyes of the young man sought the floor and the ceiling and his sneer changed to an expression of discomfort i am not said winthrop i am the district attorney of new york his tones were cold precise they fell upon the superheated brain of dr rainey like drops from an icicle when i took over that office continued winthrop i found a complaint against two medical students a failure to report the death of an old man in a private sanitarium winthrop lowered his eyes and became deeply absorbed in the toe of his boot i havent looked into the papers yet he said rainey swaying slightly jerked open the door of the bedroom ill tell him he panted thickly ill tell him to do as you say thank you i wish you would said winthrop at the same moment from the hall garrett announced mrs vance sir and mabel vance tremulous and frightened entered the room winthrop approached her eagerly ah mrs vance he exclaimed can i see miss vera embarrassed and unhappy mrs vance moved restlessly from foot to foot and shook her head please mr district attorney she begged im afraid not this afternoon upset her so and shes so nervous and queer that the professor thinks she shouldnt see nobody the professor he commented his voice was considerate conciliatory now mrs vance he said ive known miss vera ever since she was a little girl known her longer than you have and im her friend and youre her friend and i am protested mabel vance tearfullyindeed i am i know you are winthrop interrupted hastily youve been more than a friend to her youve been a sister mother and you dont want any trouble to come to her do you i dont cried the woman oh she exclaimed miserably i told them thered be trouble winthrop laughed reassuringly well there wont be any trouble he declared if i can help it and if you want to help her help me persuade her to let me talk to her dont mind what the professor says i will declared mrs vance with determination i will she started eagerly toward the hall and then paused and returned her hands were clasped her round baby eyes wet with tears were fixed upon winthrop appealingly oh please she pleaded youre not going to hurt him are you paul my husband she explained hes been such a good husband to me winthrop laughed uneasily why thatll be all right he protested he doesnt mean any harm insisted mrs vance hes on the level true he is why of course of course winthrop assented unsatisfied mrs vance burst into tears its this spirit business that makes the trouble she cried i tell them to cut it out now the mind reading at the theatre she sobbed theres no harm in that is there and theres twice the money in it but this ghost raising she raised her eyes appealingly as though begging to be contradicted its sure to get him into trouble isnt it winthrop shook his head and smiled it may he said mrs vance broke into a fresh outburst of tears i knew it she cried i knew it winthrop placed his hand upon her arm and turned her in the direction of the door dont worry he said soothingly go send miss vera here and he called after her dont worry as mabel departed upon his errand rainey reentered from the bedroom he carefully closed the door and halted with his hand upon the knob and shook his head its no use he said he will go on with it its not my fault he whined i told him it would kill him i couldnt make it any stronger than that could i rainey was not looking at winthrop but as though fearful of interruption toward the door his eyes were harassed furtive filled with miserable indecision many times before winthrop had seen men in such a state he knew that for the sufferer it foretold a physical break down or that he would seek relief in full confession to give the man confidence he abandoned his attitude of suspicion that certainly would be strong enough for me he said cheerfully did you tell him what i advised yes yes muttered rainey impatiently he said you were invited here to give advice to his niece not to him for the first time his eyes met those of winthrop boldly the district attorney recognized that the man had taken his fears by the throat and had arrived at his decision see here exclaimed rainey could i give you some information im sure you could returned winthrop briskly give it to me now but rainey glancing toward the door shrank back winthrop following the direction of his eyes saw vera impatiently he waved rainey away at the office tomorrow morning he commanded with a sigh of relief at the reprieve rainey slipped back into the bedroom winthrop had persuaded himself that in seeking to speak with vera he was making only a natural choice between preventing the girl from perpetrating a fraud or later for that fraud holding her to account but when she actually stood before him he recognized how absurdly he had deceived himself at the mere physical sight of her there came to him a swift relief a thrill of peace and deep content and with delighted certainty he knew that what vera might do or might not do concerned him not at all that for him all that counted was the girl herself with something of this showing in his face he came eagerly toward her vera he exclaimed in the word there was delight wonder tenderness but if the girl recognized this she concealed her knowledge instead her eyes looked into his frankly her manner was that of open friendliness mabel tells me you want to talk to me she said evenly but i dont want you to i have something i want to say to you i could have written it but this for an instant the girl paused with her lips pressed together when she spoke her voice carried the firmness and finality of one delivering a verdict but this she repeated is the last time you shall hear from me or see me again winthrop gave an exclamation of impatience of indignation no returned the girl it is quite final maybe you will not want to see me but winthrop again sharply interrupted her his voice was filled with reproach vera he protested well said the girl more gently im glad to think you do but this is the last and before i go i go demanded winthrop roughly where before i go continued the girl i want to tell you how much you have helped me i want to thank you you havent let me thank you broke in winthrop and now you pretend this is our last meeting its absurd it is our last meeting replied the girl of the two for the moment she was the older the more contained on the contrary contradicted the man he spoke sharply in a tone he tried to make as determined as her own our next meeting will be in ten minutes at my sisters i have told her about this afternoon and about you and she wants very much to meet you she has sent her car for you its waiting in front of the house now he commanded masterfully you come with me and get in it and leave all this he gave an angry contemptuous wave of the hand toward the cabinet behind you as he added earnestly you promised me you would as though closing from sight the possibility he suggested the girl shut her eyes quickly and then opened them again to meet his i cant leave these things behind me she said quietly i told you so this afternoon for a moment you made me think i could and i did promise i didnt need to promise its what ive prayed for then you saw what happened you saw i was right within five minutes that woman came that woman had a motive protested winthrop that woman continued the girl patiently or some other woman what does it matter in five minutes or five days some one would have told she leaned toward him anxiously im not complaining she said its my own fault its the life ive chosen she hesitated and then as though determined to carry out a programme she had already laid down for herself continued rapidly and what i want to tell you is that whats best in that life i owe to you vera cried the man sharply listen said the girl her eyes were alight eager she spoke frankly proudly without embarrassment without fear of being misconstrued as a man might speak to a man id be ungrateful id be a coward said the girl if i went away and didnt tell you for ten years ive been counting on you i made you a sort of standard i said as long as he keeps to his ideals im going to keep to mine maybe you think my ideals have not been very high but anyway youve made it easy for me because im in this business because im goodlooking enough certain men the voice of the girl grew hard and cool have done me the honor to insult me and it was knowing you and that there are others like you that helped me not to care the girl paused she raised her eyes to his frankly the look in them was one of pride in him of loyalty of affection and now since ive met you she went on i find youre just as i imagined youd be just as id hoped youd be she reached out her hand warningly appealingly and i dont want you to change to let down to grow discouraged you cant tell how many more people are counting on you she hesitated and as though at last conscious of her own boldness flushed deprecatingly like one asking pardon you men in high places she stammered youre like light houses showing the way you dont know how many people you are helping you cant see them you cant tell how many boats are following your light but if your light goes out they are wrecked she gave a sigh of relief thats what i wanted to tell you she said and so thank you she held out her hand and goodby winthrops answer was to clasp her hand quickly in both of his and draw her toward him vera he begged come with me now the girl withdrew her hand and moved away from him frowning no she said no you do not want to understand i have my work to do tonight winthrop gave an exclamation of anger you dont mean to tell me he cried that youre going on with this yes she said and then in sudden alarm cried but not if youre here ill fail if youre here promise me you will not be here indeed cried the man indignantly i will not but ill be downstairs when you need me and he added warningly youll need me no said the girl no matter what happens i tell you between us this is the end then begged the man if this is the end for gods sake vera as my last request do not do it the girl shook her head no she repeated firmly ive tried to get away from it and each time theyve forced me back now ill go on with it ive promised paul and the others and you heard me promise that woman but you didnt mean that protested the man she insulted you you were angry youre angry now piqued mr winthrop interrupted the girl today you told me i was not playing the game you told the truth when you said this was a mean business you were right but for the first time since she had spoken her tones were shaken uncertain ive been driven out of every other business she waited until her voice was again under control and then said slowly definitely and tonight i am going to show mr hallowell the spirit of his sister in the eyes of winthrop the look of pain of disappointment of reproach was so keen that the girl turned her own away no said the man gently you will not do that you can stop my doing it tonight returned the girl but at some other time at some other place i will do it you yourself will stop it said winthrop you are too honest too fine to act such a lie why not be yourself he begged why not disappoint these other people who do not know you why disappoint the man who knows you best who trusts you who believes in you you are the very one interrupted the girl who doesnt know me i am not fine i am not honest i am a charlatan and a cheat i am all that woman called me and that is why you cant know me thats why i told you if you did you would be sorry i am not sorry said winthrop you will be returned the girl before the night is over on the contrary answered the man quietly i shall wait here to congratulate you on your failure i shall not fail said the girl avoiding his eyes she turned from him and for a moment stood gazing before her miserably her lips were trembling her eyes moist with rising tears then she faced him her head raised defiantly i have been hounded out of every decent way of living she protested hysterically i can make thousands of dollars tonight she cried out of this one winthrop looked straight into her eyes his own were pleading full of tenderness and pity so eloquent with meaning that those of the girl fell before them that is no answer said the man you know its not i tell you you will fail from the hall judge gaylor entered noisily instinctively the man and girl moved nearer together and upon the intruder winthrop turned angrily well he demanded sharply i thought you had finished your talk protested the judge mr hallowell is anxious to begin winthrop turned and looked at vera steadily for an instant the eyes of the girl faltered and then she returned his glance with one as resolute as his own as though accepting her verdict as final winthrop walked quickly to the door i shall be downstairs he said when this is over let me know gaylor struggled to conceal his surprise and satisfaction you wont be here for the seance he exclaimed certainly not cried winthrop i he broke off suddenly without again looking toward vera or trying to hide his displeasure he left the room gaylor turned to the girl he was smiling with relief excellent he muttered excellent what was he saying to you he asked eagerly as i came in that you would fail the girl moved past him to the door yes she answered dully but you will not cried the man were all counting on you you know destroy the old will sign the new will he quoted he came close to her and whispered that means thousands of dollars to you and vance he urged the girl turned and regarded him with unhappy angry eyes you need not be frightened she answered for the man before her and for herself her voice was bitter with contempt and selfaccusation mr winthrop is mistaken he does not know me she said miserably i shall not fail for a moment after she had left him gaylor stood motionless his eyes filled with concern and then with a shrug as though accepting either good or evil fortune he called from the bedroom mr hallowell and from the floor below the guests of hallowell and of vance as hallowell supported by rainey sank into the invalids chair in the centre of the semicircle gaylor made his final appeal stephen he begged are you sure youre feeling strong enough wont some other night the old man interrupted him querulously no now i want it over he commanded who knows he complained how soon it may be before the sight of mannie entering the room with vance caused him to interrupt himself abruptly he greeted the showman with a curt nod and who is this he demanded mannie to whom a living millionaire was much more of a disturbing spectacle than the ghost of alexander the great retreated hastily behind vance he is my assistant vance explained he furnishes the music he pushed mannie toward the organ music growled hallowell must there be music it is indispensable protested vance music sir is one of the strongest psychic influences it nonsense cried hallowell tricks he muttered tricks vance shrugged his shoulders and smiled in deprecation i am sorry to find you in a skeptical mood mr hallowell he murmured reprovingly it will hardly help to produce good results allow me he begged to present two true believers with a wave of the hand he beckoned forward a stout grayhaired woman with bulging nearsighted eyes that rolled meaninglessly behind heavy gold spectacles mrs marsh of lynn massachusetts proclaimed vance of whom you have heard mrs marsh he added is probably the first medium in america the results she has obtained are quite wonderful she alone foretold the san francisco earthquake and the run on the long acre square bank i am glad to know you said mr hallowell pardon my not rising the old lady curtsied obsequiously oh certainly mr hallowell she protested mr hallowell she went on rolling the name delightedly on her tongue i need not tell you how greatly we spiritualists rejoice over your joining the ranks of the believers hallowell nodded he was not altogether unimpressed thanks he commented dryly but i am not quite there yet madam we hope said vance sententiously to convince mr hallowell tonight and i am sure mr hallowell cried the old lady if any one can do it little miss vera can hers is a wonderful gift sir a wonderful gift i am glad to hear you say so returned hallowell he nodded to her in dismissal and turned to the next visitor and this gentleman he asked professor strombergk announced vance the distinguished writer on psychic and occult subjects editor of the world beyond a tall fullbearded german in a tooshort frock coat bowed awkwardly upon him as upon mannie had fallen the spell of the hallowell fortune he who chatted familiarly with departed popes and emperors who daily was in communication with goethe caesar and epictetus thrilled with embarrassment before the man who had made millions from a coupling pin and helen mr hallowell cried as miss coates followed the professor that is all is it not he asked miss coates moved aside to disclose the person of the reporter from the republic homer lee i have taken you at your word uncle she said and have brought a friend with me in some trepidation she added he is mr lee a reporter from the republic a reporter exclaimed mr hallowell disturbed and yet amused at the audacity of his niece he shook his head reprovingly i dont think i meant reporters he remonstrated you said in your note returned his niece that as i had so much at stake i could bring any one i pleased and the less he believed in spiritualism the better mr lee she added dryly believes even less than i do then it will be all the more of a triumph if we convince him declared hallowell understand young man he proclaimed loudly i am not a spiritualist i am merely conducting an investigation i want the truth if you or my niece detect any fraud tonight i want to know it including in his speech the others in the room he glared suspiciously in turn at each keep your eyes open he ordered you will be serving me quite as much as you will miss coates miss coates and lee thanked him and recognizing themselves as the opposition and in the minority withdrew for consultation into a corner of the bay window vance approached mr hallowell if you are ready he said we will examine the cabinet shall i wheel it over here or will you look at it where it is if it is to be in that corner during the seance declared mr hallowell ill look at it where it is as he struggled from his chair he turned to mrs marsh and nodded his head knowingly you see mrs marsh he said i am taking no chances that is quite right mr hallowell purred the old lady if there be any doubt in your mind you must get rid of it or we will have no results with a dramatic gesture vance swept aside from the opening in the cabinet the black velvet curtain its a simple affair he said indifferently as you see its open at the top and bottom the medium sits inside on that chair bound hand and foot in turn mr hallowell mrs marsh gaylor rainey professor strombergk entered the cabinet with their knuckles they beat upon its sides they moved it to and fro they dropped to their knees and with their fingers tugged at the carpet upon which it stood under cover of their questions in the corner of the bay window miss coates whispered to lee dont look now she warned but later you will see on the left of that door the switch that throws on the lights when i am sure she is outside the cabinet when she has told him not to give the money to me ill cry now and whichever one of us is seated nearer the switch will turn on all the lights i think miss coates added with in her voice a thrill of triumph not altogether free from a touch of vindictiveness when my uncle sees her caught in the middle of the room disguised as his sister we will have cured him it may be said the man the possibility of success as miss coates pointed it out did not appear to stir in him any great delight he glanced unwillingly over his shoulder i see the switch he said leaning on the arm of gaylor mr hallowell returned from the cabinet to his chair what he had seen apparently strengthened his faith and in like degree inspired him to greater enthusiasm well he exclaimed there are no trapdoors or false bottoms about that if they can project a spirit from that sentry box it will be a miracle for whom are we waiting he asked impatiently where is winthrop judge gaylor explained that winthrop preferred to wait downstairs and that he had said he would remain there until the seance was finished afraid of compromising his position commented the old man im sorry id like to have him here he motioned gaylor to bend nearer in a voice that trembled with eagerness and excitement he whispered henry i have a feeling that we are going to witness a remarkable phenomenon gaylors countenance grew preternaturally grave he nodded heavily i have the same feeling stephen he returned vance raised his hand to command silence every one he called except the committee who are to bind and tie the medium will take the place i give him and remain in it mr day will please acquaint miss vera and mrs vance with the fact that we are ready up to this point vance had appeared only as a stage manager he had been concerned with his groupings his lights in assigning to his confederates the parts they were to play now that the curtain was to rise as an actor puts on a wig and grease paint vance assumed a certain voice and manner on the stage the critics would have called him a convincing actor he made his audience believe what he believed he knew the eloquence of a pause the value of a surprised unintelligible exclamation one moment he was as professionally solemn as a funeral director the next his voice his whole frame would shake with excitement in an outburst of fanatic fervor as it pleased him he could play hamlet tenderly shocked at the sight of his dead father or macbeth retreating in horror before the ghost of banquo for the moment his manner was that of the undertaker now mr hallowell he said hoarsely please to name those you wish to serve on the committee mr hallowell waved his arm to include every one in the room everybody will serve on the committee he declared everything is to be open and aboveboard the whole city is welcome on the committee i want this to be above suspicion that is my wish also sir said vance stiffly but a committee of more than three is unwieldy suppose you name two gentlemen and i one or he shrugged his shoulders you can name all three after a moment of consideration mr hallowell pointed at lee i choose mr that young man he announced and judge gaylor i would much rather not stephen judge gaylor whispered i know henry answered the other but i ask it of you it will give me confidence he turned to vance you select some one he commanded with a bow vance designated the tall german will professor strombergk be acceptable he asked mr hallowell nodded then the three gentlemen chosen will please come to the cabinet vance his manner now that of a master of ceremonies assigned to each person the seat he or she was to occupy miss coates with satisfaction noted that only mrs vance separated lee from the electric switch i must ask you said vance to keep the sears i have assigned to you with us tonight are both favorable and unfavorable influences and what i have tried to do in placing you is to obtain the best psychic results he moved to the door and looked into the hall then turned and with uplifted arm silently demanded attention miss vera he announced followed closely like respectful courtiers by mannie and mrs vance vera appeared in the doorway walked a few feet into the room and stood motionless as though already in a trance she moved slowly without volition like a somnambulist her head was held high but her eyes were dull and unseeing her arms hung limply she wore an evening gown of soft black stuff that clung to her like a lace shawl and which left her throat and arms bare in spite of the clash of interests of antagonism of mutual distrust there was no one present to whom the sight of the young girl did not bring an uneasy thrill the nature of the thing she proposed to do contrasted with the loveliness of her face which seemed to mock at the possibility of deceit something in her rapt distant gaze in the dignity of her uplifted head in her air of complete detachment from her surroundings caused even the most skeptical to question if she might not possess the power she claimed to feel for a moment the approach of the supernatural the voices of the committee consulting together dropped suddenly to a whisper the others were instantly silent in his arms mannie carried silken scarfs cords and ropes in each hand he held a teacup one contained flour the other shot vance took these from him and mannie hurriedly slipped into his chair in front of the organ gentlemen explained vance you will use these ropes and scarfs to tie the medium also as a further precaution against the least suspicion of fraud we will subject her to the most severe test known in one hand she will hold this flour the other will be filled with shot this will make it impossible for her to tamper with the ropes he gave the two cups to gaylor and turned to vera are you ready he asked after a pause the girl slightly inclined her head lee with one of the scarfs in his hand approached her diffidently he looked unhappily at the slight girlish figure at the fair white arms in his embarrassment he appealed to vance how would you suggest he asked vance apparently shocked hastily drew away that would be most irregular he protested apologetically lee turned to the girl would you mind putting your arms behind you he asked he laced the scarf around her arms and drew it tightly to her wrists tell me if i hurt you he murmured but the girl made no answer to what was going forward she appeared as unmindful as though she were an artists manikin will you take these now asked gaylor and into her open palms he poured the flour and shot and now continued lee will you go into the cabinet as she seated herself he knelt in front of her and bound her ankles from behind her strombergk deftly wound the ropes about her body and through the rungs and back of the chair would you mind seeing if you can withdraw your arms lee asked the girl raised her shoulders struggled to free her hands and tried to rise but the efforts were futile are the gentlemen satisfied demanded vance the three men who had shown but little heart in the work and who were now red and embarrassed hastily answered in the affirmative if you are satisfied the ropes are securely fastened vance continued you will take your seats professor strombergk as he moved to his chair announced in devout solemn tones nothing but spirit hands can move those ropes now from the organ rose softly the prelude to a moody and sankey hymn and in keeping with the music the voice of vance sank to a low tone we will now he said establish the magnetic chain each person will take with his right hand the left wrist of the person on his or her right he paused while this order was being carried into effect before i turn out the lights he continued i wish to say a last word to any skeptic who may be present i warn him that any attempt to lay violent hands upon the apparition or spirit may cost the medium her life from the cabinet the medium projects the spirit into the circle an attack upon the spirit is an attack upon the medium there are three or four wellauthenticated cases where the disembodied spirit was cut off from the cabinet and the medium died he drew the velvet curtains across the cabinet and shut vera from view are you ready mr hallowell he asked mr hallowell his eyes staring his lips parted nodded his head the music grew louder vance switched off the lights for some minutes except for the creaking of the pedals of the organ and the low throb of the music there was no sound then from his position at the open door the voice of vance commanded sternly no whispering please the medium is susceptible to the least sound there was another longer pause until in hushed expectant tones vance spoke again the air is very heavily charged with electricity tonight he said you mrs marsh should feel that i do professor murmured the medium i do we shall have some wonderful results vance agreed with her solemnly i feel influences all about me he murmured there came suddenly from the cabinet three sharp raps these were instantly answered by other quick rappings upon the library table they are beginning chanted the voice of vance the music of the organ ceased it was at once followed by the notes of a guitar that seemed to float in space the strings vibrating not as though touched by human hands but in fitful meaningless chords like those of an aeolian harp that is kiowa your control mrs marsh announced vance eagerly do you desire to speak to him not tonight mrs marsh answered she raised her voice not tonight kiowa she repeated thank you for coming good night in deep guttural accents a mans voice came from the ceiling good night it called with a final ringing wail the music of the guitar suddenly ceased again rose the swelling low notes of the organ above it came the quick pattering of footsteps the voice of rainey filled with alarm cried some one touched me are you sure your hands are held demanded vance reprovingly yes panted rainey both of them but something put its hand on my forehead it was cold in an excited whisper a voice in the circle cried look look and before the eyes of all a star rose in the darkness for a moment it wavered over the cabinet and then fluttered swiftly across the room and remained stationary above the head of the german professor there is your star professor cried vance when the professor is in the circle he announced proudly that star always appears he was interrupted by a startled exclamation from lee something touched my face explained the young man apologetically and spoke to me the music sank to a murmur and the room became alive with swift rushing sounds and soft whisperings the voice of mrs marsh low and eager could be heard appealing to an invisible presence the results are marvelous chanted vance marvelous the medium is showing wonderful power if any one desires to ask a question he should do so now the conditions will never be better he paused expectantly mr hallowell he prompted is it your wish to communicate with any one in the spirit world there was a long pause and then the voice of mr hallowell harsh and shaken answered yes with whom demanded vance there was again another longer pause and then above the confusion of soft whisperings the voice of the old man rose in sharp staccato my sister catherine coates his tone hardened became obdurate final but i must see her and hear her speak not for an instant did vance hesitate in tense sepulchral tones he demanded of the darkness is the spirit of catherine coates present the whisperings and murmurs ceased the silence of the room was broken sharply by three quick raps yes intoned vance she is present the voice of hallowell protested fiercely i wont have that i want to see her in the tone of an incantation vance spoke again will the spirit show herself to her brother the raps came quickly firmly she answers she will appear before you there was a moment that seemed to stretch interminably and then the eyes of all straining in the darkness saw against the black velvet curtain a splash of white above the sobbing of the organ the voice of mr hallowell rang out in a sharp exclamation of terror who is that he demanded he spoke as though he dreaded the answer he threw himself forward in his chair peering into the darkness is that you kate he whispered his voice was both incredulous and pleading the answer came in feeble trembling tones yes the voice of hallowell shook with eagerness do you know me your brother stephen yes with a cry the old man fell back groping blindly he found gaylors arm and clutched it with both hands my god its kate he gasped i tell you henry it is kate the voice of vance deep and hollow like a bell sounded a note of warning speak quickly he commanded her time on earth is brief mr hallowells hold upon the arm of his friend relaxed fearfully and slowly he bent forward kate he pleaded i must ask you a question no one else can tell me as though gathering courage he paused and with a frightened sigh again began i am an old man he murmured a sick man i will be joining you very soon what am i to do with my money i have made great plans to give it to the poor or must i give it as i have given it in my will to helen perhaps i did not act fairly to you and helen you know what i mean she would be rich but then the poor would be that much the poorer the confidence of the speaker was increasing as though to a living being he argued and pleaded and i want to do some good before i go what shall i do tell me there was a pause that lasted so long that those who had held their breath to listen again breathed deeply when the answer came it was strangely deprecatory uncertain unassured you stammered the voice you must have courage to do what you know to be just for a brief moment as though surprised mr hallowell apparently considered this and then gave an exclamation of disappointment and distress but i dont know he protested that is why i called on you i want to go into the next world kate he pleaded with clean hands you cannot bribe your way into the next world intoned the voice if you pity the poor you must help the poor not that you may cheat your way into heaven but that they may suffer less search your conscience have the courage of your conscience i dont want to consult my conscience cried the old man i want you to tell me he paused hesitating eager to press his question his awe of the apparition still restrained him what do you mean kate he begged am i to give the money where it will do the most good to the hallowell institute or am i to give it to helen which am i to do there was another long silence and then the voice stammered if if you have wronged me or my daughter or the poor you must make restitution the hand of the old man was heard to fall heavily upon the arm of his chair his voice rose unhappily that is no answer kate he cried did you come from the dead to preach to me tell me what am i to do leave my money to helen or to the institute the cry of the old man vibrated in the air no voice rose to answer kate he entreated still there was silence speak to me he commanded the silence became eloquent with momentous possibilities so long did it endure that the pain of the suspense was actual the voice of rainey choked and hoarse with fear broke it with an exclamation that held the sound of an oath he muttered thickly what in the name of he was hushed by a swift chorus of hisses the voice of hallowell was again uplifted why wont she answer me he begged hysterically of vance cant you cant the medium make her speak during the last few moments the music from the organ had come brokenly the hands upon the keys moved unsteadily drunkenly now they halted altogether and in the middle of a chord the music sank and died upon the now absolute silence the voice of vance when he spoke sounded strangely unfamiliar it had lost the priestlike intonation its confidence had departed it showed bewilderment and alarm i i dont understand stammered the showman ask her again put your question differently carefully slowly giving each word its value mr hallowell raised his voice in entreaty kate he cried i have made a new will leaving the money to the poor the old will gives it to helen shall i sign the new will or not shall i give the money to helen or the institute answer me yes or no before the eyes of all the apparition as though retreating to the cabinet swayed backward then staggered forward there was a sob human heartbroken a cry thrilling with distress a tumult of weeping fierce and uncontrollable they saw the figure tear away the white kerchief and cap and trample them upon the floor they saw the figure hold itself erect from it the voice of vera cried aloud in despair i cant i cant she sobbed its a lie i am not your sister turn on the lights the girl cried turn on the lights there was a crash of upturned chairs the sound of men struggling and the room was swept with light in the doorway winthrop was holding apart vance and the reporter in the centre of the room stood vera her head bent in shame her body shaken and trembling her hair streaming to her waist as though to punish herself by putting a climax to her humiliation she held out her arms to helen coates you see she cried i am a cheat i am a fraud she sank suddenly to her knees in front of mr hallowell forgive me she sobbed forgive me with a cry of angry protest winthrop ran to her and lifted her to her feet his eyes were filled with pity but in the eyes of mr hallowell there was no promise of pardon with sudden strength he struggled to his feet and stood swaying challenging those before him his face was white with anger his jaw closed against mercy youve lied to me he cried youve tried to rob me he swept the room with his eyes with a flash of intuition he saw the trap they had laid for him all of you he screamed its a plot he shook his fist at the weeping girl and you he shouted hysterically the law shall punish you winthrop drew the girl to him and put his arm about her ill do the punishing here he said with a glad welcoming cry the old man turned to him appealingly wildly yes you he shouted you punish them she plotted to get my money the girl at winthrops side shivered and shrank from him he drew her back roughly and held her close the sobs that shook her tore at his heart the touch of the sinking trembling body in his arms filled him with fierce jubilant thoughts of keeping the girl there always of giving battle for her of sheltering her against the world in what she had done he saw only a sacrifice in her he beheld only a penitent who was selfaccused and selfconvicted he heard the voice of the old man screaming vindictively she plotted to get my money winthrop turned upon him savagely how did she plot to get it he retorted fiercely you know and i know i know how your lawyer your doctor your servant plotted to get it his voice rose and rang with indignation you all plotted and you all schemed and to what end what was the result he held before them the fainting figure of the girl that one poor child could prove she was honest with his arms still about her and her hands clinging to him he moved with her quickly to the door when they had reached the silence of the hall he took her hands in his and looked into her eyes now he commanded you shall come to my sisters the waiting car carried them swiftly up the avenue their way lay through the park and the warm midsummer air was heavy with the odor of plants and shrubs above them the trees drooped deep with leaves vera crouched in a corner had not spoken her eyes were hidden in her hands but when they had entered the silent reaches of the park she lowered them and the face she lifted to winthrop was pale and wet with tears the man thought never before had he seen it more lovely or more lovable vera shook her head dumbly and looked up at him with a troubled smile i told you she murmured remorsefully youd be sorry we dont know that yet said winthrop gently well have all the rest of our lives to find that out startled the girl drew back in her face was wonder amazement a dawning happiness without speaking winthrop looked at her entreatingly pitifully beseeching her with his eyes slowly the girl bent forward and as he threw out his arms with a little sigh of rest and content she crept into them and pressed her face to his
